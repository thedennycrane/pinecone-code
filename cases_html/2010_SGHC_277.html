<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       The Monetary Authority of Singapore
                    (“MAS”), who is the plaintiff, is the Central Bank of Singapore.
                    MAS is claiming the payment of a civil penalty from two parties, <em>viz</em>, Tan Chong Koay (“Dr Tan”) who is
                    the first defendant, and Pheim Asset Management Sdn Bhd (“Pheim
                    Malaysia”) which is the second defendant, for infringing s 232(3)
                    read with s 197(1)(b), of the Securities and Futures Act (Cap 289,
                    2006 Rev Ed) (the “SFA”). Hereinafter, both defendants will
                    be referred to collectively as the “defendants”. MAS alleged that
                    the defendants created a false or misleading appearance with respect to the
                    price of United EnviroTech (“UET”) shares between 29 and
                    31 December 2004. For convenience, the period between 29 and
                    31 December 2004 will hereinafter be referred to as the “material
                    time”. I will first set out the salient facts.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Facts giving rise to the dispute</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Dramatis Personae</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       Dr Tan is, by all accounts, a successful
                    fund manager. He founded Pheim Malaysia and Pheim Asset Management (Asia) Pte
                    Ltd (“Pheim Singapore”) in the mid-1990s. Both companies are in
                    the fund-management business. Pheim Malaysia is licensed by the Securities
                    Commission of Malaysia (“SCM”) while Pheim Singapore is licensed
                    by MAS. The two companies (Pheim Malaysia and Pheim Singapore) will be referred
                    to collectively as the “Pheim Group”. According to Dr Tan,
                    the Pheim Group currently manages about US$1 billion in assets and has
                    consistently recorded profits each year since its inception, save for 1998 (when
                    Pheim Singapore did not record a profit). At the material time, Dr Tan was
                    the biggest shareholder, a member of the board of directors, the chief executive
                    officer and the chairman of the investment committee for both companies in the
                    Pheim Group.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       At the material time, the fund managers for
                    Pheim Malaysia were Peter Chong (who was also the associate director and head of
                    investment) (“Chong”), Tan Keng Lin (“Ms Tan”), Ng
                    Wai Leng (“Ng”) and Akmal Hassan (“Hassan”). Tew Sow
                    Hume (“Tew”) was the senior manager and head of compliance for
                    Pheim Malaysia. Tew and Ms Tan gave evidence on behalf of the Defendants
                    although Ms Tan came to become the Defendants’ witness in
                    controversial circumstances (to be elaborated later). Dr Tan and
                    Ms Tan were (<em>inter alios</em>) authorised to trade
                    for Pheim Malaysia at the material time. However, there is no evidence that
                    Chong, who joined Pheim Malaysia in mid-2004 and obtained a licence in August
                    2004, was authorised to trade for Pheim Malaysia through the securities firm UOB
                    Kay Hian Pte Ltd (“UOB Kay Hian”). Regular Investment Committee
                    meetings were held on a weekly basis and chaired by Dr Tan. Ms Tan
                    (amongst others) attended these meetings on a regular basis. It is not disputed
                    that Dr Tan, given his experience, was a hands-on leader with a strong
                    influence in the decision-making process at such meetings. As a result, his
                    views must have carried much weight.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       Mr Tang Boon Siah (“Tang”)
                    was, at the material time, a remisier working for UOB Kay Hian. He had known
                    Dr Tan for more than a decade from his previous job. Dr Tan trusted
                    Tang as a long-time friend. The Pheim Group had trading accounts managed by
                    Tang. Tang had also received orders from Dr Tan personally to trade on
                    Pheim Malaysia’s accounts since its inception. In 2004, Dr Tan
                    remained close to Tang, speaking to him on a near-daily basis to receive market
                    updates. In this regard, it comes as little surprise that Tang was, according to
                    Ms Tan, known internally within Pheim Malaysia as Dr Tan’s
                    “favourite broker”. Tang was the broker who executed the trades
                    for Pheim Malaysia at the material time and gave evidence on behalf of
                    MAS.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The Accounts managed by Pheim Malaysia</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       Pheim Malaysia managed various accounts for its
                    customers, including accounts named as Accounts 89, 90 and 91. The trading
                    parameters for each account were set out in the prospectus for the accounts (the
                    “Master Prospectus”) and are as follows.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       Account 89 was suitable for “conservative
                    equity investors”. Up to 60% of the assets had to be invested in equities
                    and equity-linked securities. At least 40% of the assets were to be invested in
                    fixed income instruments and liquid assets. The same limits applied for Account
                    90, except that the investments for Account 90 had to be in securities and
                    instruments that complied with Syariah principles.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       Account 91 was suitable for “risk adverse
                    investors”, with at least 80% of the assets to be invested in fixed
                    income instruments and liquid assets, and up to 20% to be invested in equities
                    and other high yielding instruments.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       For all three accounts, the value of securities
                    that were listed on a foreign stock exchange (such as Singapore Exchange Limited
                    (“SGX”)) could not exceed 10% of that account’s net asset
                    value (“NAV”), due to investment restrictions imposed by the
                    SCM.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       Apart from these three accounts, Pheim Malaysia
                    managed at least two other accounts which held on UET shares, <em>viz</em>, Accounts F5 and 98. In addition, a number of other accounts
                    managed by Pheim Singapore also held UET shares. One such account was Account
                    28, also known as the “Vittoria Fund”. UET shares formed the
                    second largest component of shares in the Vittoria Fund at the material time.
                    Vittoria Fund was also mentioned in Pheim Group’s marketing material as it
                    consistently outperformed its benchmarks.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     The funds managed by Pheim Group generally
                    recorded stellar results over the years. It hired a consulting firm to verify
                    its results, and the report stated that Pheim Malaysia’s funds
                    outperformed its benchmarks for ten consecutive years since its inception and
                    Pheim Singapore’s funds outperformed its benchmarks for nine consecutive
                    years since its inception. Mention of the Pheim Group’s outstanding record
                    was placed in its marketing material together with that for the Vittoria Fund.
                    However, Dr Tan admitted that he was aware that 2004 was a challenging year
                    and was concerned about the performance, especially given that 2003 was a
                    “fantastic” year.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Pheim Malaysia’s investments in UET and other
                companies</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     Before investing in UET, Pheim Malaysia
                    invested in Hyflux Limited (“Hyflux”), a water treatment
                    specialist company listed on the SGX. Pheim Malaysia recorded significant
                    profits on its investment in Hyflux. Pheim Malaysia sold its last Hyflux shares
                    by 4 March 2002. According to Dr Tan, after selling all its Hyflux
                    shares, Pheim Malaysia was on the lookout for similar companies to invest in.
                    UET fit the bill as it was involved in waste water treatment and was a
                    reclamation solutions provider.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     In March 2004, UET announced its intention to
                    conduct an initial public offering of its shares (the “IPO”) on
                    the SGX. Pheim Malaysia was interested in investing in UET, given its favourable
                    price to earnings ratio of 11.8 (compared to 19.48 for Hyflux). Pheim Malaysia
                    subscribed to 2.3m UET shares at $0.47 each. Of these, 1.54m UET shares were
                    purchased for Accounts 89, 90 and 91.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     UET commenced trading on the SGX on
                    22 April 2004. Between the date of the IPO and the material time, Pheim
                    Malaysia purchased UET shares on a number of occasions, as follows:</p>

<p class="Judg-1">According to Dr Tan, Pheim Malaysia purchased UET shares between
                    April and May 2004 because it thought that UET had good prospects and potential.
                    The purchases in July 2004 were the result of its Investment Committee’s
                    decision (on 7 July 2004) to increase exposure to UET shares in Accounts
                    89, 90, 91 and F5, “in view of [the] bright industry outlook [and]
                    possible rising profit]”. Similarly, purchases were made in September
                    2004 after the Investment Committee decided to increase its exposure to UET for
                    Accounts 89, 90, 91 and F5 as it expected UET to see improving profits. All the
                    purchases made after May 2004 were at prices below the IPO price.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     On 28 October 2004, UET announced that it
                    had secured a “long-term Transfer, Operate and Transfer contract to treat
                    wastewater” in China (“the TOT contract”). The company
                    clarified that the TOT contract was not expected to have any material impact on
                    UET’s performance for the financial year ending 31 December 2004. On
                    2 November 2004, the company also clarified that the TOT contract would be
                    able to generate a steady stream of income for a period of 30 years. On
                    12 November 2004, UET announced that it had recorded a 125% increase in net
                    profit for the third quarter of financial year 2004, as compared to the same
                    period for financial year 2003. According to Dr Tan, these announcements
                    only served to confirm Pheim Malaysia’s positive outlook on UET’s
                    prospects.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     On 15 December 2004, Pheim
                    Malaysia’s Investment Committee met and decided to increase its exposure
                    to UET shares for Accounts 89, 90 and 91 “in anticipation of better
                    results going forward”. Dr Tan and Ms Tan were present at this
                    meeting. In the minutes of the meeting, it was stated that follow-up action
                    would be taken by Ms Tan and Ng.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     On 21 December 2004, UET announced that
                    its subsidiary had secured a S$4m contract with Tianjin TEDA Water Technology Co
                    Ltd. However, the announcement warned that this contract was unlikely to have
                    any material effect on its earnings per share for that financial
                year.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     On 28 December 2004, Pheim Malaysia sold
                    S$815,000 worth of shares in Azeus Systems Holdings Ltd (“Azeus”).
                    Azeus was a company listed on the SGX. The shares were sold from Accounts 89, 90
                    and 91. According to Dr Tan and Tew, the Azeus shares were sold to lock in
                    profits. Instructions to sell the Azeus shares came from both Dr Tan and
                    Chong. According to Dr Tan, he gave Tang instructions to sell the Azeus
                    shares as the Pheim Group had held on to those shares for some time and the
                    major shareholder was interested in acquiring the same.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     It would be useful for me to set out the
                    prices at which UET shares traded from 15 December 2004 (the day Pheim
                    Malaysia’s Investment Committee decided to increase its exposure in UET
                    shares) to the material time, in the following table:</p>

<p class="Judg-1">I should add that Pheim Singapore sold a total of 207,000 UET shares
                    at an average price of $0.359 on or after 23 December 2004. According to
                    Dr Tan, there was a practice of not allowing Pheim Malaysia to purchase
                    shares sold by Pheim Singapore, although this rule was not reflected in its
                    internal manual. Excluding the shares sold by Pheim Singapore, approximately
                    120,000 UET shares changed hands between $0.355 and $0.39.</p>

                    12.20pm, Tang had to use the force-key function as the trade was at more than
                    six bids above the last traded price. Subsequently, all the shares purchased on
                    31 December 2004 were booked into Account 89.</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     On 19 January 2005, Pheim Malaysia
                    purchased 205,000 UET shares at a weighted price of $0.416 for Account F5.
                    According to Dr Tan, the purpose of this purchase was to increase its
                    exposure to UET shares and to average down the purchase price.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     Pheim Malaysia first sold its UET shares on
                    18 March 2005, when it sold 87,000 UET shares from Account 91 at a weighted
                    price of $0.379 per share to fund redemptions for that account. Subsequently,
                    between October 2005 and February 2006, Pheim Malaysia sold a total of 2.835
                    million UET shares at a weighted average price of $0.53 per share. By 2007,
                    Pheim Malaysia sold all its UET shares as it took the view that the
                    company’s prospects had dimmed.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The investigations into Pheim Malaysia</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     Dr Tan was interviewed by the MAS about
                    the UET trades conducted at the material time on 28 March 2006. Thereafter,
                    he conducted an investigation within Pheim Malaysia. In a subsequent interview,
                    Dr Tan told the MAS that it was Ms Tan who had executed the UET trades
                    at the material time. In April 2006, the SCM asked Pheim Malaysia to provide a
                    report on the UET trades that took place at the material time. A report was duly
                    provided on 19 April 2006. The report stated that on 29, 30 and
                    31 December 2004, Ms Tan had given Tang careful discretion orders
                    (“CD order(s)”) to purchase UET shares. Ms Tan gave evidence
                    that she had seen the report before it was sent out and did not object to it.
                    However, in court, Ms Tan testified that she had been influenced by
                    Dr Tan to agree to the statement in the report that she had carried out the
                    trades. She claimed that she was confused and therefore acted as instructed by
                    her superiors. She said:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Okay, when they got the letter from the [SCM], Mr Tew consulted
                        Dr Tan on how to deal with this and the immediate reaction was to
                        answer the [SCM] by saying that I did the trade, in a meeting -- in the
                        investment committee meeting. At that time I was rather shocked and I was
                        uncomfortable. Subsequently, Dr Tan asked me to go into his room to
                        have some private conversations, and I was under the impression that, since
                        I signed most of the trade slips, I had to be responsible for it and,
                        therefore, I agreed that my name be submitted to [SCM] and, subsequently,
                        when a letter was sent by [SCM] to ask us to attend the interview, I wasn't
                        even consulted.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The next thing I knew was Mr Peter Chong came out from Dr Tan's
                        room and it was agreed that this should be presented to the [SCM] as how it
                        was specified in the letter sent to the [SCM] earlier.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     Some of Pheim Malaysia’s staff was also
                    interviewed by the SCM on 6, 7 and 8 June 2006. In particular, Ms Tan
                    was interviewed by SCM on or about 7 June 2006. She reported the outcome of
                    her interview to Dr Tan, Chong and Tew and was told by Dr Tan to
                    prepare a note. Ms Tan prepared a note based on the notes she had taken
                    during the interview. The note Ms Tan prepared for Dr Tan stated that
                    she had given instructions to purchase the UET shares at the material time.
                    However in court, Ms Tan recanted from the version of events she had given
                    at the interview and said that she had never given any order to Tang to purchase
                    UET shares at the material time.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The foreign equity limits</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     One of Pheim Malaysia’s defences is that
                    it purchased the UET shares at the material time for Accounts 89, 90 and 91 to
                    replace the Azeus shares it sold on 28 December 2004, as it wanted to
                    maintain exposure to foreign equities without contravening the foreign equities
                    NAV limits for the accounts. During the course of the trial, Dr Tan gave
                    evidence that another reason for doing that at the material time was so that it
                    would not contravene the equities limit that was set for each of these accounts.

<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The factual disputes</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     At this juncture, it would be useful for me to
                    make some observations about the witnesses. The key witness of fact for MAS was
                    Tang while the key witnesses of fact for the defendants were Dr Tang,
                    Ms Tan and (to a smaller extent) Tew. Given that the events had transpired
                    in 2004 and the fast-paced and fluid nature of the industry, it came as little
                    surprise to the court that the witnesses of fact were unable to recall the key
                    conversations that had taken place at the material time. Some allowance,
                    therefore, has to be made for the real possibility that their recollection of
                    events at the trial was less than accurate. Even so, Tang impressed me as an
                    honest witness who spoke with remarkable candour. As I mentioned earlier,
                    Ms Tan came as a witness under controversial circumstances, arriving in
                    Singapore from Hong Kong (where she works) without prior warning in the midst of
                    the trial and taking the defendants by surprise. It appeared that the MAS had
                    managed to convince her to testify as a witness. The defendants and their
                    counsel claimed that they had made (unsuccessful) attempts to contact
                    Ms Tan. Given the circumstances, I was a little sceptical of the
                    defendants’ efforts to persuade Ms Tan to testify. As she gave
                    unfavourable evidence, it is not surprising that the defendants subsequently
                    applied to cross-examine Ms Tan under s 156 of the Evidence Act
                    (Cap 97, 1997 Rev Ed). As for Dr Tan, even giving due allowance
                    for the effluxion of time, he did not impress me as a credible witness. He
                    appeared defensive and on occasions when pressed with difficult questions, he
                    was evasive.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     Both MAS and the defendants also had an expert
                    witness each. Christopher Chong (“Mr Chong”) appeared on
                    behalf of the MAS, while Nel Radley Freits (“Mr Freits”)
                    appeared on the defendants’ behalf. Mr Chong is a financial and
                    corporate consultant with finance and accounting background. He co-founded a
                    specialist corporate advisory firm, is a director of numerous companies and
                    funds and had assisted the local regulatory authorities on a number of
                    occasions. Mr Freits is a retired stockbroker with considerable experience
                    working with traders and salespersons. He is also actively involved with the
                    SGX, serving on several committees including the Disciplinary
                Committee.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     There were two key factual disputes that arose
                    during the course of the trial, namely:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_37-p2_a"></a>(a)     Who had given the orders to Tang to
                        execute the trades in UET shares at the material time?</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_37-p2_b"></a>(b)     Were the UET share purchases for
                        legitimate commercial purposes?</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Whether Dr Tan had given the orders to Tang</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     MAS contended that Dr Tan gave the orders
                    to Tang. The defendants strenuously denied this allegation, contending that it
                    was Ms Tan who had done so, as she had admitted in her statement to the SCM
                    (as recorded in her notes) and in Pheim Malaysia’s letter to SCM. On the
                    stand, Ms Tan resolutely denied having given Tang any orders to purchase
                    UET shares and essentially said that she was cajoled into taking responsibility
                    for the trade by (<em>inter alios</em>) Dr Tan before
                    her interview with the SCM.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     There is little evidence, apart from the
                    telephone records, in this respect. Where calls were made to or from Pheim
                    Malaysia’s line, Tang could not recall who he had spoken to. Neither could
                    Ms Tan recall if she had spoken to Tang at the material time, although she
                    was adamant that even if she had spoken to Tang, she did not at any time give
                    Tang the order to purchase UET shares. The same difficulties applied where
                    Dr Tan conversed with Tang – neither could recall what had transpired
                    in their numerous conversations.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     Despite the lacuna in the witnesses’
                    evidence, I think the telephone records, when considered together with the
                    timing of the trades, leads to an irresistible inference that it was Dr Tan
                    who had given Tang the orders to carry out the trades. I will start with the
                    events that took place on 30 and 31 December 2004, before returning to
                    consider the events that took place on 29 December 2004.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">30 December 2004</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     On 30 December 2004, the first trade of
                    the day by Pheim Malaysia through Tang took place at 2.23pm. Before the first
                    trade, there were calls from Tang to Pheim Malaysia, and also, from Dr Tan
                    to Tang. According to Tang, he would have updated Pheim Malaysia and Dr Tan
                    about UET and the movements in its share price. To the best of Tang’s
                    recollection, it was Pheim Malaysia that gave him a CD order for UET shares.
                    Dr Tan, during cross-examination, claimed he could not remember the
                    conversations he had with Tang, but agreed that Tang’s recollection was
                    possible given that Tang had been unable to complete the order given by Pheim
                    Malaysia the previous day.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     Interestingly, the trades that took place on
                    30 December 2004 coincided with calls that took place between Dr Tan
                    and Tang. The first trade was executed at 2.23:47pm; Tang had called Dr Tan
                    at 2.23pm in a conversation lasting 38 seconds. The next trade occurred at
                    4.25pm; Dr Tan had called Tan just a couple of minutes earlier at 4.23pm,
                    in a conversation lasting 1 minute 33 seconds. This was followed by a number of
                    trades executed between 4.32pm and 4.45pm. Thereafter, Tang executed a series of
                    trades at 4.50pm, 4.51pm, 4.52pm, 4.53pm and 4.56pm; this was just after Tang
                    called Dr Tan at 4.50pm in a conversation lasting just slightly over a
                    minute. Next, Tang executed another two trades at 4.57pm and 4.59pm (just
                    minutes before 5pm); Tang was on the line with Dr Tan at 4.57pm for 43
                    seconds.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     According to Tang, during the 2.23pm
                    conversation, he told Dr Tan that UET shares were available and Dr Tan
                    told him to purchase them carefully. Dr Tan suggested that he would have
                    told Tang to consult the person who had originally given him the order and
                    follow that person’s instructions instead. I reject Dr Tan’s
                    evidence. If Dr Tan’s evidence was correct, Tang would not have
                    executed the trade during or shortly after the 2.23pm conversation, as he would
                    have had to call Pheim Malaysia to check with the fund manager concerned. The
                    fact that a trade was executed contemporaneously, in my view, strongly suggests
                    that Dr Tan was the one who had given instructions for the trade at
                    2.23pm.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     The same scenario played out again at 4.23pm.
                    According to Tang, Dr Tan gave him permission to purchase UET shares at a
                    higher price if necessary, as he (Tang) was having trouble fulfilling the order
                    due to the counter’s illiquidity. Dr Tan claimed he could not
                    remember this conversation but admitted it was possible. According to Tang, he
                    called Dr Tan at 4.50pm and 4.57pm to update him on the trades that were
                    made. Dr Tan agreed that it was very likely that Tang talked to him about
                    the UET trades. He could not recall if Tang had asked him for permission to buy
                    more shares. Dr Tan further claimed that if Tang had checked if he
                    (Dr Tan) wanted Tang to continue buying UET shares, he would have told Tang
                    “to do so carefully or try your best”. In my view, the timing of
                    these calls was a strong indicator that Dr Tan had personally given Tang
                    instructions to trade and permission to buy at a higher price. First, the trades
                    were executed contemporaneously with conversations between Dr Tan and Tang.
                    Second, the telephone conversations coincided with purchases that were executed
                    at higher prices. The fact that trades were executed at higher prices during or
                    immediately after the calls with Dr Tan suggests that Dr Tan had given
                    Tang permission to purchase UET shares at higher prices. Given the overly
                    coincidental pattern of calls between Tang and Dr Tan that were
                    contemporaneous with trades at higher prices, it is eminently clear that
                    Dr Tan must have been the one who had given Tang instructions to
                    trade.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">31 December 2004</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     Again, the sequence of events which took place
                    on 31 December 2004 strongly resembled that which had taken place on the
                    previous day. There was a call from Dr Tan to Tang in the morning, which
                    was followed by a short call from Tang to Pheim Malaysia. Tang’s evidence
                    was that he gave Dr Tan an update and was told that Pheim Malaysia was
                    still interested in purchasing UET shares. Dr Tan agreed this was possible.
                    Tang then called Pheim Malaysia to update one of its fund managers, and recalled
                    being given a CD Order to purchase UET shares that was likely to be of $100,000
                    in value.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     It is noteworthy that when other parties had
                    purchased UET shares at lower prices, Tang would call Dr Tan directly
                    instead of updating the fund managers at Pheim Malaysia. Tang’s evidence
                    was that he updated Dr Tan on such trades, as he was told to continue
                    monitoring the counter. Dr Tan tried to argue that it was unlikely that
                    Tang was updating him on the UET counter due to the short duration of the calls.
                    Dr Tan suggested that when he was busy, he would hold the line when he
                    received calls. Dr Tan later claimed he could not remember. The timing of
                    the calls (which took place after each trade) suggests that the calls were
                    indeed updates. I reject Dr Tan’s suggestion that the duration of
                    these calls was too short to be meaningful – 12 (and certainly 18) seconds
                    is ample time to inform a person about the last transacted price and volume,
                    together with the usual niceties. I find it significant that Tang chose to
                    update Dr Tan regularly instead of a fund manager at Pheim Malaysia. A
                    broker would logically provide regular updates to the person in a position to
                    give instructions and to provide further business. In the present case, it would
                    have been the person giving regular orders to purchase shares on previous days.
                    As such, the fact that Tang chose to call Dr Tan to provide updates gives
                    rise to the strong inference that Dr Tan had given Tang instructions to
                    execute the trades in UET shares on previous days.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     At 12.18pm, Tang called Dr Tan and the
                    call lasted nearly two minutes. Shortly after that conversation, Tang executed a
                    series of trades which pushed the price of UET shares up from the last
                    transacted price of $0.39 to $0.445. The last purchase was made just three
                    seconds before the close of the trading year. Again, the close proximity between
                    the call and the trades suggests that it was Dr Tan who had given Tang
                    instructions to purchase the UET shares. Significantly, Tang would have had to
                    use the force-key to execute the first trade as it was more than six spreads
                    above the last transacted price of $0.39. According to Tang, Dr Tan had
                    asked him to purchase UET shares carefully. He used the force-key to transact at
                    the best offer available and believed that the last transacted price of $0.39
                    was not representative of the market when compared to the previous day’s
                    closing price. On the other hand, Dr Tan claimed he could not remember what
                    happened but that it was likely that Tang had given him an update and that he
                    told Tang to purchase carefully “if you’ve got the
                    instruction”, but disagreed having told Tang to carry out the order
                    given. The sequence of events suggests that Tang’s version, that
                    Dr Tan had given him instructions to purchase UET shares during the 12.18pm
                    conversation, was correct. If all that Dr Tan told Tang to do was to
                    purchase UET shares carefully according to instructions and that he did not give
                    any instructions to purchase, Tang would have called the fund manager at Pheim
                    Malaysia at least once to provide updates. However, Tang did not. Instead, he
                    continued to update only Dr Tan. This suggests that on 30 and
                    31 December 2004, it was Dr Tan who had given Tang instructions to
                    purchase UET shares at higher prices. In this regard, whether instructions from
                    a fund manager had been given to Mr Tang in the morning is irrelevant
                    – if is clear that the puppet-master orchestrating the trades at the
                    crucial times was Dr Tan alone.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">29 December 2004</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     I will now turn to consider the events on
                    29 December 2004. There were a series of telephone calls. Tang’s best
                    recollection was that Pheim Malaysia had indicated its interest in buying UET
                    shares. However, the CD order to purchase UET shares came from Dr Tan
                    during the conversation at around 4.44pm. Dr Tan disagreed and claimed he
                    could not recall whether he had spoken to Tang and/or given Tang the order,
                    holding the view that Tang received the order in the morning instead.
                    Dr Tan received a call from an unknown person at 4.41pm, and the
                    conversation lasted about 3.5 minutes. The first trade by Tang occurred at
                    4.49pm. In my view, it was very likely that the person on the other end of the
                    phone was Tang, given how the trade was contemporaneous with the telephone call.
                    There were relatively large volumes of UET shares available at $0.385 per share
                    during the day, which differed from the closing price on 27 December 2007
                    by a mere half cent – even under a CD order, there would have been nothing
                    to stop Tang from buying those shares for Pheim Malaysia. As such, it must have
                    been that the order to purchase came after 4.35pm. If so, it must have been
                    Dr Tan who had given Tang instructions to proceed with the
                trade.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Conclusion on the trades</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     In the light of the pattern of telephone calls
                    by Dr Tan to Tang before trades were executed at higher prices, I agree
                    with MAS that on a balance of probabilities, it was Dr Tan who had given
                    Tang instructions to purchase the UET shares on each of the three days at the
                    material time. In my view, whether a fund manager from Pheim Malaysia might have
                    given Tang instructions earlier in the day is irrelevant, as the evidence shows
                    that Tang looked to Dr Tan for permission to trade at higher prices, and
                    that Dr Tan had authorised the trades. Significantly, Dr Tan was the
                    last person that Tang spoke to before he executed the trades on all three days.
                    It was also clear that updates were provided by Tang to Dr Tan primarily.
                    Even where calls were made by Tang to Pheim Malaysia, it was followed by a call
                    from Dr Tan to Tang. The objective evidence leads me to conclude with
                    little hesitation that it was Dr Tan who had given Tang instructions at the
                    material time to purchase the UET shares.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Whether the UET share purchases were for legitimate commercial
                purpose</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     The defendants contended that the UET share
                    purchases at the material time were pursuant to a legitimate investment strategy
                    and objective. There were three parts to its argument. First, they highlighted
                    that Pheim Malaysia was interested in investing in UET for the long-term, as
                    evidenced by its Investment Committee’s decisions on 7 July 2004,
                    2 September 2004 and 15 December 2004 to increase its exposure to UET
                    shares. In addition, they continued to purchase UET shares after its IPO and
                    even after the material time, allowing it to average down the cost of purchasing
                    those UET shares. Furthermore, Pheim Malaysia managed to make a profit some nine
                    months after the material time from selling the UET shares. They also argued
                    that Pheim Malaysia regarded UET shares as being undervalued, under-researched
                    and overlooked. Second, they contended that the UET shares were purchased to
                    replace the Azeus shares that were sold on 28 December 2004.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     The defendants’ arguments were
                    unconvincing. First, although decisions were made in earlier Investment
                    Committee meetings to purchase UET shares and UET shares were purchased before
                    and after the material time, those factors were negated by the peculiar
                    circumstances that were present at the time of the purchase. For reasons
                    explained in greater detail below (at <a href="#p1_79">[79]</a>–<a href="#p1_83">[83]</a>), those
                    factors suggested that Pheim Malaysia had purchased the UET shares for other
                    purposes. In particular, Pheim Malaysia could have but did not purchase UET
                    shares at lower prices before and after the material time. The strategy that it
                    employed was also inconsistent with that of an investor seeking to purchase at
                    the lowest possible price. The fact that the trades at the material time were
                    executed below UET’s IPO price was also inconclusive – the
                    reasonableness of the share purchases at the material time could not be measured
                    against the price at which the shares were traded more than eight months
                    earlier.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     Mr Chong disputed the grounds on which
                    Dr Tan reasoned that the UET shares were undervalued. I now turn to
                    consider the reasons. The TOT contract (at [14]) which Dr Tan referred to
                    stated that there would be no material impact on profits or earnings per share
                    for 2004. Dr Tan also did not consider the fact that there were significant
                    profits in the fourth quarter of financial year 2003 (“FY03”)
                    which were unlikely to be repeated in 2004, raising questions as to whether
                    UET’s earnings for 2004 would match those of FY03 despite the
                    comparatively better results in the third quarter of FY04. Although Dr Tan
                    asserted that a price to earnings ratio of 12 to 15 times would value UET shares
                    at between $0.55 and $0.69, there was no evidence that any valuation report had
                    been done in this regard. Mr Chong also showed that the UET trades at the
                    material time were at more than 12 times the earnings for 2003 (and 2004’s
                    annualised profits) and raised the valid point that an investor would unlikely
                    purchase a stock at a price to earnings ratio of 12 if his or her valuation
                    target for that stock was between 12 and 15. Significantly, the defendants did
                    not challenge these points during cross-examination. As for the choice of
                    comparable companies, Mr Chong rightly pointed out that there were other
                    risk factors which Dr Tan had not accounted for, such as the difference in
                    sovereign risk and target markets.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     After considering the evidence as a whole, I
                    agree with Mr Chong’s view that Dr Tan had no basis for saying
                    that UET shares were undervalued. Instead, Dr Tan’s reasoning
                    appeared to be an afterthought, especially in the absence of any contemporaneous
                    documentary evidence to show that he had genuinely considered the price-earnings
                    ratio to be between 12 and 15 and/or valued UET shares at $0.55 to $0.69. In
                    addition, I do not think the fact that UET shares were under-researched or
                    overlooked takes the defendants’ case any further. There are many possible
                    reasons for a stock to be under-researched or overlooked, and this fact alone
                    does not suggest that a stock is a good pick. Similarly, the fact that the
                    purchases at the material time were at prices below its IPO or were subsequently
                    sold for a profit does not assist the defendants’ case. The mere fact that
                    a profit was eventually made more than eight months down the road does not mean
                    that no market rigging could have taken place.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Whether the foreign equities limit or equities limit prevented Pheim
                Malaysia from purchasing UET shares before the material time</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     The defendants also contended that Pheim
                    Malaysia had positioned itself as having wider Asian competency and therefore
                    would invest in foreign securities if permitted by the accounts in question.
                    Accounts 89, 90 and 91 were such accounts that permitted investments in foreign
                    equities, although it was subject to a foreign equity limit of 10% and an equity
                    limit of 60% (for Accounts 89 and 90) and 20% (for Account 91). This was
                    especially so given the sale of Azeus shares on 28 December
                2004.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     As for the defendants’ case that they
                    had to wait for the Azeus shares to be sold before purchasing the UET shares, I
                    do not think that this reason operated on their minds. For the 10% foreign
                    equities limit, Accounts 90 and 91 would not have been close to breaching the
                    limit even if the UET shares were purchased between 15 and 28 December
                    2004. If one assumes that the UET shares purchased for Account 89 on
                    31 December were purchased on either 27 or 28 December 2004, Account
                    89 would have been close to or exceeded the 10% foreign equities limit. However,
                    this assumes that Pheim Malaysia would have bought the same number of UET shares
                    at the high prices it paid ($0.435 to $0.445), and UET shares were transacting
                    at significantly lower prices between 15 and 28 December 2004. In any case,
                    if the defendants genuinely held the belief that UET shares were undervalued and
                    wanted to show its competency in foreign markets, Pheim Malaysia could easily
                    have bought more shares for Accounts 90 and 91 without infringing the foreign
                    equity limits.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     As for the equities limit, I would first
                    observe that this line of argument was not pleaded by the defendants and emerged
                    late in the day, when Dr Tan took the stand. In any case, the equities
                    limit would not have been breached if the Defendants had purchased the UET
                    shares before selling the Azeus shares. Accounts 89 and 91 were significantly
                    below their respective equities limits between 15 and 28 December 2004,
                    even taking into account any purchase of UET shares. Account 90 was closer to
                    the limit, and if the UET shares purchased were considered, its equities limit
                    would have hovered between 59.37% and 59.93% between 15 and 28 December
                    2004. Dr Tan, during cross-examination, claimed that he would have been
                    concerned about leaving a buffer. I do not think the buffer operated in the
                    defendants’ minds at the material time. First, the foreign exchange rate
                    risk was lowered because both the Hong Kong dollar and the Malaysian ringgit
                    were pegged to the US dollar. Second, and more importantly, the evidence showed
                    that Pheim Malaysia was actively purchasing shares during that period of time
                    for Account 90. Third, if UET shares had been purchased at lower prices, there
                    would have been a bigger buffer. Even taking both the equity limits and foreign
                    equity limits into account, Pheim Malaysia was well-placed to purchase more UET
                    shares for Account 91 and (to a smaller extent) Accounts 89 and 90 at lower
                    prices, if it thought that UET was undervalued, but it did not do so.
                    Consequently, I do not accept that Pheim Malaysia or Dr Tan had considered
                    either limit as factors preventing them from purchasing more UET shares before
                    the Azeus shares were sold.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The parties’ pleaded case and arguments before this
                court</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     Having dealt with the key disputes of facts, I
                    will now turn to the parties’ pleaded case and arguments.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a>58     MAS argued that based on the facts of the
                    case, the only inference that could be drawn was that the defendants’ sole
                    or primary purpose in giving the orders and purchasing UET shares was to window
                    dress, by moving up and setting the market price for UET shares on the last
                    trading day of 2004 to improve the valuations of those accounts which held on to
                    UET shares. It highlighted that the UET counter was illiquid and that the trades
                    took place on the last three market days for 2004, when volumes were
                    traditionally thin. On each day, the trades took place shortly before the market
                    closed. In addition, year-end prices were particularly important for determining
                    portfolio performance. The defendants were the dominant buyer of an illiquid
                    stock which resulted in a 17% increase in UET’s share price, above what
                    would otherwise have been its likely market price. MAS also highlighted that the
                    defendants’ actions enabled the Pheim Group to increase the NAV of its
                    accounts by more than $1m and allowed three of its accounts to outperform their
                    benchmarks. As a consequence, MAS argued that both the defendants had infringed
                    s 197(1)(b) of the SFA. It sought a civil penalty of $1m per defendant to
                    achieve a deterrent effect.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a>59     Dr Tan’s defence was essentially a
                    bare denial or non-admittance of MAS’ case. He also pleaded that it was
                    Ms Tan who had given Tang CD orders to purchase the UET shares at the
                    material time. Pheim Malaysia’s case was that that the purchases of UET
                    shares by Pheim Malaysia were <em>bona fide</em> commercial
                    transactions because the defendants thought UET shares were trading at an
                    undervalue. In addition, Pheim Malaysia had sold Azeus shares on
                    28 December 2004. Since Pheim Malaysia wanted to purchase other SGX-listed
                    stocks to replace those Azeus shares without breaching the 10% foreign equity
                    limit, it was therefore natural and obvious for them to purchase the UET shares.
                    The defendants, in their submissions, highlighted that Pheim Malaysia would not
                    have continued to hold on to the UET shares after 31 December 2004 if they
                    had purchased the UET shares at the material time for the purpose of portfolio
                    pumping. Instead, Pheim Malaysia purchased more UET shares and continued to hold
                    on to those shares until October 2005, when they were sold for a profit. The
                    defendants also argued that the way Tang executed the trades enabled Pheim
                    Malaysia to purchase UET shares at the lowest possible price, which allowed it
                    to lower its average cost of purchasing UET shares since its IPO. They contended
                    that the fact that Accounts 28, 101 and 106 exceeded their benchmarks was an
                    “incidental consequence” of the trades executed <em>bona fide</em> by Tang, and that if they had wanted to achieve the
                    aim of portfolio pumping, they would have done so for <em>all</em> the accounts managed by Pheim Singapore.</p>

                    investors trade on the basis that the price reflects the operation of market
                    forces and not the outcome of the manipulative practices by other traders: see
                    also Black, <em>Regulating Market Manipulation: Sections 997-999
                        Corporations Law</em> (1996) 70 ALJ 987 (“<em>Black on Market Manipulation</em>”) at 988. Section
                    197(1) is borrowed from Australian legislation (see s 998 of the Australian
                    Corporations Act (No 50, 2001)) and there are three distinct limbs in this
                    provision. The first limb is where a person in fact <em>creates</em> a false or misleading appearance. The second limb is
                    where a person does anything that is <em>intended to
                        create</em> a false or misleading appearance. The third limb is where
                    a person does anything that is <em>likely to create</em> a
                    false or misleading appearance. For convenience, I will deal with the second
                    limb first.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The law on what constitutes an intention to create a false or
                misleading appearance</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_62"></a>62     Given that s 197 is borrowed from
                    Australia, the Australian cases are therefore persuasive and I will turn to
                    consider them. In <em>North</em>, the defendant-respondent
                    company (“Marra”) engaged the appellant-plaintiff stockbroker
                    (“North”) for advice as it (Marra) felt undervalued by the market
                    and vulnerable to a takeover. North advised Marra to (<em>inter
                        alia</em>) take over or merge with another company
                    (“Scottish”) to become a less attractive takeover target. Marra
                    accepted this advice. Thereafter, Marra reached an agreement with Scottish.
                    Under this agreement, it was important for Marra’s share price to rise to
                    approximately $16.50 so that Scottish shareholders would consider the deal
                    favourably. Before the takeover was announced, North purchased Marra shares at
                    $16.50, which was above its historical prices. North continued to purchase Marra
                    shares at that price for nearly one and a half months. Subsequently, Marra
                    argued that it did not have to pay for North’s services because their
                    contract was illegal for infringing s 70 of the New South Wales Security
                    Industry Act 1970, which states:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">A person shall not create or cause to be created or do anything which is
                        calculated to create, a false or misleading appearance of active trading in
                        any securities on any stock market in the State, or a false or misleading
                        appearance with respect to the market for, or the price of, any
                        securities.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_63"></a>63     The High Court of Australia dismissed
                    North’s appeal, holding that North’s conduct in purchasing the Marra
                    shares was illegal. Mason J found that the substance of the agreement was to
                    purchase Marra shares at approximately $16.50 in order to attain a particular
                    goal, and agreed with Mahoney JA’s view that (<em>North</em> at 56):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... it was not the purpose of the plaintiffs to buy the shares that they
                        did at the lowest price reasonably obtainable; that <em>the
                            reason why they bought shares as they did was so that the Stock Exchange
                            price of Marra shares would appear publicly to be $16.50 per share or of
                            that general order</em>; and that they did this so that that price
                        could be used to advantage in connection with, at least, the takeover [of
                        Scottish shares].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_64"></a>64     North argued that it could not have misled
                    anyone because the market was not concerned with the identity of purchasers or
                    with their motivations, so long as the purchases were genuine by satisfying a
                    legitimate market activity of the purchaser. Mason J dismissed North’s
                    argument, observing that (at 58-59):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... the object of the section is to <em>protect the market
                            for securities against activities which will result in artificial or
                            managed manipulation</em>. The section seeks to ensure that the
                            <em>market reflects the forces of genuine supply and
                            demand</em>. By "genuine supply and demand" I exclude buyers and
                        sellers whose <em>transactions are undertaken for the sole or
                            primary purpose of setting or maintaining the market price</em>.
                        It is in the interests of the community that the market for securities
                        should be real and genuine, free from manipulation. The section is a
                        legislative measure designed to ensure such a market and it should be
                        interpreted accordingly.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I agree with Hope and Samuels JJ.A. in rejecting the suggestion that the
                        section strikes only at fictitious or colourable transactions. Transactions
                        which are real and genuine but only in the sense that they are intended to
                        operate according to their terms, like fictitious or colourable
                        transactions, are capable of creating quite a false or misleading impression
                        as to the market or the price. <em>This is because they would
                            not have been entered into but for the object on the part of the buyer
                            or of the seller of setting and maintaining the price, yet in the
                            absence of revelation of their true character they are seen as
                            transactions reflecting genuine supply and demand and having as such an
                            impact on the market</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_65"></a>65     Likewise, in <em>Fame
                        Decorators Agencies Pty Ltd v Jeffries Industries Ltd</em> (1998)
                    28 ACSR 58, Gleeson CJ (delivering the judgment of the majority)
                    considered the purpose of entering into the transaction and found on the facts
                    of the case that the central object was to influence the market price. In that
                    case, Fame held shares in Jeffries, a listed company. Jeffries was a thinly
                    traded counter. Fame also held convertible preference shares in Jeffries.
                    Fame’s director became aware that the accelerated conversion provisions
                    would be triggered. The formula for the conversion was such that the lower the
                    average price over 20 trading days, the greater the number of shares that would
                    be allotted. Midday on 28 April, Fame’s director was informed that
                    there were various offers to buy shares at prices ranging from 13 cents to 35
                    cents. It was agreed that if in the afternoon there was no change in the market,
                    Fame’s director would instruct the broker to sell enough shares to bring
                    the Jeffries share price down to 13 cents, and that the sales would be left
                    until as late as possible just before the close of the market. These
                    instructions came at 3.52pm, eight minutes before the close of trading. The
                    price of Jeffries shares was brought down to 13 cents. Fame’s offer to
                    sell came just three minutes before the close of trading. The Fame director
                    initially explained that he needed to obtain quick cash, but the court rejected
                    that excuse and concluded that the shares were sold to create an artificially
                    low price to aid the conversion calculation.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_66"></a>66     The court had little hesitation finding that
                    Fame had contravened the relevant rules, holding that (at 62-63):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Section 998 aims to preserve the integrity of the share market. Markets,
                        in reflecting the interaction of forces of supply and demand, may suffer
                        from a variety of imperfections, including mismatches of information,
                        without such imperfections destroying their integrity. <em>However, the conduct of a seller of thinly traded shares, calculated to
                            effect sales at the lowest, rather than the highest, obtainable price,
                            and timed so as to deflect the possibility of some purchasers bidding up
                            the price, had</em><b><em>both the purpose and effect</em></b><em>of creating, temporarily, an artificial market and
                            price</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<em>... The effect of Fame’s conduct upon the market
                            for shares in Jeffries, and the market price, was not merely
                            incidental</em>. <b><em>The central object of such
                            conduct was to influence the market price</em></b>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">As Mason J acknowledged in North, in individual cases there may be
                        difficulty in determining whether the conduct of a buyer or a seller, unless
                        fully disclosed, falsifies the assumptions upon which a market operates, and
                        damages the integrity of the market. In the present case, however, Cohen J
                        was right to conclude that both the purpose and the effect of Fame's conduct
                        was to create an artificial market price for shares in Jeffries and that
                        such conduct contravened s 998.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[Emphasis added in italics and bold italics]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_67"></a>67     As such, in order to establish the second
                    limb, it would be necessary to show that the sole or dominant intention of the
                    party charged or sued was to set or maintain a certain price of a
                    security.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_68"></a>68     The defendants, in their submissions, sought
                    to argue that where there was legitimate commercial reasons tor entering into
                    the transaction, they could not be held liable under s 197(1) of the SFA.
                    In particular, they said:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It is submitted that this makes it clear that the mischief targeted by
                        section 197(1) is where the transactions/instructions are for the purpose of
                        creating a "false or misleading appearance" <em>and that
                            where there is</em><b><em>a</em></b><em>legitimate commercial reason for a transaction (i.e.
                            there was no purpose of creating a false or misleading appearance), the
                            transaction does not fall within the mischief of section 197(1); and
                            thus does not fall foul of the provision</em>. [Emphasis added in
                        italics and bold italics]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_69"></a>69     It is not immediately clear whether the
                    defendants are advocating that it is necessary to simply establish one
                    legitimate commercial purpose to defeat a charge or suit brought under
                    s 197(1) of the SFA, or that they must establish that the primary purpose
                    was a legitimate commercial purpose. Insofar as they propose that one legitimate
                    commercial purpose (whether primary or otherwise) is suggested, I reject that
                    submission as it would be contrary to the purpose and intent of the section. It
                    was also not supported by s 197(4) of the SFA, which provides a defence
                    only to the acts deemed under s 197(3) as creating false or misleading
                    appearances. Section 197(4) of the SFA simply provides that in relation to a
                    contravention of s 197(3):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">it is a defence if the defendant establishes that the purpose or purposes
                        for which he did the act was not, or did not include, the purpose of
                        creating a false or misleading appearance of active trading in securities on
                        a securities market.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_70"></a>70     Section 197(4) of the SFA clearly does not
                    suggest that the defence would be made out if one legitimate commercial purpose
                    (which need not be the primary purpose) can be established; to the contrary, it
                    requires the defendant to establish that the purposes for entering into the
                    transaction did not include that of raising or setting the price of the
                    security. For this reason, the court in <em>Braysich v
                        R</em> (2009) 74 ACSR 387, in considering s 998(6) of
                    the Corporations Law (in <em>pari materia</em> with
                    s 197(4) of the SFA), held that (at [95]–[97]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">As I have mentioned, an accused who seeks to rely on the defence under
                        s 998(6) must prove, on the balance of probabilities, that the purpose
                        or purposes for which he or she engaged in the relevant activity (that is,
                        the activity the subject of the relevant deeming provision in s 998(5))
                        were not, or did not include, the purpose of creating a false or misleading
                        appearance of active trading in the securities in question on a stock
                        market.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The accused will not establish the defence if he or she merely proves that
                        he or she entered into or carried out the relevant transaction or
                        transactions for a permissible or non-proscribed purpose. <em>The accused must prove that none of his or her purposes, for entering
                            into or carrying out the transaction or transactions, included the
                            purpose of creating a false or misleading appearance of active trading
                            in the relevant securities on a stock market</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Also, the defence will not be made out if the accused merely raises a
                        reasonable doubt as to whether he or she had the proscribed purpose, or
                        merely establishes that there is a reasonable and rational inference,
                        available on the evidence, that he or she did not have the proscribed
                        purpose.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[Emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">For the reasons stated, I hold that MAS, in order to succeed, must
                    establish under s 197(1) of the SFA, that the primary purpose was to set or
                    maintain the market price.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Whether the Defendants had the intention to create a false or
                misleading appearance</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_71"></a>71     I will now turn to consider whether MAS has
                    made out its case based on the second limb of s 197(1). The key question in
                    this regard is: what were the defendants’ objectives in purchasing the UET
                    shares at the material time? Was it purely or primarily for commercial reasons
                    (as the defendants contended) or was it for window-dressing (as MAS
                    contended)?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_72"></a>72     I find it more convenient to deal with the
                    defendants’ arguments first. Their argument was threefold. First, they
                    argued that their purchases were for legitimate commercial reasons. I have
                    already dealt with this argument above and found that their purchases were not
                    for legitimate commercial reasons (at <a href="#p1_50">[50]</a>
                    to <a href="#p1_53">[53]</a>). Second, they argued that there was
                    no benefit to the Pheim Group arising from the UET trades and that it would have
                    been practically impossible to increase account valuations in that manner. They
                    also argued that there was nothing in the manner in which the trades were
                    carried out which could be criticised and that the purchases were at the best
                    price for the volumes desired.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_73"></a>73     I do not accept that there was no benefit to
                    the Pheim Group arising from the UET trades. The monetary gains that the Pheim
                    Group earned from such outperformance were not significant, but that was beside
                    the point. The defendants’ aim was to maintain the Pheim Group’s
                    near-perfect record of outperforming its benchmarks, especially for its key fund
                    (the Vittoria fund) which was featured on its promotional material. The gain
                    sought by the defendants was in relation to its standing and reputation. In any
                    case, the increase in UET’s share price caused Pheim Group’s funds
                    to rise by more than $1million over the short span of three days, and this would
                    by no means be an insignificant monetary gain, even though the money
                    theoretically belonged to their clients.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_74"></a>74     The defendants also argued that if they had
                    illegitimate intentions, they would have used different and more aggressive
                    trading strategies, participate in the pre-close routine or use the force key
                    indiscriminately. In my view, such arguments do not assist their case either. As
                    MAS pointed out, the alternative methods suggested were blatant means of
                    creating a false appearance in the market, which would have attracted the
                    regulators’ attention. There are other ways of manipulating the market
                    without being so blatant. Therefore, the fact that the defendants did not engage
                    in these blatant strategies did not assist their case.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_75"></a>75     Next, the defendants argued that their
                    purchase price for those UET shares was reasonable and that they had obtained
                    the best possible price. I reject these arguments. First, the defendants relied
                    on the weighted average price of the daily trades for comparison, but even
                    Mr Freits conceded that this was not a useful gauge when, as Pheim Malaysia
                    did here, one party was responsible for the majority or all the trades in the
                    day. The defendants asked the court to recognise that the price was equally
                    determined by the sellers of the shares, who were not related to Pheim Malaysia.
                    That did not matter, because there would always be opportunistic sellers placing
                    bids that they do not expect to be matched. The fact that Tang lifted the lowest
                    sell orders in the queue also does not assist the defendants. UET was an
                    illiquid counter – bids to sell were unlikely to be readily forthcoming
                    within a short span of time. The bulk of the trades took place within a
                    relatively short span of ten to thirty minutes before the end of the trading
                    day. The strategy of continuously lifting the lowest sell orders within a short
                    span of time could only result in an increase in UET’s share price. If
                    anything, the strategy of repeatedly lifting the lowest sell orders towards the
                    end of the day for an illiquid counter would have been most effective in driving
                    up the price of that counter.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_76"></a>76     The defendants also highlighted that a
                    decision was reached on 15 December 2004 to purchase UET shares. They
                    contended that CD orders had been given to Tang in the morning, and the manner
                    in which the CD orders were executed could not be criticised. In addition, they
                    argued that there was no evidence that the defendants told Tang to manipulate
                    the market or to purchase UET shares towards the end of the trading day. I
                    accept that a decision was reached on 15 December 2004 to purchase UET
                    shares. However, I do not think that the decision weighed heavily in the minds
                    of the defendants at the material time.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_77"></a>77     As I held earlier, the limits did not prevent
                    Pheim Malaysia from purchasing some UET shares before the sale of Azeus shares.
                    There were active trades for UET shares at prices below those which Pheim
                    Malaysia paid, both before and after the material time. As such, Pheim Malaysia
                    could have bought UET shares before and after the material time at a cheaper
                    price. However, it chose not to do so, even though: (a) the accounts could
                    comfortably accommodate further purchases of UET shares; (b) there were
                    unfulfilled orders for UET shares at the material time; and (c) Dr Tan was
                    keen to show his expertise in overseas markets. When these factors are
                    considered in totality, it becomes clear that the defendants’ primary
                    purpose in buying the UET shares at the material time was not, as they claimed,
                    to increase Pheim Malaysia’s exposure to UET shares or to show its
                    expertise in the overseas market. In addition, I did not find the
                    defendants’ arguments that CD orders had been given to Tang to be
                    convincing. As Mr Chong testified, it was little use giving a CD order for
                    a large number of shares to a broker if that stock was illiquid and the volume
                    was weak as the broker, in such circumstances, would end up moving the price of
                    that stock. In any case, as I have found earlier, it was Dr Tan who had
                    given Tang instructions to purchase those UET shares just before the trades were
                    executed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_78"></a>78     I will now turn to consider the factors that
                    lead to the conclusion that the trades were for the primary purpose of raising
                    and setting UET’s share price at the end of 2004.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_79"></a>79     First, it is noteworthy that UET was an
                    illiquid counter. One would expect less (or even no) trading to take place on
                    each day as compared to a liquid counter. As such, it would be easier to
                    manipulate an illiquid counter as a manipulator can raise or set the share price
                    without having to worry too much about any interference from other parties, who
                    may place bids to sell at a price lower than the next asking price available or
                    at the last traded price. The presence of such other investors would make it a
                    lot more difficult and expensive for a party to manipulate the share
                    price.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_80"></a>80     Second, the trades took place during the last
                    three trading days of the year. This factor is significant for two reasons.
                    First, year-end closing prices are traditionally used by funds to determine
                    their portfolio performance. This was the case for the Pheim Group. In addition,
                    the evidence showed that trading volumes towards the end of the year tended to
                    be thin, making it even easier for the Defendants to manipulate UET’s
                    share price.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_81"></a>81     Third, most of Pheim Malaysia’s trades
                    were executed within the last half an hour of trading each day. Indeed, I would
                    observe that Pheim Malaysia’s last purchases for each day took place, were
                    entered and filled during the last minute of trading. Pheim Malaysia’s
                    trades were significant as it accounted for 88% of all trades carried out over
                    those three days for UET shares and, in so doing, caused UET’s share price
                    to rise by 17%. Mr Friets himself conceded that Pheim Malaysia never had
                    such a strong influence over UET’s traded volume as compared to the
                    material time.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_82"></a>82     Fourth, Pheim Malaysia had numerous
                    opportunities to purchase UET shares before and after the material time at more
                    attractive prices, but curiously chose not to do so. If (as the defendants
                    claimed) Pheim Malaysia had intended to purchase UET shares because they thought
                    UET was undervalued, they would have done so at cheaper prices before or after
                    the material time. There was no need for them to do so on the last three trading
                    days of the year and there was likewise no need for them to purchase UET shares
                    at increasingly higher prices. Mr Chong’s evidence was that a genuine
                    buyer would have spread its purchases of an illiquid security over a longer
                    period of time to enable it to purchase at the lowest possible price and to
                    minimise any price volatility. I agree, and it is evident that Pheim Malaysia
                    did none of that despite the available opportunities. It did the opposite
                    instead by buying shares of an illiquid counter at a time when trading volumes
                    were thin and within a short span of time close to the end of the trading day
                    (and year) by filling up the available sell orders.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_83"></a>83     Fifth, I observe the prices at which Pheim
                    Malaysia purchased the UET shares at the material period were not seen again for
                    the next six months. More significantly, on the first three trading days for
                    2005, UET’s share price fell to $0.415, $0.405 and $0.39, prices similar
                    to that before the material period. This suggested that the market also regarded
                    the spike in UET’s share price as an aberration. The defendants made much
                    about the fact that Pheim Malaysia had managed to average down through its UET
                    purchases at the relevant time, but the comparison with prices transacted more
                    than eight months was not, <em>per se</em>, probative of
                    genuine commercial demand for those shares.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_84"></a>84     In addition, the defendants had reasons for
                    raising and setting the price of UET shares, which was to enable certain funds
                    managed by the Pheim Group to outperform their respective benchmarks. I had
                    pointed out earlier at <a href="#p1_73">[73]</a> that the
                    monetary gains from such outperformance were not significant, but that was
                    beside the point. The defendants wanted to maintain their record of
                    outperforming their benchmarks over the past years, especially that of their key
                    fund which was featured in their promotional material. The gain that the
                    defendants sought was reputational, and not monetary, in nature. In any case,
                    the increase in UET’s share price caused Pheim Group’s funds to rise
                    by more than $1million over the short span of three days, and this would by no
                    means be an insignificant monetary gain, even if the money theoretically
                    belonged to the clients.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_85"></a>85     When all the above factors are considered
                    cumulatively, I am left with little doubt that the defendants’ primary
                    purpose behind the UET trades at the material time was to raise and set the UET
                    share price at the desired level, even taking into account the fact that more
                    cogent evidence was necessary to establish the serious charges levelled against
                    the defendants here. I would also note that Rule 13.8.2(4) of the SGX’s
                    Practice Note states that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">A fund manager’s quarterly performance will improve if the valuation
                        of his portfolio at the end of the quarter in question is higher. By placing
                        a large order to buy relatively illiquid shares, which are also components
                        of his portfolio, to be executed at or just before the close, his purpose
                        might be to distort the price in his favour.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_86"></a>86     I agree with the MAS that the facts of the
                    present case are on all fours with the example provided by the SGX in its
                    Practice Note. Mr Friets himself admitted during cross-examination that if
                    this SGX rule was applicable, the present facts would have raised concerns.
                    Similarly, in <em>Black on Market Manipulation</em>, the
                    learned author helpfully listed out some of the circumstantial indicators of a
                    manipulative intent, as follow (at p 997):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… consistent increases in a trader’s bid to acquire shares
                        from the previous sale price (“upticking”); <em>the making of purchases and sales at successfully higher prices
                            (“ramping”); allowing a trader to dominate the market and
                            artificially set market prices; and placing actual bids at or near the
                            close of trading, causing the stock to close at a higher price than the
                            previous sale price</em>. However, these factors do not
                        necessarily indicate a manipulative intention. For example, trading towards
                        the close of the trading day, which leads to an increase in the closing
                        prices of listed securities on market, may involve a manipulative intention.
                        Equally, that trading may involve legitimate purchases to top up
                        acquisitions made during the course of the day, after a buyer knows the
                        number of shares purchased in earlier transactions. It is more likely that
                        such trading is manipulative if it <em>occurs in small parcel
                            of shares</em>, or if the buyer <em>regularly
                            places orders late in the day</em> even if he or she does not have
                        unfilled earlier orders; and if the buyer <em>has a benefit
                            to be obtained</em> from a higher closing price…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[Emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_87"></a>87     The above factors also cast doubt on the
                    defendants’ contention that they purchased those UET shares because it was
                    undervalued. Even if the defendants regarded the UET shares as being
                    undervalued, they would have sought to purchase UET shares at the lowest
                    possible price. However, they failed to purchase UET shares at lower prices
                    before and after the material time. Instead, the Defendants adopted the strategy
                    of purchasing shares of an illiquid counter on the last three trading days of
                    the year and within the last half an hour of trading on each day, by lifting the
                    available sell orders, which served only to increase the cost of purchasing
                    those shares. Given how Dr Tan was in control of both Pheim Malaysia and
                    Pheim Singapore and was (as I have found) the person who gave Tang permission to
                    execute the trades at the material time, there was ample reason for Pheim
                    Malaysia to help Pheim Singapore in that sense. I therefore find that the
                    purpose of entering into the UET trades at the material time was solely or
                    primarily for the purpose of window dressing and was not the result of
                    legitimate commercial demand, as the defendants claimed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_88"></a>88     As a consequence, I find that both the
                    defendants entered into (or gave instructions to carry out) the UET trades with
                    the primary purpose of raising and then setting UET’s share price. As
                    such, MAS has succeeded in establishing its case based on the second limb to
                    s 197(1)(b) of the SFA.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The law on creating a false and misleading appearance or doing
                anything likely to create a false appearance</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_89"></a>89     Given my finding that the MAS has established
                    its case under the second limb to s 197(b) of the SFA, there is no need for
                    me to consider whether a false or misleading appearance was created or likely
                    created.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_90"></a>90     I should, however, point out that these two
                    limbs are not without their difficulties. Ostensibly, neither limb requires the
                    prosecution or the MAS to prove the offender’s <em>mens
                        rea</em>: see also Tjio, Principles and Practice of Securities
                    Regulation in Singapore (LexisNexis, 2004) at para 8.26 and <em>Securities Regulation in Australia and New Zealand</em>
                    (Walker gen ed) (LBC Information Services, 2<sup>nd</sup> Ed,
                    1998) at 532-533.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_91"></a>91     However, every transaction that takes place on
                    the market will inevitably have an impact on the price of the security traded:
                    see Huang, <em>Redefining market manipulation in Australia: The
                        role of an implied intention element</em> (2009) 27 CSLJ 8
                    at 16. As such, the fact that the trade has (or may have) a material effect on
                    the share price should not, on its own, render that trader liable to prosecution
                    under s 197 of the SFA. As A/Prof Loke observed in <em>The
                        investors’ protected interest against market manipulation in the
                        United Kingdom, Australia and Singapore</em> (2007)
                    21 AJCL 11 (“<em>Investors’ Protected
                        Interest against Market Manipulation</em>”) at 55:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Significant price movements resulting from one's trade may not support the
                        inference of a false market or a misleading price. Suppose CD Ltd purchases
                        a very large bloc of shares through a succession of orders. This necessarily
                        moves the prices upwards. <em>The trading, however, is not
                            necessarily manipulation -- for one may have very legitimate reasons for
                            making the purchase. One may be building up a beachhead by which to make
                            a takeover bid. Such stake-building prior to reaching the point where a
                            mandatory offer is triggered is very much a feature of the takeover
                            regimes in the United Kingdom, Australia and Singapore</em>. Thus,
                        unless there are good reasons for prohibiting all manners of stake-building,
                        anti-manipulation laws should not prevent such an activity.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[Emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_92"></a>92     I recognise that there may be a strong
                    argument in favour of looking beyond the effects of the trade and assessing the
                    trader’s intentions and motives in determining whether a false or
                    misleading appearance was created or likely to be created. To hold otherwise may
                    be detrimental to the efficient operation of the capital markets as it could
                    discourage traders from trading actively. As such, in Baxt on Securities Law,
                    the learned authors postulated that (at para 1407):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In order to determine whether s 1041B has been contravened, it will
                        be necessary to determine whether the appearance created by the relevant act
                        ... is false or misleading. For example, a sale of a large parcel of shares
                        over a short time may lead to a reduction in the price of securities
                        on-market, by satisfying demand for the securities at the then market price.
                        However, the mere fact that the sale gives rise to an appearance as to the
                        price of securities which differs from that which might exist in the absence
                        of that sale does not give rise to a contravention of s 1041B(1).
                        Equally, the fact that the price of securities may increase where an
                        on-market bidder is standing in the market to acquire securities does not
                        give rise to a contravention of s 1041B(1), even if the price of the
                        securities would have been lower had that bid not been made. On the other
                        hand, acquisitions of shares in a target company during a takeover bid are
                        likely to contravene s 1041B(1), if <em>the real
                            purpose</em> of the acquirer is to support the market price of
                        shares in the company so as to either frustrate the takeover bid or force
                        the bidder to increase its offer price. <em>A contravention
                            of s 1041B(1) would not be established merely because the sale or
                            purchase of financial products on a financial market leads to a change
                            in price at which those products are traded on that market, if the
                            trader’s purpose in undertaking that transaction is a legitimate
                            one</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[Emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_93"></a>93     However, such an approach would effectively
                    compress the three limbs in s 197(1) of the SFA into one limb, which is to
                    be assessed with reference to the intention or primary purpose behind the
                    transaction. It is not necessary for me to express a concluded view on this
                    topic, but I would align myself with A/Prof Loke’s views that (<em>Investors’ Protected Interest against Market
                        Manipulation</em> at pp 57-58):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It is certainly true that the statutory formulation admits of an objective
                        test that permits conviction based on conduct that is likely to create a
                        false or artificial market. None the less, the issue of whether a price is
                        artificial cannot be solely determined by the new equilibrium brought
                        about by one's orders. There must be something wrongful about these orders
                        that result in a false or artificial market. <em>At best, the
                            false or artificial market is linked to one's motivations for giving the
                            orders. The quality of the market -- whether it is false or artificial
                            -- is often informed by one's motivation</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[Emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion on s 197 of the SFA</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_94"></a>94     For all the reasons set out above, I find that
                    MAS has established its case on a balance of probabilities, that the defendants
                    had, by entering into the UET trades at the material time, intended to create a
                    false or misleading appearance to the market for and price of UET shares, under
                    s 197(1) of the SFA.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Payment of Civil Penalty</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_95"></a>95     Under s 232 of the SFA, both defendants
                    are liable to pay a civil penalty. As I mentioned earlier, MAS sought a
                    significant civil penalty amounting to $1m from each of the defendants,
                    primarily on grounds of deterrence, the seriousness, deliberateness and impact
                    of the breach and the conduct following the breach. On the other hand, the
                    defendants sought the minimum penalty, arguing that there was no major impact on
                    the market and the contravention was not the most severe. They highlighted that
                    Pheim Malaysia only earned $115 in additional management fees and that
                    Dr Tan did not make any profit or avoid any loss from the trades. The
                    penalty suggested by the MAS was disproportionate since Pheim Malaysia made an
                    annual profit of only $1.2m in 2004. The increase in value of the funds also did
                    not benefit the defendants as the money belonged to its clients.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_96"></a>96     Under s 232(3) of the SFA, if the court
                    is satisfied on a balance of probabilities that the person contravened a
                    provision [regarding market conduct] which did not result in his gaining a
                    profit or avoiding a loss, the minimum and maximum penalties that the court can
                    impose are $50,000 and $2m respectively. On the one hand, I accept that there is
                    a need for deterrence since such offences undermine the effectiveness and
                    efficiency of the securities market, and are often insidious and difficult to
                    detect. I also accept that the defendants’ conduct here was deliberate,
                    calculated and intentional. Although Dr Tan is an individual, his
                    involvement in the UET trades was significant as he was a key figure within the
                    Pheim Group and had given the orders to execute the trades at the relevant time.
                    However, the civil penalty to be imposed on the defendants cannot be
                    disproportionate. The financial advantages obtained by the defendants were not
                    significant. The adverse publicity and possible regulatory actions that the
                    defendants may face would also affect the defendants’ reputation as a fund
                    manager.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_97"></a>97     Taking all these factors into consideration, I
                    am of the view that a fine of $250,000 each for Pheim Malaysia and Dr Tan
                    would serve as a sufficient deterrence and be proportionate in the circumstances
                    and I so order.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_98"></a>98     I also award costs in favour of MAS to be
                    taxed on a standard basis unless otherwise agreed.</p>
