<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       At the conclusion of the trial of this action,
                    counsel for both parties requested time for written submissions to be exchanged
                    after the notes of evidence from the Digital Transcription System were ready.
                    The written submissions from both parties have since been exchanged. The last
                    set of submissions (the plaintiff’s reply) was received by the court on
                    14 June 2010.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       This case involves essentially two
                    issues:</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(a)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">The first issue is an action for the recovery of
                            money paid over a period of 6 years. Ms Stephanie Chee (“the
                            plaintiff”), claims that she lent more than $259,000 to the
                            defendant, Mr William Tan (“the defendant”), out of
                            goodwill, on the understanding that the money would be repaid once he
                            finished his studies. The defendant, on the other hand, claims that the
                            money was given to him as “love gifts” during the course
                            of their relationship and there was never any expectation that they were
                            to be repaid.</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(b)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">The second issue is in relation to two properties
                            purchased by the plaintiff in her name but financed partly by
                            contributions from the defendant. The two properties were sold before
                            the commencement of this action. There is a dispute between the parties
                            as to how the profits and losses from these two properties are to be
                            apportioned between them. In particular, the plaintiff is claiming an
                            indemnity from the defendant in respect of one property that resulted in
                            a net loss, while the defendant, apart from resisting that claim, has
                            put forth a counterclaim in respect of profits earned from the sale of
                            the other property. The resolution of this dispute depends entirely on
                            the terms in the investment agreement between the parties.
                            Unfortunately, there is little documentary evidence relating to this
                            agreement and much turns on the credibility of the parties, who advanced
                            contradictory stories of how they had originally agreed to apportion the
                            losses and profits from these two properties.</div>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Facts</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       The plaintiff and the defendant were introduced
                    to each other in 1999. At that time, the plaintiff, a single mother of three
                    daughters, was holding the position of General Manager of Parkway Healthcare
                    Foundation (“Parkway”). Parkway is a registered charity in
                    Singapore.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       The defendant is a wheelchair-bound paralympian
                    who has taken part in various marathons and races. He was involved in a number
                    of charity projects and is rather well known in Singapore. At the material time,
                    the defendant was a neuroscientist and a third year medical student at the
                    University of Newcastle in Australia.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       The plaintiff and the defendant had originally
                    met up in order to discuss the circumstances under which the defendant could
                    contribute to Parkway’s fund raising projects. However, they soon became
                    close personal friends as well. Throughout the course of their relationship, the
                    plaintiff made certain payments on behalf of the defendant in respect of various
                    expenses which the defendant had incurred. These included the defendant’s
                    car insurance, road tax as well as premiums on his life insurance. Apart from
                    paying the defendant’s expenses on his behalf, the plaintiff also made
                    direct payments to the defendant. This was done by way of monthly bank transfers
                    from the plaintiff to the defendant’s bank account, as well as through a
                    supplementary credit card which the plaintiff had given to the
                defendant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       The payments from the plaintiff to the defendant
                    (as well as payments made on his behalf) continued all the way until the end of
                    2005. On 22 January 2008, the plaintiff instructed her lawyers, Colin Ng
                    and Partners, to send a letter of demand to the defendant for repayment of a sum
                    of $433,383.18. The defendant’s reply to this letter was to the effect
                    that he did not know the basis upon which the plaintiff was making this demand.
                    No repayment was ever made by the defendant to the plaintiff.</p>

<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Money paid by the plaintiff to the defendant</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       The plaintiff claims that she disbursed the
                    following amounts by way of loans to the defendant over a period of 6 years from
                    2000 to 2005. The details regarding these payments are set out below:</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       These direct payments from the plaintiff to or
                    on behalf of the defendant amounted to $205,489.94. The defendant does not
                    dispute that he received these amounts from the plaintiff.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       According to the plaintiff, she made the direct
                    payments to or on behalf of the defendant on the understanding that the
                    defendant would return the money once he completed his medical studies at the
                    University of Newcastle. She was willing to do this because of the close
                    friendship which they shared and also because she believed that the defendant
                    would definitely pay her back. The defendant graduated from the University of
                    Newcastle in December 2004 and the date for repayment of the loans therefore
                    started from then.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     The defendant, on the other hand, claims that
                    the plaintiff gave him the various amounts of money as “love
                    gifts” because they were in an intimate relationship. In the alternative,
                    the defendant claims that the plaintiff waived any claim to repayment she might
                    have when she declined his offers to repay her on numerous
                occasions.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     On the totality of the evidence adduced, I am
                    unable to accept the defendant’s contention that the money which plaintiff
                    gave him were gifts. First, the evidence shows that the plaintiff did not
                    initiate any of the payments to the defendant. Rather, the defendant was always
                    the one who expressly requested the plaintiff to assist him financially. For
                    example, the supplementary credit card which the plaintiff gave to the defendant
                    was a result of a specific request by the defendant via email on 12 October
                    2000 (page 262 of the plaintiff’s affidavit of evidence in chief)
                    (“AEIC”). The email reads as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[I] need to have a visa card from Singapore but I do not qualify. [I]s
                        there any chance if you apply and put me as supplementary card holder and
                        [I] leave my cheque book with you signed beforehand to pay off my monthly
                        expenses. [I[ know you have a lot of commitments now and soon and [I] will
                        not impose further more as you are already HELPING ME SO MUCH SO
                        MUCH.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     In respect of the $1000 which the plaintiff
                    transferred to the defendant’s bank account every month, this was done in
                    response to a specific request by the defendant, as show by an email from the
                    defendant to the plaintiff on 6 August 2000. The email reads as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[I] am writing to you if there is a possibility if you could kindly
                        consider and lend me further with $1000 each month. I am so sorry for
                        bringing this up at all and have been thinking about it whether to mention
                        or not at all. [H]onestly [I] am so happy for your promotion and felt u
                            [<em>sic</em>] deserve it. [A]nd [I] know the extra
                        money should be for sustaining your own commitments.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     Apart from these emails, the plaintiff also
                    produced evidence of numerous other instances where the defendant requested the
                    plaintiff to make payment on his behalf or to transfer money to him directly.
                    The defendant has not challenged the authenticity of any of these
                emails.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     Second, every request made by the defendant to
                    the plaintiff was couched in the form of a request for a loan. The defendant
                    also made multiple representations that he would pay back whatever money the
                    plaintiff gave him upon the completion of his medical studies. This is amply
                    illustrated by the two emails cited above as well as a sampling of the emails
                    from the defendant to the plaintiff:</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(a)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">Email dated 12 December 1999</div>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">[I] will return you what [I] have borrowed when I finished my medical
                        studies.</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(b)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">Email dated 6 January 2000</div>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">[I] am also very grateful to you again that you are able to lend me and
                        putting some money in the bank</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(c)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">Email dated 14 January 2000</div>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">Many thanks for banking money for me, [I] am so very grateful. I will
                        repay you one day.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     The evidence shows that the defendant
                    expressly requested loans from the plaintiff on various occasions. The plaintiff
                    acceded to his requests but there is no evidence suggesting that she gave him
                    the money as gifts instead of loans. In all likelihood, the plaintiff, being
                    good friends with the defendant at the material time and aware of his financial
                    situation, simply agreed to lend the defendant money whenever he asked on the
                    understanding that he would pay her back once he completed his medical
                    studies.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     Faced with the formidable array of evidence
                    adduced by the plaintiff, the defendant chose to focus on his alternative case
                    theory that even if the money had not been originally given to him as gifts, the
                    plaintiff had waived all her rights to repayment by rejecting all his attempts
                    to repay her. The problem with this alternative line of defence is that the
                    defendant was unable to adduce any evidence to show that the plaintiff had
                    unequivocally rejected any attempt by the defendant to repay her. The defendant
                    tried to bridge the evidential gap by:</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(a)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">Alleging that the plaintiff had deliberately
                            concealed all evidence of her emails to the defendant showing that she
                            had rejected payment from him;</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(b)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">Alleging that the plaintiff had an intimate
                            relationship with the defendant and that it was only natural for her to
                            have orally waived repayment of the loans; and</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(c)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">Showing that the plaintiff had not made any
                            demand for the repayment of the money before she sent him the letter of
                            demand on 22 January 2008.</div>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     In my view, the defendant’s first
                    allegation about the plaintiff deliberately concealing all evidence of her
                    emails to the defendant in order to cover up the fact that she had rejected
                    attempts by the defendant to pay her has not been sufficiently proved. The point
                    about possible concealment of evidence was first put to the plaintiff on the
                    first day of cross examination (Notes of Evidence, day 1, page 11) and the
                    plaintiff’s reply was that she was using an email software that did not
                    save any outgoing emails. The plaintiff made reference to her affidavit filed on
                    21 December 2009 where she explained that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I confirm that I do not have any further emails or other correspondence
                        between myself and the Defendant that has not already been disclosed in my
                        List of Documents and Supplementary List of Documents. I did not keep the
                        emails that my daughters and I sent to the Defendant between 1999 and 2001.
                        At that time, I was using an email software called Eudore and the function
                        that I used to send emails did not automatically save the emails that my
                        daughters or I had sent. As such, none of my outgoing emails were saved and
                        I am not able to provide copies of these emails.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">As explained in paragraph 3 of my affidavit in chief, between 1999 and
                        2001, I had stored the Defendant’s emails that were sent to me on a 3
                        inch floppy disk with the emails downloaded from my computer at my office in
                        Parkway Healthcare Foundation. I subsequently transferred the data to a
                        thumb drive and finally to an external disk. From June 2001, due to a lack
                        of time, I stopped the practice and only printed out hard copies of the more
                        important documents.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     In response, counsel for the defendant
                    suggested to the plaintiff that in an ordinary email correspondence, the latest
                    email is usually accompanied by a continuous trail of all the previous emails in
                    the same thread. He produced seven emails from the defendant to the plaintiff in
                    the period 4 November 1999 to 16 November 1999 that were disclosed by
                    the plaintiff in her first List of Documents. These emails were accompanied by a
                    continuous trail of the preceding emails that were sent in the same thread,
                    including emails sent by the plaintiff to the defendant. The point made by
                    counsel for the defendant was that this showed that, contrary to the
                    plaintiff’s assertion, the email software that she used was capable of
                    capturing not just an individual email but also the entire email thread. The
                    implication was that the plaintiff had selectively disclosed only emails from
                    the defendant to her but had deliberately omitted all the emails she sent to
                    him.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     The plaintiff’s response to
                    counsel’s question was not entirely clear. However, I gathered from her
                    answer that what she meant was that the emails produced by her in the period
                    4 November 1999 to 16 November 1999 were not email threads but were
                    simply emails that she had manually copied and pasted onto a word document
                    (Notes of evidence, day 1, page 14)</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Your honour, when I first received his first email, page number 1,
                            4<sup>th</sup> November 1999, under the
                        defendant’s bundle of documents, right down on the
                            8<sup>th</sup> of November, there is a dotted line which
                        this email was exactly appeared and then, on the
                            8<sup>th</sup> of November when I replied, it is on
                        another day. So it’s not what we call train. It is being printed out
                        on hard copy, and because it was saved in a floppy, and if we go down to the
                        page number 2, there is this line drawn, which is during the manual copying,
                        it was drawn. So it is not what we call a “train”. And if you
                        would also realize, that when I write, my SingNet has a very broad spectrum
                        which is from margin to margin, whereas the defendant’s email to me is
                        – is on a very big margin on the right-hand side, and it is
                        consistently with big margin on the right-hand side…</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     In my judgment, the points raised by counsel
                    for the defendant are insufficient to show that the plaintiff deliberately
                    concealed emails from her to the defendant. If the defendant truly wanted to
                    discredit the plaintiff on this point, he should have produced some evidence
                    relating to the email program “Eudore” (which the plaintiff claims
                    she used) to show that it was actually capable of saving both outgoing and
                    incoming emails. As it is, the mere fact that the plaintiff saved some of her
                    initial emails to the defendant cannot raise any inference that she continued
                    this practice. Neither am I persuaded that the plaintiff deliberately concealed
                    evidence of her later emails to the defendant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     A large part of the defendant’s AEIC
                    dealt with the intimate relationship which he alleged he had with the plaintiff.
                    In a similar vein, counsel for the defendant spent a lot of time during the
                    trial and in his submissions trying to show that the plaintiff and the defendant
                    had an intimate relationship. This is important of course for setting the
                    context which would explain why the plaintiff was allegedly willing to make
                    gifts of money to the defendant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     In any case, viewing the evidence in totality,
                    I would hesitate to find that the plaintiff and the defendant actually had a
                    romantic relationship. Undoubtedly, the plaintiff used words of endearment such
                    as “dearest” and “darling” whenever she addressed
                    the defendant in their correspondence in the initial period of their
                    relationship. The defendant was also treated as a very close friend of the
                    family, as seen in the way he was invited for the plaintiff’s family
                    outings and his close interaction with the plaintiff’s children. In the
                    early days of their relationship, the plaintiff even encouraged her daughters to
                    treat the defendant as “daddy” by sending him a Father’s Day
                    card. I am therefore prepared to find that the plaintiff originally harboured
                    the hope of having a romantic relationship with the defendant. However, the
                    defendant was not receptive to the idea of having more than a platonic
                    relationship with the plaintiff and any romantic affection which the plaintiff
                    had for the defendant soon fizzled out after the plaintiff realized that the
                    defendant was not interested in being more than friends. This can be seen from
                    the emails sent by the defendant to the plaintiff. For example, in an email sent
                    by him to the plaintiff on 10 December 1999, he stated that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">U [<em>sic</em>] did ask me if I have intention to
                        settle down…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I am very touched by you but i am so sorry that i am still nursing the
                        wounds and am trying to get over the trauma. i am so sorry if i sound
                        disappointing to you. in fact, after going through this relationship, i felt
                        so disillusioned already.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">i felt friendship is better than BGR (boy-girl relationship). i would like
                        our friendship to last forever. i can still care for you and your kids and
                        grandkids – perhaps even better as friends.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     On 20 July 2000, the defendant sent an
                    email to the plaintiff’s daughters explaining to them that he and the
                    plaintiff were merely friends. The email read as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[B]ecause I am still hurt and sad, and also because of my studies i am not
                        wanting to have any relationship and i m not wanting to think about marriage
                            [<em>sic</em>]. i know you are worried that i will
                        marry your mummy. I know Marie will [feel] uncomfortable about it. From my
                        above explanation i hope you all are clear in your mind ok. You all are my
                        wonderful adopted daughters and princesses and angels. Your mummy and myself
                        are very good friends and we do not want anything to spoil this
                        friendship.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     On 15 November 2000, the defendant sent
                    an email to the plaintiff regarding a conference that they were scheduled to
                    attend in Indiana, USA. In that email, the defendant insisted on having separate
                    rooms for both parties. He stated:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[B]y the way, may i suggest to you that if this pall company is sponsoring
                        the ticket for one person with accommodation, then i suggest that we have
                        separate rooms because the rest of the delegates will start to have all the
                        ideas and gossips and it will jeopardise our reputation and future
                        career.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     Even in 2006, there was no indication that the
                    defendant was in a romantic relationship with the plaintiff. On 17 January
                    2006, the plaintiff wrote an email to the defendant offering him the use of the
                    broadband in her bedroom. Importantly, she indicated that she would move out of
                    the bedroom while the defendant was using it.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I have spoken to Suzie and she mentioned that you called her earlier and
                        that you have been informed that the broadband has been terminated. So sorry
                        for that. Please feel free to use our home broadband when you are back. Or,
                        if you wish, you can stay with us to use the broad band. I can always use
                        marie and sharon’s room if you need to use my bedroom when you are
                        home. We are one big family. We care for you and you have always been part
                        of our family</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     Further, in the defendant’s many emails
                    to the plaintiff, no words of endearment were used by him. The objective
                    evidence therefore contradicts the defendant’s assertion that he had an
                    intimate relationship with the plaintiff. Indeed, given the fact that both the
                    plaintiff and the defendant were not married at the material time, it would have
                    been unnecessary for the defendant to take measures to ensure that people did
                    not mistake them to be a couple. In any event, the existence of a romantic
                    relationship between the parties would not be sufficient in itself to prove that
                    the money handed over by the plaintiff to the defendant was meant as love gifts
                    or that the plaintiff has waived her right to repayment.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     The fact that the plaintiff did not make any
                    previous demand for repayment from the defendant immediately after his
                    graduation would not affect her right to make such a demand in 2008. Counsel for
                    the defendant did not seek to argue that the plaintiff’s failure to make a
                    timeous demand for repayment amounted to a waiver of her right to repayment. Of
                    course, the period of inaction on the plaintiff’s part would be a factor
                    to take into consideration when deciding whether or not the money from the
                    plaintiff to the defendant was meant to be gifts or loans.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     Finally, there was also a dispute about
                    whether the defendant had indeed left a signed chequebook with the plaintiff to
                    allow her to reimburse herself for the expenses incurred by the defendant
                    through the supplementary credit card provided to him by the plaintiff. The
                    defendant had, through an email to the plaintiff on 12 October 2000,
                    indicated to the plaintiff that he would leave a signed chequebook with her if
                    she was willing to apply for a supplementary credit card for him. Four months
                    later, on 15 March 2001, the defendant again made reference to the signed
                    chequebook when he requested the plaintiff to purchase a bank draft for him. The
                    defendant’s position is that these two emails showed that he had left the
                    chequebook with the plaintiff and the plaintiff chose not to reimburse herself
                    with his signed cheques.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     On the other hand, the plaintiff claims that
                    the defendant had not left any chequebook with her as he had promised. She
                    pointed to two emails sent to her by the defendant on 5 May 2001 and
                    2 June 2001 respectively, where the defendant requested financial favours
                    from the plaintiff and promised to pay her back. The plaintiff’s point is
                    that if the defendant had indeed left the signed chequebook with her, he would
                    simply have asked her to reimburse herself from the chequebook. There would be
                    no need for him to make a separate promise to pay her back.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     Even if the defendant had left a pre-signed
                    chequebook with the plaintiff, the plaintiff’s failure to reimburse
                    herself from those cheques would not necessarily amount to an unequivocal waiver
                    of her right to claim repayment for the expenses incurred by the defendant under
                    the supplementary credit card. On a balance of probabilities, it appears more
                    likely than not that the defendant did not leave any signed cheque book with the
                    plaintiff. Indeed, if the defendant did leave a signed chequebook with the
                    plaintiff for her to reimburse herself, that would strongly suggest that the
                    plaintiff did not intend to make any “love gifts” (at least where
                    the expenses incurred by the defendant through the supplementary credit card
                    were concerned) to the defendant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     In conclusion, I find that the various amounts
                    of money totalling $205,489.94 which the plaintiff paid to or on behalf of the
                    defendant from 2000 to 2005 were loans from the plaintiff to the defendant,
                    payable upon the defendant’s conclusion of his medical studies at the
                    University of Newcastle. There is no issue of any limitation period barring the
                    plaintiff’s claim because she commenced action less than six years after
                    the defendant graduated in December 2004.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Payments made on behalf of companies related to the
                defendant</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     In addition, the plaintiff claims that she
                    made payments to third parties on behalf of certain companies/organisations
                    (“the companies”) that were related to the defendant between 2003
                    and 2007. According to the plaintiff, she made these payments at the request of
                    the defendant and is therefore entitled to be reimbursed for these expenses. The
                    details of these payments are set out below:</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     The defendant asserts that these amounts were
                    owed by the companies in question and not by him. In my opinion, the plaintiff
                    is similarly entitled to be reimbursed for the payments she made to third
                    parties on behalf of the companies. Although the above payments were made by the
                    plaintiff on behalf of the companies, they were made at the defendant’s
                    behest and the defendant was effectively the <em>alter
                        ego</em> of the companies. The accounts for Wilcare as at 31 May 2004
                    reflected a debt of $43,198.84 owing from the company to the plaintiff. However,
                    this is an internal accounting matter within the control of the defendant as
                    director and shareholder. The plaintiff would not have made the payments on
                    behalf of the companies as there was no reason for her to. She had no interest
                    in the companies. She made the payments only because the defendant requested her
                    to and the defendant could hardly be said to have made the requests in his
                    capacity as an officer of the companies concerned. He approached her in the same
                    way and in the same capacity as all the other loans – as her erstwhile
                    good friend and confidant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     Although there may not have been specific
                    evidence that the defendant promised the plaintiff that he would reimburse her
                    for all the payments she made on behalf of these companies, this must be seen in
                    the context of the dealings at the material times between the parties. The
                    defendant was constantly asking the plaintiff for financial favours in all kinds
                    of matters and the plaintiff was actively obliging and helping him in his
                    financial matters, whether personal or corporate and whether the defendant was
                    in Singapore or abroad. To assert now that the payments made on behalf of the
                    companies were a distinct financial arrangement completely different from the
                    personal loans taken over the years would be, in my view, quite
                    dishonourable.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     Accordingly, the plaintiff is also entitled to
                    claim the amount of $54,328.84 from the defendant.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Second issue: The investment agreement between the parties</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     The second issue in this case concerns the
                    purchase of two properties in the plaintiff’s name with some financial
                    contribution from the defendant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     The first property was a condominium unit at
                    985 Bukit Timah Road, #05-11 Maplewoods Condominium, Bohemia Block, Singapore
                    589627 (“Maplewoods”). It was purchased by the plaintiff for
                    $1,225,000 in September 2001. There is no dispute that the defendant contributed
                    $279,917.80 towards the purchase.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     The second property was a unit at 1A One Tree
                    Hill, #04-08 One Tree Hill Lodge Singapore 248669 (“One Tree
                    Hill”). It was purchased by the plaintiff for $1,200,000 in May 2002.
                    There is no dispute that the defendant contributed $274,959.21 towards the
                    purchase.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     Both properties have since been sold by the
                    plaintiff but with different financial consequences. The sale of One Tree Hill
                    was done through an <em>en bloc</em> sale. It resulted in a
                    net loss, after taking into account the rental proceeds as well as expenses
                    incurred in its maintenance. On the other hand, a handsome profit was made from
                    the sale of Maplewoods by private treaty.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     The plaintiff’s claim against the
                    defendant is for an indemnity to cover the losses she suffered from the purchase
                    of One Tree Hill. Essentially, her story is that the defendant persuaded her to
                    purchase One Tree Hill to be held on trust for him. The defendant promised to
                    reimburse her for any losses she might suffer from this purchase. On
                    3 January 2006, the plaintiff returned to the defendant the sum of
                    $274,959.21, which was the amount he had given to her for the purchase of One
                    Tree Hill, in the belief that he would keep his word and reimburse her for the
                    losses she had suffered. Such reimbursement did not come and she was left with
                    no alternative but to sue for it.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     The defendant steadfastly denied the
                    plaintiff’s claim for an indemnity in respect of One Tree Hill. According
                    to him, there was an investment agreement between the plaintiff and him where he
                    was supposed to obtain loans from his friends to aid her purchase of One Tree
                    Hill. Under this agreement, the defendant’s role in the entire transaction
                    was akin to that of a lender who was entitled to the return of the amount he
                    contributed regardless of how the investment fared. In addition, half the profit
                    from the sale of the property (if any) was to be given to the defendant’s
                    friends in lieu of the interest on the loans.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     The defendant’s counterclaim against the
                    plaintiff is in relation to the profit made by the plaintiff in the sale of
                    Maplewoods. He claims that there was an investment agreement on substantially
                    the same terms as the one with regard to One Tree Hill, where the defendant
                    would procure loans to help the plaintiff with the purchase, while any profits
                    would be divided equally between the plaintiff and the defendant’s
                    friends. Since Maplewoods has already been sold, the defendant submits that the
                    plaintiff should abide by the agreement and return him both the principal sum of
                    the loan and half the amount of the profit.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     The plaintiff’s response to the
                    defendant’s counterclaim is that under the investment agreement, the
                    defendant is not entitled to the return of the $279,917.80 that he contributed
                    to the purchase of Maplewoods. In addition, the defendant is entitled to only
                    25% of the net profits when Maplewoods is sold.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The evidence</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     The most problematic aspect of this case is
                    that there was hardly any documentary evidence relating to the terms of the
                    investment agreement between the parties. There were only two documents adduced
                    before me. The first document is a letter dated 3 January 2006 from the
                    plaintiff to the defendant which reads as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Dear William</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Total Amount Payable to Australian Money Lender: Sing$274, 959.21</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Enclosed two cheques from Dr Chee Jok Heng Stephanie (OCBC No. 817351

                        sum of Sing$274,959.21 to be returned to the Australian person from whom
                        money was borrowed in April 2002 and May 2002 for the purchase of 1A One

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Thank you.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">This letter is of minimal significance because it is not disputed that
                    the plaintiff has already returned the amount of $274,959.21 to the defendant
                    (apparently for his onward transmission to the source of the funds, whose
                    identity the defendant said in court he had promised to keep
                    confidential).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     The second document is a note produced by the
                    plaintiff which is entitled “Loan Agreement for Purchase of
                    Condominium”. The document reads as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">1.    I, Stephanie Chee Jok Heng, NRIC: S1322571J of
                            Block 618, Ang Mo Kio Ave 4, #04-1057, Singapore 560618, hereby

                            410654.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">2.    I acknowledged the receipt of a total sum of money
                            Singapore Dollars two hundred, sixty-seven thousands and six hundred
                            sixty seven, and Cents eighty only (S$267,667.80) from William Tan Kian

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Dated: 7 October 2001    (Court’s note:

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Signed:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(Dr Stephanie Chee Jok Heng, Passport No./NRIC No. S1322571J)</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     According to the plaintiff, this second
                    document was produced by her with the defendant dictating its contents. She
                    asked the defendant to sign as well but he did not. The defendant asked her to
                    sign it to show the “Aussie friend” that she did receive the two
                    cheques. However, the defendant denies all knowledge of this document and claims
                    that it was backdated and generated by the plaintiff specifically for the
                    trial.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     In my judgment, no weight should be given to
                    the second document adduced by the plaintiff. The defendant has made it clear
                    that he contests the authenticity of the second document and the plaintiff has
                    not led any cogent evidence to prove its authenticity. In any event, this
                    document was not signed by the defendant and therefore cannot be used to prove
                    the terms of the investment agreement between the parties.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     With the second document produced by the
                    plaintiff having no evidential value, we are left only with the respective
                    testimonies of the parties. Unfortunately, I find the parties’ respective
                    versions of the investment agreement perplexing. The plaintiff’s story
                    about how the parties agreed that the defendant would only be entitled to 25% of
                    the net profit in relation to the sale of Maplewoods, while not being allowed to
                    recoup his principal, would militate against commonsense as the principal
                    involved is no mean sum. The defendant’s version of events, which is
                    essentially about how he is entitled to 50% of any profits from the sale of both
                    properties, while being insulated from all possible losses, equally does not
                    make much commercial sense for the plaintiff. She was practically goaded by the
                    defendant to purchase the properties in her sole name. She would have to
                    undertake 100% of the risks of any downside but have to share 50% of any profits
                    in exchange for a capital contribution of less than 25% of the purchase
                    price.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     The defendant and his financier (he claimed
                    the source of the funds was someone who trusts him and whose identity he had
                    promised to keep confidential) did not seem at all concerned that the cash
                    injection of more than a quarter million dollars was not protected or when any
                    returns would come. They also appeared not to be interested in the rental income
                    from the properties. In fact, the defendant said that he did not even know that
                    Maplewoods had been sold until after the plaintiff initiated legal
                    proceedings.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     The plaintiff’s and the
                    defendant’s versions of events share a common characteristic - they both
                    have the effect of forcing the counterparty to bear all losses on the
                    money-losing One Tree Hill while garnering as large as possible a share of the
                    profit from Maplewoods for themselves.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     Both parties agreed that the defendant was
                    primarily responsible for sourcing for the two properties and for suggesting
                    that the plaintiff purchase them. The plaintiff stated in her AEIC:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">51.    Following from the Defendant’s email dated 5
                            April 2001 in which he suggested buying a condominium for investment
                            purposes, the Defendant decided on a unit at Maplewoods Condominium in
                            Bukit Timah.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<u>One Tree Hill</u>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">56.    In early 2002, the Defendant was looking for a
                            private property that would go for an enbloc sale and wanted to invest
                            in it using my name as a proxy owner. He approached me and explained to
                            me about it.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     Apart from the active role which the defendant
                    played in sourcing for the two properties, he was also primarily responsible for
                    coming up with the 20% cash payment for the purchase price of both properties.
                    Taking into consideration the amount of effort put in by the defendant in
                    bringing about the investments, it is reasonable to believe that the parties
                    intended to share equally in whatever profits the investments may bring. The
                    plaintiff’s part was to be the legal owner on record and would be
                    responsible for all matters pertaining to the properties. I find it highly
                    unlikely that the plaintiff would agree to an investment agreement whereby the
                    defendant would be entitled to half the potential profits while being insulated
                    from all potential losses. The probability is that the parties agreed to share
                    the profits and losses from the purchase of the two properties in equal
                    proportions. I reject the plaintiff’s claim that the defendant is not
                    entitled to the return of the capital he put up for the purchase of Maplewoods.
                    That could only happen if the value of Maplewoods somehow dropped to
                    zero.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     Accordingly, I find that the terms of the
                    investment agreement between the parties are in all probability as
                    follow:</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(a)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">Each party is entitled to the return of the
                            amount of money he/she has contributed towards the purchase and
                            maintenance of the two properties; and</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(b)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">All profits and losses resulting from the
                            purchase and maintenance of the two properties are to be divided between
                            the parties equally.</div>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Calculation of money owed to the plaintiff in respect of One Tree
                Hill</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     The defendant contributed $274,959.21 towards
                    the purchase of One Tree Hill and this amount has since been returned to him by
                    the plaintiff. The only question left is the extent of the losses suffered by
                    the parties in respect of this investment.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     The plaintiff claims that the loss from One
                    Tree Hill amounted to $138,928.11. She reached this amount based on the

<p class="Judg-1">As can be seen, the defendant does not challenge the figures stated by
                    the plaintiff save for the audit fee which the plaintiff claimed she had
                    incurred.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     In her AEIC, the plaintiff produced a written
                    tabulation of the costs she had incurred in relation to One Tree Hill. Part C of
                    her tabulation includes a section entitled “Balance 10% of sale price
                    minus audit fee from Phang &amp; Co in Jan 06 (<em>ie</em>,
                    $127,333.33 – X)”. At page 2 of her tabulation, the plaintiff then
                    stated that the “Balance 10% of sale price minus audit fee etc from Phang
                    &amp; Co eventually was $53,101.81”. This means that the audit fee from
                    Phang &amp; Co, as claimed by the plaintiff, amounted to $74,
                231.52.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a>58     Counsel for the defendant correctly pointed
                    out that the plaintiff could not provide any evidence that she had indeed paid
                    $74,231.52 in audit fees to Phang &amp; Co. The completion accounts for the
                        <em>en bloc</em> sale of One Tree Hill showed clearly
                    that the auditing and accounting fees amounted to only $900. If this $900 fee is
                    divided equally among the owners of the 30 units in One Tree Hill, this would
                    work out to only $30 per unit.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a>59     The plaintiff was unable to respond to the
                    defendant’s point that her claim of $74, 231.52 for the payment of the
                    audit fee was widely off the fee of $30 per unit owner as stated in the
                    completion accounts. Accordingly, I find that the total loss suffered by the
                    parties for One Tree Hill was $64,873.46. Since the investment agreement between
                    the defendant and the plaintiff required the defendant to bear half the losses
                    suffered for One Tree Hill, the defendant is obliged to pay the plaintiff
                    $32,436.73 ($64,873.46 x 50%).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Calculation of money owed to the defendant in respect of Maplewoods </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a>60     It is common ground that the defendant
                    contributed $279,917.80 towards the purchase of Maplewoods and that the sale of
                    Maplewoods by the plaintiff resulted in a net profit of $377,061.98. The
                    defendant is entitled to half of this profit, which amounts to $188,530.99
                    ($377,061.98 x 50%).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a>61     Since the defendant is also entitled to the
                    return of his capital, the total amount due to the defendant from the sale of
                    Maplewoods is $468,448.79 ($188,530.99 + $279,917.80).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_62"></a>62     The plaintiff succeeds in her claim and is
                    entitled to be repaid the amounts of $205,489.94 and $54,328.84 which she loaned
                    to the defendant. She is further entitled to be paid $32,436.73 as the
                    defendant’s contribution for the loss suffered from the sale of One Tree
                    Hill. These three amounts add up to $292,255.51.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_63"></a>63     The defendant succeeds in his counterclaim and
                    is entitled to the return of his capital and his share of the profit in respect
                    of Maplewoods which (as shown at <a href="#p1_61">[61]</a> above)
                    works out to $468,448.79.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_64"></a>64     After setting off the respective amounts, the
                    defendant is entitled to a net payment of $176,193.28 ($468,448.79 -
                    $292,255.51).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_65"></a>65     Considering the issues at stake and as the
                    parties took about the same amount of time for their respective cases, I think a
                    fair order is that they bear their own costs for the claim and the counterclaim
                    respectively.</p>
