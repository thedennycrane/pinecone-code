        Raffles Town Club Pte Ltd ("the

defendants") was incorporated in 1996 for the purpose, inter alia, of setting up and

running a proprietary club in Singapore ("the Club"). The Club was to be erected

on a 30-year leasehold site at the junction of Dunearn Road and Whitley Road which has

been acquired from the Urban Redevelopment Authority ("URA") in May 1996. A

competition was held soon thereafter to select the architectural firm to be entrusted with

the design of the Club and the firm so selected submitted building plans for the Club to

the authorities. Provisional permission (with requirements) for the erection of the

clubhouse was obtained on 18 October 1996. The Club was to open in late 1998 but delays in

construction and in the obtaining of relevant approvals resulted in the Club opening its

doors in March 2000.</font>
<u xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">The drive for membership:

"founder" members</font></p></b></u>.

<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">2.        The

Club began its membership drive with a priority launch for "founder" members in

November 1996. A number of financial institutions participated in this launch. Letters of

invitation (dated 9 November 1996) were sent out by these institutions to selected

customers of theirs. Enclosed with the letter were a brochure on the Club ("the

Brochure"), a question and answer sheet ("Q&amp;A Sheet") and a

priority application form for "founder" membership ("application

form"). The memberships were all transferable memberships. The plaintiffs in their

pleadings and at the hearing referred to the invitation letter, the Brochure and the

Q&amp;A Sheet as the common law prospectus but conceded that they were not using that term

in any legal sense.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">3.        

There were slight variations in the format of the letters of invitation that were sent out

by the various institutions but in essence the letters stated that a limited number of

exclusive individual "founder" memberships were available at $28,000 to selected

customers. The ambience and facilities that would be available at the Club were described

in effusive and laudatory terms in these letters. The invitation letter sent out by the

United Overseas Bank, for instance, began by saying:</font>
</p><ol xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">"As your aspirations become

    reality, the desire for a place to pause and enjoy the rewards of your achievements

    becomes something of an aspiration in itself. UOB is proud to present you with an

    opportunity to actualize these aspirations for gracious living, with membership to a

    private city club without peer in terms of size, facilities, and sheer opulence – the

    Raffles Town Club."</font></p>
</blockquote>
</ol>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">And, after giving more details of

this special offer to the selected customer, ended by stating:</font></p>
<ol xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">"Raffles Town Club is

    dedicated to providing the ultimate lifestyle investment for you and your family. We

    invite you to join Singapore’s elite in a most distinguished setting."</font></p>
</blockquote>
</ol>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">The letter emphasised that

"founder" membership was available by invitation only and applications had to be

submitted by 30 November 1996.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">4.        The

Brochure, in keeping with the tone of its contents, was headed "A Treat For The

Elite". It began with a quotation from Shakespeare:</font>
</p><ol xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">"There is a tide in the

    affairs of men,</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">which, taken at the flood, leads

    on to fortune."</font></p>
</blockquote>
</ol>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">and declared to the invitee:</font></p>
<ol xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">"You are of the chosen few.

    The tide has risen, and you ride a wave of prominence. Indeed, now that you have evolved

    beyond a certain station in society, there is an exquisite reward awaiting you. It is

    called the Raffles Town Club."</font></p>
</blockquote>
</ol>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">The pages in the Brochure that

follow unabashedly extol the facilities, ambience and services that will be available at

the Club: "The Revival of a Venerable Lifestyle"; "The Epitome of Grace,

Achievement and Opulence"; "Exclusivity and Cultivation in an Age of

Sophistication" are the sort of sub-headings used to describe what was on offer at

the Club. And, as was to be expected from a club using such unabashedly extravagant

language to tout its virtues, the Brochure was a glossy publication resplendent with

colourful illustrations envisioning lavish facilities.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">5.        

There could be no doubt that what the Brochure was telling the invitees was that this was

going to be a premier and first-rate club for the exclusive enjoyment of the selected

elite in Singapore.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">6.        The

Q&amp;A Sheet also gave some pertinent assurances. There was an assurance, for instance,

that:</font>
</p><ol xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">"Common problems will be

    addressed, such as carparking, where members will have ample space to park with nearly 600

    lots. And by allocating much larger areas, traditional bottleneck facilities such as the

    gymnasium and coffeehouse will serve you smoothly even during peak periods."</font></p>
</blockquote>
</ol>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">and on the question of

transferability of membership, invitees were told that membership would, subject to the

Club’s approval, be transferable and that a transfer fee of 10% of the prevailing

entrance fee, set by the Club at $60,000 upon opening, will be applicable.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">7.        The

Q&amp;A Sheet posed and answered certain questions about the Club. This was also clearly a

document aimed at promoting sales. The last question and answer, for example, read:</font>
</p><ol xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Q. If I am not successful in this

    application, when can I re-apply for membership?</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">A. As only a limited number of

    memberships are available under this priority launch, we may not be able to accommodate

    all suitable applicants. We will however be conducting an initial public launch from 1<sup>st</sup>

    December 1996 for Individual Ordinary memberships at $40,000.</font></p>
</blockquote>
</ol>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">By asking that question and

giving that answer the promoters were insinuating that any invitee who did not

immediately apply for "founder" membership at $28,000 would lose out: if he

joined at a later date, he would have to pay the increased price of $40,000. Implicit in

this answer was, of course, the suggestion that anyone who bought a membership (which was

transferable) at $28,000 stood to make a good profit when the price went up.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">8.        The

application form, besides requiring the personal details of the applicant, contained a

number of declarations that the applicant was required to make. The first of these

declarations was the following:</font>
</p><ol xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">"I, the undersigned,

    undertake at all times to comply with and be bound by the rules and regulations as may be

    prescribed and/or varied from time to time by Raffles Town Club Limited (the

    ‘Proprietor’). I understand that the current rules and regulations as prescribed

    by the Proprietor may be viewed by me at the office of the Proprietor at 2 Nassim Road,

    Singapore 258370. I further understand that a copy of the same will be sent to me upon

    acceptance of my application."</font></p>
</blockquote>
</ol>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">I will not refer to the other

declarations as they were of no particular relevance in these proceedings.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">9.        Each

of the plaintiffs herein, upon receipt of the invitation, applied for membership by

submitting the duly completed application form to the defendants. It was not in dispute

that when the defendants accepted each of these applications the contract between that

applicant and the defendants came into being. It was also not disputed that the

declarations in the application form – and in particular the Rules and Regulations of

the Club ("the Rules") referred to in the very first declaration – was part

of that contract. The defendants contended that the declarations contained in the

application form constituted the entire contract with each of the plaintiffs. The

plaintiffs, however, contended that some of the representations in the Brochure and in the

Q&amp;A Sheet also constituted the contract. I will deal with these contentions in dealing

with the plaintiffs’ claims in contract.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">10.        The

priority launch for "founder" members met with considerable success and 18,992

persons who applied for membership were admitted as "founder" members.

Subsequently (ie after the closing date for the priority launch), an additional 56 persons

were admitted as "ordinary" members of the Club at the increased fee of $40,000

each. The plaintiffs in this case (all 4,895 of them) were from the group of 18,992

"founder" members.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">11.        It

would appear that the general membership of the Club did not, at that time, know that the

total number of "founder" members exceeded 18,000. This fact became publicly

known only in late March 2001 as a result of disclosures made in court at the hearing

of Suit No. 742/2000 in which Peter Lim (one of the original shareholders of the

defendants) sued the other shareholders (Lawrence Ang, William Tan and Dennis Foo) as a

result of certain disputes amongst them. These disputes were eventually settled

out-of-court on confidential terms sealed by the court.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">12.        In

July 2001, the original shareholders sold their entire interest in the defendants to two

new investors: Lin Jian Wei and Margaret Tung. At the time the new shareholders assumed

control, some $501.5 million of the $515 million collected as entrance fees had been spent

leaving the defendants with a cash balance of only about $13.5 million. The financial

viability of the defendants when the new shareholders took over was therefore dependent

largely on the monthly subscription from members and the profits that the defendants could

make from the food and beverage and other services provided at the Club.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">13.        On

15 November 2001, the ten named plaintiffs herein commenced this representative action

– on behalf of themselves and the 4,885 other "founder" members of the Club

– against the defendants for alleged misrepresentation/breach of contract. The remedy

they sought was the rescission of their membership contracts or damages in lieu thereof on

the grounds of misrepresentation. Alternatively, they sought damages for breach of

contract. I will deal first with the claim based on misrepresentation.</font></p>
<u xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">The tort of misrepresentation</font></p></b></u>.

<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">14.        The

representations relied on by the plaintiffs for their claim in misrepresentations were

pleaded in paragraph 9(a) to (g) of the Amended Statement of Claim. I will set these

claims out in full:</font>
</p><ol xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">"9. The prospectus

    contained, <i>inter alia</i>, the following highlights either by express representations

    or by way of necessary implications:</font></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">a. It was planned that the Club

      would have nearly 600 car park lots for the use of the members.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">b. ‘Raffles Town Club

      members will enjoy unparalleled privileges and facilities’.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">c. ‘The Club’s

      exclusive and limited memberships will be fully transferable’.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">d. The Club would be constructed

      to have a total built-up area in excess of 400,000 sq. ft. catering for the ‘business

      entertainment, networking, socializing, personal and family leisure requirements’ of

      each successful subscription for the duration of the membership. The Club would have

      ‘separate formal, casual, sporting, children’s and family facilities’

      for the successful subscribers.</font></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">e. A supplementary card would be

      issued to the spouse or fiance of the member allowing full membership privileges and

      benefits at no additional cost. This was intended to convey the meaning and message that

      each subscriber would receive two licences for the price of one.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">f. The Club would be

      ‘without peer in terms of size, facilities and sheer opulence’.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">g. There would be two classes of

      individual members:</font></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">i. first, a limited number of

        exclusive transferable founder members at S$28,000 (exclusive of GST) available to the

        credit-card holding customers on a first-come-first-served basis. This class of

        founder members would be selected from those who submitted their applications not later

        than 30 November 1996. Based on ‘priority applications’, this class of

        members were called ‘founder members’; and</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">ii. the second class of members

        would be selected from those not selected from the priority applications and from fresh

        applications submitted in response to a public launch to be made after 30 November 1996.

        The allotment price for this class of members was to be S$40,000. This class of members

        will hereafter be called ‘second class members’ ".</font></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</ol>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">It is to be noted that nowhere in

the Amended Statement of Claim was it averred that these representations (or any or

more of them) were – at the time they were made/acted upon – false or

untrue.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">15.        It

was alleged, in paragraph 10 of the Amended Statement of Claim, that:</font>
</p><ol xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">"10. The Plaintiffs and

    other members of the Class understood the representations to mean that they would be

    joining an exclusive and premier club, that the total number of members at any given time

    would be limited such that at any given time no member and the supplementary card-holder

    would be shut out from or be unable to use the facilities of the Club, including the car

    parks in the manner or up to the standard as represented in the prospectus.

    Such limitation was also to be inferred from the holding-out and the representations

    (a) that the Club would be ‘without peer in terms of size, facilities and sheer

    opulence’, (b) that there would be a ‘limited number of exclusive individual

    founder member memberships’ and (c) as to the number of car park lots and the total

    built-up area. Further, the representations were to be understood, implied or inferred in

    the light of the provisions of the Building Control Act, the regulations made thereunder

    as construed and applied by the consultant architects engaged by the Defendant for the

    construction of the Club."</font></p>
</blockquote>
</ol>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">The thrust of paragraph 10

appears to be directed not at the state of mind of the defendants but the state of mind of

the plaintiffs, namely, what the plaintiffs’ understanding of the representations

was. Even if paragraph 10, by virtue of the second half thereof, is read as providing

particulars of additional representations relied upon, it was not alleged in paragraph 9

or paragraph 10 or anywhere else in the pleadings that the defendants made these

representations knowing that these representations were false.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">16.        The

falsity of the representation was adverted to only once in the pleadings. This was in

paragraph 13 of the Amended Statement of Claim:</font>
</p><ol xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">"13. The representations as

    set out above turned out to be untrue, false and misleading.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<b><p align="center"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Particulars</font></p>
</b><blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">a. The Club in fact accepted

    19,000 members each of whom had paid S$28,000. The acceptance was communicated by the

    Defendant to the successful applicants in December 1996. There was no public launch of

    $40,000 for the second class members.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">b. The Club was opened in March

    2000 and not end of 1998 as promised and was woefully inadequate shockingly short of the

    representations to cater for and accommodate the huge number of members and the

    supplementary card-holders.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">c. Not all facilities stated in

    the prospectus were available to the members.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">d. The Defendant dreadfully

    failed to realise the representations set out above with the result that the Plaintiffs

    and the other members of the Class were unable to realise the aspirations and

    representations conveyed by the prospectus.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">e. The membership became

    virtually useless."</font></p>
</blockquote>
</ol>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">But, as can be seen, even in

paragraph 13 it was not alleged that the representations were false or untrue at the time

they were made. All that paragraph 13 averred was that the representations "turned

out" to be untrue, etc. The state of mind of the promoters of the Club when the

impugned representations were made was not put into issue by the plaintiffs.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">17.        It

would be relevant to note here that Ms Molly Lim SC, who appeared for the plaintiffs,

confirmed, in the course of the proceedings that:</font>
</p><ol xmlns="">

<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">(2) the plaintiffs had no

<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">(3) the plaintiffs were not

    complaining of the quality (as opposed to the quantity) of the membership;</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">(4) the plaintiffs were not

Shanmugam SC, who appeared for the defendants, also drew my attention to the fact that

– in dismissing an appeal in these proceedings in respect of an interlocutory order

relating to discovery of documents – Chao Hick Tin JA delivering the judgment of the

Court of Appeal (reported in <nobr>[2002] 3 SLR 345</nobr>) said at page 352:</font>
</p><ol xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">"21. It is vitally important

    to bear in mind that the action is for the non-fulfilment of ‘representations’

    and/or for breach of contract. <i>There is no allegation of fraud. Nor is it alleged that

    RTC made the representations knowing that they were false, or with no intention of

    fulfilling the same</i>. Fraud must be expressly pleaded with particulars. Thus, what was

    RTC’s decision on the number of people to accept as founder members under the fee of

    $28,000 and as second class members under the fee of $40,000 and what was the actual

    number of applications received by 30 November 1996 were wholly irrelevant to the issues

    in the action. It was not alleged that the information in any of these three categories of

    documents were made known or conveyed to any of the plaintiffs. They knew nothing of these

    documents. The documents never formed the basis upon which RTC sought to attract the

    plaintiffs to join as members. Whatever representations made by RTC to the plaintiffs were

    exclusively in the three documents and nothing else. The information contained in the

    documents to be discovered under items 1, 2 and 3 played no part in the plaintiffs’

    appreciation of what RTC was trying to convey in the prospectus.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">22. So what representations RTC

    did make to the plaintiffs must be gleaned from the prospectus and nothing else. And

    having established those representations, the plaintiffs must show, inter alia, that what

    RTC have in fact provided in the Club premises, applying objective standards, do not match

    the representations. The detailed drawings on the design of the Club’s premises have

    already been furnished to the plaintiffs pursuant to the order of the Assistant Registrar.

    <i>What was in the mind of the promoters behind RTC is not an issue in the action</i>. We

    would reiterate that there is no allegation of fraud. The discovery sought was mere

    fishing. The documents are not necessary for disposing fairly of the action.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">23. As for the alternative claim

    based on breach of contract, here again the plaintiffs must first establish what

    representations did RTC make in the prospectus. Second, plaintiffs must show that the

    representations had become terms of the contract. Third, the plaintiffs must establish a

    breach of those terms. Again for the same reasons above, the documents requested are

    wholly irrelevant."</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">(Emphasis added.)</font></p>
</blockquote>
</ol>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">That ruling by the Court of

Appeal, Mr Shanmugam submitted, underlined the fact that the plaintiffs’ case did not

involve any averment about the state of mind of the defendants.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">19.        The

plaintiffs’ case on misrepresentation was simply that the facilities and the services

at the Club, when it was built and became operational in 2000, did not match the

descriptions given in 1996 when the membership contract was entered into. There was no

allegation in the pleadings that when the said representations were made in 1996 the

defendants knew or should have known that those representations were not true and so

misrepresented their intentions to the plaintiffs. As noted above, all that the

plaintiffs in effect pleaded was that the representations made in 1996 "turned

out", when the Club became operational in 2000, to be untrue, false and misleading.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">20.        Mr

Shanmugam submitted that in the absence of the state of mind of the defendants, at the

time the impugned representations were made or acted upon, being an issue, the

representations relied on by the plaintiffs were not actionable representations and,

accordingly, the plaintiffs’ claim based on those representations ought to fail in

limine. He submitted that even if the allegation that the Club, when built, did not match

up to what had been represented in 1996 was true – an allegation strenuously denied

by the defendants – those representations would still not amount to actionable

representations unless the plaintiffs had pleaded that the defendants at the time they

made the representations had no intention of fulfilling those representations.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">21.        Mr

Shanmugam submitted, in the alternative, that the representations made in 1996 set out in

paragraph 9 of the Amended Statement of Claim were no more than advertising and

promotional puff which cannot give rise to any cause of action either in misrepresentation

or in contract.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">22.        The

term "representation" and what constitutes an "actionable

representation" or an "operative misrepresentation" is discussed in all

text books on the law of contract. "<i>Anson’s Law of Contract</i>" (1998)

(27<sup>th</sup> Ed at page 233) summarises the position succinctly as follows:</font>
</p><ol xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">"An operative

    misrepresentation consists in <i>a false statement of existing or past fact</i> made by

    one party (the ‘misrepresentor’) before or at the time of making the

    contract, which is addressed to the other party (the ‘misrepresentee’) and

    which induces the other party to enter into the contract."</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">(Emphasis added.)</font></p>
</blockquote>
</ol>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">"<i>Chitty on Contracts</i>"

(26<sup>th</sup> Ed) takes a similar position. The learned authors, at paragraph 414,

state:</font></p>
<ol xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">"The traditional rule is

    that <i>a representation must be a statement of fact, past or present, as distinct from a

    statement of opinion, or of intention, or of law</i>. A mere statement of opinion, which

    proves to have been unfounded, will not be treated as a misrepresentation, nor will a

    simple statement of intention which is not put into effect; for as a general rule these

    cannot be regarded as representations of fact, except in so far as they show that the

    opinion or intention is held by the person expressing it. <i>However, in certain

    circumstances a statement of opinion or of intention may be regarded as a statement of

    fact</i>, and therefore as a ground for avoiding a contract if the statement is false. <i>Thus,

    if it can be proved that the person who expressed the opinion did not hold it, or could

    not, as a reasonable man having his knowledge of the facts, honestly have held it, the

    statement may be regarded as a statement of fact</i>. So where, at a sale of property, the

    vendor described the occupier as ‘a most desirable tenant’, while in fact he

    knew that the rent was considerably in arrear, this was held to entitle the purchaser to

    rescind the contract."</font></p>

<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">(Emphasis added.)</font></p>
</blockquote>
</ol>
<i xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Chitty</font></p></i>, in the above

paragraph, considers the circumstances in which a statement of opinion and a promise to do

something at a future date can constitute the tort of misrepresentation. It will be noted

that where a representation does not relate to an existing or past fact but is an

expression of opinion or intention, the representation can still be actionable if the

representee establishes that the representor, at the time of the representation, did not

or could not have had that opinion or intention.

<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">23.        In

the case of <i>Bestland Development Pte Ltd v Thasin Development Pte Ltd</i> (unreported,

13 February 1991), Chao Hick Tin J (as he then was) cited with approval the paragraph from

Chitty quoted above and went on to say:</font>
</p><ol xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">"The first question to

    determine is, are the alleged statements representations? <i>To constitute a

    representation, a statement must relate to a matter of fact</i>. It must be a matter of

    present or past fact: see 31 Halsbury’s Law (4<sup>th</sup> Edition) para 1005. A

    distinction ought to be drawn between a representation of an existing fact and a promise

    to do something in the future. Furthermore, mere praise by a man of his own goods or

    undertaking is a matter of <i>puffing and pushing</i> and does not amount to

    representation. However, a statement of opinion may in certain circumstances involve a

    statement of fact. This was explained by Bowen LJ in <i>Smith v Land and House Property

    Corporation</i> (1885) 28 Ch.D 7 at 15 as follows:-</font></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">‘… it is often

      fallaciously assumed that a statement of opinion cannot involve the statement of a fact.

      In a case when the facts are equally well known to both parties, what one of them says to

      the other is frequently nothing but an expression of opinion. The statement of such

      opinion is in a sense a statement of fact, about the condition of the man’s own mind,

      but only of an irrelevant fact, for it is of no consequence what the opinion is<i>. But if

      the facts are not equally known to both sides, then a statement of opinion by the one who

      knows the facts best involves very often a statement of a material fact, for he impliedly

      states that he knows facts which justify his opinion</i>."</font></p>

</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">(Emphasis added.)</font></p>
</blockquote>
</ol>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">I will revert to the question of

"puffing and pushing" referred to by Chao J later in this judgment.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">24.        At

the time that the Brochure and the other documents containing the impugned representations

were sent to the invitees, only provisional building permission (with requirements) had

been obtained from the URA and construction of the Club had barely begun.

The representations impugned by the plaintiffs in paragraph 9 of the Amended

Statement of Claim relate therefore to what the Club was expected to be like when

completed. Those representations were therefore not statements of past or present fact but

statements of intention or (perhaps) opinion.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">25.        

Representations of intention can be actionable if it can be shown that the defendants made

those representations without having any intention of complying with those

representations. If that was the plaintiffs’ case, then the court would embark on the

exercise of determining the state of mind of the defendants at the time the

representations were made. That, however, was not the plaintiffs’ case. The

plaintiffs did not, either in the pleadings or in the course of the hearing, seek to put

in issue the state of the defendants’ mind at the relevant time. To the contrary, the

plaintiffs’ position was that the state of the plaintiffs’ mind was irrelevant

to their claim on misrepresentation.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">26.        In

this connection, Ms Lim submitted that there was no rule of law or equity that statements

of intention or promises by a representor can never amount to a "representation"

capable of giving rise to a claim for misrepresentation. In support, she relied on a

number of cases where statements of intention had given rise to actionable

misrepresentation. In particular, she quoted the paragraph from the judgment of Chao J

in <i>Bestland Development</i> (quoted above). I would have no difficulty accepting

Ms Lim’s submission if the plaintiffs had pleaded that the defendants, at the time

they made the statements in question, knew or ought to have known that the statements were

false. But that was not the plaintiffs’ case. Their case was that the representations

(enumerated in paragraphs 9 and 10 of the Amended Statement of Claim) "turned

out" to be false.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">27.        It

was the plaintiffs’ case that there was no need for them to concern themselves with

or prove the state of mind of the defendants at the time the representations were made

since the relief the plaintiffs were seeking was under s 2(1) of the Misrepresentation

Act, Ch 390. That section read as follows:</font>
</p><ol xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">"2(1) Where a person has

    entered into a contract <i>after a misrepresentation has been made to him by another party</i>

    thereto and as a result thereof he has suffered loss, then, if the person making the

    misrepresentation would be liable to damages in respect thereof had the misrepresentation

    been made fraudulently, that person shall be so liable <i>notwithstanding that the

    misrepresentation was not made fraudulently</i>, unless he proves that he had reasonable

    ground to believe and did believe up to the time the contract was made that the facts

    represented were true."</font></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">(Emphasis added.)</font></p>
</blockquote>
</ol>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Ms Lim submitted that there was

no requirement under s 2(1) of the Misrepresentation Act to plead the representor’s

state of mind and that to succeed under s 2(1) the plaintiffs need only prove the

representations made, the falsity of those representations and the loss suffered.

The falsity of the representations, Ms Lim submitted, was established by the evidence

adduced by the plaintiffs that the Club by reason of having accepted an excessive number

of members was unable to serve its members to the standards of a premier club that had

been promised in the promotional material.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">28.        In

support of her submissions, Ms Lim referred the court to a specimen pleading under the

Misrepresentation Act given in Bullen &amp; Leake "<i>Precedents of Pleadings</i>"

(14<sup>th</sup> Ed) Vol. 2 at 817. No other authority was cited by Ms Lim. In that

specimen, after the representations that induced the plaintiffs to enter into the contract

had been set out, there was a specific plea that each of those representations was in fact

false and particulars were given as to why it was alleged that those representations were

false. The representations set down in that specimen, I would also note, were

representations of existing facts. The specimen precedent was therefore of no

assistance to the plaintiffs in this case.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">29.        Mr

Shanmugam, in his response, submitted that whatever other changes the Misrepresentation

Act may have brought about to the law, it did not effect any change on the question of

what sort of representations were actionable. In support, he cited an article jointly

authored by Atiyah and Treitel entitled "<i>Misrepresentation Act 1967</i>", 30

(MLR) 369 where the learned authors in dealing with identical provisions in the English

Act, state:</font>
</p><ol xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">"<i>The Act leaves many

    important points to be decided in accordance with the old law. Thus the definition of

    puffs, representations of law and representations as to the future</i>."</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">(Emphasis added.)</font></p>
</blockquote>
</ol>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Mr Shanmugam also drew the

court’s attention to the recent case of <i>Spice Girls Ltd </i>("SGL")<i> v

Aprilia World Service BV</i> (‘AWS’), [2002] EWCA Civ 15, where at paragraph 12

Sir Andrew Morritt V-C, after setting out s 2(1) of the Misrepresentation Act 1967,

observed:</font></p>
<ol xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">"Thus liability depends on

    four elements: (a) a misrepresentation made by one person to another, (b) a

    subsequent contract between them, (c) consequential loss and (d) <i>an absence, at the

    time the contract was made, of a belief or reasonable grounds therefor in the truth of the

    facts represented</i>. If all those conditions are satisfied then the representor is

    liable to the representee for such damages as would be payable if the misrepresentation

    had been made fraudulently."</font></p>
</blockquote>
</ol>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Those observations, Mr Shanmugam

submitted, do not reflect the far-reaching changes to the law of misrepresentation that Ms

Lim claimed had been effected by the Misrepresentation Act.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">30.        In

the <i>Spice Girls</i> case the agent of SGL had sent a fax to AWS shortly before the

Agreement was entered into confirming the commitment of each of the five Spice Girls to

future implementation of the project. At that time, one of the five Spice Girls, Ms Geri

Halliwell, had told the other Spice Girls that she would soon be leaving the group. In

dealing with the effect of the representation contained in the fax the court said:</font>
</p><ol xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">"We consider that the fax of

    30 March 1998 contained express representations by SGL as to the commitment of each of the

    Spice Girls to the future implementation of all the terms of the heads of agreement as

    subsequently incorporated into the formal agreement to be concluded between SGL and

    Aprilia. That statement was untrue because SGL knew that the term of the agreement for

    which provision was made in the heads of agreement was 12 months and that there was a risk

    that Ms Halliwell would leave after only six of them. … The unqualified assurance as

    to the commitment of each Spice Girl to the entire commercial sponsorship described in the

    heads of agreement contained within it the <i>implied representation that SGL did not know

    of any matter which might falsify the assurance. That was a representation of fact and it

    was false</i>."</font></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">(Emphasis added.)</font></p>
</blockquote>
</ol>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">It is relevant to note that in

the <i>Spice Girls</i> case, AWS had specifically pleaded that the fax contained an

express or implied representation that SGL was unaware of any matter which might give AWS

reason to believe that the Spice Girls might cease to consist of all five members during

the minimum term of the Agreement. There was no similar plea relating to the state of mind

of the defendants in our present case.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">31.        I

accept Mr Shanmugam’s submission that the Misrepresentation Act did not effect any

material change to the common law concept of misrepresentation: mere puffs,

representations of law and representations as to the future all continued to be excluded

from the ambit of that tort even after the said Act came into effect. The law continued to

be that a representation as to future conduct did not, by its very nature, constitute a

misrepresentation unless, implied therein, was a representation of present or past facts

which was untrue. There was no allegation in these proceedings of any such implied

representation.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">32.        I

am satisfied that the representations in the Brochure and Q&amp;A Sheet impugned by the

plaintiffs were, in the context of the pleadings and the evidence in this case, not

actionable representations for the purposes of the tort of misrepresentation. The

plaintiffs’ claim based on misrepresentation therefore fails.</font></p>
<u xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Salesmen’s puff</font></p></b></u>.

<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">33.        

Eulogistic commendation by a salesman of the wares that he touts is a common and expected

feature of the market place. Courts are therefore reluctant to rescind contracts of sale

merely on account of the exuberant and exaggerated language employed by salesmen.

This reluctance is reflected in the maxim "Caveat Emptor" or

"Buyer Beware". When Chao Hick Tin J in <i>Bestland Development</i> (quoted

above) described praise by a salesman promoting his goods as "a matter of puffing and

pushing" that did not amount to misrepresentation, Chao J was recognising this maxim.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">34.        Mr

Shanmugam sought to persuade the court that the grandiloquent claims (not his words)

contained in the Brochure should be recognised for what they truly were – ie

salesmen’s puff – and should not form the foundation for an action either in

misrepresentation or in contract. I need not consider this submission in respect of the

claim in misrepresentation as I have already dismissed that claim on the grounds that the

impugned representations were not of a nature that was actionable. The submission,

however, remains relevant in considering the claim in contract. There is a distinction

between promotional statements that are mere puff and promotional statements that are

outside the ambit of mere puff. Certain statements – although clearly promotional in

nature – may, individually or taken together, amount to a binding promise that is

part of the contract between the parties. Such statements would not be mere puff.</font></p>
<u xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">The claim in contract</font></p></b></u>.

<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">35.        As

noted in paragraph 9 above, it was not in dispute that the declarations contained in the

application form – in particular, the declaration that applicant would abide by

the Rules – became, upon acceptance of the application, contractually binding between

that applicant and the defendants. What was in dispute was whether that was the entire

contract between the parties or whether some or all of the impugned representations also

constituted terms of that contract.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">36.        Ms

Lim submitted that, if it was the intention of the defendants that the terms in the

application form were to be the entire contract, the defendants could and should have so

stipulated in the application form. The absence of such a stipulation, Ms Lim submitted,

prevented the defendants from alleging that other terms could not be implied. I cannot

accept that submission. In my view, all that the absence of such a stipulation meant was

that it made it easier for the plaintiffs to argue that the contract between the parties

was not confined to the declarations in the application form.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">37.        

Although the defendants’ case was that the declarations contained in the application

form constituted the entire contract between the successful applicant and the defendants,

I will in this judgment where appropriate treat the defendants’ case as being that

the Rules constituted the entire contract between the parties. I do this because for the

purpose of this case, except for the declaration referring to the Rules, all the other

declarations are of no particular significance.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">38.        Ms

Lim submitted that if the representations in the Brochure and other documents were not

given legal effect, the defendants could, with impunity, ignore all those representations

and – except where those representations were actionable for the purposes of the tort

of misrepresentation – provide facilities and a level of services and ambience far

inferior to and/or very different from what the defendants had been promised in the

promotional material. She submitted that as the Rules did not spell out the facilities the

defendants were obliged to provide, the defendants could, for example, provide car parking

space for (say) 100 cars when 600 spaces had been promised or provide a small wading pool

when a large pool had been promised. In this context, Ms Lim pointed out that the

Court of Appeal, in its interlocutory judgment, had alluded to certain of the impugned

representations as being specific indications of what members could expect from the Club.

This was at page 348 of the report where the Court of Appeal said:</font>
</p><ol xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">"3. … The action is

    based on a common law prospectus issued by RTC when inviting members of the public to join

    the club. The prospectus comprised the following documents:</font></p>

<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">(2) a brochure;</font></p>

    information in the form of questions and answers.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">4. The prospectus promised

    ‘lavish reception and facilities’ and that the club would be ‘without peer

    in terms of size, facilities and sheer opulence’. <i>It also gave, inter alia,

    the following specific indications as to what members could expect</i>:</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">(1) there would be about 600 car

    parking lots for members;</font></p>

    be in excess of 400,000 sq ft."</font></p>

</blockquote>
</ol>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">She submitted that specific

indications given by the defendants in the promotional material ought to be given legal

effect.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">39.        Ms

Lim submitted that if the court gave no contractual effect to such promises, the

plaintiffs would have no recourse against the defendants even for the most cynical

disregard by the defendants of such representations/promises. That submission is not quite

correct. There would be recourse in the tort of misrepresentation. But, as discussed

earlier, to succeed in misrepresentation the plaintiff would have to show that the

representations were false at the time they were made in that the representor had no

intention of fulfilling that representation. In the present case, the plaintiffs’

claim under misrepresentation failed because the plaintiffs not only did not seek to

allege that the representations were false when they were made but took the position that

the state of mind of the representor was irrelevant.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">40.        The

Rules did not specify any limit to the number of members that the defendants could admit

and it gave full authority to the defendants to determine, from time to time, the entrance

fee payable. Unless constrained by the court, Ms Lim submitted, the defendants could flood

the Club by issuing many more thousands of memberships (even at reduced prices) and make

the demand on space at the Club so tight, that the claims in the promotional literature

that this was to be a premier club without peer in Singapore, would be sheer mockery.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">41.        The

Rules granted members a licence to use and enjoy the facilities at the Club up to October

2026 but the Rules did not define what those facilities would be. Instead, the Rules

merely stated:</font>
</p><ol xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">"2. It is the intention of

    the Proprietor to provide for the use and enjoyment by the Members of facilities (the

    ‘Facilities’) for recreation, entertainment, dining and/or such other activities

    as the Proprietor may from time to time in its absolute discretion decide."</font></p>
</blockquote>
</ol>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">It is not very clear whether the

phrase "in its absolute discretion decide" qualifies only the "other

activities" or whether it also qualifies the facilities for "recreation,

entertainment and dining" in the first part of the rule. The way the rule is drafted

it appears to qualify only the "other activities". This would mean that there is

nothing in the Rules to indicate what the facilities for recreation, entertainment and

dining consisted of. Further, the Rules do not make any reference to the standards of

service and ambience that the defendants were required to provide to the members.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">42.        In

view of the lack of any detail in the Rules on crucial matters like what facilities the

defendants were obliged to provide and the standards of service they were required to

maintain, it would, Ms Lim submitted, not make sense for this court to hold that

the Rules constituted the entire contract of membership. The only way to give some

commercial sense to the situation, she submitted, would be to consider the underlying

message in the impugned representations – that this would be an exclusive and premier

club – as part of the contractual obligations of the defendants to its members.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">43.        Ms

Lim conceded that some of the descriptions in the promotional material may well be

salesmen’s puff: a distinction would have to be made between statements that were

mere puffs and statements intended to be binding. She submitted that in deciding what was

mere puff and what were promises intended to be relied on, the test should be an objective

one: the test of the reasonable man.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">44.        The

plaintiffs’ claim in contract was spelt out in the following paragraphs of the

Amended Statement of Claim:</font>

<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">I have, at paragraph 16 above,

set out in full paragraph 13 of the Amended Statement of Claim. In effect, what the

were also the promises that constituted the contractual obligations of the defendants. In

failing to honour those promises the defendants, she submitted, were in breach of their

Paragraph 13 of the Amended Statement of Claim gave particulars of the terms of the

as follows:</font>
</p><ol xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">(a) The defendants accepted

    2000 and not end 1998 as promised.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">(d) The huge number of

</ol>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">As the above are the breaches

<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">47.        

None of the impugned representations go anywhere near suggesting that that the defendants

represented that there would be a cap on membership numbers either at 19,000 or at any

other specified figure. In fact, Ms Lim had specifically conceded that this was so

(see paragraph 17 above). As there was no specific representation as to the number of

members, it would follow that there was no specific contractual term precluding the

defendants from accepting 19,000 members.</font></p>

<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">48.        On

the evidence, it was established that there was a launch of membership at $40,000. It was

in evidence that in fact 56 persons were accepted as ordinary members at this price. There

is therefore no merit in this claim for breach even if this was such a contractual term.</font></p>

<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">49.        It

was not in dispute that the defendants had initially expected that the Club would be

opened in late 1998 and had made this known to the invitees. This was, however, only a

statement of expectation and was not, in my view, a statement intended to be a term of the

contract of membership.</font></p>
<b xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">(d)    The

<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">50.        The

thrust of Ms Lim’s arguments, minus the emotive content, was that the defendants had

promised that the Club would be a premier club in Singapore. This promise, Ms Lim

submitted, was a crucial one in attracting the plaintiffs to apply for membership and was

an express if not an implied term of the contract. She submitted that by taking in 19,000

members – a number that was in excess of what the facilities at the Club could cope

with – the defendants had breached that term.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">51.        In

considering this submission, the underlying question that needs to be answered is whether

the impugned representations gave rise to a contractual term that the Club would have the

sort of facilities and services that would make it a premier club. I will revert to this

question shortly.</font></p>
<b xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">(e) Not all facilities were

available to members</font></p></b>.

<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">52.        In

the Brochure there was a page headed "Facilities at a Glance" in which all the

food and beverage ("F&amp;B") outlets, recreational facilities and other

activity areas were listed. Amongst the nearly 40 items listed were a library and a

computer room. The complaint by the plaintiffs was that these two facilities were not

provided. The defendants’ response was that a reading area with books and chairs

had been provided and that was the library. Therefore, even if the provision of a library

was a contractual term, as a library had been provided, the question of any breach of that

term did not arise. In this context, I would note that the promotional material contained

no particulars of what the library would be like. In any event, taking the cue from the

promotional material as to the sort of "prestige club" that the defendants

envisaged, the provision of library facilities could not have been a significant feature

of the club envisaged.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">53.        Mr

Shanmugam submitted that the listing of these two items on that page was no more than a

projection of what the facilities at the Club were likely to be. There was, he submitted,

no intention on the part of the defendants to bind themselves to provide these two

facilities. In any event the library was provided for – it was only the proposal for

a computer that had been shelved. A computer room may well be introduced if the defendants

felt that there was a sufficient demand for it. Taking into consideration that in the

promotional material, no prominence was given to these two facilities, I accept Mr

Shanmugam’s submission that the provision of these two items were not contractual

obligations but merely projections of what the Club, when built, was expected to have.</font></p>
<b xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">(f)    Failing to

provide facilities matching the standards promised</font></p></b>.

<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">54.        

This claim arises from the allegation of overcrowding. It appears to be connected to

and contained within claim (d) above.</font></p>
<b xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">(g)    The

<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">55.        

There was no evidence adduced that the membership had in fact become "virtually

useless". At best, this claim is also a facet of claim (d) above.</font></p>
<u xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">The terms of the contract</font></p></b></u>.

<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">56.        The

defendants’ case was that the write-up in the invitation letter, the Brochure and the

Q&amp;A Sheet were no more than invitations to treat. It was the defendants’ case

that the terms contained in the application form (in particular the Rules) were the terms

on which each applicant was offering to join the Club and when that application was

accepted, those terms became the entire contract between the applicant and the defendants.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">57.        The

Rules make it abundantly clear – and this I suppose would be a fairly common feature

in proprietary clubs – that the proprietors (ie the defendants) were in complete

charge and had practically unfettered rights to run the Club as they chose. And there was

nothing in the Rules specifying the sort of facilities, the sort of ambience and level of

services that the defendants were obliged to provide. In short, the main selling points of

the Club – its exclusivity, its up-market ambience, its prestige, its facilities

and the quality of its services – were all not specified to in the Rules.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">58.        The

plaintiffs’ witnesses testified that the main reason they joined the Club was because

it was to be an exclusive club with the ambience, service and facilities of a premier

club. I accept that evidence. I was more than satisfied that the plaintiffs who testified

joined the Club because they took seriously the promise by the defendants in their

promotional material that this would be a premier club with first-class facilities and

services. Ms Lim submitted, and there was considerable merit in that submission, that the

absence of these rather crucial terms in the Rules indicated that the Rules could not be

the entire contract between the parties.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">59.        

Numerous authorities were cited by both sides as to the circumstances in which courts

would hold that statements found in promotional literature constituted terms (implied or

otherwise) of the contract. The underlying basis for accepting such statements as terms of

the contract is the intention of the parties. If the court, applying an objective test,

concludes that a reasonable man looking at the promotional material would have concluded

that the promoter intended that the statements (or some of the statements) therein were to

be taken seriously, then those statements were likely to be terms of the contract.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">60.        In

the present case, looking at the factual matrix in which the statements were made –

including the endorsement and co-promotion of the Club by reputable financial institutions

– the representations that this was to be a premier club with first-class facilities

and services seems to me to be more than mere puff. Such representations were, in my view,

intended to be taken seriously. They were intended as a promise from the defendants

that the Club, when functional, will meet those standards. It was this promise that led

people like Tan Chin Seng (the 1<sup>st</sup> plaintiff) to join the Club.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">61.        In

this regard, the following comments made by Sir Oliver Popplewell in <i>1406 Pub Company v

Hoare &amp; Anor</i> (Ch.D – 2 March 2001) (although Mr Shanmugam tried to

distinguish the case on the facts) are apposite:</font>
</p><ol xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">"I look at the totality of

    the evidence and ask what a reasonable outside observer would infer from all the

    circumstances. The Claimants are, of course, entitled to take advantage of any legal point

    but I cannot help but think that an outside observer would think their conduct somewhat

    shabby. … This was part and parcel of a well presented sales pitch relating to

    important terms of contract and intended to form part of the contract. I am satisfied that

    the Claimants, through Mr Hughes and the brochure, did give the promises and assurances;

    did intend that the Defendants should act on them; did intend them to be part of the

    contract and the Defendants did act on them. They would not otherwise have entered into

    the contract."</font></p>
</blockquote>
</ol>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">The invitation letter, the

Brochure and the Q&amp;A Sheet in this case were part of a "well presented sales

pitch" by the defendants containing important terms. The defendants did intend that

the invitees should act on those terms and some of the invitees did act on them. I am

satisfied that the plaintiffs who testified before me would not, but for the promises in

the promotional material relating to the exclusivity, ambience and services at the Club,

have entered into the membership contract. Ignoring the subjective views of the plaintiffs

and applying instead the objective test of the reasonable man, I find that a reasonable

man looking at the promotional material would have concluded that the defendants were

serious about this Club being a premier club with first-class facilities. Viewed

objectively the representations to that effect were, in my view, part of the

contract.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">62.        

Rule 6.1 specifically provides that the Club shall consist of such number of members as

the proprietors may in their discretion from time to time admit. If this was an unfettered

discretion, it would detract from the promise of the defendants – which I have held

to be a contractual term – to provide an exclusive and premier club. If the

defendants admit more members than what the facilities at the Club could reasonably cope

with, then the Club would no longer be the kind of club that was promised. Rule 6.1 would

therefore have to be read subject to the defendants’ obligation to provide a club

with the qualities promised. This will mean that, in exercising their rights under Rule

6.1 to admit members, the defendants will have to ensure that they do not admit so large a

number that their obligation to provide and run a premier club would be compromised. The

discretion given to the defendants under Rule 6.1 would, to that extent, be curtailed. To

put it in an alternative way: to give business efficacy to the contract, I would imply as

a term of the contract that the defendants would exercise their discretion under Rule 6.1

in such manner that there would be no breach of the defendants’ obligations to

provide the sort of club promised in the promotional material.</font></p>
<u xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">The facilities, ambience and

service at the Club</font></p></b></u>.

<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">63.        At

the invitation of the parties, I visited the Club and was shown all its facilities. The

Club was spacious and its facilities were certainly up-market. Whilst the dcor of the

Club may not be to everyone’s taste, there can be no doubt that the physical

facilities and ambience matched the adjectives "opulent" and "lavish"

used in the promotional material. In fact, there was no serious complaint by the

plaintiffs about the ambience or the quality of the physical facilities provided.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">64.        The

plaintiffs’ main complaint was that by admitting 19,000 persons (19,048 including the

56 "ordinary" members) as members, the demand for the usage of facilities and

services at the Club became so strained that the Club was not the premier club that the

defendants had contracted to provide. I now turn to consider whether the demands on the

facilities brought about by the large membership that was admitted were such that the Club

did not meet the first-class standards of a premier club that was promised.</font></p>
<u xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Did the defendants breach their

contractual undertaking to provide a premier club?</font></p>
</b></u>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">65.        The

Club was initially scheduled to open in June 1998 but because of construction delays and

delays in getting various approvals, that schedule could not be met. The opening of the

Club was an event that the thousands who had joined were eagerly awaiting – an

eagerness made keener by the delay in the opening date. When the Club did open, large

numbers of members/guests turned up at the Club during the initial weeks and months. This

resulted in overcrowding and congestion. Matters were not helped by the fact that the

defendants provided free food during the initial weeks.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">66.        It

is pertinent to note that the bulk of the complaints made by the plaintiffs about

facilities at the Club related to this initial few months and to festive days, after the

initial period, when the demand at the F&amp;B outlets, especially at the Caf &amp;

Terrace, still remained high. The usage of the pool during weekends, especially during

school holidays, was very high and the gym also saw high usage during the more popular

hours. The defendants did not seek to deny that there was a high demand for Club

facilities during the initial months but pointed out that thereafter matters settled down

to a more regular routine. It was the defendants’ case that after the initial months

the facilities at the Club were in fact under-utilised. They therefore denied any failure

on their part to provide the premier club that had been promised.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">67.        A

great deal of detailed evidence was adduced by both sides on the utilisation of club

facilities. The defendants maintained computer records of transactions at the various

outlets and printouts of the daily and monthly sales at the F&amp;B outlets were produced.

Ms Lim objected to the production of these printouts. I saw no merit in that objection.

These were accounting records kept in the normal course of business and were admissible

under s 34 of the Evidence Act.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">68.        Ms

Lim, relying on the case of <i>Regina Fur Co Ltd v Bossom </i><nobr>[1958] 2 LLR 425</nobr>, also

objected to the defendants being allowed to adduce evidence of usage. In that case, Lord

Evershed held that where the defence is one of a bare denial:</font>
</p><ol xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">"… the onus remains

    throughout upon the plaintiffs to establish the case they are alleging. Where such is the

    form of the pleadings, it is not only not obligatory upon the defendants but it is not

    even permissible for them to proceed to put forward some affirmative case which they have

    not pleaded or alleged; and it is not, therefore, right that they should, by

    cross-examination of the plaintiffs or otherwise, suggest such an affirmative case."</font></p>
</blockquote>
</ol>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Ms Lim submitted that the defence

raised in this case was one of bare denial and the defendants therefore ought not to be

allowed to adduce evidence of usage.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">69.        Mr

Shanmugam disagreed. He submitted that the principle in the <i>Fur</i> case applied only

where the defendants put the plaintiffs to strict proof and admitted nothing. The present

case, he submitted, was not of the same genre. In the present case, the defendants had not

just put the plaintiffs to strict proof – the defendants had also denied that the

Club was overcrowded. The defendants were therefore entitled to put forward evidence to

show that the Club was not overcrowded.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">70.        I

accept the submission of Mr Shanmugam. The defence in this case was not the sort of bare

denial that Lord Evershed was dealing with in the <i>Fur</i> case. The defendants here

were entitled to adduce evidence, in support of their plea, that there was no

overcrowding.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">71.        The

plaintiffs adduced evidence – albeit anecdotal – that even outside the initial

launch period (when some degree of congestion was to be expected), the number of

members/spouses/guests patronising some of the facilities at the Club was so great that

patrons had, at times, to queue for some time to get a place. It was alleged that some

members had even walked away in disgust. The defendants admitted that even after the

initial months there may have been occasions when members could not immediately get a

place at the venue of their choice but this, it was claimed, happened rarely. And

when it did, it was during public holidays or festive seasons when demand was bound to be

high. It was, the defendants submitted, a common feature in all popular restaurants

wherever situate – whether in a prestigious club or not – for there to be high

demand during such periods.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">72.        I

do not propose to rehearse here the evidence relating to usage that was adduced by the two

sides. The evidence was not only from witnesses of fact (including employees of the Club)

but also from expert witnesses familiar with the operations of clubs and comparisons were

made between this Club and various other premier clubs in the region. Having heard all the

evidence, I come to the conclusion that the demands on a number of facilities at the Club

(especially the Caf &amp; Terrace; the Chinese restaurant; the swimming pool; the gym;

and the bathing/sauna facilities) were, at times, such that there was considerable

pressure on the defendants to cope. This pressure arose because the available facilities

had to serve the needs of the large membership of 19,000 persons (and their spouses and

their guests).</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">73.        

Although I find that there was, at times, considerable pressure on the defendants to cope

with the needs of so many members, I do not find that that pressure was such that it

crossed the line where it could be said that the Club was no longer the premier club that

was promised. I would also add, in case the defendants are inclined to admit even more

members, that the pressure was very close to that line. Admission of more members can

easily result in that line being crossed. In my view, the membership of the Club, as it

now stands, is just about the very maximum permissible to sustain the Club as a premier

club.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">74.        For

the above reasons, I dismiss with costs the claims made by the plaintiffs.</font></p>
