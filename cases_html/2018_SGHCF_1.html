During the relationship and marriage, the Wife was involved in the businesses at various points, including a period in which the Husband was in prison after being convicted for an offence. At one point, some businesses were transferred from the Husband to the Wife. The effect of that transfer is in dispute between the parties, as is the level and significance of the Wife’s involvement in the Husband’s businesses.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">7 Before and during the marriage, various properties were purchased by the Wife.

The Wife denied this, claiming that the money came from her savings or from her businesses. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">8 A civil claim alleging beneficial interest in the various properties purchased by the Wife was commenced by the Husband (“the Civil Claim”). This overlapped with the divorce proceedings. In the interests of ensuring consistency and savings of time and cost, I directed that the hearing of the ancillaries be taken first; with evidence to be taken from both parties before the Civil Claim. Following this, and after consulting with the parties, I indicated that I would determine which assets constituted the matrimonial pool. The intention was to simplify proceedings so that parties could be clear as to which assets were subject to the matrimonial regime, and which were not, and fell to be determined solely by the general civil law. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">9 After I reached my decision on the pool of matrimonial assets, the Civil Claim was discontinued save for a few outstanding matters. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Decision on the matrimonial asset pool</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">10 In my earlier decision on the matrimonial pool,

First, relying on the Wife’s evidence that she received about $686,416 from the proceeds of sale of the Non-Matrimonial Properties, the Wife argues that by withdrawing the Civil Claim, the Husband admits that at the very least, a sum of $686,416 of the Wife’s own money was available for the purchase of immovable properties that formed part of the matrimonial pool. Second, by withdrawing the Civil Claim, the Husband concedes that his factual grounds for alleging an equitable interest in the Non-Matrimonial Properties are without basis. In particular, the Husband admits, by withdrawing the Civil Claim, that his allegation that the moneys used to purchase the properties acquired in the Wife’s name were obtained from an alleged pool of funds belonging to the Businesses (“the Funds Pool”) without proper accounting are groundless. Third, given that the Husband relies on the very same factual grounds to allege that he has made direct contributions to the properties in the matrimonial pool held in the Wife’s name (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, that the funds for purchasing these matrimonial assets were obtained from the Funds Pool), these allegations of fact must similarly be viewed with circumspection.

However, the Husband still bears a burden of proving any fact he relies on to support his contentions on direct contributions. The Husband’s entire case on direct contributions to properties held in the Wife’s name rests on his allegation that the Wife had a practice of drawing freely from the Funds Pool, without any form of accounting. This material fact was not proven.

</div> The Wife submits that there is no evidence of direct contributions leading to increase in value of the properties in Category A from the Husband. In contrast, the Wife contributed directly because down-payments and mortgages were paid using moneys in the Wife’s bank accounts. Even if the Husband’s evidence that the funds for purchasing these properties came from the Funds Pool is preferred, the funds should be considered as a gift to the Wife which can still be counted as the Wife’s direct contributions. As for indirect contributions by the Husband, other than being a guarantor for the loans to purchase P1 and P2 and the paternal contributions to the household, there were no other indirect contributions – all investments were initiated and made by the Wife. Following from this, the Wife submits that for the Category A properties both the direct and indirect contributions should be determined to be 95:5 in the Wife’s favour.

Since the Husband now concedes by withdrawing the Civil Claim that the Wife had at least $686,416 of her own funds (see [16] above), which could have been used to contribute solely to any such improvements, there is insufficient evidence of the Husband having contributed to any such improvements to these properties.

Next, to give credit to both parties’ indirect contribution throughout the marriage, instead of giving the party who has contributed more significantly than the other an “uplift” to his or her direct contribution percentage, the court should proceed to ascribe a second ratio to represent each party’s indirect contribution to the well-being of the family relative to that of the other. Using each party’s respective direct and indirect percentage contributions, the court then derives each party’s average percentage contribution to the family which would form the basis to divide the matrimonial assets. Further adjustments (to take into account, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, the other factors enumerated in s 112(2) of the WC) may need to be<span class="font-italic"> </span>made to the parties’ average percentage contributions …</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">The Court of Appeal then elaborated further that indirect contributions, being a question of impression and judgment, is not to be determined mathematically but based on “all the relevant facts” of the case (at [24]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 After arriving at the average ratio, the court then considers the appropriate weight to be given as between the direct contributions and indirect contributions. This adjustment is again non-mathematical and is based on the court’s sense of “what is fair and just” (<span class="font-italic">ANJ v ANK</span> at [26]). The Court of Appeal also noted in <span class="font-italic">ANJ v ANK</span> as follows (at [27]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The circumstances that could shift the “average ratio” in favour of one party are diverse, and in our judgment, there are at least three (non-exhaustive) broad categories of factors that should be considered in attributing the appropriate weight to the parties’ collective direct contributions as against their indirect contributions:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(a) The length of the marriage. Indirect contributions in general tend to feature more prominently in long marriages (<span class="font-italic">Tan Hwee Lee</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>([18] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) at [85]). Conversely, indirect contributions usually play a <span class="font-italic">de </span><span class="font-italic">minimis </span>role in short, childless marriages (<span class="font-italic">Ong Boon Huat</span><span class="font-italic"> Samuel v Chan Mei Lan Kristine </span>[2007] 2 SLR(R) 729 at [28]).</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(b)  The size of the matrimonial assets and its constituents. If the pool of assets available for division is extraordinarily large and all of that was accrued by one party’s exceptional efforts, direct contributions are likely to command greater weight as against indirect contributions (see <span class="font-italic">Yeo Chong Lin v Tay Ang Choo Nancy </span>[2011] 2 SLR 1157 (“<span class="font-italic">Yeo Chong Lin</span>”)).</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(c)  The extent and nature of indirect contributions made. Not all indirect contributions carry equal weight. For instance, the engagement of a domestic helper naturally reduces the burden of homemaking and caregiving responsibilities undertaken by the parties, and to that extent, the weight accorded to the parties’ collective indirect contributions in the homemaking and caregiving aspects may have to be correspondingly reduced. The courts also tend to give weighty consideration to homemakers who have painstakingly raised children to adulthood, especially where such efforts have entailed significant career sacrifices on their part.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 In <span class="font-italic">TNL v TNK</span><span class="font-italic"> and another appeal and another matter </span>[2017] 1 SLR 609 (“<span class="font-italic">TNL v TNK</span>”), the Court of Appeal clarified that the approach in <span class="font-italic">ANJ v ANK</span> should not be applied to marriages where only one spouse earns income (referred to in <span class="font-italic">TNL v TNK</span> at [43] as “Single-Income Marriages”) (at [46]). It was further clarified in <span class="font-italic">TNL v TNK</span> (at [47]), that in the application of the structured approach in <span class="font-italic">ANJ</span><span class="font-italic"> v ANK</span>, separate ratios should not be applied to indirect financial contributions, on the one hand, and non-financial contributions on the other. The Court of Appeal also noted that in long Single-Income Marriages, the tendency is towards equal division of the matrimonial assets; the Court of Appeal however left open the issue of what considerations may apply in short Single-Income marriages (<span class="font-italic">TNL v TNK</span> at [48]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 While the marriage was relatively short (see [5] above), there is evidence of contribution by both parties, though this evidence was not abundant.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Evidence and presumptions</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 In the light of the absence of substantial portions of evidence, the question of the burden of proof is particularly significant. I accept the Wife’s submissions that the legal burden does not operate in the usual way as it does in civil claims. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 The court takes “a rough and ready” approach in the absence of sufficient evidence: see <span class="font-italic">AN</span><span class="font-italic">J v ANK </span>(at [23]). This flows from the fact that the process of division of matrimonial assets is driven not by pleadings, but rather the role of the court in fulfilling the legislative mandate to order a “just and equitable” division: see 112(1) of the Women’s Charter. Matrimonial property has to be divided somehow, even if there is scant evidence, as the parties’ divorce requires that division come what may. The court could in cases of little objective evidence turn to broader factors, such as the length of the marriage, and the raising of children, to gauge on a very broad basis, the likelihood of the degree of contribution from each side. In some cases, the court could lean towards equality in division. However, these factors are not present in the present case, given the relative brevity of the marriage as well as the absence of children being raised within the marriage (the children from past marriages or relationships are in any event adults at the material point of division). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 What is notable here is that the parties were in a relationship for about a decade before they were married. However, I am of the view that the fact that the parties were in a relationship that lasted for many years could not be a relevant factor given the scope of the legislative provision which is concerned only with factors relating to the period of marriage. I could not see anything in s 112 or the scheme of Part X of the Women’s Charter that justifies an expansive approach which allows me to take into account pre-marriage circumstances. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 Within this context, the factual or evidential burden of adducing evidence to support or rebut a particular position is important. The evidential burden lies on the party asserting a proposition, or refuting other evidence brought into play. In the absence of such evidence, the contrary position stands. In addition, s 116(<span class="font-italic">g</span>) of the Evidence Act may also be invoked to determine factual issues. This allows an adverse inference to be drawn in some circumstances. Its use in the context of matrimonial law must however be nuanced (see [73] below).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 In the present case, tracing the flow of funds from pre-marriage sources, asset by asset, did not appear to be practical and is not in fact pursued by the parties. I do note that in some cases, it may be possible to trace the flow of funds from asset to asset to determine the direct contributions that were made. That is not however practical at all here, in view of the time lapsed and quantity of assets, and the lack of relevant documentary evidence recording the source of funds. It is that lack of evidence that necessitates a robust approach to be taken, though not at the cost of justice. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Methodology adopted</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 The Wife argues that “the classification methodology” identified in <span class="font-italic">NK</span><span class="font-italic"> v NL </span>[2007] 3 SLR(R) 743 (“<span class="font-italic">NK v NL</span>”) is more appropriate than “the global assessment methodology”.

<div class="FootnoteRef text-justify">  Wife’s Written Submissions for Division dated 3 May 2017 at para 34.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> As noted in <span class="font-italic">NK</span><span class="font-italic"> v NL</span> by Andrew Phang JA (at [35]), “the classification methodology” is more appropriate where there are “multiple classes of assets” which have attracted different contributions. In such a context, it would be more equitable to consider assets by classes. The Wife contends that there are clearly identifiable multiple classes of assets, and that different direct financial contributions were made to each asset. The Husband argues instead in favour of “the global assessment methodology”. I accept that, as between the properties and the Businesses, there were possibly differing direct financial contributions. However, given the dearth of objective and substantive evidence, I find that there would not be much utility in drawing a distinction between these different classes of assets. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 Instead, what helpfully distinguishes the various assets are that they fall into three distinct categories: (a) matrimonial home, (b) assets purchased before marriage, and (c) assets purchased after the start of the marriage. This is not an application of “the classification methodology”, but is simply the consequence of the language of s 112(10) of the Women’s Charter, which distinguishes between three types of assets (see [78] below):</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) the matrimonial home;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) assets acquired before the marriage but which were substantively improved; and </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) assets acquired after the start of the marriage.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">The entire <span class="font-italic">value</span> of the matrimonial home as well as the assets acquired after the start of the marriage would fall to be included as part of the matrimonial assets divisible on dissolution of the marriage. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 As regards (b), prior acquired assets which have been improved, it is only the <span class="font-italic">improved</span> value that is subject to division by the court. This approach, advocated by Professor Leong Wai Kum in her book, <span class="font-italic">Elements of F</span><span class="font-italic">amily Law in Singapore </span>(LexisNexis<span class="font-italic">,</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>2nd Ed, 2013) at p 577<span class="font-italic"> </span>was endorsed by Debbie Ong JC (as she then was) in <span class="font-italic">TNC v TND </span>[2016] 3 SLR 1172 (“<span class="font-italic">TNC v TND</span>”) at [41]. I accept the arguments and follow the approach endorsed by Ong JC in <span class="font-italic">TNC</span><span class="font-italic"> v TND </span>that in respect of assets acquired pre-marriage which have been improved, it is only the increase in value from improvement that is subject to division. Subjecting the whole of the value of the asset to division will in effect give an unjustified windfall to the claiming party. In the context of determining whether a global assessment or classification methodology should be adopted, Ong JC made the following observations (at [41]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Section 112(10)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>), however, places assets acquired <span class="font-italic">before </span>marriage, but regarded as matrimonial assets by virtue of ordinary <span class="font-italic">usage </span>or substantial <span class="font-italic">improvement</span>, on the same footing as those acquired during marriage (s 112(10)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>)). For property acquired before marriage but regarded as a matrimonial asset due to substantial improvement, Professor Leong suggests treating only the increase in value of the property brought about by the parties’ improvement as liable to division. Discounting the value of the property before marriage from the value of the property at the operative date enables the court to derive the value attributable to the parties’ efforts, which is a quintessential asset (<span class="font-italic">Elements </span>at p 577). However, such discounting cannot be done for property regarded as matrimonial asset by virtue of “ordinary usage” or enjoyment since there is no discernible increase in value that can be ascribed to the parties’ efforts. This is why the use of the classification approach for such assets may be more appropriate.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">In my view, the requirement of substantial improvement in respect of prior property is meant to exclude <span class="font-italic">de </span><span class="font-italic">minimis </span>or negligible contributions. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 As noted by Ong JC, the approach does not apply to the matrimonial home, however. The matrimonial home which is acquired before marriage is of a different nature from other improved properties: it serves as the focal point of the family life. The difference in treatment from other pre-marriage properties is clear in the language of the statute. Section 112(10)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the Women’s Charter reads: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">In this section, “matrimonial asset” means — </div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) any asset acquired before the marriage by one party or both parties to the marriage — </div><div class="Judg-Quote-2 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(i) ordinarily used or enjoyed by both parties or one or more of their children while the parties are residing together for shelter or transportation or for household, education, recreational, social or aesthetic purposes; or </div><div class="Judg-Quote-2 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(ii) which has been <span class="font-italic">substantially improved during the marriage</span> by the other party or by both parties to the marriage; …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added] </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">The matrimonial home is distinguished from other pre-marriage properties since only the latter must have been substantially improved to qualify as matrimonial assets.

</div> as I noted above at [54], the period of cohabitation before marriage must be excluded from the court’s consideration except in so far as it can indicate the source of funds used during the course of marriage. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 Some of the properties that were bought before marriage, were as I found earlier, in fact acquired by payments and contributions after marriage. That to my mind would count as acquisition, and such assets would be part of the matrimonial pool under s 112(10)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the Women’s Charter (see <span class="font-italic">BHN v BHO</span> [2013] SGHC 91 at [36]; <span class="font-italic">THL v THM</span> [2015] SGHCF 11 at [40]). However, for such acquisition, the court should not take the whole of the value of the asset, but only that part of the acquisition that coincides with the period of the marriage. Limiting the value subject to division to only that part attributable to acquisition after marriage prevents an unearned windfall. Such assets are distinguishable from assets purchased wholly after the start of the marriage. For the latter, the whole of the acquisition is attributable to the joint enterprise as well as the community of resources and property that constitute a marriage.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The implications of the withdrawal of the Civil Claim </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 The Wife argues that the effect of the withdrawal of the Civil Claim is that the proceeds of $686,416 is excluded from the matrimonial pool and not subject to division. From this, the Wife argues that $686,416 was available as the Wife’s own money for the purchase of immovable properties that are part of the matrimonial pool.

</div> The Husband argues that this is not the effect of the discontinuance. It is said by the Husband that the outstanding issues in the Civil Claim would be dealt with in the present matrimonial proceedings. The decision of the court in excluding the Non-Matrimonial Properties also renders these funds academic. Whether the source of funds used in property purchases came from the Funds Pool is however an issue that is still live. Additionally, the Wife’s argument that she is now entitled to the $686,416 is yet another sign of a constantly changing evidence and should be disregarded for that reason.

All that my decision determined was that the class of assets I identified fell outside the matrimonial pool. By subsequently discontinuing the Civil Claim, this does not necessarily amount to a concession by the Husband that these funds used for the purchase of properties were to be regarded as solely coming from the Wife. I accept the Husband’s explanation that it was academic for him to seek adjudication of the ownership of this $686,416 given that these funds were either dissipated or channelled into other property purchases and investments.

</div> In my judgment, the concerns about the position of the Wife’s savings and means below lend a considerable blow to the conclusion that this sum of $686,416 came entirely from the Wife and her businesses. For the same reasons as below, I find that this sum more probably than not involved contributions by the Husband.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Illegality </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 The Wife argues that the Husband is precluded from asserting an interest in the matrimonial assets as a result of the doctrine of illegality. The Wife argues that the Husband was committing an illegal act by using third parties as nominees for the businesses which were registered in the Wife’s name as his intention was to defraud his creditors should he be made a bankrupt. He is thus precluded from relying on his assertion that he is the sole beneficial owner of the Businesses even though some of the Businesses were registered in the Wife’s name, in order to claim direct contributions in respect of the matrimonial properties through the Funds Pool.

</div>
</div>
</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 I do not find in favour of the Wife on this point. First and foremost, in the absence of any dishonest intention to defraud creditors, there is nothing to my mind illegal about using nominees to front a business <span class="font-italic">per se</span>. There is no evidence adduced that the Husband intended to defraud any of the Businesses’ creditors by appointing nominees for these Businesses. There is also no claim made against the Husband by any creditor of the Businesses under s 340(1) of the Companies Act (Cap 50, 2006 Rev Ed). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 Even if there is any illegality in question, I am not convinced that it will bar a claim in division of matrimonial assets as there is no cause of action to speak of in such an exercise. I am satisfied that considering that the present application is a matrimonial proceeding, and as the creditors are not involved, in the circumstances before me, that should not bar his claim to a possible division of these matrimonial assets in his favour, and certainly not in a determination of whether an asset could be subject to the regime under s 112 of the Women’s Charter.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 Even if illegality can extend to matrimonial proceedings, I have to consider the proportionality of denying the Husband’s claim. The Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Ting Siew May</span><span class="font-italic"> v Boon Lay Choo and another </span>[2014] 3 SLR 609<span class="font-italic"> </span>(“<span class="font-italic">Ting Siew May</span>”) laid down the proposition that where a contract is entered into with the object of committing an illegal act, the response would be proportionate to the illegality. It was made clear in the recent decision of the Court of Appeal that the proportionality analysis is only relevant where the contract is “not unlawful <span class="font-italic">per se</span> but entered into with the object of committing an illegal act” (see <span class="font-italic">Ochroid Trading Ltd and another v Chua </span><span class="font-italic">Siok Lui (trading as VIE Import &amp; Export) and another</span> [2018] SGCA 5 at [176(a)]). In other words, the proportionality analysis is inapplicable where the contract itself is prohibited. Applying by analogy to this case, the Husband’s appointment of nominees for some of the Businesses by itself is not illegal; any illegality can only be said to arise if he had done so with the object of defrauding creditors.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 In assessing proportionality, the court takes into account considerations such as the purpose of the prohibiting rule, the nature and gravity of the illegality, the remoteness of the illegality to the contract, the object of the parties and the consequences of denying the claim (<span class="font-italic">Ting Siew May</span> at [66], [70] and [77]). While these factors in <span class="font-italic">Ting Siew May</span> were laid down in a contractual context, if illegality can even extend to matrimonial proceedings in the first place, its approach can also be applied in the present case.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">71 Applying the factors highlighted in <span class="font-italic">Ting Siew May</span>, any illegality would not be of such a degree that the Husband’s claim under matrimonial law should be denied. The Wife argues that the Husband was relying on an illegality in claiming an interest in the Businesses, as he would have retained an interest in assets that had ostensibly been transferred out of his name. However, on this basis, even if the Wife was not party to the illegality, the proportionate response following <span class="font-italic">Ting Siew May</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>would not be to exclude the interest between the Husband and the Wife <span class="font-italic">inter se</span>. Whatever may be the position <span class="font-italic">vis-à-vis</span> third parties, creditors or the authorities, between the Husband and the Wife, the Wife is not affected or prejudiced by the illegality in relation to her interests. In other words, the illegality is remote from the claim made under matrimonial law. Allowing the Husband’s claim here would not also to my mind undermine the policy of the bankruptcy provisions – the creditors’ rights against the Husband remain unaffected. Ironically, it would be denying his share of the matrimonial assets that would affect his creditors’ interests as the Husband’s assets would then be lowered as a result of his failure to obtain a share in the matrimonial pool. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Adverse inference</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">72 Both parties argue that an adverse inference should be drawn against the other. In respect of an inference against the Husband, the Wife argues that an adverse inference should be drawn against him for failing to produce relevant evidence which was within his power to produce such as relevant personal bank accounts and management accounts of the Businesses. As for the inference against the Wife, the Husband points to the Wife’s failure to fully disclose all her assets, her bank accounts, her positive undervaluation of some of the properties sold and her failure to produce any documentary evidence to prove that the funds that she used to purchase the properties were her personal funds. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">73 The mere absence of evidence is not sufficient to trigger any such adverse inference. What must be shown is that there has been a failure to make full and frank disclosure, or a satisfactory explanation as to money or assets that are shown to be either putatively assets or contributions to acquisition of such assets. Thus, it must be shown either that there is failure to give full and frank disclosure, or that there is some evidence of the existence of assets or contributions, which calls for an explanation. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">74 As expressed by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Chan Tin</span><span class="font-italic"> Sun v Fong Quay Sim </span>[2015] 2 SLR 195 (“<span class="font-italic">Chan Tin Sun</span>”) (at [62]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The law on drawing adverse inferences was succinctly summarised by this court in <span class="font-italic">Koh Bee Choo v Choo Chai </span><span class="font-italic">Huah</span> [2007] SGCA 21 at [28]. In order for the court to draw an adverse inference, there must be:</div><div class="txt-body text-justify">(a) a substratum of evidence that establishes a <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> case against the person against whom the inference is to be drawn; and</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(b) that person must have had some particular access to the information he is said to be hiding.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">In our judgment, a <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> case had been made out against the Husband in the light of the moneys he withdrew. Moreover, what happened to the moneys was clearly within the Husband’s knowledge. In the premises, we found that the Judge therefore did not err in drawing an adverse inference against the Husband.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">Guidance was also given in <span class="font-italic">Chan Tin Sun</span> on how the adverse inference should be effected: either by ascribing a value to the undeclared or hidden assets, or to order a higher proportion of the known assets in favour of the prejudiced party (at [64]; see also <span class="font-italic">NK v NL</span> at [61]–[62]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">75 On the facts, I draw no adverse inference against the Husband. The absence of relevant information from him is sufficiently explained; it is apparent that the Husband maintained little record of his business activities and the funds that came in and went out, for whatever reason. No evidence was adduced that this was an aberration from normal practice, which would have shown that there was an attempt to hide or avoid giving the required evidence. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">76 Similarly, as against the Wife, no adverse inference is drawn. While there was an absence of documentary evidence as regards her supposed savings of $300,000 at the time she met the Husband, I could not conclude that there was any <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> case for an adverse inference to be drawn. The failure to adduce such evidence is to be expected given the passage of time. In the absence of clear evidence to the contrary, I am also not convinced that the Wife failed to disclose all her assets or that she undervalued the properties sold.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Assets in matrimonial pool</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">77 The matrimonial pool was, as I indicated at [10], determined earlier. For completeness, the reasoning behind that determination is explained briefly. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">78 As regards what assets constitute the matrimonial pool, the starting point is the statutory definition in s 112(10) of the Women’s Charter:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">In this section, “matrimonial asset” means — </div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) any asset acquired before the marriage by one party or both parties to the marriage — </div><div class="Judg-Quote-2 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(i) ordinarily used or enjoyed by both parties or one or more of their children while the parties are residing together for shelter or transportation or for household, education, recreational, social or aesthetic purposes; or </div><div class="Judg-Quote-2 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(ii) which has been substantially improved during the marriage by the other party or by both parties to the marriage; and </div><div class="txt-body text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) any other asset of any nature acquired during the marriage by one party or both parties to the marriage, </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">79 There are three broad classes in s 112(10):</div><div class="mb-3"><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(a) any property, including property acquired before the marriage, used as a matrimonial home or for what I term matrimonial purposes;</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(b) any property, including property acquired before the marriage, which has been substantially improved during the marriage; and</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(c) any assets acquired during the marriage.</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">80 The pool comprised the Park Villas Property used as the matrimonial home, or rather the proceeds, since it had been sold by the time of the divorce proceedings, as well as other properties purchased before marriage, but for which payments continued to be made during the marriage, as well properties purchased after the commencement of the marriage (see [10]–[12] above). I also included as matrimonial assets the Businesses, the CPF moneys and Bank Accounts as declared because I was satisfied that both parties gave substantial contributions to these assets during the marriage. The Vehicles and the Shares were also considered as matrimonial properties. However, I excluded a number of properties that were purchased and sold before the marriage. These were not part of the pool as they were not matrimonial assets within the meaning of s 112. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">81 In my earlier decision on the matrimonial pool, I noted the properties listed at [15] were not part of the pool. For these properties (with the exception of 8@Woodleigh, #02), they were excluded because they were not acquired during the marriage and were also neither a matrimonial home nor a property that was substantially improved during the course of the marriage. As for 8@Woodleigh, #02, this was excluded because I was not satisfied that this was a property acquired by one of the parties within the marriage.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">82 In determining the matrimonial home and property used for matrimonial purposes, considering the language of the statute and its broad objective, which in Part X is concerned with marriage and dissolution, I did not consider it appropriate for me to take into account any use by the parties before the marriage. There may be a difference had such property been used or enjoyed shortly before a marriage with the view that it is to be so employed for the purpose of the marriage, but I did not find that that was the situation here. The parties cohabitated together for many years.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">83 As for the matrimonial home, the Husband claimed that the Park Villas Property was the matrimonial home. I accepted this evidence on this score, which was not significantly challenged by the Wife, and was satisfied that the Park Villas Property fell within the definition of s 112(10)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)(i) of the Women’s Charter. In comparison, I was not persuaded that P1 and P2 were used as the matrimonial home, but there I accepted that there was some evidence of contribution to acquisition by the Husband during the marriage, and that these properties should be determined as matrimonial assets. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">84 In respect of the properties listed above at [11], I was satisfied that both parties gave substantial contributions during the marriage. The Vehicles were all matrimonial properties. While some of them were bought close to the interim judgment date, and after the breakdown of the marriage, it was appropriate to so treat these vehicles as matrimonial property, given the probability that funds were still commingled at the time, though the actual shares and distribution should be determined later. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">85 There was a claim in respect of the rental income received by the parties from the various properties; this would have to be taken into account in the question of contribution to the acquisition of the other assets.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">86 The Wife also sought account for the Husband’s rent-free use of P2 from December 2012 to the present. The Husband retorts that this claim is not backed up by any rental agreement or invoice and that there was an agreement between him and the Wife for the Husband to occupy P2 rent free. In my judgment, the Wife’s claim is anathema to the process of division of matrimonial property. The use of property by one or the other is to be accounted for in the division rather than through the payment of rentals: see s 112(2)(<span class="font-italic">f</span>) of the Women’s Charter. If the property is part of the matrimonial pool, there will be some interest that belongs to the other party in occupation and no rental right can properly arise against that other party within the context of matrimonial division. This is so even if there was any agreement or contract between them. The Husband for his part claims rental collected by the Wife in respect of P2; whatever may have been received in the past is not part of the matrimonial property, and in the absence of any other evidence must be taken to either have been spent or used in the purchase of the other properties. If spent, there is nothing left to divide; if used in the purchase of the property, it will be taken in as part of the determination of the contributions by either party. In the present case, such determination has, in the absence of evidence, to be on a rough and ready basis. Lastly, I also do not consider as proven the Husband’s claim for unpaid salaries. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Direct contributions </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">87 What this case starkly brings into consideration is how direct contributions are to be attributed, given the parties’ pre-marriage sources and interwoven ownership claims arising outside the marriage. However, this has to be taken in the context that the Civil Claim has been largely withdrawn and the assessment of the contributions must be on the basis of what is asserted and can be determined from the evidence adduced in the matrimonial proceedings.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">88 The Wife refers to some possible transfers of funds by the Husband as gifts, which are to be counted as the Wife’s direct contributions towards the acquisition of the properties. But so long as they occur within the context of the marriage, these would count as contributions by the Husband, except within the limited circumstances contemplated in s 112(10) of the Women’s Charter. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">89 Evidence of direct contributions is lacking on both sides. On the Wife’s side, there is little put forward to support her contention that her savings were significant. The Wife claims that she had $300,000 in savings at the time of her first meeting of the Husband in 1996. Given what she had indicated of her work at the relevant time, I find this to be very unlikely. A rough and ready approach had to be taken as per <span class="font-italic">ANJ v ANK</span>, and her claim that she contributed significantly from resources other than from the Funds Pool could not be given full weight. Nonetheless, I am unable to find that she would not have had <span class="font-italic">any</span> savings whatsoever.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">90 One would have to weigh her background, and the inherent probabilities of the situation, in the absence of any objective evidence. These point to the Wife possibly having some savings, but not to the extent that she claims. The difficulty is what figure should be ascribed to the Wife’s contributions. But any difficulty in relation to ascribing a value to the savings of the Wife, and hence to her contributions to the acquisition or improvement of the matrimonial property, is counterbalanced by the absence of evidence from the Husband’s side as well. The Husband relies on the income from the Businesses. What is not significantly substantiated however is how much could be determined to be his income from the Businesses. But it is likely that given the Businesses were ongoing and seemingly at least not tottering on the verge of collapse that the cash flow at least was sufficient to return a profit. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">91 The Wife traces her direct contributions ultimately to her savings, and to her investments from those savings over the years, as well as what was derived legitimately by her from the Businesses. First, the Wife avers that she had saved some $300,000 by the time the couple met – she argues that this was possible because she started working at a young age of nine in various occupations including as a cleaner, a factory worker, a seamstress, a babysitter, a waitress, and a cashier. In 1995, she held a few jobs concurrently and was able to earn between $3000 and $4000 a month. In 1996, she worked as a beautician during the day, and worked at a KTV lounge in the evenings, and became a beer promoter; by that time it was said that she could earn about $6000 monthly. The Wife accordingly claims that by 1996, she had fixed deposits with four banks amounting to $270,000.

</div>
</div> The Husband argues that the source of funds used to purchase the properties came from the cash collection from the Businesses. There is little direct evidence of this, however. There are no financial records showing the transfer from bank accounts or other sources. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">97 I accept that the evidence disclosed does show that the Husband had a substantial income during the time of the marriage, though the figure of $25,000 per month from the Businesses may be optimistic given that there is no clear indication of the expenses per month. Nonetheless, the income tax documents showing a substantial and sustainable income indicates that as between the Husband and Wife, the Husband would have likely been able to contribute much more in terms of direct contributions. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">98 At the point of the start of the marriage, the assets and contributions of the parties were to my mind largely to be ascribed to the Husband. I accept that the Businesses were started by the Husband and that he was the primary person responsible for the same. The Husband sought to downplay the Wife’s involvement in the Businesses, and the Wife for her part sought to claim the greater share of the Businesses. I find on the evidence before me that it is most likely the result of the joint contribution of both parties, although the Husband certainly contributed more in the Businesses, which weighed in his favour for direct financial contributions. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">99 Similarly, as regards the rental from the Husband that the Wife refers to in respect of the property at P2, the Husband argues that the rental income was claimed by the Wife only to allow her to boost her credit profile. As discussed above at [85], any rental previously paid or is presently owed is immaterial to the division of property. I do not also give it any weight in respect of the financial position of the Wife since the funds would have come from the Husband, even if she treated it as rental. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">100 As regards acquisition, I accept that acquisition could be taken to include payment of mortgage or other financing. However, there has to be some evidence of this. The difficulty again, as I mention in this case, is that there is largely a dearth of clear records. Despite the absence of clear evidence, given the financial position of the parties and the fact that some of these properties were worth millions, I find on balance that it was more likely than not that some contributions to the acquisition of assets were made during the period of the marriage. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">101 The Wife argues that the mortgage repayments for the various properties came solely from her, pointing to payments from her account. The Husband however contends that the funds in the account must be traced back to the Funds Pool, which were his. While the Wife has some documents showing at least the initial or some of the mortgage payments, the question of the ultimate source of the funds still had to be determined. Since I found that the Wife probably had some savings of her own (but not to the extent claimed), there was likely to have been some intermingling of funds.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">102 The Wife raises the point that the Husband did not know of some of the property purchases previously. However, to my mind, any ignorance on his part would not affect the Husband’s direct contributions if, as a matter of fact, funds attributable to him were indeed used to purchase these properties. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">103 In the circumstances, I have come to the conclusion that the Wife’s contributions were not as great as she indicates, and that the Wife’s assertions about her fount of means being her savings of $300,000 cannot be accepted. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">104 On the other side, I do note that the Husband relies on the Businesses generating the funds, which is alleged to have been available for the Wife to use “carte blanch[e]”.

</div> Again, there is not much by way of documentary evidence showing that the funds used to purchase the properties came directly from the Businesses.

As I noted in my decision on the matrimonial pool, while there was a substantial amount of documentation brought in by affidavit, the nature and force of these documents was perhaps less than in a usual divorce case, especially as regards the source of funds. Although both parties appear to be entrepreneurs focused on making a success of their respective business and investment activities, the maintaining of records and tracking of inflow and outflow seems to have been less of a priority. Matters were also complicated by the long period of cohabitation, while the period of formal marriage was relatively short. This meant that there was significant entanglement between matters relevant to the determination of direct contribution to the marriage, and the transactions and interactions between the parties during the period of cohabitation.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Indirect contributions</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">108 As for the indirect contributions, the Husband concedes that the Wife contributed more indirectly through the marriage.

</div> The choice of what properties to purchase, how long to hold for, and how much of the funds should be used were decisions made by the Wife. The exercise of these skills on a general basis throughout the marriage is to my mind sufficient to qualify as “indirect financial contributions” (see <span class="font-italic">ANJ v ANK</span> at [24]). I am not aware of any case law that would point against this. Recognising such decision-making as a form of indirect contribution, captures the effort and skill exercised by the spouse in question, which contributes to the welfare and prosperity of the family just as much as other efforts. But it should be borne in mind that not all such decisions would necessarily be recognised; much will depend on facts, including the number of occasions of the decision making or deliberation, and the amount involved each time. One-off decisions, or a few decisions done over a long period of time, is unlikely to qualify for recognition.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">110 The work done by the Wife in respect of the Businesses would also go towards her indirect financial contributions.

I accept that both the Husband and the Wife played a part in taking care of each other as well as the Wife’s son. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">112 Bearing these factors in mind, I find that the appropriate share of the indirect contributions would be 70% to the Wife and 30% to the Husband.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Ratio adjustment</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">113 I turn now to how this ratio between the direct and indirect contributions should be adjusted. The appropriate ratio adjustment has been considered in a number of cases. The Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">ANJ v ANK</span> noted that the length of the marriage, size of the assets, and the extent and nature of indirect contributions would impact on the relative weightage (at [27]). In relation to length of the marriage, greater weightage may be given to indirect contributions especially in long marriages (see [49] above, citing <span class="font-italic">ANJ v ANK</span>). For marriages of shorter length, it would be appropriate to adjust the ratio to give greater weight to the direct contributions (<span class="font-italic">ANJ v ANK</span> at [27a]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">114 In the circumstances here, I am of the view that given the short duration of the marriage, a far greater weight should be given to the direct contributions as opposed to the indirect contributions. A just and equitable weightage would give greater emphasis to the direct contributions, simply because indirect contributions would generally accumulate and be substantial only with a longer passage of time as compared to direct contributions; there may be situations where the indirect contributions, such as effort for the family life, may be significant, for instance, if substantial amount of care has to be expended in respect of a family member suffering from a disability, but there was nothing of that nature in the present case. Again, it must be emphasised that while the couple was together for a substantial time before marriage, none of this could, under the Women’s Charter as it stands, be taken into account, even in determining whether any ratio adjustment should be made – the powers of the Court under Part XII of the Women’s Charter are exercisable only in the context of a marriage. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">115 Taking everything into account, a weightage of 75:25 in favour of direct contributions is appropriate. A 60:40 split would seem too low given the duration and circumstances, including the lack of young children, while an 80:20 would give an overly negligible weightage to the Wife’s indirect contributions. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The appropriate ratio</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">116 Applying the approach in <span class="font-italic">AN</span><span class="font-italic">J v ANK</span>, the following ratios will need to be recalibrated:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Direct contributions: Wife to Husband: 30:70</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Indirect contributions: Wife to Husband: 70:30</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Ratio adjustment: Direct to indirect: 75:25</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">117 The weighted average of the Wife’s contributions is thus:</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"> ((30/100) x 75) + ((70/100) x 25) = 22.5 + 17.5 = 40.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">118 The weighted average of the Husband’s contributions is thus:</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"> ((70/100) x 75) + ((30/100) x 25) = 52.5 + 7.5 = 60.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Value of the matrimonial assets</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">119 The values of the assets are largely taken from the table of matrimonial assets jointly prepared by the Wife and the Husband (“the Table of Assets”) at the start of the proceedings (though the column in the table on valuation price was based on figures provided by the Husband). There were other valuations belatedly provided by the Wife on 30 April 2017. There was no opportunity to test this, and I did not wish to prolong matters further. Further, such evidence should not be brought in without leave of court, and specific directions. And certainly not at the stage where oral submissions are made. I thus did not consider this piece of evidence in the following analysis. I also do not think it is appropriate to reference the recent valuation – these were not valuation reports sourced from independent property valuers. For similar reasons, I also did not consider the mortgage statements that were tendered late in the day.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">120 The Wife points to contributions by her friends in various properties that formed part of the matrimonial pool. However, there is not that much documentary evidence of the respective stakes or contributions, but at the same time the Husband does not show that these purchases did not occur together with the Wife’s friends, and does not seriously take issue with the proportions the Wife claims to be the interest of her friends. Given that the Husband was not involved in these investment decisions himself, this is understandable, but it also means that I simply have to go with what little evidence there is. In the circumstances therefore, I find that the properties are held as the Wife claims.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">121 The Park Villas Property, the matrimonial home, was purchased in 2005 by the Wife as the sole owner. It was purchased at $750,000 and was sold at the price of $2,210,000 in 2015. The matrimonial home accordingly had a $1,460,000 value increase over the purchase price. As this was the matrimonial home however, the share accruing to the Husband is not merely the improvement, but the whole of the value. In the light of the language of s 112, as noted above at [60], it is the whole of the matrimonial property that is subject to division. Since the Wife received $1,836,182.97 in net sale proceeds from the sale of the Park Villas Property, the whole of this sum is to be divided. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">122 As regards the Park Villas Property, the Husband claims that this was sold at an undervalue, as he had a desktop valuation of up to $3.8m, and argues that the property was worth at least $3.6m. A desktop valuation is only a rough guide, and in the absence of any substantial evidence, which was not adduced earlier, I could not find that there was any undervalue to this transaction based on the evidence before me. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">123 For those assets for which acquisition occurred during the marriage, where such acquisition is taken to have wholly occurred during the marriage, the whole of the value of the property is subject to division; but where the acquisition during marriage is part of a transaction dating from before the marriage, only a pro-rata portion should be taken as part of the distributable value (see [60] and [62] above). Since there is no clear evidence on how much exactly was paid during the course of marriage for this latter category of properties, I have just taken the contribution of the parties to be proportional to the increase in value of the assets and, in the absence of any other evidence, used that to determine the respective contributions out of the whole pool. For the pre-marriage assets for which improvement occurred during the marriage, the attribution of the value increase during the marriage is taken to be from 2009 to 2013 (save for instances where the property was sold before 2013), as the interim judgment for divorce was granted on July 2013, while they were married on September 2009. I took this as four years of marriage. I do not think that taking matters on a more granular level, such as calculating by way of the precise date of marriage, to the month, would be helpful. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">124 With respect to the methodology, the overall increase in value from purchase is approximated as the value of the property in 2013 (or earlier if sold before 2013) less the purchase price and any outstanding loan at the time of the valuation, which was generally in 2013. The value of contribution during the period of marriage is then ascertained by calculating the average value increase per year on a straight line basis. In the absence of the respective valuations of the properties in 2009 and 2013, this is the closest approximation that can be done. The same is done with respect to properties that has already been sold except that the net sale proceeds is proportionately reduced to reflect only the increase in value during the marriage (sale price less purchase price) – needless to say, there is no need to consider any outstanding mortgage for these properties. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">125 In the circumstances, as a result of the methodology adopted, it mattered not whether the assets purchased before marriage fell under s 112(10)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)(ii) or s 112(10)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the Women’s Charter. However, this is not to be taken as a rule to be applied in future cases; the same approach is adopted for both on a rough and ready basis only because of the dearth of evidence in this case. Accordingly, taking the best evidence available, the value of the pre-marriage assets to be divided is as follows:</div><table class="table table-sm table-bordered"><tbody><tr><td><div class="Judg-1

</div> There is an absence of evidence about how this was accumulated. I am loathe to take a straight line allocation for this period as I do not consider that the evidence on either side justifies this: in particular, there is insufficient evidence on either side of continuous contribution. As such, I have only considered the $200,000 in the Wife’s CPF that would have been refunded as a result of the sale of the Park Villas Property.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">131 This gives a total value of $1,836,182.97 (Park Villas Property) + $4,074,964.74 (pre-marriage properties) + $2,494,786.59 (properties acquired during marriage) + $750,000 (Businesses) + $441,645.80 (the Vehicles) + $425,384.64 (the Bank Accounts) + $1,000,000 (the Shares) + $200,000 (the CPF moneys) = $11,222,964.74. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">132 </span>Applying the division of 60% to the Husband and 40% to the Wife, this should result in the following values: the Husband receives $6,733,778.84 and the Wife receives $4,489,185.90.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">133 </span>Any rental received as income during the period of marriage is not a matrimonial asset and in the absence of evidence that it went to the acquisition of assets as well as given the circumstances and uncertainties inherent in this case, it would not be appropriate to trace this contribution separately. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Allocation</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">134 A number of factors that typically feature in the determination of allocation are absent here – there are no children to the marriage and no specific accommodation needs to be made for any minor child outside the marriage either. In these circumstances, the allocation will need to take into account the present activities and work of the parties. And as far as possible, parties should continue in their habitual homes, and properties they use. But all of these would be subject to the division of the property as a whole. In the following allocation, I endeavour to allocate mostly in line with the parties’ respective wishes. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">135 The Husband has asked for B4 and B5 to be transferred to him.

</div> Since I found above at [97] that the Businesses were started by the Husband, who also contributed more to these businesses, it should follow that the businesses presently in the Wife’s name (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, B4 and B5) should also be transferred to him. This would then mean that all the Businesses would be in the Husband’s name. Following that, the total value of the matrimonial assets in the Husband’s name, including his share of The Sky, the Vehicles and the Bank Accounts, would come up to a total of about $1.038m. The remaining shortfall of about $5.7m has to be made up through the transfer of some properties by the Wife. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">136 The Husband has also specifically asked for P1 and P2 to be transferred to him.

</div> Since these properties are integral to the Businesses, it would make sense for him to own these properties as well. Since these properties are worth a total of $7,011,662.75 (valuation less the outstanding mortgage as of 2013), he would need to make a transfer of the additional sum of about $1.31m to the Wife in order for her to transfer these two properties to him without any cash consideration. He may also wish to reduce this figure by transferring his half share in The Sky to the Wife. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">137 Whether any right can be asserted in general law on the other properties is not necessarily determined by the discontinuance of the Civil Claim. And the ultimate effect of the discontinuance on other matters is not before me. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Maintenance </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">138 The Wife’s claim on maintenance can be dealt with briefly since it is not the mainstay of the Wife’s claim. As provided under s 114(2) of the Women’s Charter, I have to: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… endeavour so to place the parties, so far as it is practicable and, having regard to their conduct, just to do so, in the financial position in which they would have been if the marriage had not broken down and each had properly discharged his or her financial obligations and responsibilities towards the other.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">139 Considering several of the factors listed in s 114(1) of the Women’s Charter, I am not inclined to grant any maintenance to the Wife. The foremost consideration is that the court’s power to order maintenance is “supplementary” to its power to divide matrimonial assets (see <span class="font-italic">ATE v ATD</span> [2016] SGCA 2 (“<span class="font-italic">ATE v ATD</span>”) at [33]). In the present case, the significant pool of matrimonial assets that I have awarded the Wife is a key factor; she can claim rental income from these assets as a substitute for any reasonable maintenance from the Husband. This is not a run-off-the-mill case where the Wife only received a share of one property or merely just one or two properties as a result of the division. The short duration of marriage and the significantly younger age of the Wife as compared to the Husband also militated against the award of any maintenance. Bearing in mind the Court of Appeal’s observations in <span class="font-italic">ATE v ATD</span> that nominal maintenance should not be ordered “automatically or as a matter of course” (at [28]), I am also not convinced that the present case warranted a preservation of the Wife’s right to apply for maintenance in the future. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Orders </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">140 Directions will be given for a hearing on the specific orders.
