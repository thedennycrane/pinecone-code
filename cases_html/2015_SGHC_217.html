        Chao Hick Tin JA:</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       The appellant pleaded guilty to four
                    drug-related charges, with nine other drug-related charges taken into
                    consideration, and was given a total sentence of 17 years and three
                    months’ imprisonment and 18 strokes of the cane. He now appeals
                    against sentence. The four charges to which he pleaded guilty and the
                    corresponding sentences imposed were as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_1-p2_a"></a>(a)     One charge for trafficking 11.64
                        grams of methamphetamine – 16 years’ imprisonment and 15 strokes
                        of the cane;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_1-p2_b"></a>(b)     One
                        charge for consumption of methamphetamine – five years’
                        imprisonment and three strokes of the cane; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_1-p2_c"></a>(c)     Two charges for possession of two different
                        Class A drugs – 15 months’ imprisonment on each
                        charge.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>The sentence for one of the possession charges was ordered to run
                    consecutively with the sentence for the trafficking charge.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       This was not the first time the appellant had
                    committed drug-related offences: he had prior convictions for drug trafficking
                    and consumption. In view of these antecedents, the mandatory minimum sentences
                    prescribed under the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2008 Rev Ed)
                    (“MDA”) applied for both the trafficking charge and the
                    consumption charge. As to the trafficking charge, since methamphetamine is a
                    Class A drug, under s 33(4A)(i) of the MDA, the minimum sentence was
                    10 years’ imprisonment and 10 strokes of the cane. As for the
                    consumption charge, since the appellant also had a prior admission to a Drug
                    Rehabilitation Centre, under s 33A(1) of the MDA the minimum sentence was
                    five years’ imprisonment and three strokes of the cane.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       The appellant’s previous convictions for
                    drug trafficking and consumption were handed down in 1997. At just 17 years
                    of age, he pleaded guilty to three drug-related charges, with a further two
                    drug-related charges taken into consideration. The total sentence imposed on him
                    was 15 years’ imprisonment and 24 strokes of the cane. The three
                    charges to which he pleaded guilty and the corresponding sentences imposed for
                    those charges were as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_3-p2_a"></a>(a)     One charge for trafficking
                        297.2 grams of cannabis – 14 years’ imprisonment and
                        12 strokes of the cane;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_3-p2_b"></a>(b)     One charge for trafficking 623.2 grams of cannabis
                        mixture – 14 years’ imprisonment and 12 strokes of the
                        cane; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_3-p2_c"></a>(c)     One
                        charge for the offence of consumption of “Ecstasy” – one
                        year’s imprisonment.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>The sentence for the consumption charge was ordered to run
                    consecutively with the sentence for one of the trafficking charges. The
                    appellant completed serving sentence on 7 February 2007. Subsequent to
                    that, and before his present brush with the law, the appellant committed an
                    offence of disorderly behaviour in 2007, for which he was fined $600, and
                    offences of voluntarily causing hurt in 2012, for which he was fined a total of
                    $2,400.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Facts</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       The pertinent facts relating to the charges
                    which are the subject of this appeal are these. On 11 March 2013, narcotics
                    officers raided the appellant’s flat and found a number of items on the
                    floor of his bedroom that were subsequently analysed and found to contain drugs.
                    In particular, there were yellow tablets and a yellow substance that contained a
                    total of 1.24 grams of N,a-Dimethyl-3,4-(methylenedioxy)phenethylamine, a
                    Class A drug. This gave rise to one of the charges for possession of a
                    Class A drug. The appellant was arrested and later released on
                bail.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       Subsequently, on 12 June 2013, while the
                    appellant was out on bail, he was arrested by narcotics officers. A car key was
                    found in the appellant’s possession but he refused to divulge the
                    vehicle’s location. The narcotics officers eventually used the key to gain
                    access to a vehicle parked in the carpark where the arrest took place. A number
                    of packets of crystalline substance were found in the vehicle and in the
                    appellant’s possession. These packets were analysed as three different
                    exhibits and were found to contain 11.64, 7.76 and 0.97 grams of
                    methamphetamine. Investigations revealed that the packets containing
                    11.64 grams of methamphetamine were meant for sale to one Chua for an
                    agreed price of $1,350, and that the remaining packets – containing a
                    total of 8.73 grams of methamphetamine – were meant for the
                    appellant’s own consumption. This gave rise to the trafficking charge as
                    well as the other charge for possession of a Class A drug.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       Following the appellant’s arrest, a urine
                    sample was taken from him and analysed. The sample was found to contain
                    methamphetamine. This gave rise to the consumption charge.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The enhanced sentencing regime for repeat drug traffickers</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       Drug trafficking is an offence under s 5(1)
                    of the MDA. The punishments to be imposed for this offence are defined in the
                    Second Schedule of the MDA. Minimum and maximum sentences are laid down
                    according to the type of drugs trafficked, <em>ie</em>,
                    whether they are Class A, B or C drugs. In addition to this general regime,
                    harsher punishments are prescribed where the quantity of certain drugs –
                    such as methamphetamine, cannabis and diamorphine – exceeds stipulated
                    levels.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       The punishments laid down in the Second Schedule
                    are applicable where an offender is convicted of drug trafficking for the first
                    time. But if the offender has been convicted of drug trafficking on one or more
                    previous occasions, then his subsequent offences of the same nature will attract
                    enhanced minimum and maximum sentences depending on the class of drugs
                    trafficked and the quantity pursuant to s 33(4A) of the MDA which took
                    effect in May 2013. For Class A drugs, the minimum sentence is
                    10 years’ imprisonment and 10 strokes of the cane, and the
                    maximum is 30 years’ imprisonment and 15 strokes of the cane.
                    Section 33(4A)(i) provides:</p>

<p class="Judg-Quote-2">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The decision below</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       In the present case, the District Judge was
                    obliged to impose a minimum sentence of 10 years’ imprisonment and 10
                    strokes of the cane on the appellant for the trafficking charge because of his
                    earlier drug trafficking convictions. In the result, the District Judge thought
                    fit to impose a sentence which exceeded that minimum by a margin of six
                    years’ imprisonment and five strokes of the cane. He gave his reasons in
                    his grounds of decision published as <em>Public Prosecutor v Loo
                        Pei Xiang Alan</em> [2015] SGDC 89 (“the
                GD”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     On the trafficking charge, the District Judge
                    agreed with defence counsel’s submission that the appellant’s drug
                    trafficking antecedents “would have been factored into the prescribed
                    mandatory minimum sentence”. But he held that there were a number of
                    aggravating factors that together showed the appellant’s “blatant
                    disregard” for the law and his “contemptuous attitude”
                    towards it. These factors were: (i) he committed the offence while on bail,
                    (ii) the drugs involved were Class A drugs, and (iii) he stood to
                    gain a profit of $1,350. In the circumstances, the District Judge thought that
                    the length of the imprisonment term to be imposed for this charge “should
                    be significantly more than the previous sentence of 14 years
                    imprisonment”, and he accordingly ordered 16 years’
                    imprisonment (at [15]–[16] of the GD).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     On the consumption charge, the District Judge
                    “did not find any compelling reason to impose an imprisonment term of
                    more than the mandatory minimum of five years”. Accordingly, he so
                    sentenced the appellant (at [13] of the GD). On the two possession charges, the
                    District Judge noted that the drugs were Class A drugs and that the
                    quantity of drugs in the appellant’s possession “could not be said
                    to be small”. That, coupled with the appellant’s “blatant
                    disregard for the law”, warranted in his view a sentence of
                    15 months’ imprisonment for each charge (at [17] of the GD). Finally,
                    considering the total sentence to impose, the District Judge opined that
                    17 years and three months’ imprisonment and 18 strokes of the cane
                    was “[neither] disproportionate nor crushing” (at [20] of the
                    GD).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The consumption and possession charges</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     I should say at the outset that I do not think
                    the sentences imposed on the consumption and possession charges should be
                    disturbed. The sentence of five years’ imprisonment and three strokes of
                    the cane imposed on the consumption charge was the minimum that the District
                    Judge could have imposed, and hence it cannot possibly be said to be excessive.
                    As for the possession charges, the amounts of drugs involved were not very
                    substantial, but given the appellant’s recalcitrance and disregard for the
                    law in re-offending on bail, I do not think the sentence of
                    15 months’ imprisonment for each charge can be said to be manifestly
                    excessive.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The trafficking charge</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The small quantity of drugs trafficked</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     All that remains for consideration is the
                    sentence for the trafficking charge. In my view, the proper starting point in
                    determining the appropriate sentence is the quantity of methamphetamine
                    trafficked. This is because, as Sundaresh Menon CJ noted in the very recent
                    decision of <em>Vasentha d/o Joseph v Public
                        Prosecutor</em> [2015] SGHC 197 (“<em>Vasentha</em>”), the sentencing framework in the MDA for drug
                    trafficking “rests primarily on the <em>type</em>
                    and <em>quantity</em> of the drugs” (at [14]),
                    meaning that “the quantity of drugs involved in a trafficking charge will
                    inevitably have a strong bearing on the sentence to be imposed in any given
                    case” – a sensible approach given that “the quantity of the
                    drugs will usually be proportionate to the harm” that would be caused to
                    society, and would thus serve “as a reliable indicator of the seriousness
                    of the offence” (at [23]).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Guidance from the indicative starting points for first-time
                offenders</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     In <em>Vasentha</em>,
                    Menon CJ further developed this notion of a correlation between the
                    quantity of drugs trafficked and the sentences to be imposed by establishing the
                    following “indicative starting points” for sentencing first-time
                    offenders trafficking in diamorphine (which his case was concerned with)
                    according to the quantity of diamorphine trafficked (at [47]):</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     These indicative starting points pronounced in
                        <em>Vasentha</em> are of course not strictly applicable
                    to the appellant in this case since he is not a first-time offender. Moreover,
                    Menon CJ took pains to emphasise that the indicative starting points were
                    not determinative of the sentence but would have to be adjusted where
                    appropriate “to reflect the offender’s culpability and the presence
                    of aggravating or mitigating circumstances” (at [48]), such as whether
                    the offender was directing the drug trade on a commercial scale, or involving
                    others in the operation, or motivated by financial or other advantage, or
                    performing only a limited function under direction (at [51]). Indeed, on the
                    facts of that case, Menon CJ thought that “a significant reduction
                    from the indicative starting point” would be warranted (at
                [80]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     Nevertheless, I think it is appropriate for me
                    to take some measure of guidance from the indicative starting points in
                        <em>Vasentha</em>. There is no reason why the quantity
                    of drugs trafficked should not be a vital determinant in sentencing repeat
                    offenders as it is in sentencing first-time offenders; I cannot imagine it was
                    Parliament’s design in enacting s 33(4A) of the MDA to diminish the
                    relevance of that factor. The indicative starting points in <em>Vasentha</em> demonstrate, in a rough and general way, the proper
                    relationship between the quantity of drugs trafficked and the sentence to be
                    imposed, bearing in mind the need to utilise the full sentencing range
                    prescribed by the statute. Since this relationship holds in cases involving
                    repeat trafficking offenders, <em>Vasentha</em> is
                    pertinent even in the present appeal. Let me explain.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Indicative starting points where the drug trafficked is
                methamphetamine</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     I am cognisant of the fact that the drug
                    trafficked in <em>Vasentha</em> was diamorphine whereas the
                    drug in this case was methamphetamine. Trafficking one gram of diamorphine is of
                    course not necessarily equivalent to trafficking one gram of methamphetamine.
                    But I consider that it is possible to derive some sort of conversion scale, or
                    “exchange rate”, so to speak, between diamorphine and
                    methamphetamine. This is because the Second Schedule of the MDA prescribes the
                    exact same minimum and maximum punishments for trafficking between 10 and
                    15 grams of diamorphine and trafficking between 167 and 250 grams of
                    methamphetamine – the minimum is 20 years’ imprisonment and 15
                    strokes of the cane, and the maximum is imprisonment for life or 30 years
                    and 15 strokes of the cane. This means that, all other things being equal,
                    an offender who traffics between 10 and 15 grams of diamorphine is to be
                    considered <em>as culpable as</em> a person who traffics
                    between 167 and 250 grams of methamphetamine. Doing the arithmetic, the
                    culpability of an offender who traffics one gram of diamorphine is equivalent to
                    the culpability of an identically-situated offender who traffics 16.7 grams
                    of methamphetamine.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     In the present case, the quantity of
                    methamphetamine trafficked was 11.64 grams. That is not a large amount, as
                    the District Judge himself noted (at [14] of the GD). Applying the conversion
                    scale which I have indicated in the preceding paragraph, trafficking
                    11.64 grams of methamphetamine is an act of equivalent culpability to
                    trafficking 0.70 grams of diamorphine. Returning to the indicative starting
                    points in <em>Vasentha</em>, that quantity of diamorphine
                    would fall within the <em>lower end</em> of the <em>lowest band</em> encompassing quantities under 3 grams.
                    Had the appellant in this case been a first-time offender, the indicative
                    starting point for trafficking 11.64 grams of methamphetamine would thus
                    have been five to six years’ imprisonment and five to six strokes of the
                    cane.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Precedents involving first-time traffickers in
                methamphetamine</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     The Prosecution has brought to my attention
                    two precedents in which first-time traffickers who dealt in similar quantities
                    of methamphetamine were given sentences that exceeded this indicative starting
                    point for the lowest band indicated in <em>Vasentha</em> by
                    a substantial amount. To that extent these precedents might appear at first
                    glance to be inconsistent with the indicative starting points in <em>Vasentha</em>. In <em>Public Prosecutor v Ng
                        Kian Hoe</em> [2012] SGDC 364 (“<em>Ng Kian
                        Hoe</em>”), the offender was sentenced to eight years’
                    imprisonment and five strokes of the cane for trafficking 19.77 grams of
                    methamphetamine. He appealed against sentence but I dismissed the appeal in
                    January 2013. In <em>Seah Soon Huat William v Public
                        Prosecutor</em> [2001] SGDC 366 (“<em>Seah
                        William</em>”), the offender was sentenced to eight
                    years’ imprisonment and six strokes of the cane for trafficking
                    20.69 grams of methamphetamine. He lodged an appeal but subsequently
                    withdrew it.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     In my view, <em>Ng Kian
                        Hoe</em> and <em>Seah William</em> do not suggest
                    that the indicative starting points suggested in <em>Vasentha</em> are inapplicable where the drug trafficked is
                    methamphetamine and not diamorphine. On the premise that trafficking about
                    20 grams of methamphetamine is of equal culpability to trafficking
                    1.20 grams of diamorphine such that the indicative starting point is five
                    to six years’ imprisonment and five to six strokes of the cane, the
                    circumstances of those two precedents disclose significant aggravating factors
                    that provide ample justification for going well beyond that starting point. In
                        <em>Ng Kian Hoe</em>, the key aggravating factor was
                    that the offender “had an established pattern of procuring and selling
                    his drugs” for profit and was not merely a “naïve or inexperienced
                    dealer” (at [14]–[15]). In <em>Seah
                        William</em>, the key aggravating factor was that the offender had
                    “jumped bail” and failed to attend the mention at which he was to
                    have pleaded guilty, and had committed his trafficking offence while on the run
                    (at [15]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     That said, I should express reservations about
                    observations that were made in these two precedents. In <em>Ng
                        Kian Hoe</em>, the District Judge expressed the view that the quantity
                    of methamphetamine trafficked – 19.77 grams – was
                    “fairly high” (at [14]), and in <em>Seah
                        William</em>, the District Judge opined that 20.69 grams of the
                    drug was a “large” quantity (at [14]). With respect, I do not
                    think the District Judges were quite correct to characterise the quantity of
                    methamphetamine trafficked in that manner. Although 20 grams of
                    methamphetamine is not an insignificant amount, it is not large either. As I
                    have said, it would fall within the <em>lowest band</em> of
                    indicative starting points mentioned in <em>Vasentha</em>,
                    and it is in this context that the seriousness of trafficking that quantity of
                    methamphetamine should be assessed.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The indicative starting point and aggravating factors in this
                case</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     Returning to the present case, I reiterate
                    that, had the appellant been a first-time offender, the indicative starting
                    point for trafficking 11.64 grams of methamphetamine would have been that
                    for the lowest band pronounced in <em>Vasentha</em>, which
                    is five to six years’ imprisonment and five to six strokes of the cane.
                    Given this position, I think that the indicative starting point for trafficking
                    that quantity of methamphetamine for a repeat offender would be very close to
                    the mandatory minimum of 10 years’ imprisonment and 10 strokes
                    of the cane stipulated by s 33(4A) of the MDA, if not the minimum
                    itself.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     Therefore, given the small quantity of
                    methamphetamine trafficked by the appellant, there has to be good reason to
                    impose a sentence that exceeds the mandatory minimum by a significant amount of
                    six years’ imprisonment and five strokes of the cane. The Prosecution in
                    its submissions cited certain excerpts from the speech of Mr Teo Chee Hean, the
                    Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Home Affairs, in Parliament during the
                    second reading of the Misuse of Drugs (Amendment) Bill (<em>Singapore Parliamentary Debates</em>, <em>Official
                        Report</em> (12 November 2012) vol 89) in order to make the point
                    that drug trafficking squarely engages the principle of general deterrence,
                    particularly when the drug trafficked is methamphetamine:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">On the supply side, we are seeing greater quantities of methamphetamine
                        and heroin being trafficked through Southeast Asia. This has worsened the
                        regional drug situation, with a significant number of clandestine
                        laboratories operating in East and Southeast Asia. …</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Mr Speaker, Sir, the threat posed by organised drug syndicates is a very
                        serious one. The global drug situation is worsening, with the number of drug
                        users across the world increasing from 180 million to some
                        210 million over the last decade. Within our own region, the drug
                        problem has become worse. Illicit drugs draw thousands of people every year
                        into a web of addiction and despair. Their family members and the rest of
                        society also pay a heavy price.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Those who trade in illegal drugs are still attracted by the huge financial
                        gains to be made, and deterring them requires the strictest enforcement
                        coupled with the severest of penalties.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">We deal with the drug problem comprehensively by tackling both the demand
                        and supply factors. On the demand side, we educate the young about the
                        harmful effects of drugs, and impose severe penalties, including long-term
                        sentences, on those who abuse drugs. …</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The measures in this Bill will send a strong deterrent message and enhance
                        operational effectiveness of our enforcement agencies. They strengthen our
                        ability to curb the demand for and the supply of drugs, in particular our
                        ability to act against and deter those who target the young.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     In my view, these broad and general statements
                    in Parliament do not assist the Prosecution in the present case. At best, they
                    explain why mandatory minimum sentences were thought to be necessary for repeat
                    drug traffickers. I accept that general deterrence is a primary consideration in
                    sentencing drug traffickers, and that is reflected in the minimum sentence that
                    should be imposed for a repeat offender. But that hardly suggests that sentences
                    for repeat drug trafficking should ordinarily or usually exceed the prescribed
                    minimum by a substantial amount. On the contrary, Parliament must have
                    considered that there would be cases of repeat drug trafficking that would
                    warrant no more than 10 years’ imprisonment and 10 strokes of the
                    cane; obviously the discretion granted to the court is to enable the sentencing
                    judge to impose an appropriate sentence having regard to the quantity of the
                    drugs trafficked as well all the other pertinent circumstances.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     Thus I reiterate that there has to be good
                    reason on the facts of the instant case to justify the sentence of
                    16 years’ imprisonment and 15 strokes of the cane on the trafficking
                    charge. In my judgment, it is not good enough reason that the appellant is a
                    repeat offender; that aggravating factor has, as indicated in the preceding
                    paragraph, already been taken into account in the stipulation of a mandatory
                    minimum sentence, and as Menon CJ warned in <em>Vasentha</em>, it “would not be appropriate to have regard to
                    the offender’s relevant antecedents <em>to the extent these
                        have already been taken into account</em> in an enhanced sentencing
                    regime” as that would constitute “double-counting” (at
                    [55]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     The District Judge also thought that a stiffer
                    sentence was warranted because the appellant stood to gain $1,350 in
                    “profit” (at [15] of the GD). In the first place, I do not think
                    that was indeed the extent of the appellant’s profit – according to
                    the Statement of Facts, the “agreed price was about” $1,350. The
                    appellant says that, after deducting the cost of the drugs from the agreed
                    price, his profit was no more than $150, and even if that is not the exact
                    figure there is every reason to believe that the appellant’s profit was
                    much less than $1,350. The District Judge thus appears to have overstated the
                    appellant’s blameworthiness.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     More fundamentally, where repeat traffickers
                    are concerned, I do not think the fact that the offender stands to profit
                    financially from drug trafficking or the fact that the offender appears to be
                    more than a mere “courier” or pawn are significant aggravating
                    factors. This is because, for the vast majority of repeat traffickers, the
                    primary reason that they re-offend is probably a desire for financial gain.
                    First-time traffickers, in contrast, are likely to have more diverse motivations
                    in that many of them may have been pressured by their peers into criminal
                    activity or committed their offences unthinkingly in youthful folly, meaning
                    that many of them might not have been drawn into their criminal activity by the
                    prospect of profit such that it would be meaningful to distinguish between those
                    who are profit-driven and those who are not. Also, repeat traffickers are by
                    definition highly unlikely to be naïve and incidental participants in the drug
                    trade. It is to be expected such repeat traffickers are in the business for the
                    money either to feed their own drug addiction or to make money for some other
                    purposes. Thus I consider that the fact of financial profit <em>per se</em> and the fact that the offender cannot be characterised as
                    inexperienced and ignorant in the world of illicit drugs have already been taken
                    into account as aggravating factors in the prescription of a mandatory minimum
                    sentence, and it would generally be double-counting to consider them aggravating
                    factors that warrant a further increase beyond that minimum. It may not be
                    double-counting where a repeat trafficker’s trade is unusually lucrative
                    or where he is particularly experienced or established in the drug trade. Even
                    so, it is likely that the quantity of drugs involved will be larger and that in
                    turn will undoubtedly attract a higher sentence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     The District Judge also thought that another
                    aggravating factor was that the drug trafficked by the appellant was a
                    Class A drug (at [15] of the GD). In my view, however, the District Judge
                    committed an error of double-counting. Given that s 33(4A) of the MDA
                    prescribes different mandatory minimum sentences for Class A, B and C
                    drugs, the fact that a Class A drug was trafficked has already been taken into
                    account as an aggravating factor and should not be given additional weight.
                    Although the Minister highlighted that greater quantities of methamphetamine
                    (and heroin) were being trafficked in the excerpts from his speech in Parliament
                    reproduced above (at [23]), I do not think that this suggests that higher
                    sentences should be imposed for trafficking methamphetamine than for trafficking
                    other Class A drugs. In the absence of specific provision in the MDA that
                    trafficking methamphetamine should attract even higher sentences, I cannot read
                    the Minister’s comments as indicating that this drug should be singled out
                    for special treatment. Taken at their highest, those comments merely explain the
                    context and background against which the amendments to the MDA were
                    proposed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     In my judgment, there is only one good reason
                    for elevating the appellant’s sentence beyond the indicative starting
                    point – which is very close to or at the mandatory minimum of
                    10 years’ imprisonment and 10 strokes of the cane – and it
                    is the fact that he committed the offences while out on bail. It
                    demonstrates a disregard for the law and a recalcitrance that calls for an
                    increased sentence on principles of specific deterrence and prevention. But I do
                    not think that this factor alone warrants a sharp increase of six years’
                    imprisonment and five strokes of the cane from the minimum. I am therefore of
                    the opinion that, for the trafficking charge, the sentence of
                    16 years’ imprisonment and 15 strokes of the cane imposed on the
                    appellant by the District Judge was manifestly excessive. In my view,
                    12 years’ imprisonment, two years more than the prescribed minimum,
                    and 10 strokes of the cane would be an appropriate sentence.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Precedents involving repeat traffickers</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     The sentence of 12 years’ imprisonment
                    and 10 strokes of the cane is not out of line with precedents. In <em>Public Prosecutor v Muhammad Raffie Bin Saide</em> [2015]
                    SGDC 115 (“<em>Muhammad Raffie</em>”), a case
                    from the State Courts, the offender was a repeat trafficker who was sentenced to
                    12 years’ imprisonment and 10 strokes of the cane on a trafficking
                    charge under s 33(4A) of the MDA. That case involved 9.01 grams of
                    diamorphine, a much larger amount of drugs than in this case. But this was
                    thought to warrant an increase of just two years’ imprisonment from the
                    mandatory minimum, and the prosecution did not lodge an appeal against sentence.
                    An identical sentence of 12 years’ imprisonment and 10 strokes
                    of the cane in this case would not, by comparison, be at all inadequate. I
                    should add that in light of the sentences imposed on the offender in <em>Muhammad Raffie</em> on account of other drug related charges
                    brought against him, he received a global sentence of 14 years’
                    imprisonment and 24 strokes of the cane.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     Another precedent is <em>Public
                        Prosecutor v Tan Thiam Eng</em> [2014] SGDC 430 (“<em>Tan Thiam Eng</em>”). The offender there was convicted
                    after trial of trafficking 8.59 grams of ketamine, a Class A drug, and
                    since he had trafficking antecedents he was liable to the mandatory minimum of
                    10 years’ imprisonment and 10 strokes of the cane. He was sentenced
                    to 10 years and nine months’ imprisonment and 10 strokes of the cane
                    on this charge, and as he also pleaded guilty to three other drug-related
                    charges, his total sentence was 12 years and nine months’
                    imprisonment and 10 strokes of the cane. The offender’s appeal against
                    sentence in Magistrate’s Appeal No 156 of 2014 was dismissed on
                    16 January 2015.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     In imposing sentence, the trial judge in
                        <em>Tan Thiam Eng</em> took into account the
                    offender’s egregious behaviour in conducting his defence at trial: he
                    observed that the offender had “cast baseless aspersions” against
                    prosecution witnesses and had “wasted Court and Prosecution’s time
                    in protracting the case”, unequivocally demonstrating that he was
                    “not remorseful” (at [40] of the trial judge’s decision).
                    The trial judge went so far as to say that the offender was “toying with
                    the system” (at [41]). Despite these strong criticisms of the
                    offender’s conduct, the trial judge thought fit to exceed the minimum
                    sentence for the trafficking charge by just nine months’ imprisonment.
                    This suggests that it would not be inadequate in the present case to add two
                    years’ imprisonment to the mandatory minimum.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     The final precedent is <em>Public Prosecutor v Mohammed Shahdat Bin Mohd Kemarudin</em> [2012]
                    SGDC 312 (“<em>Mohammed Shahdat</em>”), which
                    the Prosecution brought to my notice. The offender was a repeat trafficker who
                    trafficked 18.92 grams of methamphetamine, which is not much more than the
                    quantity trafficked in the instant case; this offender had not merely one but
                    two trafficking antecedents, for which he had been sentenced in 1988 to a stint
                    of three years’ duration in a juvenile home and in 1994 to
                    10 years’ imprisonment and 10 strokes of the cane (at [9]). For his
                    latest trafficking offence he was sentenced to 13 years’ imprisonment
                    and 13 strokes of the cane. His appeal to the High Court was dismissed.
                    This case was disposed of before the mandatory minimum sentences for repeat
                    traffickers prescribed in s 33(4A) of the MDA came into effect in May 2013,
                    but in my judgment the sentence imposed there would have been appropriate within
                    the current regime of enhanced punishments.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     I should mention that in <em>Mohammed Shahdat</em> the offender had numerous previous convictions,
                    not only for drug-related offences but also for robbery and a sexual offence.
                    The District Judge thought that it was right to impose 13 years’
                    imprisonment and 13 strokes of the cane in view of the “persistent
                    pattern of reoffending” and the fact that the offender had committed his
                    most recent set of offences “soon after release from custody” (at
                    [20]). Although the appellant in the present case has exhibited a degree of
                    recalcitrance, his re-offending is not as protracted and pronounced as that of
                    the offender in this precedent, and accordingly I do not think it would be wrong
                    to impose a lower sentence of 12 years’ imprisonment and 10 strokes
                    of the cane in the present case.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Relevance of the sentences imposed in respect of the
                appellant’s antecedents</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     It seems that an important reason why the
                    District Judge thought a sentence of 16 years’ imprisonment and 15
                    strokes of the cane was warranted was that the sentence for this trafficking
                    charge ought to be more severe than the sentence imposed on the appellant for
                    his previous trafficking charges in 1997, which was 14 years’
                    imprisonment and 12 strokes of the cane on each charge (see [16] of the GD). To
                    the extent that this suggests that the sentence for a repeat trafficking charge
                    must <em>necessarily or categorically</em> be higher than
                    the sentence for a prior trafficking charge, it is wrong in principle. The
                    specific circumstances of the charges cannot be disregarded, and it is not
                    difficult to envisage situations in which an offender would be less culpable on
                    the subsequent occasion than on the earlier one, <em>eg</em>, where the quantity of drugs trafficked on the subsequent
                    occasion was significantly smaller than that trafficked on the earlier
                    occasion.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     Here, the amounts of drugs trafficked in
                    respect of the 1997 charges were very much more substantial than the amount
                    trafficked in respect of the present charge. As to the 1997 charges,
                    297.2 grams of cannabis and 623.2 grams of cannabis mixture were
                    trafficked. The Second Schedule of the MDA prescribes a minimum sentence of
                    20 years’ imprisonment and 15 strokes of the cane for trafficking
                    between 330 and 500 grams of cannabis and between 660 and 1,000 grams
                    of cannabis mixture; the quantities of cannabis and cannabis mixture trafficked
                    by the appellant on that earlier occasion thus came fairly close to the
                    threshold beyond which a very hefty minimum sentence would have to be imposed.
                    What this goes to show is that the 1997 charges concerned a large amount of
                    drugs. The present trafficking charge, on the other hand, pertains to
                    11.64 grams of methamphetamine, and that, as I have endeavoured to show, is
                    a relatively small amount. As I have endeavoured to show at [13] to [18] above,
                    the quantum of the drugs trafficked is a weighty factor in determining the
                    severity of the punishment.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Conclusion on the trafficking charge</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     Seen in this light, it is a wholly acceptable
                    outcome if the sentence for the present trafficking charge is less severe than
                    the sentence imposed for each of the 1997 trafficking charges. I see no
                    impediment so far to the course of action I am inclined to take, which is to
                    reduce the sentence for the present trafficking charge to 12 years’
                    imprisonment and 10 strokes of the cane.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The total sentence</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     The District Judge decided that the sentence
                    for the trafficking charge should run consecutively with the sentence for one of
                    the possession charges. But since I am minded to reduce the sentence for the
                    trafficking charge to 12 years’ imprisonment and 10 strokes of the
                    cane, the question then is whether it is appropriate to order that this reduced
                    sentence run consecutively with the sentence for the consumption charge instead,
                    which is five years’ imprisonment and three strokes of the cane. That
                    would result in a total sentence of 17 years’ imprisonment and 13
                    strokes of the cane, not far off from the total sentence of 17 years and
                    three months’ imprisonment and 18 strokes of the cane imposed by the
                    District Judge.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     In my judgment, it would not be right to order
                    that the sentences for the trafficking and consumption charges run
                    consecutively. The reason is that both the charges attracted mandatory minimum
                    sentences due to the appellant’s antecedents. Running the sentences
                    consecutively would be tantamount to “double-whammy” of an
                    aggravating factor – the appellant’s re-offending. Accordingly, the
                    sentence for the trafficking charge should run consecutively with the sentence
                    for one of the possession charges, as the District Judge ordered.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     This would make the total sentence
                    13 years and three months’ imprisonment and 13 strokes of the cane. I
                    consider this an appropriate sentence taking into account the appellant’s
                    overall criminality as manifested in the four charges proceeded with and the
                    nine taken into consideration. No doubt it is less than the total sentence
                    imposed on the appellant in respect of the 1997 charges, which was
                    15 years’ imprisonment and 24 strokes of the cane. But I see no
                    reason why that is wrong in principle – there is no reason why the total
                    sentence imposed when an offender has re-offended should necessarily or
                    categorically be higher than the sentence imposed for his previous convictions.
                    It must necessarily depend on the circumstances. And given that the
                    appellant’s 1997 offences involved a much larger quantity of drugs, I see
                    no difficulty if the total sentence imposed on the appellant now is lower than
                    that imposed on him in 1997.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     Instead, a global sentence of 13 years
                    and three months’ imprisonment and 13 strokes of the cane appears to
                    be appropriate given that the offender in <em>Muhammad
                        Raffie</em> received a global sentence that was not a great deal
                    higher than what I propose to impose on the appellant in this case. This is even
                    though the offender in <em>Muhammad Raffie</em> can be
                    considered to be substantially more culpable overall than the appellant in this
                    case. I consider that the offender in <em>Muhammad
                        Raffie</em> was more culpable because he faced roughly the same number
                    of charges which were broadly of a similar nature to the ones in the present
                    case, except that the trafficking charges in <em>Muhammad
                        Raffie</em> concerned a much larger quantity of drugs than in the
                    present case – the offender there had trafficked a total of
                    9.03 grams of diamorphine. If 14 years’ imprisonment and 24
                    strokes of the cane was not thought to be inadequate in <em>Muhammad Raffie</em>, I do not think that 13 years and three
                    months’ imprisonment and 13 strokes of the cane can be considered
                    insufficient in the present case.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     I therefore allow the appeal and reduce the
                    sentence on the trafficking charge from 16 years’ imprisonment and 15
                    strokes of the cane to 12 years’ imprisonment and 10 strokes of
                    the cane. The total sentence is accordingly reduced from 17 years and three
                    months’ imprisonment and 18 strokes of the cane to 13 years and three
                    months’ imprisonment and 13 strokes of the cane.</p>
