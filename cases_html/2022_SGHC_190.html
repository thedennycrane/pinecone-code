The AR granted summary judgment in favor of the Plaintiffs in SUM 277 of 2022 (“SUM 277”). The Defendant appealed against the AR’s decision in RA 171 of 2022 (“RA 171”). The Defendant submitted that the US judgment should not be enforced because of fraud as the Plaintiffs did not disclose to the US Courts that they had separately received settlement payouts. The Defendant also submitted that there was a</span> breach of natural justice by the US Courts. <span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">I dismissed the appeal</span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">.

On 2 October 2018, he emailed the US District Court saying that he “may need 3 months extension instead of the 1.5 months requested…”.

Accordingly, the Plaintiffs would not have been surprised or prejudiced by it. </span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Whether the non-disclosure amounted to fraud </span></div><div class="txt-body text-justify">15. The thrust of the Defendant’s legal submission for Issue 1 was that the US Judgment should be set aside as the Plaintiffs’ non-disclosure of the settlement payout to the US District Court amounted to extrinsic fraud and/or material non-disclosure. The Defendant’s characterisation of the fraud here as extrinsic fraud instead of intrinsic fraud was material. Case law has made a distinction between the two and imposed more stringent safeguards in respect of allegations of extrinsic fraud.</div><div class="txt-body text-justify">16. The Defendant’s submission required an examination of three elements. First, whether the non-disclosure amounted to fraud. Second, whether the non-disclosure was material. Third, whether the fraud was extrinsic or intrinsic fraud.</div><div class="txt-body text-justify">17. I dealt first with whether the non-disclosure amounted to fraud. The threshold for proving fraud is very high. The mere fact that the plaintiffs may have presented erroneous or misleading evidence does not necessarily mean that it is a case of fraud; there must be a dishonest intention to mislead the court: <span class="font-italic">Ching Chew Weng Paul v Ching Pui Sim </span>[2011] 3 SLR 869 at [44]; <span class="font-italic">Eleven Gesellschaft Zur Entwicklung Und Vermarktung Von Netzwerktechonologien MBH v Boxsentry </span><span class="font-italic">Pte Ltd</span> [2014] SGHC 210 (“<span class="font-italic">Boxsentry</span>”)<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [105]. </div><div class="txt-body text-justify">18. In the present case, the Defendant raised the Plaintiffs’ non-disclosure in the US proceedings, which the Plaintiffs did not dispute. However, unlike the plaintiff in <span class="font-italic">Boxsentry</span>, the Plaintiffs here did not provide any evidence that explained their purported non-disclosure, such that the court can conclude that their non-disclosure was not dishonest. Counsel for the Plaintiff was only able to refer me to the 1st Plaintiff’s 1st affidavit in Suit 858 at [19], where he said that “the claim in this present suit is based exactly on what the US District Court granted in the US Judgment, which in turn takes into account all amounts that the Plaintiffs are entitled to under the applicable law in the US Action and on the basis of the parties’ pleaded cases there”.</div><div class="txt-body text-justify">19. As there is no evidence before the court from which to conclude that there was no dishonest intention behind the plaintiffs’ non-disclosure, I proceeded, for purposes of assessing this appeal against summary judgment, on the assumption that there might have been some dishonest intention and that the allegation of fraud should be considered. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Whether the non-disclosure is material</span></div><div class="txt-body text-justify">20. I next dealt with whether the non-disclosure was material. The Defendant submitted that it was material, and if the Plaintiffs had adduced the information on the settlement payouts to the US District Court, the “outcome of the determination <span class="font-italic">might</span> have been different” [emphasis in original in italics]: <span class="font-italic">Facade Solution Pte Ltd v Mero Asia Pacific Pte Ltd</span> [2020] 2 SLR 1125 (“<span class="font-italic">Fa</span><span class="font-italic">cade Solution</span>”) at [35]. This is because the Plaintiffs had been partially recompensed pursuant to the Class Action settlement, which arose out of the very same investments that they premised their claims on against the Defendant. The Plaintiffs themselves recognized that double recovery was not permitted as they had, in particularizing their claim, set off the (unparticularised) “recovered returns” that they had already received.

By extension of the principle to this case, the issue was whether the non-disclosure was material to the US District Court in making its order.</div><div class="txt-body text-justify">22. The documents before the US District Court did not include information that there were payouts made to the Plaintiffs or the amount of payout for each Plaintiff. Consequently, the US District Court was not aware that some payouts had been received by the Plaintiffs. Such information could conceivably have been material to the US District Court, such that the outcome might have been different. I hence proceeded further with the analysis, on the basis that the non-disclosure was material.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Whether the fraud is extrinsic or intrinsic</span></div><div class="txt-body text-justify">23. I dealt next with whether the fraud was extrinsic or intrinsic.</div><div class="txt-body text-justify">24. In <span class="font-italic">Ong Han </span><span class="font-italic">Nam v Borneo Ventures Pte Ltd</span> [2021] 1 SLR 1248 (“<span class="font-italic">Ong Han Nam</span>”), the Court of Appeal noted at [49] the distinction between extrinsic fraud and intrinsic fraud:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">(a) </span>Extrinsic fraud refers to fraud taking place outside trial.

This includes false statements made at the trial which were met by counter-statements by the other side, and adjudicated upon by the Court; fraud going to the merits of the judgment; and perjury at trial.</div><div class="txt-body text-justify">25. The Court in <span class="font-italic">Ong Han Nam</span>, citing <span class="font-italic">Hong Pian Tee </span><span class="font-italic">v Les Placements Germain Gauthier Inc </span>[2002] SGCA 18 (“<span class="font-italic">Hong Pian Tee</span>”) at [30], held at [49] that foreign judgments can only be challenged on the ground of intrinsic fraud if “fresh evidence has come to light which reasonable diligence on the part of the defendant would not have uncovered and the fresh evidence would have been likely to make a difference in the eventual result of the case”.</div><div class="txt-body text-justify">26. In <span class="font-italic">Boxsentry</span>, the court observed at [103], citing D M Gordon, “Fraud or New Evidence as Grounds for Actions to Set Aside Judgments–I” (1961) 77 LQR 358 at p 366 and D M Gordon, “Fraud or New Evidence as Grounds for Actions to Set Aside Judgments–II” (1961) 77 LQR 533 at p 533, that the distinction between intrinsic and extrinsic fraud can be attributed to the history of English legal development. Traditionally, common law courts would only treat a judgment as void for fraud based on collusion and other extrinsic fraud, ignoring the evidence given at trial. The courts of equity, however, were more willing to examine whether judgments were obtained by false evidence.</div><div class="txt-body text-justify">27. This distinction was first authoritatively examined by our Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Hong Pian Tee</span>. The appellant there had submitted that where fraud was raised, the foreign judgment could no longer be conclusive, even if the defence of fraud had been investigated into by the foreign court and rejected (at [10]). Furthermore, the appellant in that case<span class="font-italic"> </span>argued that he was entitled to have the issue of fraud re-litigated in Singapore even if there was no fresh evidence (at [10]). The Court of Appeal examined two lines of authorities. The first line of authorities, starting with <span class="font-italic">Abouloff v Oppenheimer &amp; Co</span> (1882) 10 QBD 295 (“<span class="font-italic">Abouloff</span>”) seemed to say that so long as fraud is alleged, the defendant is thereby entitled to reopen the issue of fraud. In the second line of authorities, the Canadian courts declined to follow <span class="font-italic">Abouloff. </span>In <span class="font-italic">Jacobs v Beaver</span> (1908) 17 OLR 496 (“<span class="font-italic">Jacobs</span>”), Garrow JA of the Ontario Court of Appeal held that a court should only look into the merits of a foreign judgment if extrinsic fraud was alleged or if the defendant had discovered evidence of intrinsic fraud after the foreign judgment was passed. The Court of Appeal at [23] also noted that the Australian cases also seemed to be moving away from <span class="font-italic">Abouloff</span>.</div><div class="txt-body text-justify">28. The Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Hong Pian Tee</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>held that it would adopt the approach taken by the Canadian-Australian cases. At [27] and [30], the court explained:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">27 … In our judgment the approach adopted in <span class="font-italic">Abouloff</span> has less to commend itself as it would only encourage endless litigation. It is of paramount importance that there should be finality. Every losing party understandably would like to litigate the issue over again with the hope that a different tribunal would look at the fact situation differently. But that can never be a good reason for allowing a losing party to reopen issues. To liberally allow a party to do so would be to permit that party to have a second bite at the cherry, an eventuality which is generally abhorred by all civilised systems of law. Of course, we are conscious that the rule against reopening issues is not absolute. There are exceptions but they are subject to safeguards. …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">30 … It is consonant with the doctrine of comity of nations. It avoids any appearance that this court is sitting in an appellate capacity over a final decision of a foreign court. We, therefore, ruled that where an allegation of fraud had been considered and adjudicated upon by a competent foreign court, the foreign judgment may be challenged on the ground of fraud only where fresh evidence has come to light which reasonable diligence on the part of the defendant would not have uncovered and the fresh evidence would have been likely to make a difference in the eventual result of the case. …</div><div class="txt-body text-justify">29. The above brief survey of the history behind the adoption of the distinction between extrinsic and intrinsic fraud under Singapore law, indicates that the distinction is fundamentally underpinned by the principles of finality of litigation and the comity of nations, with safeguards built-in when engaging the exceptions. It is important not to lose sight of this when examining the technical differences between extrinsic and intrinsic fraud.</div><div class="txt-body text-justify">30. With this in mind, I turned to further examine the technical distinctions between the two forms of fraud. Examining the scenarios that have been characterised as extrinsic fraud and intrinsic fraud as set out at [24] above, one key differentiating characteristic, is whether the alleged fraud took place within a trial process, where the party alleging fraud may have discovered the fraud or traced the connection between the fraud and the judgment.</div><div class="txt-body text-justify">31. Where there is bribery of a solicitor, counsel or witness, or a collusion with a representative, or perjury during discovery, the alleged fraud occurs outside of a trial process. It may be harder for such fraud to have been discovered or its connection traced to a judgment. The safeguards set out in <span class="font-italic">Hong Pian Tee </span>at [30], have not been imposed in such situations of extrinsic fraud. </div><div class="txt-body text-justify">32. In contrast, where the alleged false statements were made during trial, or there was perjury at trial, the alleged fraud takes place during a trial where parties are engaged in an adversarial process, examining and disputing the other parties’ evidence. A party engaged in a trial would be in a relatively better position to discover such alleged fraud or trace its connection to the judgment. The safeguard sets out in <span class="font-italic">Hong Pian Tee</span> at [30], that allegations of such intrinsic fraud can only be brought if “fresh evidence has come to light which reasonable diligence on the part of the defendant would not have uncovered”, would apply.</div><div class="txt-body text-justify">33. <span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">The Plaintiffs submitted that the fraud alleged by the Defendant was intrinsic fraud, as the US Judgement was issued on the back of the Motion for Summary Judgment, to which the Defendant had every opportunity to respond but chose to ignore.</span></div><div class="txt-body text-justify">34. <span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">The Defendant submitted that the Plaintiffs’ non-disclosure of the settlement payouts amounted to extrinsic fraud. </span>The Defendant relies on <span class="font-italic">Boxsentry</span>, in which the court held at [104] that:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Boxsentry’s fraud allegation was premised on Eleven’s failure to give full and frank disclosure of the background facts to the Berlin Regional Court. This was purportedly done so that the Berlin default judgment could be obtained unfairly against Boxsentry. It appeared to be an allegation of extrinsic and not intrinsic fraud since it was an allegation that Eleven fraudulently sought to mislead the Berlin Court.</div><div class="txt-body text-justify">35. The Defendant alleged that the Plaintiffs here also failed to give full and frank disclosure to the US District Court. However, there is an important point of distinction between the present case and the facts in <span class="font-italic">Boxsentry</span>. Specifically, <span class="font-italic">Boxsentry</span> concerned a default judgment. In a case of default judgment, it is trite law that the applying party has the duty of full and frank disclosure so that the court can arrive at a fair and just outcome, especially when the opposing party is entirely absent from the proceedings and may not even be aware of the suit. The failure to provide full and frank disclosure is a ground to set aside a default judgment.</div><div class="txt-body text-justify">36. In <span class="font-italic">Hong Pian Tee</span>, the court<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [21] cited the Ontario Court of Appeal's decision in <span class="font-italic">Woodruff v McLennan</span> (1887) 14 OAR 242 (“<span class="font-italic">Woodruff</span>”) to elaborate on the types of situations that the Canadian courts regarded as extrinsic fraud:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… the defendant had never been served with process, that the suit had been undefended without defendant’s default, that the defendant had been fraudulently persuaded by plaintiff to let judgment go by default … or some fraud to defendant’s prejudice committed or allowed in the proceedings of the other court.</div><div class="txt-body text-justify">37. Thus, the examples of extrinsic fraud that the court in <span class="font-italic">Hong Pian Tee </span>cited, relying on <span class="font-italic">Woodruff, </span>also involved suits which are undefended. Similarly, the Hong Kong decision referred to by the Defendant, <span class="font-italic">Alan Chung Wah Tang &amp; Kan Lap Kee v Chung Chun Keung &amp; Joint Group Investment Limited &amp; Vicfont Company Limited</span> [2021] HKCFI 369 also involved an application for default judgment. </div><div class="txt-body text-justify">38. In contrast, the present case did not involve a default judgment or an undefended suit. Counsel for the Defendant accepted that different considerations apply to a summary judgment application. Typically, in a summary judgment application, the plaintiff does not have the same duty of full and frank disclosure as compared to a default of appearance application, since the Defendant would be expected to be present and assisting the court in understanding his side of the story. The Defendant’s Counsel, however, submitted that the present case is nevertheless akin to a default judgment because his client was not responding.</div><div class="txt-body text-justify">39. However, the Defendant had responded earlier in the US Action. He was well aware of the Plaintiffs’ case against him. He entered an appearance before the US District Court, filed his Answer to the Amended Complaint on 10 August 2017 and a Motion to Dismiss the Complaint on 18 September 2017 for lack of personal jurisdiction and improper venue. </div><div class="txt-body text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">40. </span>The Defendant also emailed the US District Court to seek an extension of time to file his response to the Motion for Summary Judgment. On 2 October 2018, the Defendant emailed the US District Court to ask for an extension of time for three months. The US District Court asked him to file a motion to extend time. Not only did the Defendant fail to do so, he did not respond to the Motion for Summary Judgment in any manner. He simply dis-engaged from the US Action, unilaterally. </div><div class="txt-body text-justify">41. <span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">Despite the fact that he did not file a motion to extend time for three months, t</span>he US District Court waited for more than three months. It was only four months later that the US District Court issued the US Judgment. As far as the US District Court was concerned, the Defendant had contested in the US Action and there were opportunities for him to continue to do so, including on the point of damages. But the Defendant simply chose not to respond.</div><div class="txt-body text-justify">42. Therefore, the fact that the US District Court was not aware of the particulars of the settlement payouts, cannot be casted as the Plaintiffs’ fault alone. The Defendant is equally at fault, if not more at fault, for unilaterally disengaging from the proceedings and failing to present his defence to the US District Court.</div><div class="txt-body text-justify">43. Furthermore, when the Defendant’s appeal was subsequently considered by the US Court of Appeal, the court noted in its judgment that “[the] Defendant also challenges the district court’s grant of summary judgment on all counts in favour of Plaintiffs. We review the challenges by the defendant <span class="font-italic">de novo</span><span class="font-italic"> ...</span>”.

</div> In other words, the US Court of Appeal assessed the summary judgment on its merits and did not treat it as a default judgment application.</div><div class="txt-body text-justify">44. If the distinction between intrinsic fraud and extrinsic fraud is made on whether the fraud goes to the merits of the judgment as opposed to going to the jurisdiction of the court (<span class="font-italic">Boxsentry </span>at [102]), then the Plaintiffs’ alleged non-disclosure of the settlement payouts would be considered intrinsic fraud. This is because the alleged fraud pertained to the quantum of damages that should have been awarded to the Plaintiffs, which goes towards the merits of the judgment, as opposed to the jurisdiction of the court. </div><div class="txt-body text-justify">45. If the distinction between intrinsic fraud and extrinsic fraud is made on whether the fraud took place within a trial (<span class="font-italic">Boxsentry</span> at [103]), then the Defendant’s allegation would still be an allegation of intrinsic fraud. While the parties had not reached the trial stage, what was in motion here was a summary process whereby parties were engaged in an adversarial process and were expected to present their evidence to the court. There was in effect, a summary trial. This is in stark contrast to the situations of default judgment and undefended suits that were described as extrinsic fraud in <span class="font-italic">Boxsentry</span> and <span class="font-italic">Woodruff</span>. The alleged fraud here would clearly be more akin to taking place in a trial (intrinsic fraud) rather than taking place outside of a trial (extrinsic fraud). The circumstances were also such that the Defendant could reasonably have discovered the alleged fraud or traced its connection to the judgment.</div><div class="txt-body text-justify">46. Bearing the above in mind, I took the view that the alleged fraud here, assuming that there was fraud, could only be characterised as intrinsic fraud. </div><div class="txt-body text-justify">47. As held in <span class="font-italic">Ong Han Nam</span>, foreign judgments can only be challenged on the ground of intrinsic fraud if “fresh evidence has come to light which reasonable diligence on the part of the defendant would not have uncovered and the fresh evidence would have been likely to make a difference in the eventual result of the case” (at [49]). In this case, it could not be said that the particulars of the settlement payout constituted “fresh evidence” that “has come to light which reasonable diligence on the part of the defendant would not have uncovered”. I concluded as such for the following reasons:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The existence of the settlement sum was something that the Defendant knew of at the time of the US Action. The Defendant and his spouse had by then received partial payouts from the Class Action, amounting to $4,945.34.

There was no evidence that the Defendant did so. </div><div class="txt-body text-justify">56. However, the issue before this court was not whether the Plaintiffs had complied with all the procedural requirements of service in the United States, but whether there were any breaches of natural justice. In <span class="font-italic">Pa</span><span class="font-italic">ulus Tannos v Heince Tombak Simanjuntak and others and another appeal </span><span style="color: rgba(33,37,41,1)">[2020] SGCA 85</span>, the Court of Appeal held at [28] that the question is whether, having been given notice, the litigant has the opportunity of substantially presenting his case before the court. At [42], the court noted that the heart of natural justice lies in the concepts of notice and of the opportunity to be heard. </div><div class="txt-body text-justify">57. In this case, the Defendant was given sufficient notice of the state of proceedings in the action before the US District Court. He was engaged in email correspondence with the US District Court at different stages of the proceedings. </div><div class="txt-body text-justify">58. The Defendant had also received the Plaintiffs’ key documents that he was expected to respond to. Counsel for the Defendant accepted that the Defendant had received the Plaintiffs’ Motion for Summary Judgment and the Supplement. Even if the Defendant’s case about his receipt of the Plaintiffs’ Request of Admissions was taken at its highest, that is assuming that it is true that the Defendant had not received the Plaintiffs’ Request for Admissions by email or otherwise, the Defendant’s email to the US District Court dated 1 October 2018 indicated that he had received the relevant documents and affidavits relating to the Plaintiffs’ Motion for Summary Judgment. He stated in his email:

However, he failed to do so and chose instead to disengage from the proceedings. Indeed, the Defendant had not just one, but several opportunities to present his defence in the US Action, but he failed to do so on each occasion. </div><div class="txt-body text-justify">60. The US District Court even emailed the Defendant to inform him that he could put in a motion to seek an extension of time to file his reply. However, the Defendant made the conscious decision not to partake in the US District Court proceedings after 2 October 2018. In the judgment of the US District Court, the court stated that it granted the summary judgment after considering “that the Court deems the matters in the Plaintiffs’ Request for Admission admitted and in light of [the Defendant’s] failure to respond to the motion for summary judgment”.

</div> In other words, contrary to the Defendant’s submission, the summary judgment in the US District Court was not entered solely on the Deemed Admissions. It was also because the Defendant decided not to participate.</div><div class="txt-body text-justify">61. In such circumstances, it cannot be said that there was a breach of natural justice.</div><div class="txt-body text-justify">62. The Defendant also argued that when he appealed against the US Summary Judgment, he filed and submitted a sworn declaration on 28 February 2019 with over 200 documents that directly contradicted the Deemed Admissions. However, the US Court of Appeal did not consider the new evidence he adduced but affirmed the reliance on his Deemed Admissions, which deprived him of the opportunity to present his case.</div><div class="txt-body text-justify">63. However, the mere fact that the US Court of Appeal did not agree with the Defendant’s position about the new evidence he sought to adduce, does not mean that there was a breach of natural justice. The fact remains that Defendant had the opportunity to be heard by the US Court of Appeal. </div><div class="txt-body text-justify">64. The Defendant further submitted, relying on <span class="font-italic">BRS v BRQ</span> [2021] 1 SLR 390 at [90], that the fair hearing rule requires a tribunal to consider all important issues. The Defendant argued that the US Court of Appeal did not do so, and merely treated the Defendant’s “deemed admissions” as the only evidence required to dismiss his appeal. However, the US Court of Appeal did consider this but rejected it on the ground that “the answer and motion to dismiss were unsworn [and] they were not evidence that the district court could consider in ruling on the motion for summary judgment.”

Where the defendant is unable to cross the fraud or breach of natural justice threshold, it would not be appropriate for this court to sit in an appellate capacity to moderate the judgment given by the foreign court. This was particularly so in this case, since the Defendant was aware that the Plaintiffs had received some amount of payouts from the Class Action, but did not raise it to the attention of the US District Court. As the US Court of Appeal pointedly observed, the Defendant did not challenge the damages amount.
