<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify">The prosecution’s version of events</p></b></i><font face="CG Times (W1),Times New Roman" xmlns="">
<p align="justify">3        The prosecution called only

one witness, Loke Poh Yeng (PW 2) who was working as a sales assistant in the store at the

material time. PW 2 testified that she saw the respondent and her friend, one Nor Natasha

binte Ibrahim ("Natasha") browsing at the eyeshadows at one of the shelves. The

respondent was holding a paper bag. PW 2 was then standing at a spot 2.3 metres away. At

that time, PW 2 was able to see only the respondent’s side profile while Natasha had

her back turned towards PW 2. Natasha was standing between PW 2 and the respondent. </p>
<p align="justify">4        PW 2 gave evidence that she

saw the respondent select an eyebrow pencil and a liquid eyeliner (the items mentioned in

the charge) from the shelf. The respondent did not place those items back on the shelf.

Instead, she held on to those items and walked together with Natasha down the aisle, along

the same row of shelves. According to PW 2, Natasha did not touch or select those items

while she walked away from the shelf. When the two of them reached the end of that row of

shelves, they made a U-turn around it to the other side of the shelf and walked up the

aisle in PW 2’s direction. The respondent and Natasha then stopped to browse at some

combs. </p>
</font>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">5        PW 2 then noticed that the

respondent no longer had the eyebrow pencil and liquid eyeliner in her hand after she made

the U-turn. Suspecting that the respondent might have stolen the items, PW 2 told her

colleague ("Yi Zhu") to help her keep watch over the respondent. At the combs

section, the respondent selected a comb and paid for it at the cashier’s counter.

After payment, the respondent and Natasha left the store, whereupon they were promptly

detained by PW 2 and Yi Zhu.</p>
<font face="CG Times (W1),Times New Roman" xmlns="">
<p align="justify">6        The respondent permitted

PW2 and Yi Zhu to check her paper bag and they found the two items in the bag. The bag

also contained a hair dryer. When asked as to whether she had paid for the items, the

respondent indicated that they might have dropped into her bag. </p>
</font><i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify">The respondent’s version of events</p></b></i><font face="CG Times (W1),Times New Roman" xmlns="">
<p align="justify">7        The respondent did not

dispute that she was browsing at the two items and that those items were subsequently

found in the paper bag she was holding. She however denied knowledge as to how the items

came to be found in her bag. She testified that she had placed the items back onto the

shelf when she moved away from that shelf. She offered the explanation that the items

could have dropped into the bag or someone could have put them into the bag without her

knowledge. According to her, the bag belonged to Natasha and she was only helping Natasha

carry it. She further asserted that she was stopped and searched outside the shop not by

PW 2, but by another salesgirl. </p>
</font><i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify">The decision below</p></b></i><font face="CG Times (W1),Times New Roman" xmlns="">
<p align="justify">8        The judge rejected PW

2’s evidence that the respondent had held on to the two items as she was leaving the

shelf where those items were located. The judge also rejected PW 2’s evidence that

Natasha had not held on to those items. The relevance of these was that, if Natasha was

the one holding on to the items as the respondent and her left the shelf, a reasonable

inference might be drawn that it was Natasha, and not the respondent, who had put the

items in the bag. PW 2’s evidence was rejected for two main reasons.</p>
<p align="justify">9        First, the accuracy of PW

2’s observations might have been affected by her shortsightedness (she was not

wearing glasses that day) and the fact that the shop was crowded on that day. Secondly,

the judge did not find PW 2 to be a credible witness based on her demeanour in court and

the inconsistencies in her evidence. </p>
<p align="justify">10        At the conclusion of the

trial, the judge found that on the cumulative effect of all the evidence adduced before

the court, the prosecution had not proven beyond a reasonable doubt that it was the

respondent, and not some other person, who had taken and placed the two items in the bag.

She acquitted the respondent. </p>
</font><i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify">The appeal</p></b></i><font face="CG Times (W1),Times New Roman" xmlns="">
<p align="justify">11        Three main issues were

raised in this appeal. First, whether the judge had erred in concluding that PW 2 was not

a credible witness. Secondly, whether the judge had erred in concluding that the

prosecution had failed to prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt. Thirdly, if the appeal

was allowed, what would be the appropriate sentence to impose on the respondent.</p>
<i>
<p align="justify">PW 2’s credibility</p></i>
<p align="justify">12        The judge found PW 2 not

to be a credible witness based mainly on her demeanour in court and the inconsistencies in

her evidence. It is settled law that due weight should be accorded to the trial

judge’s assessment of the veracity or credibility of the witness, given that she had

the benefit of observing the demeanour of the particular witness: <i>Jimina Jacee d/o CD

Athananasius v PP</i> <a class="remove" href1="/scripts/lp/dll/prospect.dll?GetHTML_lpqs&amp;type=1&amp;CaseID=49737&amp;freetext=" target="LWBMainFrame">[2000] 1 SLR 205</a>. </p>
<p align="justify">13        The inconsistencies in PW

2’s evidence related to whether, and when, PW 2 had actually seen the respondent

place the items in the paper bag. In the initial part of her examination-in-chief, PW 2

testified that the respondent had put the two items into the paper bag when she and

Natasha made the U-turn. Subsequently, she changed her testimony and said that the

respondent had deposited them into the bag when she was selecting the comb. However when

the prosecution invited her to mark on the sketch the position where the respondent put

the items into her bag, she changed her testimony yet again and admitted that she had not

seen the respondent put the items into her bag, but had merely noticed that the respondent

was no longer holding the items after the U-turn and this aroused her suspicions.

Nevertheless, at a later stage during further cross-examination, PW 2 once again stated

that she had seen the respondent ‘take’ the items. </p>
<p align="justify">14        The prosecution attempted

to offer various explanations for the inconsistencies. They need not be repeated here but

suffice to say that I did not find them convincing. It was clear from PW 2’s

testimony that she plainly could not make up her mind as to whether she had actually seen

the respondent place the items in her bag. In my opinion, the judge was entitled to find

PW 2 not to be a credible witness. </p>
<p align="justify">15        The prosecution further

submitted that, even if PW 2 was not a credible witness, the judge had erred in law in

rejecting the bulk of her evidence. Reliance was placed on <i>Loganatha Venkatesan &amp;

Ors v PP</i> <a class="remove" href1="/scripts/lp/dll/prospect.dll?GetHTML_lpqs&amp;type=1&amp;CaseID=59263&amp;freetext=" target="LWBMainFrame">[2000] 3 SLR 677</a> where the court stated at  56:</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
</blockquote></blockquote></font><font size="3" xmlns=""><i><b><p align="justify">It is important to bear in mind that an

    impeachment of the witness’s credit does not automatically lead to a total rejection

    of his evidence.</p></b></i> The court must carefully scrutinize the whole of the evidence to

    determine which aspect might be true and which aspect should be disregarded…Thus,

    regardless of whether his credit is impeached, the duty of the court remains, that is, to

    evaluate the evidence in its entirety to determine which aspect to believe [Emphasis

    added]. 

    </font>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">I did not accept the prosecution’s submission on this point. The

judge in the present case certainly did not automatically reject the whole of PW 2’s

evidence. In fact she had carefully weighed all the circumstances in deciding which

aspects of PW 2’s evidence to accept and which aspects to reject. Hence the judge

accepted PW 2’s evidence that she was present when the respondent and Natasha were

subsequently stopped while leaving the store. However, she found herself unable to accept

PW 2’s evidence that it was the respondent, and not Natasha, who was holding on to

the two items while they were moving away together from the shelf where those items were

kept. I could find nothing wrong in her approach. It is trite law that an appellate court

should be slow to overturn findings of fact made by a trial judge unless they can be shown

to be plainly wrong or reached against the weight of the evidence:<i> Soh Yang Tick v

Public Prosecutor </i><a class="remove" href1="/scripts/lp/dll/prospect.dll?GetHTML_lpqs&amp;type=1&amp;CaseID=45534&amp;freetext=" target="LWBMainFrame">[1998] 2 SLR 42</a> at  35. The judge’s finding of fact in this

case clearly could not be said to fall within those categories. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">16        It was important, however,

to note that, even though the judge rejected PW 2’s evidence, she did not go the

other way and accept the respondent’s evidence to the contrary that she had put the

items back before she left the shelf. Instead she held, and justifiably so, that on the

available evidence she was not prepared to draw any conclusion either way whether the

respondent or Natasha was holding on to those items when they left the shelf. The next

issue was then, whether on the remaining evidence the prosecution had proven its case

against the respondent beyond a reasonable doubt. </p>
<i xmlns="">
<p align="justify">Whether the prosecution had proven its case beyond a reasonable doubt</p></i>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">17        Only two material facts

were established at the conclusion of the trial. First, the respondent, with her friend

Natasha, was browsing at the two items. Secondly, the same two items were subsequently

found in a bag the respondent was holding as she was leaving the store. The trial court

could not conclude on the evidence whether the respondent or Natasha had held on to those

items while they were moving away from the shelf. There was also no conclusion as to

whether the respondent or someone else had put the items in the bag. The

prosecution’s case therefore relied entirely on circumstantial evidence.</p>
<font face="CG Times (W1),Times New Roman" xmlns="">
<p align="justify">18        <i>Ang Sunny v PP</i>
<a class="remove" href1="/scripts/lp/dll/prospect.dll?GetHTML_lpqs&amp;type=1&amp;CaseID=29&amp;freetext=" target="LWBMainFrame">[1966] 2 MLJ 95</a> laid down the test that when the prosecution is relying entirely on

circumstantial evidence, the effect of all such evidence must lead the court

"inevitable and inexorably" to one conclusion only: that it is the accused who

committed the offence. There have been suggestions that <i>Sunny Ang</i> laid down a

higher standard of proof for cases where prosecution evidence is wholly circumstantial.

Such notion was however dispelled in <i>PP v Oh Laye Koh<b> </b></i><a class="remove" href1="/scripts/lp/dll/prospect.dll?GetHTML_lpqs&amp;type=1&amp;CaseID=8326&amp;freetext=" target="LWBMainFrame">[1994] 2 SLR 385</a> where

the court stated that the same principle of guilt beyond reasonable doubt applies equally

to cases where the prosecution evidence is wholly circumstantial as it does to those where

direct evidence is adduced. In applying the principle of guilt beyond reasonable doubt,

the court is concerned with whether there is any other reasonably possible conclusion

other than that the accused had committed the offence. The court is not concerned with

"fanciful possibilities": <i>Nadasan Chandra Secharan v PP</i> <a class="remove" href1="/scripts/lp/dll/prospect.dll?GetHTML_lpqs&amp;type=1&amp;CaseID=10774&amp;freetext=" target="LWBMainFrame">[1997] 1 SLR 723</a>

at  89. Lord Denning stated the position succinctly in <i>Miller v Minister of Pensions</i>

[1947] 2 All ER 372 at 373:</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
</blockquote></blockquote></font><font face="CG Times (W1),Times New Roman" size="3" xmlns=""><p align="justify">If the

    evidence is so strong against a man as to leave only a remote possibility in his favour

    which can be dismissed with the sentence "of course it is possible, but not in the

    least probable," the case is proved beyond reasonable doubt, but nothing short of

    that will suffice.</p></font>
<font face="CG Times (W1),Times New Roman" xmlns="">
<p align="justify">19        Applying the principles

elucidated above to the present facts, it appeared to me that the success of this appeal

hinged on whether there could be any other reasonable explanation as to how the same two

items that the respondent was browsing ended up in the bag she was holding, other than

that she had put them there herself. In my opinion, there was none.</p>
<p align="justify">20        There are only three

logical possibilities as to how those items came to be in the bag. First, the two items

dropped into the bag by accident. Second, someone else had placed the items in her bag.

Third, the respondent herself had placed the items in the bag. </p>
<p align="justify">21        The respondent based her

defence on both the first and second possibilities. The first possibility is clearly

fanciful and not in the least probable. I have examined the exhibits with care and found

it incredible that the same two items which the respondent was browsing could somehow end

up neatly in her bag by accident.</p>
<p align="justify">22        The second possibility, if

taken to mean that some passer-by in the shop with no connection at all to the respondent

put the items in the bag, is also incredible as a bare assertion. The respondent did not

adduce any evidence to support her claim. It is not in the least probable from common

experience that strangers go round framing one another while shopping in stores.

Otherwise, anyone caught with unpaid items in their bag could simply deny involvement by

pointing their fingers at some unspecified strangers. </p>
<p align="justify">23        If the second possibility

is taken to mean that Natasha was the one who placed the items in the bag, then it is

perplexing why she did not call Natasha as a witness even though the prosecution offered

Natasha as a defence witness. Natasha was clearly crucial to the respondent’s defence

and she could have called Natasha as a witness and then applied to the court to

cross-examine her under s 156 of the Evidence Act, Cap 97, to establish that she was the

one who had actually placed the items in the bag. Although cross-examination of one’s

own witness is generally undertaken when the witness unexpectedly alters his account on

the stand to the detriment of the party who called him, the broad terms of s 156 clearly

allow other situations where one’s own witness can be cross-examined. Section 156

reads as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
</blockquote></blockquote></font><font face="CG Times (W1),Times New Roman" size="3" xmlns=""><p align="justify">The court

    may, <i><b>in its discretion</b></i>, permit the person who calls a witness to put any

    questions put to him which might be put in cross-examination by the adverse parties

    [Emphasis added].</p></font>
<font face="CG Times (W1),Times New Roman" xmlns=""><i>
<p align="justify">Butterworths’ Annotated Statutes of Singapore</p></i> (Evidence,

Volume 5) commented on the section as follows:

<blockquote>
<blockquote>
</blockquote></blockquote></font><font size="3" xmlns=""><p align="justify">A witness is generally called by a party to give

    evidence which supports the latter’s case. However, there may be circumstances in

    which the witness must be asked questions which characterise cross-examination. <i><b>For

    example, a party may wish to call a witness who might have been called by the opposing

    party, but was not, so that he may elicit favourable evidence (normally admissions)

    through the use of leading questions </b></i>[Emphasis added].</p>
</font>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">This describes the situation in the present case where Natasha might

have been called as a prosecution witness but was not, and so it was open to the

respondent to cross-examine her to elicit favourable evidence. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">24        In my opinion, the

respondent’s failure to call Natasha to the stand should have resulted in an adverse

inference being drawn against her under Illustration (g) to s 116 of the Evidence Act. I

do not mean to suggest that a defendant’s failure to call a material witness will

always result in an adverse inference being drawn against him. Illustration (g) to s 116

provides that:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<font size="3"><p align="justify">The court may presume that evidence which could be and

    is not produced would if produced be unfavourable to the person who withholds it.</p>
</font>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">As apparent from the wording of the provision, it allows, but does not

compel, the court to draw adverse inferences even if available evidence is not produced in

court. In fact, the general rule is that the burden lies on the prosecution to prove its

case and no adverse inference can be drawn against the defence if it chooses not to call

any witness: <i>Goh Ah Yew v PP<b> </b></i><a class="remove" href1="/scripts/lp/dll/prospect.dll?GetHTML_lpqs&amp;type=1&amp;CaseID=14249&amp;freetext=" target="LWBMainFrame">[1949] 15 MLJ 150</a> and <i>Abu Bakar v R<b> </b></i><a class="remove" href1="/scripts/lp/dll/prospect.dll?GetHTML_lpqs&amp;type=1&amp;CaseID=20273&amp;freetext=" target="LWBMainFrame">[1963] 1 MLJ 288</a>. There is however an important qualification to this general rule: if the

prosecution has made out a complete case against the defendant and yet the defence has

failed to call a material witness when calling such a witness is the <i>only way</i> to

rebut the prosecution’s case, Illustration (g) to s 116 of the Evidence Act then

allows the court to draw an adverse inference against the defendant: <i>Choo Chang Teik

&amp; Anor v PP</i> <a class="remove" href1="/scripts/lp/dll/prospect.dll?GetHTML_lpqs&amp;type=1&amp;CaseID=31645&amp;freetext=" target="LWBMainFrame">[1991] 3 MLJ 423</a> and <i>Mohamed Abdullah s/o Abdul Razak v PP</i>
<a class="remove" href1="/scripts/lp/dll/prospect.dll?GetHTML_lpqs&amp;type=1&amp;CaseID=56785&amp;freetext=" target="LWBMainFrame">[2000] 2 SLR 789</a>. This is based on the commonsense notion that if the only way for the

defence to rebut the prosecution’s case is to call a particular witness, then her

failure to do so naturally raises the inference that even that witness’s evidence

will be unfavourable to her. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">25        This was exactly the case

in the present appeal. The circumstantial evidence adduced by the prosecution was strong

enough to amount to a complete case against the respondent. The respondent had no other

available means of rebutting the prosecution’s strong circumstantial evidence against

her except through calling Natasha to the stand. Yet she failed to do so without good

reasons. Natasha was clearly an available witness. In fact, she was in court during the

trial hearing. In such circumstances, the judge should have drawn an adverse inference

against the respondent under Illustration (g) to s 116 of the Evidence Act that

Natasha’s evidence would be unfavourable to her. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">26        Hence, only the third

possibility, namely that the respondent herself had placed the items in the bag, remained

a reasonable explanation of how those items came to be found there. From the above

analysis, I concluded that the judge was wrong to rule that the prosecution had not proven

its case beyond a reasonable doubt. The only explanation as to how the very same items the

respondent was browsing ended up in the bag was a bare claim that they had accidentally

dropped in there, or that someone had placed them there. She had available in her means to

call a witness to substantiate these bare claims, but she failed to do so. Such claims may

of course in appropriate cases rebut the prosecution’s case if supported by evidence;

but without such evidence, they remain only fanciful possibilities. Otherwise anyone who

goes shopping with a friend, and when found with unpaid items which she was seen to be

browsing earlier, can simply wriggle out of the situation by asserting a bald claim that

someone else has framed her, or that the items have accidentally dropped into her bag.

Such a scenario will have negative policy implications. It will mean that no store is

given effective legal protection against theft unless the offender is caught in the act of

stealing. For the foregoing reasons, I allowed the appeal and convicted the respondent

under s 380 of the Penal Code.</p>
<i xmlns="">
<p align="justify">Sentencing</p></i>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">27        I was originally minded to

order a pre-sentence probation report and adjourn the issue of sentence to another day in

view of the fact that the stolen items were of low value and had already been recovered,

and that the respondent was a minor at the time the offence was committed. In such

circumstances, a probation order under s 5(1) of the Probation of Offenders Act, Cap 252,

might be more appropriate than a custodial sentence. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">28        However, I was informed by

the prosecution during the hearing that the respondent had committed the present offence

while she was already under probation awarded for a conviction under s 381 of the Penal

Code. She clearly had not learnt her lesson and I took the view that a probation order

would no longer be appropriate. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">29        Under s 380 of the Penal

Code, anyone convicted under the section<i> "shall be punished </i>with imprisonment

for a term which may extend to 7 years, and <i>shall also be liable</i> to a fine".

In<i> PP v Lee Soon Lee Vincent</i> <a class="remove" href1="/scripts/lp/dll/prospect.dll?GetHTML_lpqs&amp;type=1&amp;CaseID=46962&amp;freetext=" target="LWBMainFrame">[1998] 3 SLR 552</a>, I referred to <i>Ng Chwee Puan v R</i>

[1953] MLJ 86 and decided that the phrase ‘shall be liable’ (as opposed to

‘shall be punished’) contained no obligation or mandatory connotation. Hence,

while a sentence of imprisonment under s 380 is mandatory, imposition of a fine is

discretionary. Taking into account all the circumstances of this case, I sentenced the

respondent to two weeks’ imprisonment. </p>
