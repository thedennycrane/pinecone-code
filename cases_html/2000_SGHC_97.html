<strong>JUDGMENT:</strong>
</font>
</p>
<p xmlns=""><font color="#804040" face="Times New Roman"><strong>Grounds of Decision</strong></font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">1 This was an appeal by the Second

Defendants against the damages assessed and awarded by an Assistant Registrar pursuant to

an interlocutory judgment.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">2 The events commenced with an accident on

3 May 1997 when the Plaintiff was using a lift at the Textile Centre at Jalan Sultan. The

lift fell to the bottom of the lift shaft, and she was injured.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">3 The Plaintiff was 51 years old at the

time of the accident and was working as a host mamasan at the Volvo (KTV) Karaoke Lounge.

She did not resume work after the accident because of the injuries to her left lower limb,

the post-traumatic stress disorder that developed, and problems she had with her eyes.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">4 The Assistant Registrar assessed damages

for the Respondent in the aggregate sum of $415,341.79 on 6 January 2000. The Second

Defendants appealed against five heads of award made by the Assistant Registrar for- </font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">(i) fracture of the left tibia and fibula

  - $30,000</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">(ii) fracture of the medial malleolus of

  left ankle - $20,000</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">(iii) post-traumatic stress disorder -

  $40,000</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">(iv) pre-trial loss of earnings - $72,600,

  and</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">(v) post-trial loss of income - $162,000</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">5 I reduced awards (i), (ii), (iii) and

(v) and upheld award (iv). As the Plaintiff has appealed against the reductions, I shall

deal with them.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><i> </i></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">Injury to the left tibia, fibula and

malleolus</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">6 Dr Sarbjit Singh, a consultant

orthopaedic surgeon attached to the Tan Tock Seng Hospital attended to the Plaintiff from

the start and had continued to be in charge of her case. He stated in his report of 27

November 1997 that</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">She sustained an open compound fracture of

  the left tibia and fibula and a closed fracture medial malleolus of the left ankle.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Wound debridement, external fixator

  application of the left tibia and fibula and internal fixation of the left ankle fracture

  was done on the same day.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">She was discharged from hospital on

  14.5.97.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Patient developed delayed union of the

  fractured left tibia requiring posterolateral bone grafting on 1.8.97.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">When last seen on 7.11.97, the wounds had

  healed well. The fracture site was mobile with a varus deformity. She is still on

  follow-up.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">and in a later report dated 9 November

1998, he added that</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Patient developed delayed union of the

  fractured left tibia requiring posterolateral bone grafting on 1 August 97. Serial x-rays

  confirmed to show poor fracture union.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Acute shortening and Ilizarov distraction

  osteotomy of the left tibia was done on 10 March 98.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Serial x-rays showed good progression of

  the distraction site. Limited bone grafting was done on 10 June 98.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">The fracture united on follow-up and the

  frame was removed on 9 September 98.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">She is presently walking partial weight

  bearing. Patient has residual stiffness of the left ankle.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">7 In his last report dated 6 August 1999

he noted</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">The non-union of the left tibia healed on

  follow-up. She has mild stiffness of the left ankle and lack 15 ankle dorsiflexion.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Presently, she walks with a shoe raise.

  Her left knee range of motion is full and painless.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">8 The Plaintiff was also seen by

orthopaedic consultants in private practice. In particular, Dr Liang Te Shan submitted his

report based upon an examination on 2 February 1999 that</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">1. She is markedly hyposthetic from the

  mid shin level downwards. Her sole sensation to pressure and pain is reduced making skin

  pressure sores likely.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">2. She has chronic limb pain. This is from

  a combination of nerve injuries, altered weight bearing biomechanics from bone malunions,

  ankle fusion, subtalar fibrodesis and flexion contractures causing clawing of the toes.

  (bone fusion, soft tissue joint scarring, muscle loss and scarring resulting in

  contractures.)</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">She is basically unable to use her left

  leg to walk without pain and cannot be employed in her prior occupation in a lounge.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">3. There is in addition unsightly scars

  and atrophic/poor quality soft tissue in the leg and foot.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Assessment:</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Mdm Goh has suffered very severe injuries

  to her left leg. She also has other problems requiring consultation with other physicians

  and psychiatrists. Her injuries have resulted in many months of painful treatment,

  multiple surgeries and loss of gainful employment.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Although surgery was successful in

  preserving her left leg, the leg is functionally useless. In addition, she has chronic

  persistant disabling pain that often results in dependancy on sedatives, psychiatric

  modifying drugs and in some, narcotic analgesics.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">In my opinion, she is better off with her

  leg amputated below the knee as her function (and cosmesis with an artificial limb) would

  be far superior.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">As it is, she has little to show in

  beneficial terms for the pain and suffering she has endured. She may well decide

  eventually to have a below knee amputation to remove the painful useless limb and then may

  be rehabilitated back into gainful employment.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">9 At the hearing before the Assistant

Registrar Dr Singh expanded on parts of his reports. He explained that an Ilizarov

distraction is a technique to get a fracture site to heal. This involves cutting the bone

and placing the leg in a frame, after which the bone is lengthened by gradual adjustments

of the frame over a period of 6 months.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">10 Dr Singh also explained that the loss

of 15 ankle dorsiflexion meant that the Plaintiff’s foot could not be horizontal,

but would point downwards at 15. This is a permanent disability which requires her to

wear a shoe with a shoe raise to walk, and even with that, she will walk with a very mild

limp. She is now able to walk short distances of about 30 metres and her walking is

expected to improve, but there will be some pain and discomfort in the left forefoot and

the ankle.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">11 He also commented to the matters raised

in Dr Liang’s report. He disagreed that the Plaintiff’s left leg is functionally

useless, and considered amputation very unlikely.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">12 When Dr Liang gave evidence he

confirmed that he saw the Plaintiff only once before he put up his report. After the

report, he saw the Plaintiff once again on 15 July 1999. On the second occasion, she was

on a wheelchair. Although he said he tried to get her out of the wheelchair, she was

unwilling to put weight on her leg because of her pain.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">13 On the Plaintiff’s own evidence,

her condition has improved since Dr Liang saw her. She testified before the Assistant

Registrar that she can walk about 10 steps in her orthopaedic shoes with the help of a

walking stick before she felt pain. She mentioned that she experienced pain when she

walked, but did not complain of the chronic persistent disabling pain Dr Liang referred to

in his report. She did not say that her left leg is functionally useless, and did not

express any intention to have it amputated. Indeed it was not clear whether the question

of amputation has been brought up to her for consideration.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">14 I preferred Dr Singh’s evidence on

the Plaintiff’s condition to Dr Liang’s. Dr Singh had a greater knowledge of the

Plaintiff’s condition than Dr Liang and the Plaintiff’s own evidence was more

consistent with his assessment. Dr Liang could have been of greater assistance if he had

seen in the Plaintiff more often than he did, and closer to the hearing before the

Assistant Registrar.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">15 It appears from the evidence that the

closed fracture of the medial malleolus healed without problems, as did the open compound

fracture of the left fibula. The fractured tibia was more troublesome. A delayed union

required bone grafting and Ilizarov distraction before it healed properly. The fracture of

the medial malleolus of the left ankle has also healed with a 15 loss of dorsiflexion

(upward flexing) in the left ankle. She has a slight limp and discomfort when she walks

and she can only walk short distances now although that would improve in time.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">16 Counsel for both parties cited

precedent awards for injuries similar to those suffered by the Plaintiff. Two relatively

recent awards for fractures of the tibia and fibula with residual disabilities were of

particular assistance.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">17 In <i>Alagamalai s/o Veerasamy v Chan

Lian Chan, </i>November 1994 MMD 1603, a 39-year-old police officer suffered comminuted

fractures of the distal shafts of the left tibia and fibula. There was malunion at the

fracture site with disuse atrophy of the bones. The left leg was shortened by 2 cm, and

the lower half of the leg was deformed. There was limitation of movement in the left ankle

- 5 loss of dorsiflexion as well as 15 loss of plantarflexion (downward flexing). He

walked with an obvious limp and was unable to squat fully. He was awarded $20,000 in 1994.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">18 In <i>Lai Sin Wah v Ng Soo Ngoh</i>

January 1999 MCL 72 a 42-year-old carpenter had comminuted fractures of the tibia and

fibula. His right leg was infected, malunited and shortened. He experienced chronic pain

over the fractured right leg aggravated by heavy lifting and chronic discharge from the

right shin. He had a limping gait and unsightly bowing of the right shin, and was unable

to run, jog or squat. For these injuries he was awarded $25,000 in 1998.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">19 An older 1991 award for similar

fractures with residual disabilities was also referred to. This was in <i>Parakatt Sajeev

s/o Kunniyer Damodara Kurup v Camperon Bernard</i> – <i>Singapore Piling Civil

Contractors Pte Ltd </i>[1996] MD 991<i>. </i>A 28-year-old carpenter sustained an open

wound over the medial aspect of the left leg and open fracture of the left tibia and

fibula. External fixation and split skin graft were applied to the open wound. He

developed an infected non-union which required treatment by debridement and Gentamycin

beads, but even with the treatment infection may flare up again in the future. The

residual disabilities were two large scars, a stiff ankle and difficulty in squatting and

rapid ambulation. $36,000 was awarded for these injuries. This is higher than the 1994 and

1998 awards as the residual injuries were less severe, with no shortening or deformity. I

accepted the two later awards to be more reflective of the current levels of awards for

such injuries.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">20 For the injuries to the malleolus and

the ankle two awards made in 1992 were cited. $12,000 was awarded to a 21-year-old

construction worker for a closed fracture of the medial malleolus with stiffness of the

ankle in <i>Lee Wee Yee &amp; Anor v Koh Geok Chee &amp; Ors</i> December 1992 MMD 1574.

In <i>Mohamad Aliman bin Kassim v Zulkifli bin Abdul Latib &amp; Anor </i>1998 MD 1750,

$20,000 was awarded to a 52-year-old driver/storekeeper for an open fracture of the right

medial malleolus with puncture wound over the fracture site, resulting in permanent slight

restriction in dorsiflexion of the ankle as well as osteoarthritis in the ankle which may

lead to pain that require treatment.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">21 I used these awards as guides and

benchmarks. I took into account the differences in the forms and severity of injuries eg

the Plaintiff’s limited ability to walk and the fact that her fractures have healed

without shortening, the overlap between the three fractures to her lower limb, and the age

of the Plaintiff. After considering these matters, I concluded that an award of $40,000

for the lower limb injuries was appropriate, and reduced the Assistant Registrar’s

awards for these injuries by $10,000.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><i> </i></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">Post-traumatic stress disorder</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">22 Three psychiatrists gave evidence on

the post-traumatic stress disorder the Plaintiff developed. Dr Kwek Seow Khee of the

Department of Psychological Medicine, Tan Tock Seng Hospital who had attended to the

Plaintiff submitted a report dated 21 July 1999 that</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Mdm Goh developed Posttraumatic Stress

  Disorder following the fall of the lift she was in from 19<sup>th</sup> storey. Her

  symptoms were elaborated in the previous report submitted by my colleague dated 4 Feb 99.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">She has been regular with her follow-up as

  well as with her medication. Though fairly stable on the whole up to her last visit, her

  symptoms tended to get worse when she ran out of medication. Her treatment also needed

  adjustment at times when she experienced new stressors, such as the repeated

  hospitalization for operations.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">She continues to experience fear each time

  she enters a lift and have startle response at the hearing of noise produced by appliances

  e.g. air-conditioner. She needs to be accompanied for most part of her daily life and has

  to avoid items that would remind her of her traumatic experience such as a violent scene

  from a television show.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">She has departed from her previous

  confident character and outgoing lifestyle and has tended now to be dependent on people

  and medication.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">It is likely that she needs ongoing

  treatment for the foreseeable future.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">23 Dr Tan Lay Ling of the Department of

Geriatric Psychiatry, Woodbridge Hospital is the colleague Dr Kwek referred to. Dr Tan

reported on 4 February 1999 that</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Mdm Goh was referred to the Psychological

  Department by the Department of Orthopaedic Surgery of Tan Tock Seng Hospital on 9 July

  97. Mdm Goh apparently sustained an open compound fracture of the left tibia and fibula

  and a closed fracture medial malleolus of the left ankle when the lift she was in fell 19

  floors. She requested for a psychiatric referral as she was complaining of insomnia

  following the accident.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Mdm Goh reported having insomnia since her

  accident on 4 May 97. She would experience recurrent, intrusive images of the scene of the

  accident that disturbed her sleep. She also worries that her air-conditioner would fall on

  her while she sleeps and would startle easily at the slightest noise in the room. She

  developed intense fear and avoidance of taking lifts. She was also anxious and had

  difficulty concentrating on what she was doing.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Mdm Goh was diagnosed to be suffering from

  a posttraumatic stress disorder following the accident. She was started on medications

  with regular outpatient follow-up.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">When she was last reviewed on 14 Jan 99,

  her sleep has improved with the medications, but she was still rather anxious. She was not

  noted to be depressed.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">24 The Plaintiff saw Dr Peh Lai Huat on 2

February 1999 for a second opinion. He noted in his report of 19 August 99 that</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Besides her physical injuries, she

  suffered from psychological symptoms after the incident in May 1997 in which she was

  inside a falling lift. These include anxiety and being easily frightened by noises. When

  she partially overcame her fears of using lifts, she grew alarmed when there were many

  people in the lift or when the lift showed signs of not closing properly. She manifested

  phobic avoidance in such situations by letting the lift go first or insisting on getting

  out of it immediately.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">These signs and symptoms indicate that she

  developed Post-traumatic Stress Disorder as a result of the lift incident.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">She was initially depressed and had

  insomnia. Her physical disabilities and restrictions of lifestyle were factors

  contributing to her despondency and anxieties about her future.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">She received treatment for her condition

  at the Department of Psychological Medicine of Tan Tock Seng Hospital but continued to be

  symptomatic. When I reviewed her on 19 August 1999, her mental state was anxious and she

  reported being startled by loud noises such as that from the air-conditioner at home. She

  would also have tremors of her body when she came across television scenes of disasters

  and would avoid them.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">In my opinion, Mdm Goh Eng Hong has not

  fully recovered from her psychiatric disorder and needs continuation of treatment. The

  physical and mental trauma she suffered and the loss of functional abilities put her risk

  of depression, even in the future. The psychological part of her rehabilitation needs to

  be taken into consideration, in addition to the treatment of her post-traumatic stress

  disorder.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">25 Only one precedent for an award for

post-traumatic stress disorder was cited to me, namely <i>Pang Koi Fa v Lim Djoe Phing</i>

distraught when her daughter died. She was on the verge of a breakdown and almost

committed suicide. She complained of heart palpitations, breathlessness, insomnia, crying

episodes, loss of interest in her work and social life. She was preoccupied with memories

of her daughter, and preserved her daughter’s room at home and her desk at her

office. There was evidence that she underwent a personality change; she stopped cooking

for the family, became over-protective of her son and quarrelled frequently with her

husband. Her psychiatrist diagnosed her to be suffering from post-traumatic stress

disorder and pathological grief, with the grief bringing on the disorder. She was awarded

$30,000 general damages.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">26 The signs and symptons described were

as severe, if not more severe than the Plaintiff’s. Furthermore counsel for the

Second Defendants drew attention to the fact that while both ladies developed stress

disorder, the plaintiff in <i>Pang Koi Fa </i>also experienced pathological grief. He

argued that the Plaintiff should not get more than the $30,000 the latter received. I

could not fault the reasoning, and reduced the award under this head from $40,000 to

$30,000.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><i> </i></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">Loss of income</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">27 The Plaintiff had claimed that she was

earning $6,635 a month at the time of the accident. She was appointed as a host mamasan in

April 1997, after a 2-week trial period. She had a group of 8 to 10 "daughters"

under her charge. She received from the lounge $110 for each bottle of Martell or Hennessy

brandy opened by customers entertained by her or her "daughters". She claimed

that she kept these payments to herself because all the customers were her customers, and

the "daughters" were only entitled to the tips they received from the customers.

</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">28 Prior to becoming a host mamasan, she

was a freelance mamasan from 1988 to 1992. She explained that a freelance mamasan is not

employed by or attached to a nightclub, and accompanies her customers to the nightclubs

they patronise. A host mamasan entertains her customers at a fixed establishment, but she

is also not under its employment. The Plaintiff claimed that her takings as a freelance

mamasan were more than $3,000 a month, but she did not say whether that was before or

after she shared the takings with her "daughters" (as freelance mamasans do).</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">29 The Plaintiff did not produce any

documentary evidence to support her claim on her earnings. She called Gan Chin Kuan, a

partner of the Volvo (KTV) Karaoke Lounge (since renamed Classic KTV Karaoke Lounge), as

her witness.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">30 His evidence was that the Plaintiff had

a 2-week trial period as a host mamasan from about 10 March 1997 and became as a regular

host mamasan from 3 April 1997. He confirmed that the Plaintiff received $110 for each

bottle of liquor opened by customers entertained by the Plaintiff or her

"daughters". He produced vouchers recording payment of $6,635 to her in April

1997.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">31 However Mr Gan contradicted the

Plaintiff’s claim that all the customers entertained by her and her

"daughters" were her customers. He was quite firm that about 30% of them were

customers of the "daughters".</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">32 The Assistant Registrar did not accept

the Plaintiff’s claim that she earned $6,635 as a host mamasan. He held that</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">The Plaintiff’s evidence in court was

  that the full $6,635 commission was hers to keep and that her girls shared no part of it,

  their remuneration consisting solely of tips given by their customers. In my view, the

  possibility of the $6,635 commission having to be distributed between the Plaintiff and

  her girls cannot be overlooked. Apart from the fact that the Plaintiff’s testimony

  was wholly self-serving and uncorroborated by any documentary evidence or the evidence of

  her girls (none of whom were called), the owner of the lounge’s (Gan Chin Kuan)

  testimony was that for all of the Plaintiff and her girls’ work, he would pay a lump

  sum commission to the Plaintiff and it was up to the Plaintiff to remunerate her girls, if

  at all. There is thus a real possibility that the Plaintiff merely retained part of her

  $6,635. This is particularly likely in light of the owner’s testimony that he knew as

  a fact that the customers who patronised the Plaintiff and her girls belonged to both the

  Plaintiff and her girls. There was consequently no reason for the Plaintiff to pocket the

  full commission when some of the customers were actually not hers.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">33 He set the Plaintiff’s pre-trial

income at $2,200 per month, applied a multiplier of 33 months and awarded $72,600

pre-trial loss of earnings. The Plaintiff did not appeal against this award, which I

upheld against the Second Defendants’ appeal.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">34 The Plaintiff has appealed against my

variation of the Assistant Registrar’s award for post-trial loss of earnings of

$2,700 a month for 5 years, which worked on to $162,000.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">35 The Assistant Registrar set the higher

multiplicand for the post-trial earnings with the explanation that</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">The pre-trial multiplicand is

  significantly lower than the post-trial multiplicand because the economy was bad for the

  second half of 1997, 1998 and for part of 1999. The services that the Plaintiff provided

  was in the nature of a luxury item and therefore its performance was expected to fluctuate

  with the economy...As for the post-trial multiplicand I have decided that $2,700 per month

  was reasonable.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">36 It was not the Plaintiff’s case

that her earnings would have increased in 1999. She made her claims for pre-trial and

post-trial loss of earnings on the same multiplicand of $6,635 per month. No submission on

economic fluctuations was made by counsel. There was no evidence before the Assistant

Registrar the state of the karaoke lounge business over that period or how that would

impact on a mamasan’s earnings. With no input from persons in the trade like Mr Gan

or the Plaintiff’s former colleagues, these are not matters on which judicial notice

can be taken.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">37 Consequently, I did not uplift the

multiplicand for the post-trial loss and kept it at $2,200.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">38 That left the multiplier to be

established. The Assistant Registrar set it at 5 years "considering that the

Plaintiff is already 54 at the time of the trial and the fact that the job in question is

dependant on age". There was little evidence to help the court. The Plaintiff said

nothing about it in her affidavit of evidence-in-chief, and only mentioned during

re-examination that she could have worked for "10 odd years" if she was not

injured. Mr Gan told the Assistant Registrar that host mamasans can work for as long as

they want if they have their customers and "daughters", and that he had seen

them working to between 50 and 60, but he was non-committal about their working beyond 60.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">39 It is not clear what retirement age the

Assistant Registrar adopted. I found that 60 years would be fair on the evidence

available. It is trite law that in assessing lost future income, the multiplier to be

applied is not the full measure of the lost working years. This was made clear by the

Privy Council in <i>Lai Wee Lian v Singapore Bus Service (1978) Ltd </i>[1984-1985] SLR 10, where Lord Fraser of Tullybelton held that in the selection of an appropriate

multiplier discounts should be made for the inevitable contingencies and uncertainties of

human life and working capacity, as well as the fact that an award for lost future

earnings is received in an accelerated lump sum payment.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">40 Looking at the Plaintiff’s

employment record, she was working as a host mamasan for about a month and was a freelance

mamasan before that. From the evidence it can be inferred that mamasans are prone to come

and go, as are the lounges and nightclubs they operate in.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">41 Apart from the lower limb injuries and

stress disorder, the Plaintiff was having problems with her eyes which would affect her

ability to work. She developed cataracts in both eyes after the accident. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">The left eye underwent surgery in

September 1997, and the right eye was operated on in August 1999. The Plaintiff deposed on

29 November 1999 that she was still having trouble with her vision, with numerical figures

appearing sometimes reversed as in a mirror image, or upside down, or as entirely

different figures, and vision of her left eye is blur. The Assistant Registrar had found

that the eye condition was not connected to the accident and the Plaintiff had not

appealed against this finding.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">42 After taking these matters into

consideration, I found that the multiplier of 5 years is not justified, and I set it at 3

years. Consequently I reduced the award for post-trial loss of income to $2,200 for 3

years, or $79,200, from the $162,000 awarded by the Assistant Registrar.</font></p>
