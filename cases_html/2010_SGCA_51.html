        Chao Hick Tin JA (delivering the judgment of the
                court):</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       This appeal concerns an application by the
                    appellant for leave to adduce further evidence in relation to a pending action
                    in the High Court challenging the decision of the Deputy Registrar of Patents
                    and the Principal Assistant Registrar of Patents (hereafter referred to
                    collectively as “the Tribunal”) to revoke the appellant’s
                    Singapore patent P-No 42669 (“the Patent”). The
                    appellant’s application (“the Interlocutory Application”)
                    was refused by the High Court judge (“the Judge”), which led the
                    appellant to file the present appeal against the Judge’s
                decision.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Background</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The Patent pertains to a method for producing
                    arachidonic acid (“ARA”) in triglyceride form for use in infant
                    formula. One of the claims of the Patent is that “the oil [made using the
                    patented method] comprises <em>at least</em> 50%
                        ARA”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> [emphasis in bold in original omitted;
                    emphasis added in italics]. The respondent applied to have the Patent revoked on
                    the ground that it lacked novelty or inventiveness, citing ten instances of
                    prior art. Following a four-day hearing before the Tribunal from 9 to
                    12 February 2009, the Tribunal reserved judgment. On 3 November 2009,
                    the Tribunal released its written decision revoking the Patent for lack of
                    inventiveness (see <em>Cargill International Trading Pte Ltd v
                        Martek Biosciences Corporation</em> [2009] SGIPOS 12
                    (“the Tribunal’s Judgment”)). The appellant, being
                    dissatisfied with the decision of the Tribunal, appealed to the High Court by
                    way of Originating Summons No 1418 of 2009
                    (“OS 1418/2009”) filed on 15 December 2009. It was in
                    relation to the appeal in OS 1418/2009 (“the HC Appeal”)
                    that, on 15 January 2010, the appellant filed Summons No 234 of 2010
                        (<em>ie</em>, the Interlocutory Application) requesting
                    for leave to adduce further evidence pursuant to O 55 r 6(2) and/or
                    O 87A r 13(2) of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5,
                    2006 Rev Ed) (“the ROC”). The evidence which the appellant
                    wanted to adduce (“the Alleged Further Evidence”) related to a
                    repeat of one of the experiments described in the prior art identified as
                    “D4” (“the Experiment”). (D4 is the original
                    description (in Japanese) of the Experiment, with “D4a” being the
                    English translation thereof. For convenience, we will hereafter refer to this
                    prior art as “D4a”.) On 12 March 2010, the Judge dismissed
                    the Interlocutory Application (see <em>Martek Biosciences Corp v
                        Cargill International Trading Pte Ltd</em> [2010] 3 SLR 927
                    (“the High Court GD”)).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       At this juncture, we ought to explain that D4a
                    is a patent in Japan relating to a skin cosmetic product which also uses ARA.
                    The Experiment purports to set out how to make oil with all the features of the
                    Patent’s claim. Particularly, it is claimed that the oil made from the
                    Experiment comprises 72.9% ARA (for convenience, this claim will hereafter be
                    referred to as “the D4a Claim”), which matches the claim in the
                    Patent that the oil made using the patented method comprises at least 50% ARA.
                    The Tribunal made certain findings on the invalidity of the Patent relying on,
                        <em>inter alia</em>, D4a.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       On 19 March 2010, the appellant’s
                    solicitors wrote in to the Judge stating that the appellant had informed them,
                    right after the hearing of the Interlocutory Application on 12 March 2010,
                    that it had already conducted the Experiment and that the results showed that
                    the oil produced from the Experiment had an ARA content of less than 50% and not
                    72.9% as stated in the D4a Claim. The appellant’s solicitors requested for
                    leave to make further arguments in order to persuade the Judge to reconsider the
                    Interlocutory Application. The Judge declined the request, culminating in the
                    present appeal by the appellant.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The decision below</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       In the High Court GD, the Judge made the
                    following findings:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_5-p2_a"></a>(a)     The nature of an appeal from a
                        decision of the Registrar of Patents (“the Patents Registrar”)
                        to the High Court under O 87A r 13 of the ROC was “akin to
                        that [of an appeal] from the High Court to the Court of Appeal under
                        O 57 [of the] ROC” (see the High Court GD at
                    [69]).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_5-p2_b"></a>(b)     Accordingly,
                        the test set out in <em>Ladd v Marshall</em> [1954]
                        1 WLR 1489 for determining whether leave should be granted for
                        further evidence to be adduced in an appeal before the Court of Appeal
                        (“the <em>Ladd v Marshall</em> test”)
                        should apply to an appeal under O 87A r 13, “albeit with
                        appropriate modifications if the nature of the appeal and the factual matrix
                        of the case so require[d]” (see the High Court GD at
                    [74]).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_5-p2_c"></a>(c)     The appellant
                        should have either carried out the Experiment prior to the hearing before
                        the Tribunal, or applied for leave from the Tribunal during the hearing to
                        carry out the Experiment and adduce the results obtained as evidence in the
                        hearing. At the very least, the appellant should have conducted the
                        Experiment during the period between the last day of the hearing before the
                        Tribunal (<em>viz</em>, 12 February 2009) and the
                        date on which the Tribunal’s Judgment was released (<em>viz</em>, 3 November 2009). The appellant’s inaction
                        between 12 February 2009 and 3 November 2009 showed “a lack
                        of due diligence in securing all relevant evidence before the
                        Tribunal” (see the High Court GD at [75]).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_5-p2_d"></a>(d)     The evidence of the Experiment which
                        the appellant was seeking leave to adduce (<em>ie</em>,
                        the Alleged Further Evidence) would not have any major or significant
                        bearing on the HC Appeal as the Tribunal had also held the Patent to be
                        invalid in view of prior art other than D4a (see the High Court GD at
                        [78]–[79]).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_5-p2_e"></a>(e)     The appellant had not enclosed any report or results of the
                        Experiment (which it claimed it had already carried out) and, hence, the
                        respondent would not be in a position to verify the credibility of the
                        alleged results (see the High Court GD at [78]).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The test to be applied for adducing further evidence under
                Order 87A rule 13(2) of the ROC</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Comparison/Analogy with other provisions of the ROC</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       The legal question which we have to decide in
                    this appeal is: what is the test to be applied in deciding whether to grant
                    leave for further evidence to be adduced pursuant to O 87A r 13(2) of
                    the ROC in an appeal from the Patents Registrar to the High Court? As the Judge
                    noted at [11] of the High Court GD, this question has hitherto never been
                    decided in Singapore as the HC Appeal is the first case involving an application
                    for leave to adduce further evidence in an appeal under O 87A
                    r 13.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       The applicable provision in the ROC is
                    O 87A r 13(2), which provides that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">An appeal [under O 87A r 13] shall be by way of rehearing and
                        the evidence used on appeal shall be the same as that used before the
                        [Patents] Registrar and, except with the leave of the Court, no further
                        evidence shall be given.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">In the court below, both the parties as well as the Judge, in
                    determining what test should be applied <em>vis-à-vis</em>
                    O 87A r 13(2), drew analogies with other provisions in the ROC which
                    similarly deal with the grant of leave to adduce further evidence in appeals
                    (see [11] of the High Court GD). For ease of reference, tabulated below are the

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       It can be seen from the above that the wording
                    of O 87A r 13(2) of the ROC (<em>vis-à-vis</em>
                    an appeal from a decision of the Patents Registrar to the High Court) is similar
                    to that of O 87 r 4(2) (<em>vis-à-vis</em> an
                    appeal from a decision of the Trade Marks Registrar to the High Court), but is
                    different from both the wording of O 55 r 6(2) (<em>vis-à-vis</em> an appeal to the High Court under O 55) and that
                    of O 57 r 13(2) (<em>vis-à-vis</em> an appeal to
                    the Court of Appeal under O 57). Notwithstanding this difference in
                    wording, an appeal to the High Court under O 87A r 13 is similar to an
                    appeal to the High Court under O 55 in so far as both types of appeals
                    operate by way of rehearing (see, respectively, O 87A r 13(2) and
                    O 55 r 2(1)). We must, however, point out that the prescribed regime
                    for adducing further evidence under O 55 r 6(2) seems more liberal
                    than the corresponding regime under O 87A r 13(2) as the former
                    provides that “[t]he Court shall have power to require further evidence
                    on questions of fact, and the evidence may be given in such manner as the Court
                    may direct”. As for an appeal under O 57 from the High Court to the
                    Court of Appeal <em>vis-à-vis</em> a decision given after a
                    trial or hearing of any cause or matter on the merits, pursuant to O 57
                    r 13(2), further evidence can only be admitted on “special
                    grounds”, a condition not specified in O 87A r 13(2). Here, we
                    must add that s 37(1) of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act (Cap 322,
                    2007 Rev Ed) provides that an appeal from the High Court to the Court of
                    Appeal “shall be by way of rehearing”; this same provision also
                    appears in O 57 r 3(1) of the ROC.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       At [67] of the High Court GD, the Judge, citing
                        <em>Singapore Court Practice 2009</em> (Jeffrey
                    Pinsler SC gen ed) (LexisNexis, 2009) at para 87A/13/2, stated that
                    the term “rehearing” in relation to O 87 of the ROC (which,
                    as mentioned earlier, concerns trade marks) was not to be understood as
                    referring to a full <em>de novo</em> rehearing of evidence;
                    in so ruling, the Judge drew a distinction between an appeal under O 87
                    r 4 and an appeal under O 55. The Judge (likewise at [67] of the High
                    Court GD) endorsed the analysis in <em>Mediacorp News Pte Ltd v
                        Astro All Asia Networks plc</em> [2009] 4 SLR(R) 496 and
                        <em>Valentino Globe BV v Pacific Rim Industries
                        Inc</em> [2009] 4 SLR(R) 577 that “a
                    ‘rehearing’ under O 87 r 4 [of the] ROC [was] similar to
                    that under O 57 r 13 [of the] ROC (<em>ie</em>,
                    an appeal from [the] High Court to the Court of Appeal)”. He also pointed
                    out (at [68] of the High Court GD) that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The proceedings before the Tribunal were akin to a full trial with oral
                        evidence having been adduced and cross-examination having taken place.
                        … The statutory framework of the Patents Act [(Cap 221,
                        2005 Rev Ed)] read with O 87A [of the] ROC suggests that the
                        Tribunal is the proper forum for the taking of evidence and that the High
                        Court sitting in its appellate capacity does not have unbridled powers to
                        introduce fresh evidence after a decision has been rendered by the
                        Tribunal.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     The above reasoning of the Judge is logical.
                    However, the problem with treating O 87 r 4(2) and, likewise,
                    O 87A r 13(2) as being “akin to” (see [69] of the High
                    Court GD) O 57 r 13(2) is that the latter requires the presence of
                    “special grounds” before leave may be granted to adduce further
                    evidence. This requirement is absent from both O 87A r 13(2) and
                    O 87 r 4(2). Since the wording of O 87A r 13(2) and that of
                    O 87 r 4(2) are not the same as the wording of O 55 r 6(2)
                    and that of O 57 r 13(2), we do not think it would be appropriate to
                    apply the rules for construing the latter two provisions (<em>ie</em>, O 55 r 6(2) and O 57 r 13(2)) when
                    construing the former provisions (<em>ie</em>, O 87A
                    r 13(2) and O 87 r 4(2)). While comparisons may be made between
                    O 87A r 13(2)/O 87 r 4(2) and O 55
                    r 6(2)/O 57 r 13(2), one should not lose sight of the basic
                    difference in the various rules. It stands to reason that the ROC prescribed a
                    separate set of rules, with different wording, for patent proceedings and trade
                    mark proceedings because of their special nature. As noted by Laddie J in
                        <em>Hunt-Wesson Inc’s Trade Mark Application</em>
                    [1996] RPC 233 (“<em>Hunt-Wesson</em>”) at 241:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In <em>Ladd</em> v. <em>Marshall</em> the court was concerned with private litigation
                        between two parties. If one of them failed to produce evidence which was
                        relevant and helpful until too late, only it would suffer the consequences.
                        However that is not the case here. An opposition [to the registration of a
                        trade mark] may determine whether or not a new statutory monopoly, affecting
                        all traders in the country, is to be created. Refusing permission to an
                        opponent who files evidence late affects not only him but also may penalise
                        the rest of the trade.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">This is an important difference between patent/trade mark proceedings
                    and a normal private litigation between two individuals. Therefore, the
                    considerations which are relevant in determining whether to grant leave for
                    further evidence to be admitted in an appeal to the High Court from a decision
                    of the Patents Registrar or a decision of the Trade Marks Registrar should be
                    examined bearing in mind the objectives of the Patents Act (Cap 221,
                    2005 Rev Ed) and the Trade Marks Act (Cap 332, 2005 Rev Ed)
                    respectively.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The appropriate test to be used</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     What test, then, should the court apply when
                    deciding whether or not to allow further evidence to be adduced pursuant to
                    O 87A r 13(2) of the ROC? Undoubtedly, the <em>Ladd v
                        Marshall</em> conditions – namely, the further evidence sought
                    to be adduced: (a) must not have been obtainable with reasonable diligence
                    for use at the trial; (b) must be such that, if given, would probably have
                    an important influence on the result of the case, although it need not be
                    decisive; and (c) must be apparently credible, although it need not be
                    incontrovertible – are useful. This is also implicit in these remarks of
                    the Judge (at [74] of the High Court GD):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I am of the view that <em>Ladd v Marshall</em> should
                        apply where leave is sought to adduce further evidence, albeit with
                        appropriate modifications if the nature of the appeal and the factual matrix
                        of the case so require.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     The problem lies in determining how the
                        <em>Ladd v Marshall</em> conditions should apply in a
                    proceeding such as the present and what modifications (if any) should be made.
                    As mentioned at <a href="#p1_8">[8]</a> above, an appeal from a
                    decision of the Patents Registrar to the High Court is by way of rehearing (see
                    O 87A r 13(2)), so too is an appeal from the High Court to the Court
                    of Appeal (see O 57 r 3(1)). To this extent, there is similarity
                    between these two types of appeals. Before proceeding further with our analysis,
                    we should first address the meaning of the expression “by way of
                    rehearing” in O 57 r 3(1). Here, we would endorse what the
                    authors of <em>Singapore Civil Procedure 2007</em>
                    (G P Selvam chief ed) (Sweet &amp; Maxwell Asia, 2007) state at
                    para 57/3/1 in commenting on O 57 r 3(1):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">These words [<em>ie</em>, “by way of
                        rehearing”] do not mean that the witnesses are heard afresh. They
                        indicate [that] the appeal is not limited to a consideration [of] whether
                        the misdirection, misperception of evidence or other alleged defect in the
                        trial has taken place, so that a new trial should be ordered. They indicate
                        that the court considers (so far as may be relevant) the whole of the
                        evidence given in the court below and the whole course of the trial.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">However, it does not follow that this similarity between O 87A
                    r 13(2) and O 57 r 3(1) (in terms of the use of the expression
                    “by way of rehearing”) alone entails that the test established by
                    case law for adducing further evidence under O 57 r 13(2) (<em>ie</em>, the <em>Ladd v Marshall</em>
                    test) should be applied strictly in relation to O 87A r 13(2). This is
                    because O 57 r 13(2) prescribes that, in the case of an appeal to the
                    Court of Appeal from a judgment given after a trial or hearing of any cause or
                    matter on the merits, leave to adduce further evidence should only be given on
                    “special grounds”, a requirement which (as mentioned at <a href="#p1_10">[10]</a> above) is missing from O 87A
                    r 13(2). The requirement of “special grounds” in O 57
                    r 13(2) must obviously be given effect to, hence the application of the
                        <em>Ladd v Marshall</em> conditions.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     We should point out that what we have just
                    said in the preceding paragraph about the difference between an appeal from a
                    decision of the Patents Registrar to the High Court under O 87A r 13
                    and an appeal from the High Court to the Court of Appeal under O 57 is
                        <em>not</em> to be taken as a suggestion that the test
                    for adducing further evidence in an appeal under O 87A r 13 is akin to
                    the corresponding test <em>vis-à-vis</em> an appeal from a
                    lower court (other than a subordinate court), tribunal or person to the High
                    Court under O 55. Apart from the fact that the wording of O 87A
                    r 13(2) is different from that of O 55 r 6(2), one must also bear
                    in mind the special nature of patent proceedings (and also trade mark
                    proceedings, where O 87 r 4(2) is concerned (see <a href="#p1_10">[10]</a> above)). It seems to us that it would not be
                    profitable to interpret O 87A r 13(2) by making a literal comparison
                    with either O 55 r 6(2) or O 57 r 13(2). Instead, the
                    starting point must be to look at O 87A r 13(2) itself. On the face of
                    it, this provision gives the court an unfettered discretion to allow further
                    evidence to be adduced as it does not spell out the circumstances in which the
                    court may grant leave in this regard; neither does it set out any limitation or
                    restriction on how the discretion to allow further evidence should be exercised
                    by the court.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     The Judge, having reviewed the decisions in
                        <em>WBG Network</em>, <em>Lassiter
                        Ann</em>, <em>Ladd v Marshall</em>, <em>Ang Leng Hock v Leo Ee Ah</em> [2004] 2 SLR(R) 361
                    and <em>WUNDERKIND Trade Mark</em> [2002] RPC 45,
                    came to the view (at [69] of the High Court GD) that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[B]y contrasting the language employed by different rules concerning
                        adduction of further evidence under [the] ROC and taking into account the
                        characteristics of a hearing before the [Patents Registrar], it [can] be
                        seen that the nature of an appeal under O 87A r 13(2) [of the] ROC
                        is akin to that [of an appeal] from the High Court to the Court of Appeal
                        under O 57 [of the] ROC.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">One factor which greatly influenced the Judge in equating O 87A
                    r 13(2) with O 57 r 13(2) was the consideration that proceedings
                    before the Patents Registrar were “akin to a full trial with oral
                    evidence [being] adduced and cross-examination [taking] place” (see [68]
                    of the High Court GD (also reproduced at <a href="#p1_9">[9]</a>
                    above)). This entails that each party in a proceeding before the Patents
                    Registrar must put its entire case before the Patents Registrar. It would be
                    highly undesirable to freely permit parties, after the Patents Registrar has
                    decided a matter, to adduce further evidence in an appeal from the Patents
                    Registrar’s decision to the High Court. This would render the proceedings
                    before the Patents Registrar highly inefficient. Up to this point, the logic
                    behind treating an appeal under O 87A r 13 as “akin to”
                        (<em>per</em> [69] of the High Court GD) an appeal
                    under O 57 cannot be assailed. But, what still remains to be taken into
                    reckoning is the special character of a registered patent. A patent will affect
                    not only the parties to the particular patent proceeding in question, but also
                    everyone else. The proprietor of a patent enjoys a monopoly within the
                    jurisdiction. Like trade mark proceedings (and see, in this regard, the passage
                    from <em>Hunt-Wesson</em> at 241 quoted at <a href="#p1_10">[10]</a> above), patent proceedings have repercussions
                    on the market at large: they concern the state of the patents register, which
                    undoubtedly affects the public’s interest.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     That said, while the court ought to bear in
                    mind the special character of patent proceedings, and notwithstanding the
                    wording of O 87A r 13(2) (which seems to accord to the court an
                    apparently unfettered discretion to allow further evidence to be adduced in an
                    appeal under O 87A r 13), it is also important that the discretionary
                    power in O 87A r 13(2) is exercised in a principled manner so that
                    there will be some certainty as to how this provision is to be applied whilst,
                    at the same time, meeting the ends of justice in specific cases. We do not think
                    it is feasible or desirable to lay down any rigid test for the exercise of this
                    discretion other than to identify the factors or considerations which the court
                    should take into account in deciding whether or not to allow further evidence to
                    be adduced pursuant to O 87A r 13(2).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     At this juncture, it is appropriate for us to
                    again refer to <em>Hunt-Wesson</em>, a case concerning an
                    appeal against the dismissal of an opposition to a trade mark application
                    registration. There, Laddie J first observed that the appeal before him was
                    a rehearing, and then said (at 241–242):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In my view the more appropriate course to adopt [as opposed to simply
                        applying the <em>Ladd v Marshall</em> test] … is
                        to look at all the circumstances, including those factors set out in
                            <em>Ladd</em> v. <em>Marshall</em> and to decide whether on the particular facts the
                        undoubted power of the court to admit fresh evidence should be exercised in
                        favour of doing so.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">After reviewing various precedents (which, he noted, did not offer a
                    uniform approach), Laddie J (at 242) proffered the following factors as
                    examples of the considerations relevant to the exercise of the court’s
                    discretion to allow further evidence:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">1.    Whether the evidence could have been filed earlier
                            and, if so, how much earlier.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">2.    If [the evidence] could have been [filed earlier],
                            what explanation for the late filing has been offered to explain the
                            delay.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">3.    The nature of the [trade] mark.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">4.    The nature of the objections to it.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">5.    The potential significance of the new
                            evidence.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">6.    Whether or not the other side will be significantly
                            prejudiced by the admission of the evidence in a way which cannot be
                            compensated, <em>e.g</em>. by an order for
                            costs.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">7.    The desirability of avoiding multiplicity of
                            proceedings.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">8.    The public interest in not admitting onto the
                            register invalid [trade] marks.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The factors enumerated by Laddie J were approved by the
                    English Court of Appeal as being relevant in the case of <em>E I Dupont de Nemours &amp; Co v S T Dupont</em>
                    [2006] 1 WLR 2793 at [103].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     While the statutory provision governing the
                    admission of further evidence in <em>Hunt-Wesson</em> is
                    not identical to the relevant statutory provision in the present case (<em>ie</em>, O 87A r 13(2) of the ROC), one significant
                    common factor between the two provisions is that they both do not prescribe how
                    the court’s discretion should be exercised. For this reason, it seems to
                    us that the factors listed by Laddie J, although enunciated in the context
                    of trade mark proceedings, are useful guidelines in patent proceedings such as
                    the present. The only point which we must emphasise is that the list of factors
                    set out by Laddie J is not exhaustive. Ultimately, in each case, the court
                    must decide, based on the facts of the particular case at hand, whether it is
                    just to admit the further evidence in question, bearing in mind also the
                    public’s interest.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conduct of the appellant</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Circumstances relating to the Interlocutory Application</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     At this juncture, we think it appropriate to
                    scrutinise how the Interlocutory Application was presented to the court by the
                    appellant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     As mentioned at <a href="#p1_2">[2]</a> above, on 3 November 2009, the Tribunal delivered its
                    decision revoking the Patent. On 15 December 2009, the appellant filed
                    OS 1418/2009 to challenge the Tribunal’s decision. On 15 January
                    2010, the appellant filed Summons No 234 of 2010 (<em>viz</em>, the Interlocutory Application) for leave to adduce
                    “evidence of and relating to a repeat of an experiment described in prior
                    art reference D4a [<em>ie</em>, the Experiment as defined
                    at <a href="#p1_2">[2]</a> above]”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span> The Interlocutory Application was
                    made on the basis that the appellant had not conducted the Experiment yet, but
                    wanted to do so. This is borne out by the supporting affidavit for the
                    Interlocutory Application, which stated as follows:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">We [<em>ie</em>, the appellant’s solicitors]
                        have been instructed that the [appellant] wishes to adduce evidence of and
                        relating to a repeat of an experiment described in prior art reference D4a
                            [<em>ie</em>, the Experiment]. In this regard, we
                        have been instructed that the [appellant] <em>wishes to
                            conduct</em> the said experiment … and to adduce evidence
                        of and relating to the same. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">In other words, at the time the Interlocutory Application was filed,
                    it was presented as an application for leave to be granted to the appellant to
                    conduct the Experiment and, subsequently, submit the results thereof to the
                    court for the purposes of the HC Appeal.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     That the above was the manner in which the
                    Interlocutory Application was presented to the court is also evident from the
                    proceedings at the hearing of the application on 12 March 2010. At that
                    hearing, counsel for the appellant told the Judge that “[the appellant]
                    ha[d] not done the [E]xperiment yet[;] … [it was] asking for six weeks
                    [to] present the [E]xperiment … to the Court”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span> The purpose of the Interlocutory
                    Application, as understood by the Judge, is set out at [9] of the High Court GD
                    as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[T]he [appellant] took out Summons No 234 of 2010/Q … to apply
                        for leave to conduct the [E]xperiment … and to adduce evidence of and
                        relating to the same …</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     On 19 March 2010, one week after the
                    Judge dismissed the Interlocutory Application, the appellant’s solicitors
                    wrote in to the court requesting for leave to make further arguments before the
                    Judge. In the letter, the appellant’s solicitors informed the court that
                    right after the hearing of the Interlocutory Application on 12 March 2010,
                    the appellant told them that it had <em>already
                        conducted</em> the Experiment and that the results obtained revealed
                    the D4a Claim to be inaccurate. The letter also stated that the results
                    allegedly showed that the oil produced from the Experiment had an ARA content of
                    less than 50%, <em>ie</em>, less than the ARA content of
                    72.9% alleged in the D4a Claim. The Judge declined the request for leave to make
                    further arguments.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     In the present appeal, at the time the appeal
                    was filed, the Interlocutory Application was likewise presented to this court on
                    the basis that the appellant had already conducted the Experiment, and that what
                    the appellant wanted was leave to adduce the results of the Experiment as
                    evidence in the HC Appeal. This is evident from the following paragraphs of the
                    appellant’s written case (dated 10 June 2010) for the present appeal
                    (“the Appellant’s Case”):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">40.    After the hearing of the [Interlocutory
                            Application], the [a]ppellant requested [for leave to make] further
                            arguments and informed the Court that, after the date of the hearing,
                            the [a]ppellant had already conducted a repeat of [the Experiment] and
                            had obtained results of great significance.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">42.    With respect, the [a]ppellant submits that the
                            … Judge appeared to pay more attention to the timing of this
                            request for further arguments rather than the hard facts of the
                            experimental data, such data being quintessential to the issues in the
                            HC Appeal.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">43.    … It was only after the hearing [of the
                            Interlocutory Application] that the [a]ppellant came into possession of
                            the results [of the Experiment] and only at the time of its request for
                            further arguments could the [a]ppellant then enlighten the Court as to
                            the relevance of the results and their important influence on the
                            outcome of the HC Appeal. …</p>
<p class="Judg-1">In this regard, para 53 of the Appellant’s Case is also
                    relevant:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In response to the [r]espondent’s assertions that there was no
                        report or result of the alleged experiment, <em>the
                            [a]ppellant is in a position to provide these reports to the
                            [r]espondent as part of the evidence</em> that will be considered
                        in the HC Appeal and the [a]ppellant confirms that the manner in which its
                        experts measured the ARA (as will be described in their declarations) is
                        consistent with what would have been done by a skilled person. The
                        [r]espondent’s experts can then properly verify the results at [their]
                        leisure. Notwithstanding the above, the [a]ppellant submits that the
                        [r]espondent’s experts are not the arbiters of the credibility of the
                        experimental data and cannot prejudge the same, this being a matter rightly
                        falling within the dominion of the High Court. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     More significantly, in the Appellant’s
                    Case (at paras 55–58), it was revealed for the first time that the
                    appellant had suspicions as to the accuracy of the D4a Claim after becoming
                    aware, sometime in the fourth quarter of 2009 (<em>ie</em>,
                    after the hearing before the Tribunal), that an entity known as
                    “DSM” (whose full name has not been disclosed by the appellant)
                    had carried out an experiment similar to the Experiment and had filed the
                    results which it obtained (“the DSM results”) with the European
                    Patent Office on 6 October 2009. The Judge was not informed of this
                    catalytic factor.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     During the hearing before this court on
                    20 August 2010, the appellant seemed to shift its position yet again. At
                    that hearing, the appellant sought leave for an independent expert to conduct
                    the Experiment and then submit the results obtained to the court. Nothing was
                    said about producing the results of the Experiment, which the appellant claimed
                    it had already conducted. In other words, it appears that by the time this
                    appeal was heard, the appellant no longer wanted to proceed with the
                    Interlocutory Application based on the premise underlying the application as
                    presented in the Appellant’s Case, namely, the premise that the appellant
                    had already conducted the Experiment and was seeking leave only to produce the
                    results obtained, which would show that the D4a Claim was inaccurate (see
                        <a href="#p1_22">[22]</a> above). Why was that so? Was the
                    appellant, at the time this appeal was heard, still trying to find more
                    favourable evidence?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     In the light of what has been stated at
                        <a href="#p1_18">[18]</a>–<a href="#p1_24">[24]</a> above, we will now summarise the matters which give us
                    cause for concern. First, why did the appellant not inform the Judge, at the
                    hearing on 12 March 2010, that it had already carried out the Experiment
                    and was seeking leave only to adduce the results obtained as evidence in the HC
                    Appeal? As a result of this omission, the Judge was left with the impression
                    that the Interlocutory Application was an application for leave to <em>both</em> carry out the Experiment <em>and</em> adduce the results obtained as evidence in the HC
                    Appeal.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     Second, why did the appellant not tell the
                    Judge about the catalytic factor mentioned at <a href="#p1_23">[23]</a> above? It appears to us that if the filing of the DSM
                    results with the European Patent Office on 6 October 2009 was indeed the
                    event which aroused the appellant’s suspicions as to the accuracy of the
                    D4a Claim, that fact would have been relevant for the purposes of explaining, in
                    part, why the Interlocutory Application had to be made. By its own submission,
                    the appellant was aware of the DSM results as early as 16 November
                        2009.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_5" id="Ftn_5_1"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span> The appellant did not,
                    however, make the Interlocutory Application forthwith, but instead waited until
                    15 January 2010 before doing so. No explanation was given by the appellant
                    for this delay. Now, what is even more baffling is that the appellant offered
                    another reason as to why it made the Interlocutory Application only on
                    15 January 2010, namely: the appellant stated that it was only after the
                    cross-examination of one of the respondent’s expert witnesses,
                    Dr William R Barclay (“Dr Barclay”), during the
                    hearing before the Tribunal, which cross-examination revealed that
                    Dr Barclay had not personally conducted the Experiment, that the idea of
                    conducting the Experiment crossed its (the appellant’s) mind. This
                    alternative explanation did not find favour with the Judge, who commented in the
                    High Court GD at [75] as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The [appellant]’s position that the necessity of conducting the
                        [E]xperiment only arose during cross-examination did not explain why the
                        application to adduce fresh evidence should only take place at the appeal
                        stage [<em>ie</em>, at the stage of the HC Appeal]. The
                        [appellant]’s inaction over the period between 12 February 2009
                            [<em>viz</em>, the day on which the hearing before
                        the Tribunal ended] to 3 November 2009 [<em>viz</em>, the date on which the Tribunal’s Judgment was
                        released] shows a lack of due diligence in securing all relevant evidence
                        before the Tribunal.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">We cannot help but wonder whether this allegation by the appellant
                        (<em>viz</em>, that the filing of the DSM results with
                    the European Patent Office prompted its suspicions as to the accuracy of the D4a
                    Claim) was an afterthought.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     Third, the appellant was rather coy in
                    disclosing key information and evidence, such as the following:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_27-p2_a"></a>(a)     the results of the Experiment (which
                        the appellant claimed it had already conducted), evidence that the appellant
                        had indeed conducted the Experiment, as well as evidence on when and how the
                        Experiment was carried out; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_27-p2_b"></a>(b)     copies of any documents relating to the filing of the DSM
                        results with the European Patent Office and/or the results themselves (here,
                        we note that although the appellant claims that DSM provided it with a copy
                        of the DSM results as filed with the European Patent Office, the appellant
                        has chosen not to produce those results to the court).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     In our view, the foregoing matters clearly
                    show not only a lack of forthrightness on the part of the appellant <em>vis-à-vis</em> the court, but also a failure by the appellant
                    to exercise reasonable diligence in presenting its case both before the Tribunal
                    and before the Judge. Worse, the aforesaid matters made us doubt whether the
                    appellant had indeed already carried out the Experiment as it claimed and
                    whether the filing of the DSM results with the European Patent Office was truly
                    the catalytic factor which led to the appellant’s decision to challenge
                    the D4a Claim. In short, the way in which the appellant presented the
                    circumstances surrounding and its reasons for making the Interlocutory
                    Application left us unconvinced that the appellant had genuine reasons to doubt
                    the accuracy of the D4a Claim.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Acceptance of prior art at face value</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     The appellant also made the assertion before
                    us that it was the usual practice to accept the claims of prior art at face
                    value. To this, we would make two observations. First, no evidence of this
                    alleged practice has been tendered to the court; this practice is only a bare
                    claim on the part of the appellant. Second, we find it strange that in the face
                    of the respondent’s application to strike out the Patent on the basis of
                    prior art, the appellant was content to simply accept the claims of the prior
                    art cited by the respondent. Be that as it may, and even assuming that it is
                    indeed the usual practice to accept the claims of prior art at face value, it
                    appears to us that this alleged practice is only part of the reason why the
                    appellant did not challenge the D4a Claim earlier. In this regard, the
                    explanation given by the appellant’s counsel to the Judge at the hearing
                    on 12 March 2010 is telling – namely, the appellant did not conduct
                    the Experiment (with a view to challenging the accuracy of the D4a Claim)
                    earlier because it was confident that it had distinguished D4a from the
                        Patent.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_6" id="Ftn_6_1"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span> It appears that it was only after the
                    adverse ruling by the Tribunal and after realising that D4a was one of the
                    reasons for that ruling that the appellant sought to cast doubt (or search for
                    some evidence which could cast doubt) on the accuracy of the D4a
                Claim.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Application of the relevant guidelines to the facts of this
                case</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The <em>Ladd v Marshall</em>
                conditions</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     While we are of the view that the <em>Ladd v Marshall</em> conditions should not be applied rigidly
                    to an application for leave to adduce further evidence in an appeal from a
                    decision of the Patents Registrar to the High Court and that there is a need to
                    also consider other factors (as listed at <a href="#p1_16">[16]</a> above) where applicable, we think it is nevertheless useful
                    to see to what extent this case satisfies the <em>Ladd v
                        Marshall</em> conditions (which, it should be observed, are consistent
                    with the other factors just mentioned).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     It seems to us clear that the appellant has
                    not fulfilled the first of the <em>Ladd v Marshall</em>
                    conditions, <em>viz</em>, the condition that the further
                    evidence sought to be adduced could not have been obtained with reasonable
                    diligence for use at the trial. If the appellant had wanted to, it could have
                    carried out the Experiment to verify the D4a Claim prior to the hearing before
                    the Tribunal. Here, we note the possible argument that, perhaps, the appellant
                    should not be faulted too much for not challenging D4a (by carrying out the
                    Experiment) earlier: the court should understand that people usually would not
                    challenge valid patents, which are deemed to be authentic in their claims.
                    Putting it another way, it may be argued (in the appellant’s favour) that
                    a reasonable person might not have thought it necessary to challenge a valid
                    patent (in this case, D4a), and, without challenging D4a, the Alleged Further
                    Evidence (as defined at <a href="#p1_2">[2]</a> above) would not
                    have been available for use in the proceedings before the Tribunal. However, for
                    our present purposes, and without going into an examination of the usual
                    practice with regard to the treatment of claims in a registered patent, there is
                    a need for the court to examine the facts of this case more closely. It will be
                    recalled (see <a href="#p1_26">[26]</a> above) that the appellant
                    stated that the thought of challenging the D4a Claim occurred to it only after
                    the cross-examination of Dr Barclay; the appellant did not explain why it
                    could not have made such a challenge earlier. As observed by the Judge at [75]
                    of the High Court GD (and see also sub-para (c) of <a href="#p1_5">[5]</a> above), the appellant should have taken one of the following
                    steps: (a) conduct the Experiment prior to the hearing before the Tribunal;
                    or (b) apply for leave during that hearing to conduct the Experiment and
                    adduce the results obtained as evidence before the Tribunal; or (c) at the
                    very least, apply sometime between the close of the hearing before the Tribunal
                    and the date on which the Tribunal’s Judgment was released (a period of
                    some eight months) for leave to conduct the Experiment and tender the results
                    obtained to the Tribunal. In addition, the appellant’s counsel admitted at
                    the hearing before the Judge that the reason why the appellant did not conduct
                    the Experiment earlier was because it was confident that it had distinguished
                    D4a, which related to a skin cream, from the Patent, which related to infant
                    formula (see <a href="#p1_29">[29]</a> above). The
                    appellant’s over-confidence and complacency appear to us to be the real
                    reasons why the appellant did not carry out the Experiment earlier. These
                    factors hardly give the appellant a reasonable excuse for failing to adduce the
                    Alleged Further Evidence in the proceedings before the Tribunal. The decision
                    not to carry out the Experiment earlier was a strategic move taken by the
                    appellant, and it now has to live by its choice. We therefore find that the
                    appellant has not satisfied the first of the <em>Ladd v
                        Marshall</em> conditions.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     As for second of the <em>Ladd v
                        Marshall</em> conditions (<em>viz</em>, the
                    condition that the further evidence sought to be adduced must have an important
                    bearing on the result of the case, although it need not be decisive), the Judge
                    felt that the Alleged Further Evidence would not have had such an impact. With
                    respect, we do not agree with the Judge on this point. In our view, looking at
                    the decision of the Tribunal, it seems quite clear that the Tribunal regarded
                    D4a as being central to its decision. This appears from [215] of the
                    Tribunal’s Judgment, where the Tribunal stated:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In summary, notwithstanding some findings of novelty in some of the claims
                        [set out in the Patent], we find that the main claims [lack inventive step],
                        namely[,] claim 1 lacks inventive step given the teachings in <em>D4a read with D7</em> or <em>D4a read with
                            D10</em>, claim 2 lacks inventive step given the teachings in
                            <em>D4a read with D5a</em> or <em>D4a read with D7</em>, … and … claim 35 lacks
                        inventive step given the teachings in <em>D4a read with
                            D5a</em> or <em>D4a read with D7</em>. All
                        the dependent claims fail as such and we find that the invention in the
                        … Patent is not patentable. [underlining and emphasis in bold in
                        original omitted; emphasis added in italics]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     The Judge cited some of the respondent’s
                    submissions which purportedly showed that “the Tribunal’s decision
                    was that the Patent was also invalid in view of prior art <em>other than</em> D4[a]” [emphasis in original] (see the High
                    Court GD at [78]). With respect, a plain reading of the Tribunal’s
                    Judgment (specifically, [152] and [156] thereof) clearly shows that the Tribunal
                    did take into account D4a, read together with other instances of prior art cited
                    by the respondent, in arriving at its decision. <em>Prima
                        facie</em>, any evidence which allegedly casts doubt on the accuracy
                    of the D4a Claim would have a significant impact on the outcome of the case.
                    Accordingly, the second of the <em>Ladd v Marshall</em>
                    conditions seems to have been fulfilled. The Judge also went on to state (at
                    [78] of the High Court GD) that “without enclosing any report or result
                    of the … [E]xperiment, the [r]espondent’s experts would be in no
                    position to verify the credibility of the alleged result”. It seems to us
                    that this point is more germane to the third of the <em>Ladd v
                        Marshall</em> conditions, to which we now turn.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     The third condition set out in <em>Ladd v Marshall</em> is that the further evidence sought to
                    be adduced must be apparently credible, although it need not be
                    incontrovertible. As the Judge noted (see <a href="#p1_33">[33]</a> above), the appellant did not disclose any report or
                    document which would have revealed more about the Alleged Further Evidence. The
                    appellant was also vague in its description of this evidence, and merely made
                    the bare assertion that “after repeating [the Experiment], it was found
                    that the oil produced by following [the Experiment] ha[d] an Arachidonic Acid
                    (ARA) content of <u>less</u> than <u>50%</u>”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_7" id="Ftn_7_1"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span>
                    [underlining in original]. Further, as noted earlier (at sub-para (a) of
                        <a href="#p1_27">[27]</a> above), the appellant did not give
                    details as to when it conducted the Experiment, how the Experiment was carried
                    out and, significantly, the exact ARA content of the oil produced from the
                    Experiment (in this regard, it was not good enough for the appellant to simply
                    state that the oil produced had an ARA content of less than 50%). Another
                    relevant factor is that although, according to the letter from the
                    appellant’s solicitors to the court dated 19 March 2010 (see
                        <a href="#p1_4">[4]</a> above), the appellant had <em>already conducted</em> the Experiment by the time the Judge
                    heard the Interlocutory Application on 12 March 2010, the appellant
                    nonetheless presented that application to the Judge as an application for
                        (<em>inter alia</em>) leave <em>to
                        conduct</em> the Experiment (see <a href="#p1_20">[20]</a> above). Equally perplexing is the question of why the
                    appellant did not inform its counsel prior to the hearing on 12 March 2010
                    that it had already conducted the Experiment and, instead, made this known only
                    after the said hearing. In addition, as the Judge rightly pointed out (see [76]
                    of the High Court GD), if the Experiment had indeed been conducted prior to the
                    hearing of the Interlocutory Application as alleged, why did the appellant not
                    file an affidavit setting out the findings obtained from the Experiment? Even
                    more intriguing is the fact that, at the hearing before us, the appellant asked
                    this court to appoint an independent expert to carry out the Experiment (see
                        <a href="#p1_24">[24]</a> above). For these reasons, we have
                    serious doubts as to whether the appellant had indeed carried out the Experiment
                    as it claimed and, even if it had done so, whether it had conducted the
                    Experiment properly so as to obtain credible results. In this regard, we should
                    mention in passing that the appellant does not appear to appreciate the
                    importance of being absolutely forthright with the court when seeking the
                    court’s indulgence. In the result, we hold that the appellant has not
                    satisfied the third of the <em>Ladd v Marshall</em>
                    conditions.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     As discussed earlier (see <a href="#p1_15">[15]</a> above), the <em>Ladd v
                        Marshall</em> test should not be prescribed as a strict test for the
                    purposes of an application to adduce further evidence under O 87A
                    r 13(2) of the ROC. Thus, even though the appellant has not satisfied the
                        <em>Ladd v Marshall</em> test, it does not follow that
                    the Interlocutory Application must necessarily fail. We also need to consider
                    whether there are other compelling factors which justify granting the appellant
                    leave to adduce the Alleged Further Evidence. In this regard, the other
                    considerations stated by Laddie J in <em>Hunt-Wesson</em> at 242 (see <a href="#p1_16">[16]</a>
                    above) are relevant.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Other considerations</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     In our view, given the circumstances of this
                    case, aside from the <em>Ladd v Marshall</em> conditions,
                    the last two of the factors stated by Laddie J in <em>Hunt-Wesson</em> at 242 also require consideration, namely:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_36-p2_a"></a>(a)     the desirability of avoiding
                        multiplicity of proceedings; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_36-p2_b"></a>(b)     the public’s interest, particularly the effect of
                        the Patent on the market.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     
          <em>Vis-à-vis</em> the
                    first of the aforesaid factors, what is special about trade mark proceedings and
                    patent proceedings (as opposed to a normal civil litigation) is that even after
                    an opposing party fails in its challenge to the registration or the validity of
                    a trade mark or patent, there is nothing to prevent another party from later
                    opposing the same trade mark or patent. Therefore, to avoid multiplicity of
                    proceedings, the court may be more inclined to allow the first-mentioned
                    opposing party to adduce the best evidence available and indulge that
                    party’s request for leave to adduce further evidence even if the request
                    is made at a late stage of the proceedings. However, this factor may not
                    necessarily apply the other way round, <em>viz</em>, the
                    court may not be similarly inclined to grant indulgence to a party who fails to
                    obtain registration of a patent or trade mark, but who later seeks to adduce
                    further evidence to bolster its alleged proprietary entitlement to register the
                    patent or trade mark in question. This difference in treatment between the two
                    scenarios is, arguably, not without justification. The first of the <em>Ladd v Marshall</em> conditions is meant to discourage a
                    party from putting forth its case in a piecemeal manner and to, in turn, punish
                    the party wishing to adduce further evidence for its failure to adduce that
                    evidence at the proper time. The party asserting a proprietary right in a patent
                    or trade mark has the responsibility to put forth its entire case, including all
                    relevant material in support thereof. If it fails to do so, it has only itself
                    to blame. On the other hand, a party which opposes the registration of a patent
                    or trade mark is, to a certain extent, doing a public service in terms of
                    preventing unworthy inventions and products from monopolising the market. If an
                    unworthy invention or product is permitted to remain on the patents register or
                    the trade marks register, another interested party can subsequently challenge
                    that same invention or product, thus engendering further
                litigation.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     Turning to the second factor on public
                    interest mentioned at <a href="#p1_36">[36]</a> above, we do not
                    think that there is anything in the present case which favours the appellant. On
                    the contrary, we find that the following submission by the respondent (<em>viz</em>, that allowing the Alleged Further Evidence to be
                    adduced would cause unnecessary delay in the HC Appeal, which would in turn have
                    repercussions on the market) has merit:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_8" id="Ftn_8_1"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[T]he public will be deprived of a more cost[-]effective and non-patented
                        substitute during this period [<em>ie</em>, the period
                        pending the resolution of the HC Appeal], not only from the [r]espondent but
                        very possibly also from other market players who will most likely be
                        withholding the sale of close substitutes pending the outcome of the HC
                        Appeal.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     Thus, there is nothing in the two factors
                    highlighted at <a href="#p1_36">[36]</a> above which would
                    persuade us to exercise our discretion in favour of granting the appellant leave
                    to adduce the Alleged Further Evidence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     Over and above all the considerations
                    discussed above, and even assuming (for the purposes of the Interlocutory
                    Application as presented to this court <em>at the hearing of this
                        appeal</em> (see <a href="#p1_24">[24]</a> above)) that
                    the results of the Experiment (as conducted by an independent expert) will turn
                    out to be favourable to the appellant, adducing the Alleged Further Evidence at
                    this late stage of the proceedings will be extremely prejudicial to the
                    respondent. As submitted by the respondent:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_9" id="Ftn_9_1"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The time to challenge the [D4a Claim] was during the proceedings before
                        the Tribunal, but no action was taken by the [a]ppellant despite the fact
                        that [it has] been aware of the [D4a Claim] for at least the last four
                        years. … Had the [a]ppellant submitted the Alleged [Further] Evidence
                        during the proceedings before the Tribunal, the [r]espondent could have
                        developed its evidence differently … The [r]espondent no longer has
                        the opportunity to do so because the [a]ppellant is only now seeking to
                        introduce the Alleged [Further] Evidence against D4a at this late stage.
                        This prejudice to the [r]espondent is irremediable.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">In the circumstances of this case (and proceeding on the basis of the
                    Interlocutory Application as it was presented to this court at the hearing of
                    this appeal), if the court were to allow the appellant’s request at this
                    time for the appointment of an independent expert to conduct the Experiment and
                    present the results obtained to the court, the court, in order to act fairly,
                    would also have to give the respondent substantial leeway to re-run such parts
                    of its case as may be necessary. This would inevitably re-open matters already
                    dealt with by the Tribunal, an outcome which the court can hardly countenance.
                    We would hasten to add that not every application for leave to adduce further
                    evidence in an appeal would result in such an eventuality if the application
                    were granted: much would depend on the nature of the case at hand, the decision
                    which is under appeal as well as the nature of the further evidence sought to be
                    adduced.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     To summarise, it seems to us that the
                    Interlocutory Application, in its final form as presented to this court at the
                    hearing of this appeal, is not so much an application for leave to adduce the
                    Alleged Further Evidence in the HC Appeal, but, rather, an application for leave
                    to adduce such further evidence in aid of the appellant’s case as the
                    appellant may be able to find. The appellant does not appear to be certain what
                    the results of the Experiment will be, but is only speculating that they will be
                    favourable to it. The justice of the case also does not favour the appellant
                    (see <a href="#p1_40">[40]</a> above). Therefore, we affirm the
                    Judge’s decision and decline to grant leave either for the appellant to
                    adduce the Alleged Further Evidence in the HC Appeal (taking the Interlocutory
                    Application as it was presented at the time it was filed and also as it was
                    presented to the Judge), or for an independent expert to be appointed to carry
                    out the Experiment and then submit his findings to the court (taking the
                    Interlocutory Application in its final form as presented to this court at the
                    hearing of this appeal).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     This appeal is, therefore, dismissed with
                    costs and the usual consequential orders.</p>
