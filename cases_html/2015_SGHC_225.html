        Judith Prakash J:</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       The issue posed by the two applications before
                    me is akin to the old and familiar brain teaser contained in the question: Which
                    came first, the chicken or the egg?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The plaintiff started this action on
                    3 August 2015 seeking a declaration that she had not entered into any
                    arbitration agreement with the defendants and a further declaration that all
                    proceedings in the arbitration known as SIAC Arbitration No 24/2015
                    (“SIAC 24”) are a nullity and of no effect. On the same
                    day, she filed an application for an injunction to restrain the defendants, as
                    claimants, from continuing with SIAC 24 against the plaintiff, as
                    respondent, pending the full and final disposal of the action. The
                    defendants’ response, a few days later, was to file a summons for all
                    proceedings in this action to be stayed pending the full and final determination
                    of SIAC 24. The defendants invoked s 6 of the International
                    Arbitration Act (Cap 143A, 2002 Rev Ed) (“the IAA”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       I heard both applications on an urgent basis on
                    the same day. In essence, the defendants’ contention is that there is an
                    arbitration agreement to which the IAA applies and therefore, under s 6(2)
                    of the IAA, I must stay this action and dismiss the plaintiff’s
                    application for an interim injunction. The plaintiff contends that the court is
                    not bound to stay the proceedings under s 6(2) because, due to her position
                    that she never signed any arbitration agreement and that the purported signature
                    that appears on the document on which the defendants rely is not her signature
                    but a forgery, no arbitration agreement exists and therefore the defendants have
                    no standing to make an application under s 6 of the IAA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       The plaintiff says that the question as to
                    whether a valid arbitration agreement exists so as to confer jurisdiction on the
                    tribunal in SIAC 24 is an issue for the court. The defendants on the other
                    hand argue that under the regime set up by the IAA and the UNCITRAL Model Law on
                    International Commercial Arbitration (“the Model Law”), the
                    existence of an arbitration agreement is pre-eminently an issue which comes
                    within the jurisdiction of the arbitral tribunal and only after the tribunal has
                    rendered its decision on its issue can the court play a role.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Background</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The Personal Guarantee Deed</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       The first defendant is a Singapore incorporated
                    company and the second to fifth defendants are individuals. In December 2013,
                    all the defendants agreed to grant a loan to a Singapore incorporated company
                    (which I shall refer to as “the Borrower”) in the aggregate
                    principal amount of US$2.3m to partially finance the Borrower’s
                    acquisition of all the shares in another company which I shall refer to as
                    “XPL”. The plaintiff’s husband (“PV”) was the
                    sole shareholder and director of the Borrower.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       During the negotiations for the loan to the
                    Borrower, PV agreed that he and the plaintiff would guarantee the repayment of
                    the loan as part of the security for it. The loan agreement and various security
                    documents were signed on 28 December 2013. The guarantee of the plaintiff
                    and PV were contained in a “Personal Guarantee Deed” (“the
                    Guarantee”) which was prepared in a number of counterparts and supposed
                    to be executed on the same day. PV apparently executed one counterpart of the
                    Guarantee on 28 December 2013 but the plaintiff did not sign
                any.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       The loan moneys were disbursed to the Borrower
                    in various tranches between 30 December 2013 and 3 January 2014. In
                    late February 2014, the defendants were informed by their solicitors that as the
                    plaintiff was travelling she would only be able to provide the executed
                    counterpart of the Guarantee on her return. Eventually, on 24 March 2014,
                    the Borrower’s solicitors, M/s Allen &amp; Gledhill LLP
                    (“A&amp;G”), sent the defendants’ solicitors a letter which
                    stated “Enclosed please find the Personal Guarantee Deed executed by [the
                    plaintiff]”. The copy of the Guarantee attached to that letter bore a
                    signature next to the plaintiff’s name and also bore the signature of a
                    witness. It appeared to the defendants that the plaintiff had signed the
                    Guarantee in the presence of a witness.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       The Guarantee provided, by cl 7.7 thereof,
                    for any dispute or difference arising amongst the parties with respect to the
                    Deed or “as to any matter or thing of whatsoever nature arising
                    thereunder or in connection therewith, <em>including any question
                        regarding its existence, validity or termination</em> [emphasis
                    added]” to be submitted to a single arbitrator to be appointed by the
                    parties or, failing agreement, to a single arbitrator to be appointed on the
                    request of any party by the President of the Court of Arbitration of the
                    Singapore International Arbitration Centre (“the
                SIAC”).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Events leading to this action</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       On 29 April 2014, the Borrower defaulted on
                    the scheduled repayment of the loan thus giving rise to an event of default
                    under the loan documentation. On 2 June 2014, the defendants, through their
                    solicitors, gave notice to the Borrower, PV and the plaintiff of the event of
                    default and demanded payment from the Borrower and PV. The plaintiff was
                    informed that if proceedings had to be commenced against the Borrower to enforce
                    recovery, the plaintiff may be liable as guarantor for the loan. A few days
                    later, the defendants received a letter from solicitors acting for the plaintiff
                    and a company named Colloso Limited stating that their clients were considering
                    purchasing XPL. At about the same time, there was a meeting between the
                    plaintiff and the third defendant arranged by PV. It is not clear from the
                    defendants’ evidence what was discussed at the meeting.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     The loan was not repaid. On 11 November
                    2014, the defendants’ solicitors made a written demand on the plaintiff
                    via a letter to her then solicitors, M/s Oon &amp; Bazul LLP
                    (“O&amp;B”), for the sum of US$2.76m plus late interest and costs.
                    The plaintiff did not make payment. However, subsequently there were attempts to
                    mediate the dispute in which her solicitors participated. In the event, no
                    mediation took place.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     On 4 February 2015, the defendants issued
                    a “Notice of Arbitration under the Singapore International Arbitration
                    Centre” (the “Notice”) in respect of their claim against
                    the plaintiff for payment pursuant to the Guarantee. By the Notice, the
                    claimant nominated one Mr Ben Giaretta as sole arbitrator. A copy of the
                    Notice was sent to the plaintiff at an address in Kuala Lumpur.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     The plaintiff did not respond directly to the
                    Notice. However, on 14 April 2015, she sent an e-mail to the SIAC stating
                    that she had received some letters which stated something about
                    “ARBITRATION no.024 of 2015” and wanted to know what it was about.
                    She said that she would send the matter to an attorney. The SIAC replied to the
                    plaintiff by e-mail the same day informing her that she had been named the
                    respondent in SIAC 24.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     The plaintiff did not indicate any agreement
                    to Mr Giaretta being appointed sole arbitrator. Thus, on 5 May 2015, the
                    SIAC appointed another person, one Ms Caroline Kenny QC, as the sole arbitrator
                    (“Tribunal”) for SIAC 24.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     On 13 May 2015, M/s Drew &amp; Napier,
                    acting as the plaintiff’s solicitors, informed the Tribunal that, since
                    2012, the plaintiff had not resided at the Kuala Lumpur address to which the
                    Notice had been sent and did not have a copy of the Notice. Therefore, M/s Drew
                    &amp; Napier asked for a month to obtain the Notice and take instructions on the
                    proposed timelines for the arbitration. On 18 May 2015, the Tribunal sent
                    out a draft Procedural Order which contained the proposed timelines for the
                    arbitration.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     On 21 May 2015, M/s Drew &amp; Napier
                    responded to the Tribunal’s letter by informing it that the
                    plaintiff’s position was that SIAC 24 had been improperly commenced
                    by the defendants. Their letter further stated that the plaintiff had not
                    entered into any agreement, deed or contract with the defendants, including the
                    Guarantee. The signature appearing on page 23 of the defendants’
                    Statement of Case in the arbitration was not her signature and in the premises
                    there was no valid arbitration agreement between her and the defendants. The
                    letter emphasised that it was not a submission to jurisdiction in respect of the
                    arbitral proceedings.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     On 25 May 2015, the Tribunal issued
                    Procedural Order No 1 which, among other things, required the plaintiff to
                    file her Statement of Defence on or before 15 June 2015. She did not do so.
                    On 17 June 2015, M/s Drew &amp; Napier discharged themselves from acting
                    for her and, on 23 June 2015, the plaintiff herself asked the Tribunal to
                    give her some time as she was looking for another attorney. She subsequently
                    appointed her present solicitors, Advocatus Law LLP (“Advocatus”),
                    and on 16 July 2015 they asked the Tribunal to let them have two weeks to
                    take instructions. The Tribunal responded the same day and extended the time for
                    delivery of the Statement of Defence to Friday, 24 July 2015.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     Ultimately, the Statement of Defence was
                    served on 27 July 2015. In it the plaintiff made the following main
                    points:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_17-p2_a"></a>(a)     The Statement of Defence was filed
                        without prejudice to her right to object to the Tribunal’s
                        jurisdiction on the ground that there was no valid arbitration agreement in
                        existence between her and the defendants.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_17-p2_b"></a>(b)     The plaintiff did not sign or otherwise enter
                        into the Guarantee. The signature purporting to be that of the plaintiff in
                        that document is not hers.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_17-p2_c"></a>(c)     The plaintiff’s challenge to the validity of the
                        Guarantee on the ground that her signature was forged directly impeached the
                        validity of the arbitration agreement.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_17-p2_d"></a>(d)     Accordingly, the Tribunal had no jurisdiction over the
                        plaintiff including to rule on its own jurisdiction and the appropriate
                        forum to determine whether the purported signature was indeed that of the
                        plaintiff and if she is bound by the arbitration agreement was the Singapore
                        court.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     On 28 July 2015, the Tribunal requested
                    the parties to indicate their availability for hearing from 21 to
                    28 August 2015. The plaintiff’s solicitor responded by asking the
                    Tribunal to stay the proceedings. On 31 July 2015, the Tribunal ruled that
                    under r 25.2 of the SIAC Rules the Tribunal had power to rule on its own
                    jurisdiction “including any objections with respect to the existence,
                    termination or validity of the arbitration agreement”. The Tribunal
                    refused the application for a stay and stated that it would rule on the
                    objection to its jurisdiction when delivering the award on the merits. Three
                    days later, the plaintiff commenced the present proceedings.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">How should s 6 of the IAA be applied?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     This is where the chicken and the egg question
                    arises. Mr Nakul Dewan, counsel for the defendants, says that the international
                    arbitration regime in place in Singapore gives primacy to the Tribunal and it is
                    the Tribunal that has the first bite at deciding whether or not there is an
                    arbitration agreement which confers jurisdiction on it. The defendants further
                    say that under s 6 of the IAA I have no choice but to refer the question of
                    the existence, validity or termination of an arbitration agreement to the
                    Tribunal. The plaintiff’s riposte is that s 6 would only apply to an
                    “arbitration agreement” and that since she did not sign the
                    Guarantee, neither she nor the defendants are parties to an “arbitration
                    agreement” within s 6(1) and therefore the defendants are not
                    allowed to apply to court for a stay of this action. It is for the court to
                    decide whether there is an arbitration agreement or not.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     Essentially, my dilemma is how to apply
                    s 6 of the IAA in the circumstances of this case. The first two subsections
                    of that provision read:</p>

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     The plaintiff relies on s 6(1) to argue
                    that where the existence of an arbitration agreement is challenged, until that
                    challenge is resolved by the court, there can be no “arbitration
                    agreement” which permits the opposing party to apply for a stay of the
                    court action. The defendants on the other hand refer to Art 16 of the Model
                    Law, which is part of Singapore law, and emphasise that under sub-Art (1)
                    the Tribunal may rule on its own jurisdiction including any objections with
                    respect to the “existence or validity of the arbitration
                    agreement”. Accordingly, s 6(2) makes it plain that a stay must be
                    issued unless the court is satisfied that the arbitration agreement is null and
                    void or inoperative or incapable of being performed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     There is no doubt that as a matter of general
                    law, the courts have jurisdiction to decide on the existence or otherwise of a
                    putative contract and this would include an arbitration agreement. It is the
                    defendants who have invoked s 6 of the IAA to persuade me that in the
                    present case the court’s general jurisdiction must give way to the
                    Tribunal’s jurisdiction which is founded not only on Art 16 of the
                    Model Law but also on r 25.2 of the SIAC Rules which specifically empowers
                    the Tribunal to decide on the existence of the arbitration agreement. This
                    section can only be invoked if there is an “arbitration agreement”
                    and therefore the question is what burden of proof the defendants have to
                    satisfy in order to persuade me of this.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     There is a subsidiary point which is that
                    under s 6(1), for the application to be made, the court proceedings must be
                    in respect “of a matter which is the subject of the agreement”.
                    The parties did not make much of this point, no doubt because they recognised
                    that the wording of cl 7.7 of the Guarantee specifically referred to
                    disputes about the “existence” of the arbitration agreement being
                    among the disputes that would be referred to arbitration.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     The defendants’ submission is that to
                    make a determination that an arbitration agreement exists in order for a stay to
                    be granted pursuant to s 6 of the IAA, the court is only required to be
                    satisfied of the same on a <em>prima facie</em> basis. The
                    plaintiff disagrees. Her counsel, Mr Christopher Daniel, submits that in a
                    situation where one party has denied ever entering into the alleged arbitration
                    agreement so that its very existence is brought into question, the question as
                    to whether any agreement was ever reached should be decided by the court on the
                    usual civil standard after a full trial. He says there is a conceptual
                    difficulty in referring the issue of existence to the tribunal since if no
                    agreement was ever concluded, no tribunal can ever be constituted.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     I should note here that the plaintiff did not
                    dispute that if an arbitration agreement in the terms of cl 7.7 of the
                    Guarantee existed it would give rise to an international arbitration governed by
                    the IAA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     In order to decide on the applicable standard,
                    it is necessary to look into the regime governing international arbitration. It
                    is well-known that in this regime the role of the court has been deliberately
                    circumscribed so as to promote the efficiency and speediness of the arbitral
                    process. By Art 5 of the Model Law, the court is prohibited from
                    interfering in matters governed by the Model Law except to the extent it
                    expressly allows such intervention. Accordingly, in Singapore the court cannot
                    interfere in this process except as specifically set out in the Model Law and
                    the IAA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     In relation to jurisdictional questions,
                    Art 16 of the Model Law, as noted earlier, confers on an arbitral
                    tribunal a power to rule on its own jurisdiction including any objections with
                    respect to the existence of the arbitration agreement. Under sub-Art (3), a
                    plea that the tribunal has no jurisdiction may be ruled on either as a
                    preliminary question or in an award on the merits. The article further provides
                    that if the tribunal makes a ruling as a preliminary question that it has
                    jurisdiction, either party may within 30 days thereafter apply to the court to
                    decide the matter. On the other hand, if the tribunal rules that it has
                    jurisdiction as part of an award on the merits, the objecting party may apply
                    under Art 34(2)(<em>a</em>)(i) to set aside the award
                    on the ground that there was no jurisdiction because no arbitration agreement
                    existed (see <em>PT First Media TBK v Astro Nusantara
                        International BV</em> [2014] 1 SLR 372 at [156]). The drafters of the
                    Model Law thus did not rule out recourse to court on the issue of jurisdiction
                    but took care to provide that this issue would first be determined by the
                    tribunal and would only be considered by the court after the tribunal had come
                    to a decision. The drafters of the Model Law did consider whether court
                    determination of the jurisdiction issue should be allowed prior to the
                    tribunal’s own decision and, at one point in time, a draft article
                    providing for concurrent court control was included in the draft of the Model
                    Law. Subsequently, however, this draft article was deleted for the purpose of
                    preventing dilatory tactics and obstruction of the arbitral process (see
                        <em>Yearbook of the UN Commission on International Trade Law,
                        1985</em>, Vol XVI, at p 122,
                    paras 12–13).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     I therefore accept that under the regime
                    established by the Model Law, generally the court’s consideration of
                    whether an arbitration tribunal has jurisdiction or not must come after the
                    tribunal’s own examination of the issue. I also accept that the
                    tribunal’s powers in relation to the issue are wide because it can
                    consider not only validity but also the very existence of the arbitration
                    agreement. However, the true interpretation of s 6(1) impacts on whether in
                    this case it is mandatory for me to stay the court proceedings.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     Mr Daniel seeks to persuade me that if
                    the very existence of an arbitration agreement is in question, it must be the
                    court that considers this issue first. He drew my attention to a commentary in
                        <em>Russell on Arbitration</em> (Sweet &amp; Maxwell,
                    23rd Ed, 2007) at para 2-012, which reads:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… By contrast, where it was alleged that the signature of one
                        of the parties to the matrix contract had been forged, and hence no matrix
                        contract or agreement to arbitrate had been reached, then this was a
                        question going to whether there was any agreement ever reached and would be
                        decided by the court.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     The plaintiff says that this principle was
                    applied by the English High Court in <em>Nigel Peter Albon
                        (trading as N A Carriage Co) v Naza Motor Trading Sdn Bhd and
                        anor</em> [2007] 2 All ER 1075 (“<em>Albon</em>”) where the respondent contended that a purported
                    joint venture agreement with the claimant was a forgery and, on that ground,
                    refused to participate in the arbitration proceedings which were commenced by
                    the claimants. It was stated in <em>Albon</em> at [20] that
                    “[w]hilst the doctrine of ‘<em>Kompetenz-Kompetenz</em>’ … provides that the arbitral
                    tribunal shall have jurisdiction to determine whether the arbitration agreement
                    was ever concluded, it does not preclude the court itself from determining that
                    question”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     Mr Daniel also noted that a local author
                    has argued that “[i]f the facts and legal arguments impinge directly on
                    the validity of the arbitration agreement, [for example], forgery of the main
                    contract that contains the arbitration agreement – there is no <em>a priori</em> reason why the courts should
                    defer entirely to the principle of <em>kompetenz-kompetenz</em>” (see Nicholas Poon, “The Use
                    and Abuse of Anti-Arbitration Injunctions: A Way Forward for Singapore”
                    (2013) 25 SAcLJ 244 at para 18).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     The <em>Albon</em> case
                    requires a closer look. It was decided in the English High Court by
                    Lightman J on the issue of whether to grant a stay of court proceedings an
                    application made under s 9(1) of the Arbitration Act 1996 (c 23) (UK)
                    (“English Act”). Although the language is not identical, s 9
                    of the English Act is the equivalent of s 6 of the IAA and s 9(1)
                    allows a party to an arbitration agreement against whom legal proceedings are
                    brought in respect of a matter which under the agreement is to be referred to
                    arbitration to apply for a stay of the court proceedings. Under s 9(4), on
                    an application being made, the court “shall grant a stay unless satisfied
                    that the arbitration agreement is null and
                void …”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     Lightman J considered that on an
                    application for a stay under s 9(1) if the issue arose whether the
                    arbitration agreement was ever concluded and that issue could not be resolved on
                    the written evidence before the court, the question was whether the court can or
                    should give directions for the resolution of that issue by the court or can or
                    should grant the stay so as to enable the issue to be resolved in the
                    arbitration (at [13]). In his judgment, the language of s 9(1) established
                    two threshold requirements. The first was that there had been concluded an
                    arbitration agreement and that the second was that the issue in the proceedings
                    was a matter which under the arbitration agreement was to be referred to
                    arbitration. Unless the court was satisfied that both these conditions were
                    satisfied, the court could not grant a stay under s 9 (at [14]). The judge
                    noted that the English Court of Appeal in the case of <em>Ahmad
                        Al-Naimi (t/a Buildmaster Construction Services) v Islamic Press Agency
                        Inc</em> [2000] 1 Lloyd’s LR 522 (“<em>Al-Naimi</em>”) had ruled that in a case where the conclusion
                    of the arbitration agreement was an issue, there were four options open to the
                    court:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_33-p2_a"></a>(a)     (where it is possible to do so) to
                        decide the issue on the available evidence presently before the court that
                        the arbitration agreement was made and grant the stay;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_33-p2_b"></a>(b)     to give directions for the trial by
                        the court of the issue;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_33-p2_c"></a>(c)     to stay the proceedings on the basis that the arbitrators
                        will decide the issue; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_33-p2_d"></a>(d)     (where it is possible to do so) to decide the issue on
                        the available evidence that the arbitration agreement was not made and
                        dismiss the application for a stay.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>These
                        guidelines established that on an application under s 9(1) of the
                        English Act, the court can try to and should decide the issue whether the
                        arbitration agreement was concluded, but if it was not able to resolve the
                        issue on the available evidence, the court could still stay the proceedings
                        so that the arbitrators could decide the issue but only by exercising its
                        inherent jurisdiction and not by exercising any jurisdiction under
                        s 9.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     Accordingly, it appeared to Lightman J
                    that the English position was that if there was not sufficient evidence before
                    the court to decide the issue of whether an arbitration agreement had been
                    concluded, one way or the other, there was no room for the grant of a mandatory
                    stay under s 9(4). Jurisdiction under s 9 to grant a stay would only
                    arise if and when the issue was resolved in favour of the conclusion of the
                    arbitration agreement (at [23]). In the case before him, he was not able to
                    resolve the issue of the genuineness of the joint venture agreement containing
                    the purported arbitration agreement on the evidence before the court. He held,
                    therefore, that he had no jurisdiction to grant a stay under s 9. The judge
                    did not state expressly what standard of proof he was applying in order to
                    arrive at his conclusion but it can be inferred that it was the usual civil
                    standard of the balance of probabilities. Thus, at that stage, the evidence
                    adduced by the applicants for the stay did not establish that the respondent had
                    signed the arbitration agreement and that his signature was not a forgery (as he
                    contended).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     Although important phrases used in
                    ss 9(1) and (4) of the English Act are equivalent to phrases used in
                    ss 6(1) and (2) of the IAA, the context of the two sections is not the
                    same. As I stated above, the IAA was enacted to incorporate the Model Law as
                    part of the law of Singapore and the Model Law strictly circumscribes court
                    intervention in arbitral proceedings. The IAA deals solely with international
                    arbitration and we have a separate piece of legislation dealing with domestic
                    arbitration in which the grounds for court intervention in arbitral proceedings
                    are somewhat wider. The English Act, however, covers both international and
                    domestic arbitration proceedings. Whilst it was based on the Model Law, it has
                    not incorporated the Model Law wholesale (for example, there is no equivalent to
                    Art 5) and has some significantly different features. Relevant in this
                    context is s 30 of the English Act which, while conferring power on the
                    arbitral tribunal to rule on its own substantive jurisdiction, also allows the
                    parties to the arbitration agreement to opt out of this provision. Secondly, by
                    s 32 of the English Act, the court may, on the application of a party to
                    arbitral proceedings, determine any question as to the substantive jurisdiction
                    of the tribunal. Although such application will not be considered unless it is
                    made with the agreement in writing of all the other parties to the proceedings,
                    or with the permission of the tribunal, its presence in the English Act is
                    indicative of a somewhat different approach to the court’s involvement in
                    arbitral proceedings.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     Bearing in mind the differences in the regimes
                    governing international arbitration in Singapore and in England, I do not think
                    it will be correct for me to fully take on board the approach of the English
                    courts as set out in <em>Albon</em> and <em>Al-Naimi</em>. The regime in force here gives primacy to the tribunal
                    although, of course, the court still has an important role to play. If I were to
                    hold that, in a situation where the conclusion of the arbitration agreement
                    is in issue, the jurisdiction in s 6(2) to stay the court proceedings would
                    not bite unless I could conclude, on the basis of the usual civil standard, that
                    the arbitration agreement had been entered into, I would be imposing too high a
                    burden on the party seeking the implementation of the arbitration agreement. I
                    consider that it would satisfy the rights of both parties if the party applying
                    for the stay was able to show on a <em>prima facie</em>
                    basis that the arbitration agreement existed. The matter would then go to the
                    tribunal to decide whether such existence could be established on the usual
                    civil standard and then, if any party was dissatisfied with the tribunal’s
                    decision, such party could come back to the court for the last say on the issue.
                    In another case regarding a tribunal’s jurisdiction, albeit a different
                    aspect not involving the formation of the arbitration agreement, the Court of
                    Appeal observed that it was only in the <em>clearest</em>
                    case that the court should decide that there was no jurisdiction instead of
                    remitting the matter to the tribunal for an initial decision (see <em>Tjong Very Sumito v Antig Investments Pte Ltd</em> [2009] 4
                    SLR(R) 732 at [22]–[24]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     I note that “Commentary to the UNCITRAL
                    Model Law” by Stavros L Brekoulakis and Laurence Shore in <em>Concise International Arbitration</em>, Loukas
                    A Mistelis (ed) (Kluwer Law International, 2010) (“the
                    Commentary”) indicates at pp 601–602 that there have been
                    other national courts which have given priority to the arbitral tribunal to
                    decide the issue of existence of an arbitration agreement, holding that evidence
                    that an arbitration agreement existed <em>prima facie</em>
                    only would be enough for the courts to refer the issue to the tribunal for final
                    determination. The Commentary also notes (at p 602) that other national
                    courts have taken the contrary position. Whilst I recognise that there is some
                    degree of logical discomfort in the notion that an arbitral tribunal can be
                    given authority to decide on its jurisdiction when it may end up deciding that
                    because one party did not sign it, no arbitration agreement ever existed and
                    therefore in fact the tribunal had no authority to decide the question, I think
                    that having accepted and given effect to the principle of “<em>kompetenz-kompetenz</em>” for so many years we must
                    disregard that discomfort. Otherwise we may find ourselves drawing finer and
                    finer distinctions between situations in which the principle applies and
                    situations in which it does not.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Have the defendants made out a <em>prima
                    facie</em> case that the plaintiff signed the Guarantee?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     The defendants rely on the following as
                        <em>prima facie</em> evidence that the plaintiff signed
                    the arbitration agreement:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_38-p2_a"></a>(a)     The executed version of the
                        Guarantee was forwarded to the defendants’ then solicitors, M/s Lee
                        &amp; Lee (“L&amp;L”), by A&amp;G, who had acted for the
                        Borrower and PV in relation to the loan and security documents. L&amp;L had
                        communicated with A&amp;G regarding the late provision of the Guarantee
                        signed by the plaintiff. It is not clear whether A&amp;G were acting for the
                        plaintiff herself but it is indisputable that they were involved in the
                        transaction on behalf of the Borrower and PV and therefore the fact that
                        they furnished the document ostensibly signed by the plaintiff was an
                        assurance as to the genuineness of such document.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_38-p2_b"></a>(b)     After the Borrower defaulted in late
                        payment of the loan, the plaintiff met with the third defendant and also
                        communicated with her then solicitors in relation to a proposed purchase of
                        XPL. There was no reason for the plaintiff to have such communications if
                        she had no knowledge of the transaction.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_38-p2_c"></a>(c)     When the defendants first informed the plaintiff
                        by the solicitor’s letter dated 2 November 2014 that they will
                        enforce the Guarantee, the plaintiff did not dispute the existence of the
                        Guarantee or her obligation to pay. Subsequently, she agreed to mediation as
                        communicated by letter from her solicitors O&amp;B.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_38-p2_d"></a>(d)     The defendants had obtained and
                        adduced the expert evidence of Mr Pang Chan Kok William (“Mr
                        Pang”), a handwriting and forensic documents expert. Mr Pang had
                        examined eight specimen signatures of the plaintiff, including the one on
                        the Guarantee, and had opined that there were a number of attributes within
                        the handwriting of the questioned signature that were consistent with the
                        specimen signatures and there was enough material to warrant undertaking
                        further comparison of the questioned signature with other specimens of the
                        plaintiff’s signatures and handwriting.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     The plaintiff’s response was that she
                    had not signed the Guarantee and that it was significant that the defendants had
                    not adduced any evidence to rebut that position other than their statement of
                    their belief that she had done so. No direct evidence of any sort had been
                    adduced. It should be noted that the plaintiff’s position that she did not
                    sign the Guarantee was set out in the Statement of Defence in SIAC 24, in
                    the Statement of Claim in this action and in an affidavit which she filed in
                    support of her application for the injunction.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     Evaluating the evidence, I have concluded that
                    the defendants have made out a <em>prima facie</em> case
                    that the Guarantee was signed by the plaintiff despite her protestations
                    otherwise. First, the signed copy of the Guarantee was provided to the
                    defendants by solicitors representing the plaintiff’s husband PV and the
                    Borrower. The defendants submitted that A&amp;G were the plaintiff’s
                    solicitors as well but there is no evidence of this. Nevertheless, the fact that
                    the signed document was provided by a firm of solicitors that was acting for
                    parties who were definitely involved in the transaction gives the Guarantee a
                    proper provenance. Second, the Borrower and PV are, obviously, not strangers to
                    the plaintiff and it would not be irrational or completely abnormal or unusual
                    for her to provide a guarantee of the Borrower’s obligations. Third, after
                    the defendants first indicated to the plaintiff that there had been an event of
                    default by the Borrower, her response was to indicate an interest in taking over
                    XPL. She did not at that stage deny any knowledge of the transaction or that she
                    had signed the Guarantee. Subsequently, she met up with the third defendant.
                    Later, after the letter of demand was issued to her, her solicitors were
                    discussing possible mediation with the defendants’ solicitors. It was not
                    until May 2015, after SIAC 24 was started, that the assertion that she had
                    not signed the Guarantee was made. This was extremely late for such a position
                    to be taken and casts doubt on its truth. I have also taken into consideration
                    that it is only the plaintiff’s word that she did not sign the Guarantee
                    and she has shown herself to be capable of misrepresenting the true position.
                    Further, there is some independent evidence that the signature on the Guarantee
                    could be hers and there is no independent evidence that the signature on the
                    Guarantee is not hers. Contrary to the plaintiff’s contention, it is she
                    rather than the defendants who desires the court to act on a bare
                    assertion.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     The conclusion I have come to is only a
                        <em>prima facie</em> one. When the evidence is explored
                    in full and the relevant persons have testified and been cross-examined, a
                    different picture may emerge. It remains possible that the eventual conclusion
                    reached may be that the plaintiff did not sign the Guarantee.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     I have held, however, that at this stage it is
                    only necessary for me to be satisfied on a <em>prima
                        facie</em> basis that an arbitration agreement exists. Having reached
                    that conclusion, the defendants are, <em>prima facie</em>,
                    parties to an arbitration agreement and entitled to make an application for a
                    stay under s 6. Further, I must grant that stay application unless I am
                    satisfied that the arbitration agreement is null and void, inoperative or
                    incapable of being performed. I am satisfied that none of those situations exist
                    here. As Lightman J observed in <em>Albon</em>, the
                    formulation “null and void” means “devoid of legal
                    effect” which would be the result of the agreement being procured by
                    duress, mistake, fraud or waiver. It does not apply to a situation in which no
                    agreement was concluded at all. Further, for an arbitration agreement to be
                    “inoperative”, it must have been concluded but for some reason
                    ceased to have legal effect (see <em>Albon</em> at
                    [18]).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     For the reasons given above, I dismiss the
                    plaintiff’s application for an interim injunction and allow the
                    defendants’ application for a stay of this action. I therefore make an
                    order that any and all proceedings in this court with respect to HC/Suit No
                    792 of 2015 and HC/Summons No 3763 of 2015 shall be stayed pending the full
                    and final determination of SIAC 24.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     I will hear the parties on
                costs.</p>
