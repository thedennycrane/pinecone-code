<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       These appeals concern four separate <em>in rem</em> writs issued against the <em>Chem
                        Orchid</em> (“the Vessel”). Each writ was filed pursuant
                    to a different cause of action each plaintiff had against the demise charterer
                    of the Vessel. In the court below, the defendant (the owner of the Vessel)
                    applied to set aside all of the writs on the basis that the court’s
                    admiralty jurisdiction had not been properly invoked under s 4(4) of the
                    High Court (Admiralty Jurisdiction) Act (Cap 123, 2001 Rev Ed)
                    (“HCAJA”) because the Vessel was no longer on demise charter at
                    the time the writs were issued. The Assistant Registrar found for the defendant
                    and set aside the writs. Two of the <em>in rem</em> writs
                    also contained separate <em>in personam</em> claims against
                    the defendant as owners of the Vessel. Those claims remain alive as the
                    Assistant Registrar found that there was no legal basis to justify their
                    striking out at this stage of the proceedings. The plaintiffs now appeal against
                    the Assistant Registrar’s decision to set aside the writs while the
                    defendant appeals against the Assistant Registrar’s decision not to strike
                    out the claims brought by two of the plaintiffs.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The key question in these appeals is whether the
                    charter of the Vessel had already been terminated at the time of the issuance of
                    the writs. This necessitates an examination of an important legal point,
                        <em>viz</em>, the requirement of redelivery in the
                    termination of a bareboat charter. This is not merely a matter of contract but
                    has, in the context of admiralty law, crucial implications on the court’s
                    jurisdiction to order the arrest of bareboat or demise chartered vessels (the
                    terms are used interchangeably in this judgment).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       The right to arrest and the risk of a vessel
                    being arrested are normal incidents arising from the operation and management of
                    any vessel. Typically, parties dealing with vessels do not transact directly
                    with the registered owner of the vessel but with managers and/or agents of the
                    vessels which may vary from port to port. In the case of bareboat charters, this
                    is almost invariably the case because the effect and essence of any bareboat
                    charter is to grant the bareboat charterer complete control and possession of
                    the vessel. Given that there is no public registry of bareboat charters
                    available for inspection, third parties dealing with bareboat charterers have no
                    way of finding out if the vessel is on bareboat charter and may well assume that
                    they are in fact dealing with the owners of the vessel.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       This point assumes critical significance when
                    one considers that, until the 1980s, vessels on bareboat charter were insulated
                    from arrest for most claims save for a limited class of maritime liens. Thus,
                    third parties could not arrest a vessel to satisfy debts owed to them by the
                    bareboat charterers. This placed third parties who transacted with bareboat
                    charterers at a significant disadvantage for they could, unbeknownst to them, be
                    left without security for their claims. In recent decades, many common law
                    jurisdictions such as the United Kingdom, Hong Kong, Australia, Malaysia,
                    Canada, and New Zealand have amended their laws to permit the arrest of the
                    bareboat chartered vessel if, at the time the action is brought, the vessel
                    still remains on bareboat charter to the party liable <em>in
                        personam</em>. The laws in these jurisdictions are largely uniform
                    save for that of New Zealand, which permits not only the arrest of the specific
                    bareboat chartered vessel implicated in the cause of action but also the arrest
                    of any other vessels which are on bareboat charter to the party who is liable
                        <em>in personam</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       To bring our laws in line with the other
                    maritime nations, Singapore amended the HCAJA on 1 April 2004 to permit the
                    arrest of bareboat chartered vessels (see High Court (Admiralty Jurisdiction)
                    (Amendment) Act 2004 (Act 2 of 2004) (“the 2004 Amendment”)).
                    Following this amendment, s 4(4) of the HCAJA now reads:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(4) In the case of any such claim as is mentioned in section
                            3(1)(<em>d</em>) to (<em>q</em>), where —</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(<em>a</em>) the claim arises in connection
                                with a ship; and</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(<em>b</em>) the person who would be liable
                                on the claim in an action in personam (referred to in this
                                subsection as the relevant person) was, when the cause of action
                                arose, the owner or charterer of, or in possession or in control of,
                                the ship,</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<em>an action in rem may</em> (whether
                        or not the claim gives rise to a maritime lien on that ship) <em>be brought in the High Court against</em> —</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(i) <em>that ship, if at the time when the action
                                    is brought the relevant person is</em> either the

                                    <em>the charterer of that ship under a charter by
                                    demise</em>; or</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(ii) any other ship of which, at the time when the action is
                                brought, the relevant person is the beneficial owner as respects all

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       The hearings before the Assistant Registrar
                    stretched over a long period of 14 calendar days with the first hearing date on
                    11 October 2012 and the last almost a year later in September 2013 (see
                        <em>The “Chem Orchid”</em> [2014] SGHCR 1
                    (“the Judgment”)). Unfortunately, much time and effort was
                    expended on proof of Korean law (which was the governing law under the bareboat
                    charter), to little end because none of the parties suggested that an
                    application of the Korean “rules” of contractual interpretation
                    would have yielded a different result from the application of Singapore law in
                    this case. Thus, the introduction of expert evidence only served as a
                    distraction and contributed to the protracted nature of the proceedings. To
                    avoid a recurrence, I have included a <em>coda</em> on the
                    use of expert witnesses in the proof of foreign law in this judgment. Hopefully,
                    this will provide guidance on the circumstances when proof of foreign law is
                    necessary and on the proper role of expert witnesses in that
                regard.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The background facts</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The Lease Agreement between HKC and Sejin</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       The registered owner of the Vessel at all
                    material times prior to its court-ordered sale in Singapore was Han Kook Capital
                    Co Ltd (“HKC”), a Korean incorporated company. On 1 February 2010,
                    HKC entered into an agreement to lease the Vessel to Sejin Maritime Co Ltd
                    (“Sejin”), another Korean company, for a total period of 108
                    months (“the Lease Agreement”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       Under the Lease Agreement, Sejin was to pay
                    monthly rental to HKC on the third day of each month. Sejin was also responsible
                    for the employment and payment of the crew and for the repair and maintenance of
                    the Vessel. Sejin was effectively in possession and control of the Vessel and it
                    is common ground that the Lease Agreement is in substance a charter of the
                    Vessel by demise. The Lease Agreement also provided that, in the event of any
                    disagreement as to its interpretation, Korean law shall apply.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The Asset Transfer Agreement and the Notice of Credit
                Transfer</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       Sejin complied punctually with its payment
                    obligations during the initial months of the Lease Agreement but defaulted soon
                    after. HKC’s representative, Mr Sejun Kim, filed an affidavit in these
                    proceedings stating that reminders were sent but no rental payments were
                    received from Sejin after its last payment in October 2010.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     In December 2010, a new corporate entity known
                    as HK AMC Co Ltd (“HKA”) was established to deal with the recovery
                    of bad debts owed to HKC. On 27 December 2010, HKC and HKA executed an Asset
                    Transfer Agreement (“ATA”) in which the former agreed to sell
                    certain credits which it had obtained in the course of its business to the
                    latter at a fair price. The credits under the Lease Agreement were included in
                    this transfer.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     To be clear, the ATA did not effect a transfer
                    of ownership of the Vessel – HKC remained the registered owner of the
                    Vessel at all times. Further, the ATA did not purport to transfer the entire
                    Lease Agreement to HKA – it only purported to transfer the credits
                    thereunder. These points are not disputed by the parties but I should highlight
                    that their experts disagree on the question of whether the <em>ATA</em> had <em>validly</em> transferred the
                    lease credits (see [145]–[146] below).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     I should also mention in this connection that,
                    prior to the ATA, on 24 December 2010, HKC had issued a Notice of Credit
                    Transfer (“NCT”) to Sejin in which it informed Sejin of the
                    arrangement. There was, however, some dispute as to whether the NCT had
                    transferred <em>more</em> rights than the ATA. This dispute
                    centred on paras 3 and 4 of the NCT, which reads:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">3. In addition to the Transfer Credit, we [<em>ie</em>, HKC] transferred the <em>right or
                            status</em> in our possession or management out of personal or
                        physical security, right to profit or the other rights incidental to the
                        Transfer Credit.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">4. In spite of the above transfer of Credit, the right, obligation or
                        status of yours [<em>ie</em>, Sejin] based on the
                        relating contract, agreement, security arrangement or the other contract
                        shall remain unchanged and <em>the right, obligation or the
                            other status</em> of ours based on the above contracts shall be
                        succeeded by the Transferee [<em>ie</em>, HKA] to the
                        extent of the transfer.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     The parties’ experts disagreed on
                    whether the NCT – in notifying Sejin that HKC had transferred its
                    “right” or “status” under the Lease Agreement
                    – conferred upon HKA the right to terminate the Lease Agreement. The
                    experts’ respective opinions dealt with this point extensively because, as
                    will become clear, it was <em>HKA</em> (and not HKC) which
                    had issued the purported termination notice.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The 4 April Notice</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     By early April 2011, Sejin had failed to make
                    any rental payments under the Lease Agreement for a period of six consecutive
                    months. Mr Sejun Kim described in his affidavit that, at the time, there was no
                    sign that Sejin would be able to make further payments since the value of the
                    Vessel had depreciated substantially and the prevailing market conditions for
                    trading the Vessel were very poor. In his affidavit, Mr Sejun Kim explained that
                    HKC had “grave concerns” about Sejin’s ability to perform
                    its obligations under the Lease Agreement and was thus entitled to terminate it
                    by giving notice to Sejin in accordance with Art 24(2) of the Lease Agreement,
                    which reads:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In the event [HKC] is of the opinion that [Sejin] is facing difficulties
                        in continuing its normal business activities due to any reason whatsoever,
                        including but not limited to reasons of application for bankruptcy,
                        compulsory composition or company rehabilitation procedure or work-out,
                        giving rise to concerns about [Sejin’s] ability to perform its
                        obligations to [HKC] or to maintain or manage the Vessel, [HKC] may
                        terminate this Contract with notification specifying the cause towards
                        [Sejin].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     On 4 April 2011, a formal notice with the
                    heading “Lease contract termination notice” was thus sent to Sejin
                    (“the 4 April Notice”), informing the latter that it had
                    “lost all the benefit of time” for repaying its outstanding debts.
                    As the content of the 4 April Notice is of some importance, I reproduce the
                    material portions here in full:</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     HKC claimed that the 4 April Notice validly
                    terminated the Lease Agreement in accordance with Art 24(2). However, it is
                    important to note that the 4 April Notice was issued by <em>HKA</em> rather than <em>HKC</em>. This, as
                    mentioned earlier, led the parties’ experts to examine the ATA and NCT
                    more closely to determine whether HKA, despite being a non-party to the Lease
                    Agreement, had nevertheless acquired the right to terminate it. A further source
                    of disagreement among the experts concerned whether (assuming, <em>arguendo</em>, that HKA had the right to terminate the Lease
                    Agreement) that right was properly exercised in accordance with Art 24(2) of the
                    Lease Agreement. Chiefly, the disagreement concerned the question of whether the
                    4 April Notice was defective in failing to specify the “cause” of
                    the termination towards Sejin. According to some of the experts, the 4 April
                    Notice did not state the cause for termination and this omission cannot now be
                    cured by the explanations given by Mr Sejun Kim in his affidavit.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Subsequent correspondence and the continued trading of the
                Vessel</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     There was no formal written response from
                    Sejin to the 4 April Notice. Instead, Mr Sejun Kim stated that he had a meeting
                    with the Chief Executive Officer of Sejin, Mr Keunhyuk Park (“Mr
                    Park”), sometime in mid-April 2011 to discuss matters. According to Mr
                    Sejun Kim, Mr Park asked him whether the termination could be revoked and the
                    Lease Agreement revived. In response, Mr Sejun Kim replied that the Lease
                    Agreement had been terminated and that this termination could not be revoked
                    with a mere promise by Sejin to pay the outstanding rental.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     On 9 May 2011, the Chief Executive Officer of
                    HKA who signed off on the 4 April Notice, Mr Jaejeong Yoo (“Mr
                    Yoo”), issued a further notice to Mr Park reiterating that Sejin had
                    “lost all the benefit of time” for payment of the rental arrears.
                    In the notice, Mr Yoo demanded immediate payment of sums due as well as the
                    return of the Vessel by 13 May 2011. However, Sejin failed to do
                either.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     On 23 May 2011, Sejin wrote in response to
                    HKA’s 9 May letter. Sejin explained that it had been unable to discharge
                    its monthly payment obligations because frequent breakdowns of the Vessel had
                    affected her normal sailing schedule. However, Sejin went on to inform HKA that
                    it “finally … [had] the opportunity to pay the entire overdue
                    lease amount” out of freight earnings under certain prospective
                    sub-charters which it had entered into. The details of these fixtures were
                    provided to HKA and included a charterparty dated 13 May 2011 which Sejin
                    had entered into with the plaintiff in Admiralty in Rem No 197 of 2011
                    (“ADM 197/2011”), Frumentarius Ltd (“Frumentarius”),
                    for a voyage from Belawan, Indonesia to Taman, Russia. Sejin stated that the
                    freight earnings from these fixtures would amount to roughly US$1.7m and
                    requested that the deadline for repayment of the outstanding rental sums be
                    changed to 17 June 2011. I pause to observe that the charter-hire arrears at
                    this stage only amounted to 289,430,562 Korean Won (approximately US$261,445.52
                    at the current exchange rate). Sejin concluded its letter with the following
                    statement: “If our company cannot keep the above payment promise, we
                    promise that our company will agree to all the actions your company will take,
                    and will implement all the instructions related to the ship
                    retrieval.”</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     Sejin did not receive any written response
                    from either HKC or HKA until 14 June 2011. Sejin continued to trade using the
                    Vessel in the intervening period and, on 31 May 2011, provided HKA with a
                    written update that the Vessel had entered Belawan and was in the process of
                    loading palm oil cargo. Sejin also stated that the Vessel would proceed next to
                    Dumai, Indonesia for additional loading before heading towards the Mediterranean
                    Sea and then the Black Sea for discharge. Neither HKC nor HKA reacted to
                    Sejin’s advice on the Vessel’s loading schedule in spite of the
                    purported termination of the Lease Agreement.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     In accordance with the itinerary outlined in
                    Sejin’s letter, the Vessel completed loading three parcels of palm oil
                    cargo at Belawan on 4 June 2011. The cargo was owned by the plaintiff in
                    Admiralty in Rem No 198 of 2011 (“ADM 198/2011”), a Russian
                    company known as KRC Efko-Kaskad LLC (“KRC”). KRC had
                    sub-chartered the Vessel from Frumentarius for carriage of its goods to Taman.
                    The Vessel then proceeded to Dumai, where she completed loading an additional
                    parcel of palm oil cargo on 11 June 2011 owned by the plaintiff in Admiralty in
                    Rem No 201 of 2011 (“ADM 201/2011”), a Swiss company known as
                    Mercuria Energy Trading SA (“Mercuria”), to be shipped to Huelva,
                    Spain. On 13 June 2011, while at Dumai, the Vessel also stemmed bunkers which
                    were supplied by the plaintiff in Admiralty in Rem No 184 of 2011 (“ADM
                    184/2011”), Winplus Corporation Co Ltd
                (“Winplus”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     On 14 June 2011, HKA issued a formal written
                    response to Sejin’s letter dated 23 May 2011. In this response, HKA made
                    reference to the 4 April Notice and its letter of 9 May 2011 and stated that, in
                    light of Sejin’s non-compliance with the demands for payment and return of
                    the Vessel, Sejin’s conduct was “an embezzlement and subject to
                    criminal penalty”. HKA further stated that it could not fully accept
                    Sejin’s request to postpone the deadline for repayment and then set out a
                    number of conditions which Sejin had to fulfil if it wanted to revive the Lease
                    Agreement. Despite HKA’s position, however, the Vessel was neither
                    redelivered nor was payment of the arrears made by Sejin. Instead the Vessel
                    proceeded from Dumai to Singapore where she arrived on 16 June 2011. On 30 June
                    2011, the Vessel took on more bunkers, which were also supplied by
                    Winplus.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     In his affidavit, Mr Sejun Kim stated that he
                    had learnt of the Vessel’s presence in Singapore from Mr Park on 29 June
                    2011 and HKA immediately sent out a final notice for its redelivery. Sejin
                    responded in a letter dated 4 July 2011 stating, <em>inter
                        alia</em>, that it was not intentionally delaying the return of the
                    Vessel and elaborating, “[w]e wanted to return the ship safely through
                    the ship’s normal sailing route, but the situation does not allow us to do
                    that so far”. On 15 July 2011, Sejin sent a further letter to Mr Sejun
                    Kim which, while pertaining mostly to the description of certain transhipment
                    arrangements, also contained the following statement: “we will do our
                    best to return the ship to Korea as soon as possible.”</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The arrest and sale of the Vessel </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     Despite Sejin’s express desire to
                        <em>eventually</em> redeliver the Vessel to HKC, that
                    was never in fact done because, on 28 July 2011, Winplus filed an <em>in rem</em> writ against the Vessel to commence ADM 184/2011
                    and arrested her in Singapore on the same day. Winplus’ invocation of the
                    court’s admiralty jurisdiction was based on its claim solely against
                    Sejin, the demise charterer of the Vessel, for the unpaid bunkers which were
                    supplied in Dumai and in Singapore.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     On 8 August 2011, three further <em>in rem</em> writs commencing ADM 197/2011, ADM 198/2011
                    and ADM 201/2011 were issued against the Vessel by Frumentarius, KRC, and
                    Mercuria respectively. All three writs named the owners and/or demise charterers
                    of the Vessel as defendant. Frumentarius’ claim was for the loss or damage
                    arising from the breach of the charterparty entered into with Sejin, while KRC
                    and Mercuria’s claims arose from the non-delivery of their cargoes to
                    Taman and Huelva respectively.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     Between 22 and 23 August 2011, HKC entered
                    appearances in all the <em>in rem</em> actions as the
                    registered owner of the Vessel. Sejin did not enter any
                appearances.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     On 7 October 2011, after the parties with
                    cargo remaining on board the Vessel had arranged for their transhipment, the
                    court ordered the Vessel to be appraised and sold. As the bids received did not
                    meet the Vessel’s appraised value, the court approved of its sale below
                    the appraised value on 23 December 2011.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The applications by HKC </p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">HKC’s setting aside applications</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     On 29 February 2012, HKC filed similar
                    applications in all four admiralty actions seeking, <em>inter
                        alia</em>, to set aside the writs and all subsequent proceedings taken
                    in these actions on the basis that the court’s <em>in
                        rem</em> jurisdiction had not been properly invoked.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     The crux of HKC’s case both here and
                    below was that the Lease Agreement had been terminated by the 4 April Notice
                        <em>prior</em> to the issuance of the <em>in rem</em> writs in all the actions. If HKC’s
                    submission is correct, the plaintiffs would fail in establishing a crucial
                    jurisdictional fact under s 4(4)(<em>b</em>)(i) of the
                    HCAJA, <em>viz</em>, that Sejin, as “the relevant
                    person”, was the bareboat charterer of the Vessel at the time when the
                    various actions were brought. If that is so, the writs must be set aside on the
                    basis that the court had no jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     The plaintiffs strenuously denied that the
                    Lease Agreement had already been terminated at the time their respective actions
                    were commenced. Their arguments (both here and below) proceeded along the
                    following lines:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_30-p2_a"></a>(a)     First, HKA had merely been
                        transferred a right to claim the credits under the Lease Agreement and had
                        not, whether by way of the NCT or the ATA, acquired a right to terminate the
                        same. Thus, the 4 April Notice issued by HKA was ineffective in
                        purporting to terminate the Lease Agreement.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_30-p2_b"></a>(b)     Second, even if HKA had the right to terminate
                        the Lease Agreement, the 4 April Notice was nevertheless ineffective because
                        it failed to comply with certain requirements under Art 24(2), such as the
                        specification of the relevant “cause” for
                    termination.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_30-p2_c"></a>(c)     Third,
                        the plaintiffs further submitted that a bareboat charter could generally be
                        brought to an end only upon physical redelivery of the vessel. Thus, the
                        Vessel in this case, having never been physically redelivered, still
                        remained on bareboat charter to Sejin when the <em>in
                            rem</em> writs were issued.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">HKC’s striking out applications</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     As mentioned earlier, two of the four writs
                    contained alternative claims brought directly against HKC as the registered
                    owner of the Vessel. These were the writs issued by the cargo interests, KRC and
                    Mercuria, in ADM 198/2011 and ADM 201/2011 respectively. They claimed that
                    (even if the Lease Agreement had been terminated by the 4 April Notice)
                        <em>in personam</em> liability attached to HKC, who, in
                    permitting cargo to be loaded and in permitting the master to issue bills of
                    lading for the same, had clothed the master with ostensible authority to bind
                    HKC as the registered owner of the Vessel. If this is correct, then the
                    court’s admiralty jurisdiction would have been properly invoked as against
                    HKC since there is no question that HKC, as “the relevant person”
                    in this alternative claim, remained the registered owner of the Vessel at the
                    time when these actions were brought.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     In its applications filed in ADM 198/2011 and
                    ADM 201/2011, HKC sought to strike out these alternative claims under O 18 r 19
                    of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2014 Rev Ed) (“ROC”) and/or
                    the inherent jurisdiction of the court.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The decision below</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     The Assistant Registrar’s decision may
                    be summarised as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_33-p2_a"></a>(a)     In respect of HKC’s setting
                        aside applications, the Assistant Registrar held that the Lease Agreement
                        was terminated <em>prior</em> to the issuance of the
                        writs. Hence, the court’s admiralty jurisdiction was wrongly invoked
                        insofar as they were based on Sejin’s <em>in
                            personam</em> liability. She reasoned thus:</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_33-p2_a-p3_i"></a>(i)       First, although the ATA
                            and/or the NCT did not transfer HKC’s right to terminate the Lease
                            Agreement to HKA, HKA was nevertheless impliedly or apparently
                            authorised to issue the 4 April Notice for and on behalf of HKC based on
                            the conduct of the parties (see the Judgment at [42],
                            [46]–[48]).</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_33-p2_a-p3_ii"></a>(ii)       The 4 April Notice complied with Art 24(2) of
                            the Lease Agreement (see the Judgment at [64]). In particular, the
                            “cause” for termination, <em>viz</em>, Sejin’s non-payment of rental arrears, was
                            sufficiently clear from the 4 April Notice and this was borne out by,
                                <em>inter alia</em>, the background against
                            which this notice had been sent and the parties’ subsequent
                            correspondence which showed that Sejin did not question or challenge the
                            termination (see the Judgment at [67]–[69]).</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_33-p2_a-p3_iii"></a>(iii)       The 4 April Notice was
                            not sufficient on its own, however, to terminate the Lease Agreement. At
                            common law, a bareboat charter was brought to an end only when the
                            vessel had been physically redelivered and even though this general rule
                            could be contracted out of by the parties, the terms of the Lease
                            Agreement in this case made it clear that physical redelivery of the
                            Vessel was required for effective termination (see the Judgment at [112]
                            and [122]).</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_33-p2_a-p3_iv"></a>(iv)       Notwithstanding the need for physical
                            redelivery, a bareboat chartered ship could be <em>constructively</em> redelivered if there was “some
                            step or acknowledgment by the charterer to give effect to the
                            redelivery” (see the Judgment at [126]). In this regard, Mr
                            Park’s acknowledgment at his meeting with Mr Sejun Kim in
                            mid-April 2011 that the 4 April Notice was a notice of termination
                            constituted constructive redelivery of the Vessel (see the Judgment at
                            [129]). Alternatively, Sejin’s declarations of intent to redeliver
                            the Vessel on 4 and 15 July 2011 were also sufficient to effect
                            constructive redelivery. The Lease Agreement had therefore terminated on
                            15 July 2011 at the latest (see the Judgment at
                            [136]–[137]).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_33-p2_b"></a>(b)     In respect of HKC’s application to strike out KRC
                        and Mercuria’ s alternative claims in ADM 198/2011 and ADM 201/2011,
                        the Assistant Registrar found that these claims were not so legally and
                        factually unsustainable as to warrant being struck out. If it were accepted
                        that the Lease Agreement had been terminated by mid-April 2011, then HKC
                        could have made it clear that Sejin no longer had the authority to load
                        further cargoes and issue bills of lading. It was also open to HKC to take
                        steps to recover possession of the Vessel but it did not do so. In light of
                        the foregoing, HKC indirectly represented to shippers (such as KRC and
                        Mercuria) that Sejin had the authority to bind HKC to the bills of lading
                        which were issued at the material time (see the Judgment at
                    [153]).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The present appeals</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     The plaintiffs all appealed against the
                    Assistant Registrar’s decision to set aside their respective <em>in rem</em> writs. They argued that Sejin was still the
                    demise charterer at the time their actions were commenced. Their appeals are as

<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The plaintiffs’ appeals </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     I begin by considering the plaintiffs’
                    appeals against the Assistant Registrar’s decision to set aside their
                        <em>in rem</em> actions on the basis that Sejin was no
                    longer the demise charterer at the commencement of these actions. The Court of
                    Appeal has made clear in <em>The “Bunga Melati
                        5”</em> [2012] 4 SLR 546 (“<em>The Bunga
                        Melati</em>”) at [112] that when there is a challenge to the
                    invocation of the court’s admiralty jurisdiction, the onus is on the
                    arresting party to discharge the following burdens under s 4(4) of the
                    HCAJA:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(a) prove, <em>on the balance of probabilities</em>,
                        that the jurisdictional facts under the limb it is relying on in s

                            case</em> that its claim is of the type or nature required by the
                        relevant statutory provision ("step 1");</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(b) prove, <em>on the balance of probabilities</em>,
                        that the claim arises in connection with a ship ("step 2");</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(c) identify, <em>without having to show in

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(d) prove <em>on the balance of probabilities</em>,

                        beneficial owner of the offending ship as respects all the shares in it or
                            <b>the charterer of that ship under a demise

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[original emphasis in italics; emphasis added in bold]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     In the context of the plaintiffs’
                    appeals, all parties agreed that the “relevant person” under step
                    3 is Sejin and that the dispute centres only on step 5: was Sejin, on a balance
                    of probabilities, still the demise charterer of the Vessel at the time the four
                        <em>in rem</em> actions were brought?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     The parties’ arguments on appeal were
                    broadly similar to what they had advanced below and may be briefly summarised.
                    On one hand, HKC submitted that the 4 April Notice issued by HKA constituted a
                    valid and sufficient termination under Art 24(2) of the Lease Agreement. Thus,
                    HKC argued that Sejin was not the demise charterer of the Vessel at the time the
                    writs were brought. On the other hand, the plaintiffs submitted that the 4 April
                    Notice was invalid because, <em>inter alia</em>, HKA did
                    not have the right to terminate the Lease Agreement. They also submitted, in the
                    alternative, that physical redelivery of the Vessel was essential for the
                    termination of the Lease Agreement and yet this was never done. The plaintiffs
                    also submitted that the doctrine of constructive delivery, which the Assistant
                    Registrar had recognised and applied, ought not to be a part of our law. In the
                    result, they argued that Sejin was still the demise charterer of the Vessel at
                    the time the writs were brought.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     These arguments raise the following
                    sub-issues, each of which I will deal with in turn:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_39-p2_a"></a>(a)     Was HKA’s issuance of the 4
                        April Notice a valid contractual termination of the Lease Agreement under
                        Art 24(2) (“the contractual termination
                    issue”)?</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_39-p2_b"></a>(b)     Was
                        physical redelivery of the Vessel <em>further</em>
                        required to bring about effective termination (“the physical
                        redelivery issue”)?</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_39-p2_c"></a>(c)     If so, should Sejin nonetheless be regarded as having
                        constructively redelivered the Vessel (“the constructive redelivery
                        issue”)?</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The contractual termination issue</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     Before proceeding to examine the merits of the
                    contractual termination issue, there is a preliminary point that needs to be
                    disposed of. Sejin, in its correspondence with HKC/HKA, did not appear to
                    challenge the validity of the termination under Art 24(2) of the Lease Agreement
                    and has not entered appearance in these proceedings to do so. This raises the
                    question of whether <em>the plaintiffs</em>, as strangers
                    to the Lease Agreement, can question the validity of its termination given that
                    this has not been challenged by <em>Sejin</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     As I have stressed at the outset, the question
                    of termination is not merely a contractual issue affecting the immediate
                    contracting parties, <em>ie</em>, Sejin and HKC. It has a
                    pivotal bearing on the jurisdiction of this court in respect of the four
                        <em>in rem</em> writs issued against Sejin. There is no
                    dispute that questions affecting the jurisdiction of the court are to be
                    determined by the <em>lex fori</em> (see <em>The “Kapitan Temkin”</em> [1998] 2 SLR(R) 537).
                    HKC’s reliance on the bald opinion of its expert witness (Prof In Hyeon
                    Kim (“Prof Kim”)) that “the Korean court is unlikely to
                    accept any objection from a third party such as Winplus where the parties to the
                    Lease Agreement and the Notice of Transfer are not questioning the same”
                    is unhelpful. In my view, on issues that go to the root of the court’s
                    jurisdiction, it is entirely appropriate for the court to examine the objective
                    evidence in order to be satisfied as to whether jurisdiction has been made
                    out.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     The admiralty jurisdiction of the High Court
                    is conferred by statute and exists where the requisite statutory conditions have
                    been satisfied; it cannot be conferred by the agreement or waiver of the parties
                    if it does not exist under the HCAJA (see <em>The “Ohm
                        Mariana” ex “Peony”</em> [1992] 1 SLR(R) 556
                    at [15] and <em>The “Alexandrea”</em>
                    [2002] 1 SLR(R) 812 at [10]–[11]). Similarly, the admiralty jurisdiction
                    of this court exists in this case only if the requisite statutory conditions
                    have been satisfied (<em>ie</em>, if Sejin was the demise
                    charterer at the time the writs were brought). HKC’s submission that the
                    doctrine of privity of contract would preclude the plaintiffs from challenging
                    the termination, with respect, misses the point. The issue here is one of
                    jurisdiction and not one of contract. The plaintiffs were not seeking, as
                    non-parties, to sue on the Lease Agreement (which is a purely contractual
                    point). Rather, they were seeking to show that the court has jurisdiction in
                    this matter because the Lease Agreement was still valid when the <em>in rem</em> writs were issued – that is a
                    jurisdictional issue. I agree that it is open to the plaintiffs to challenge the
                    validity of the termination so as to establish jurisdiction in aid of the
                    enforcement of their respective claims notwithstanding Sejin’s apparent
                    acceptance of the termination.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     Counsel for Winplus, Ms Yogarajah Sharmini
                    (“Ms Sharmini”), helpfully drew my attention to two cases where
                    the validity of the termination of the bareboat charters was examined by the
                    court on points not pursued by the bareboat charterers. In <em>Ships “Hako Endeavour”, “Hako Excel”,
                        “Hako Esteem” and “Hako Fortress” v Programmed
                        Total Marine Services Pty Ltd</em> (2013) 296 ALR 265
                        (“<em>The Hako Fortress</em>”), the
                    arresting party (not the bareboat charterer) argued that the notice of
                    termination was invalid as it was served at an address different from that
                    specified in the bareboat charter. Similarly in <em>ASP Holdings
                        Ltd v Pan Australia Shipping Pty Ltd</em> (2006) 235 ALR 554
                        (“<em>ASP Holdings</em>”), the arresting
                    party attacked the validity of the termination notice on points which were not
                    raised by the administrator of the bareboat charterer. In both cases, the court
                    nonetheless examined the points raised by the arresting parties to determine
                    whether the bareboat charters had been validly terminated pursuant to the
                    notices. In the case of <em>The Hako Fortress</em>, the
                    court held that the notice was valid while in <em>ASP
                        Holdings</em>, the court accepted the argument raised by the arresting
                    party and found the notice to be invalid. These cases illustrate that the
                    validity of a termination notice – which has a material impact on
                    jurisdiction – can and must be examined by the court notwithstanding the
                    fact that the bareboat charterer might have accepted the termination as being
                    valid.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(1)   HKA did not acquire the right to terminate the Lease
                Agreement under the ATA and/or the NCT</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     The contractual termination issue received
                    much attention by the experts. Much ink was spilled on the question whether the
                    right to terminate the Lease Agreement had been transferred under the ATA and/or
                    the NCT. On this issue, I agree with the Assistant Registrar that the ATA did
                    not purport to transfer the right of termination from HKC to HKA and that the
                    only asset which was transferred thereunder was the credit payable to HKC under
                    the Lease Agreement. On this score, there can be no dispute that the right to
                    terminate was not transferred under the ATA. I also agree with the Assistant
                    Registrar that the NCT could not be relied on by HKA to terminate the Lease
                    Agreement since it served merely as a notice to Sejin of the intended credit
                    transfer and could not transfer <em>more</em> rights than
                    was transferred under the ATA. In this context, it is pertinent to note that the
                    NCT was served <em>prior</em> to the execution of the ATA.
                    Accordingly the operative instrument which dealt with the transfer of the
                    “assets” was the ATA and no more.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(2)   The requisite opinion under Art 24(2) must have been formed
                by HKC</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     The Assistant Registrar, having arrived at the
                    above finding, then proceeded to find that HKA had implied and/or apparent
                    authority to issue the 4 April Notice on behalf of HKC. This is where I part
                    company with the Assistant Registrar’s reasoning. I am of the view that
                    this inquiry is premature. Instead, I am of the view that a more fundamental
                    question arises from the plain wording of Art 24(2) of the Lease Agreement.
                    Article 24(2) was set out earlier but I reproduce it again for ease of
                    reference:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<em>In the event [HKC] is of the opinion that</em>
                        [Sejin] is facing difficulties in continuing its normal business activities
                        due to any reason whatsoever, including but not limited to reasons of
                        application for bankruptcy, compulsory composition or company rehabilitation
                        procedure or work-out, giving rise to concerns about [Sejin’s] ability
                        to perform its obligations to [HKC] or to maintain or manage the Vessel,
                            <em>[HKC] may terminate this Contract with notification
                            specifying the cause</em> towards [Sejin]. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     It is clear that there are two conditions
                    precedent to the exercise of the right of termination under Art 24(2). First, it
                    is necessary for <em>HKC</em> to form an <em>opinion</em> that Sejin is unable to carry on with its normal
                    business activities. Second, HKC must specify the <em>cause</em> for the formation of the <em>opinion</em> in the notification sent to Sejin. I shall deal with the
                    second condition later. For now, I observe that the first condition premises the
                    right to termination on the formation of a subjective, <em>bona
                        fide</em> opinion by <em>HKC</em> regarding
                    Sejin’s circumstances and the viability of the Lease Agreement. However,
                    there was simply no evidence by any of the experts (whether under Korean law or
                    otherwise) that this requirement could be satisfied upon proof that <em>HKA</em> (and not <em>HKC</em>) had
                    formed the requisite opinion.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     The Privy Council’s decision in
                        <em>Loke Hong Kee (S) Pte Ltd v United Overseas Land
                        Ltd</em> [1981–1982] SLR(R) 424 (“<em>Loke
                        Hong Kee</em>”), which arose on appeal from a decision of the
                    Court of Appeal in Singapore, is apposite. In that case, the court had to
                    consider a clause in a building contract which entitled the respondent employer
                    to determine the appellant contractor’s employment if, <em>inter alia</em>, the works were “in the opinion of the
                    [respondent’s] architect unsatisfactory”. Lord Keith of Kinkel
                    (delivering the judgment of the Board) interpreted this particular provision at
                    [11] as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… The phrase "in the opinion of the architect unsatisfactory" which
                        appears in art V(3) carries the kind of subjective connotation which is
                        necessarily associated with words expressive of satisfaction or
                        dissatisfaction. <em>It is the view of the particular
                            architect</em> as to what is or is not satisfactory which is to be
                        the criterion, not any objective standard. … [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     The lack of any evidence to suggest that HKC
                    had formed the requisite opinion when the 4 April Notice was issued is therefore
                    an insuperable barrier to HKC’s present claim that the Lease Agreement was
                    validly terminated by HKA in accordance with Art 24(2). I note that Mr Sejun Kim
                    filed an affidavit on HKC’s behalf in these proceedings to state that HKC
                    had indeed been gravely concerned about Sejin’s continued performance of
                    the Lease Agreement at the material time (see [14] above). He elaborated that
                    several factors were responsible for HKC arriving at this view, <em>viz</em>, (a) Sejin’s failure to make rental payments
                    for a period of six months; (b) the Vessel’s substantial depreciation in
                    value; and (c) the extremely bad worldwide market conditions for trading the
                    Vessel. However, apart from the non-payment of rental arrears, the two other
                    points were not stated in the 4 April Notice. Further, Mr Sejun Kim’s
                    assertions were not supported by any sort of contemporaneous evidence: there
                    was, for example, no email or other written evidence showing that HKC had formed
                    and communicated such opinion to HKA before the latter proceeded to issue the 4
                    April Notice. This may be usefully contrasted with <em>Loke Hong
                        Kee</em> where there was clear evidence at [6]–[7] that the
                    respondent had only exercised its right to terminate the appellant’s
                    employment after receiving a letter from its architect explaining the basis of
                    his opinion that the progress of the works was unsatisfactory. Mr Sejun
                    Kim’s assertions, it should be added, were also not supported by any
                    affidavit from Mr Yoo of HKA confirming that the purported termination by HKA
                    had indeed been exercised on the basis of HKC’s opinion.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     I observe that Prof Kim had stated in his
                    first opinion that, given the circumstances described by Mr Sejun Kim, there was
                    “enough for HKC to form its view” to terminate the Lease Agreement
                    under Art 24(2) (see [139] below). Whether or not Sejin’s circumstances
                    were serious enough to warrant termination in HKC’s opinion is irrelevant.
                    The pertinent question is whether <em>HKC</em> did,
                        <em>in fact, form such an opinion</em>. This point is,
                    self-evidently, something which only HKC can know and which therefore only HKC
                    can make good through the evidence of its authorised representatives. Prof Kim
                    had been offered as an expert witness. He was not a factual witness who had been
                    called to give evidence on HKC’s behalf. Accordingly, it was entirely out
                    of bounds for Prof Kim to express <em>his own opinion</em>
                    as to what would constitute circumstances serious enough for <em>HKC</em> to form an opinion that the Lease Agreement should be
                    terminated. I further observe that Prof Kim had also gone on to express in his
                    second opinion that even if HKA did not have the express right to terminate the
                    Lease Agreement in issuing the 4 April Notice, HKA was nevertheless authorised
                    to do so for and on behalf of HKC (see [142] below). It bears repeating that
                    this is a matter which Prof Kim has no personal knowledge of. In fact, his
                    opinion on this issue was completely without foundation because there is nothing
                    on the face of the 4 April Notice to suggest that HKA was issuing it on behalf
                    of HKC. Ultimately, Prof Kim’s apparent zeal to cover all bases in support
                    of HKC’s position here has, in my assessment, served only to compromise
                    his standing as an expert.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     In summary, <em>even
                        if</em> HKA were authorised to terminate the Lease Agreement (as the
                    Assistant Registrar had gone on to find), it could only do so under Art 24(2) if
                    HKC had formed the requisite opinion, but there is no evidence on which I am
                    able to conclude that it did. Thus, the 4 April Notice did not validly terminate
                    the Lease Agreement under Art 24(2). Nevertheless, before I leave this point, I
                    should express some views on the Assistant Registrar’s finding of
                    HKA’s apparent authority to issue the 4 April Notice (see [33(a)(i)]
                    above). She correctly cited relevant authority to demonstrate that, for apparent
                    authority to arise, there must be: (a) a representation by the principal to a
                    third party that the agent had the authority to enter into the transaction on
                    its behalf; and (b) reliance by the third party on the principal’s
                    representation.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     However it must be emphasised that the
                    doctrine of apparent authority is typically relied on <em>by a
                        third party</em> to prevent the principal from resiling from
                    transactions entered into by the agent. The doctrine is <em>not</em> open to be invoked <em>by the
                        principal</em> as a means of retrospectively legitimising or
                    validating the otherwise unauthorised acts of its agent in the absence of
                    ratification. The doctrine of apparent authority has therefore been described in
                    G E Dal Pont, <em>Law of Agency</em> (LexisNexis
                    Butterworths, 3rd Ed, 2014) (“<em>Dal
                    Pont</em>”) at para 20.3 as having a “negative” as
                    opposed to “positive” impact. This can be traced to the widespread
                    judicial acceptance of its theoretical underpinning in the doctrine of <em>estoppel</em> (see, <em>eg</em>,
                        <em>Rama Corporation Ld v Proved Tin and General Investments
                        Ld</em> [1952] 2 QB 147 at 149; <em>Freeman &amp;
                        Lockyer (a firm) v Buckhurst Park Properties (Mangal) Ltd and
                        another</em> [1964] 2 QB 480 at 503; <em>ING Re (UK)
                        Ltd v R&amp;V Versicherung AG</em> [2006] 2 All ER (Comm) 870 at
                    [99]). Hence, the doctrine of apparent authority has erstwhile been referred to
                    as “agency by estoppel” (see <em>The Law of
                        Contract in Singapore</em> (Andrew Phang Boon Leong gen ed) (Academy
                    Publishing, 2012) (“<em>The Law of Contract in
                        Singapore</em>”) at para 15.040). Once it is recognised that
                    apparent authority is based on estoppel, the uni-directional manner of its
                    operation becomes clear: it may be called in aid by a third party to prevent the
                    principal from denying the authority of his agent which he has represented to be
                    genuine but, crucially for present purposes, it does not allow the principal to
                    positively assert or rely on the apparent authority of his agent to improve his
                    position. Many commentators have therefore stated that a principal may not rely
                    on the apparent authority of its agent to <em>enforce</em>
                    a contract which the latter has entered into (see Peter Watts and F M B
                    Reynolds, <em>Bowstead and Reynolds on Agency</em> (Sweet
                    &amp; Maxwell, 20th Ed, 2014) at para 8-029; Roderick Munday, <em>Agency: Law and Principles</em> (Oxford University Press,
                    2nd Ed, 2013) at para 4.49; <em>The Law of Contract in
                        Singapore</em> at para 15.044; <em>Dal Pont</em>
                    at para 20.3). I do not see why the outcome should be any different where the
                    principal seeks to rely on the same to argue that such a contract has been
                        <em>terminated</em> to his advantage.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     For the reasons stated above, I find that,
                    with respect, the Assistant Registrar erred in her application of the doctrine
                    of apparent authority. HKC (the apparent principal) cannot rely on HKA’s
                    apparent authority to issue the 4 April Notice to assert that the Lease
                    Agreement had been validly terminated.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(3)   Sejin’s non-payment of rental <em>simpliciter</em> is a cause for termination under Art 24(1) and not Art
                24(2)</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     In my view, there is a further difficulty with
                    HKC’s argument that the 4 April Notice validly terminated the Lease
                    Agreement under Art 24(2). According to para 3 of the 4 April Notice, it appears
                    that HKA relied on the fact that Sejin had “lost all the benefit of time
                    of debt” as the basis for asserting its right of termination under Art
                    24(2) against HKA (see [15] above). The experts disagreed as to whether this
                    sufficiently specified the “cause” of termination as required
                    under Art 24(2). That dispute led the Assistant Registrar to consider the
                    conduct of the parties prior to and subsequent to the issuance of the notice to
                    determine whether Sejin was under any confusion as to the cause for the
                    termination. However, I consider that the 4 April Notice is beset with a more
                    fundamental problem. It appears to me that the purported reason given, <em>viz</em>, Sejin’s non-payment of rental arrears
                        <em>simpliciter</em>, cannot even trigger the right to
                    terminate under <em>Art 24(2)</em> to begin with. Let me
                    explain.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     Article 24(2) is a general provision which
                    allows for the termination of the Lease Agreement. It is preceded by Art 24(1),
                    which sets out a <em>separate</em> procedure for
                    terminating the Lease Agreement predicated on the occurrence of certain clearly
                    defined events. Article 24(1) is a lengthy provision but it suffices for me to
                    reproduce only the following portion:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-Heading1">
<b>Article 24 (Termination of
                            contract)</b>

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     Article 24(1) of the Lease Agreement sets out
                    a clear schema for an exercise of the right of termination. It lists a total of
                    14 specific events. If the first seven are present, it is unambiguously stated
                    that HKC shall issue a <em>rectification notice</em> to
                    Sejin and it is only if Sejin fails to make the necessary rectification after
                    the expiry of a ten day period that the right to termination arises. For the
                    next seven, HKC has the right to <em>immediate</em>
                    termination without needing to give Sejin a period of time to make
                    rectification.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     Sejin’s failure to make its monthly
                    rental payments timeously falls within the former category of events. In my
                    view, the comprehensive list of events as set out in Art 24(1) of the Lease
                    Agreement shows that the parties had painstakingly addressed their minds to the
                    situations in which termination should be preceded by the issuance of a prior
                    rectification notice and those which should give rise to an immediate right of
                    termination. The failure to make timely payment of rental belongs to the former
                    category. Holding that this same ground, without more, can nevertheless provide
                    cause for <em>immediate</em> termination <em>without prior notice</em> under Art 24(2) would render Art 24(1)
                    otiose and would remove from Sejin a contractual safeguard against immediate
                    termination which – on a proper construction of the termination regime in
                    Art 24 – it appears the parties intended for Sejin to
                have.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     This begs the question: what, then, is the
                    ambit of Art 24(2)? Article 24(2) appears to be worded quite broadly: it states
                    that the Lease Agreement may be terminated in the event that HKC is “of
                    the opinion that [Sejin] is facing difficulties in continuing its normal
                    business activities <em>due to any reason
                    whatsoever</em>… [<em>HKC</em>] may terminate
                    this contract with notification specifying the cause towards [Sejin]”
                    [emphasis added]. However, one must be careful not to place undue emphasis on
                    this italicised phrase or divorce it from the rest of the clause. The
                    “cause” (which Sejin must be notified of) is not <em>any</em> reason underlying the termination at large. Instead,
                    on my interpretation of Art 24(2), the “cause” must <em>specifically</em> refer to the reason why HKC has formed its
                    opinion that Sejin “is facing difficulties in continuing its normal
                    business activities”. And, in this connection, it is of some significance
                    that Art 24(2) has enumerated by way of illustration a list of events that might
                    make it difficult for Sejin to continue its normal business activities,
                        <em>eg</em>, application of bankruptcy, compulsory
                    composition, and company rehabilitation procedure. While these reasons are
                    expressly stated to be non-exhaustive, their collocation discloses the
                    parties’ intentions that the particular reason relied on for termination
                    under Art 24(2) <em>without prior notice</em> must bear
                    some relation to <em>Sejin’s ability to operate as a going
                        concern.</em> Properly construed, Sejin’s mere inability to pay
                    its debts to HKC <em>simpliciter</em> does not fall within
                    this category. Instead, that event is governed by Art 24(1) which specifically
                    provides that termination on this ground must be preceded by a rectification
                    notice.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a>58     For completeness, I will add that there is no
                    evidence before the court that, at any time prior to the 4 April Notice, Sejin
                    had been sent any notices to effect immediate rectification. Thus, there is no
                    basis for concluding (and neither did HKC raise such a point) that the Lease
                    Agreement had been terminated under Art 24(1).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(4)   Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a>59     In summary, I find that the 4 April Notice was
                    invalid for three reasons. First, HKA had not been transferred the right of
                    termination and therefore could not have terminated the Lease Agreement under
                    Art 24(2). Second, a valid termination under Art 24(2) is premised on HKC having
                    first formed an opinion that Sejin could not continue its normal business
                    activities. On the facts, HKC had not formed such an opinion. Third, the
                    non-payment of rental arrears <em>simpliciter</em> is not a
                    “cause” that gives rise to a right of immediate termination under
                    Art 24(2). In the premises, I am satisfied on a balance of probabilities that
                    Sejin remained the demise charterer under the Lease Agreement at the time the
                    plaintiffs’ respective <em>in rem</em> actions were
                    commenced. Hence I allow the plaintiffs’ appeals against the Assistant
                    Registrar’s order to set aside the four <em>in
                        rem</em> writs. There is strictly no need for me to consider the
                    remaining two issues which I had outlined earlier at [39] but, as I heard
                    extensive submissions on both these matters, I will proceed to express my views
                    on them.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The physical redelivery issue</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a>60     Assuming that the 4 April Notice constituted a
                    valid notice of termination, the question then arises as to whether the notice
                    itself was sufficient to terminate the Lease Agreement or whether Sejin was
                    nevertheless additionally required to physically redeliver the Vessel to bring
                    the Lease Agreement to an end. In more general terms, is physical redelivery
                    necessary to terminate a bareboat charter?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a>61     This is a novel question of law insofar as
                    Singapore is concerned but it has been judicially considered in several other
                    Commonwealth jurisdictions, notably, in Australia (see <em>Patrick Stevedores No 2 Pty Ltd v MV “Turakina”</em>
                    (1998) 154 ALR 666 (“<em>The Turakina</em>”),
                        <em>CMC (Australia) Pty Ltd v The Ship “Socofl
                        Stream”</em> [1999] FCA 1419 (“<em>The
                        Socofl Stream (jurisdiction)</em>”), <em>ASP
                        Holdings</em>, <em>The Hako Fortress</em>), New
                    Zealand (see <em>The “Rangiora”,
                        “Ranginui” and “Takitimu”</em> [2000] 1
                    Lloyd’s Rep 36 (“<em>The
                    Rangiora</em>”)) and Hong Kong (see <em>Gulf Marine
                        and Industrial Supplies Inc v The Demise Charterers of the Ship or Vessel MV
                        ‘Trident Dawn’ (Qatar Flag)</em> [1992] HKCFI 273). The
                    Assistant Registrar undertook an extensive survey of these cases and eventually
                    arrived at the following view on the state of the law regarding the need for
                    physical redelivery (see the Judgment at [112]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… I am of the view that the guiding principle that may be drawn
                        from the above authorities is that, <em>in general, both a
                            notice of termination and redelivery of the ship are required to
                            terminate a demise charterparty so that control and possession by the
                            demise charterer may be brought to an end</em>. This is due to the
                        unique nature of the demise charterparty. However, as a demise charterparty
                        is in essence a contract between the owner and the charterer, <em>parties are free to include terms in the demise charterparty as
                            to how possession of the ship is to be terminated. Such terms may vary
                            or affect the obligation of redelivery upon the termination of a demise
                            charterparty.</em> This is the common thread that may be found to
                        run through all the cases considered on this issue. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_62"></a>62     According to the Assistant Registrar, two
                    clear propositions emerge from the cases. First, as a general rule, physical
                    redelivery is necessary to terminate a bareboat charter and, second, parties may
                    contract out of this rule through the use of specific provisions in the bareboat
                    charter itself. I agree with the first but not the second.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_63"></a>63     I should mention that in their submissions on
                    the physical redelivery issue, the parties relied on the common law and not on
                    Korean law. Counsel for HKC, Mr Henry Heng (“Mr Heng”), argued
                    that, on a proper reading of the relevant clauses in the Lease Agreement, it is
                    clear that the parties have contracted out of the general common law rule
                    requiring physical redelivery. However, according to counsel for the respective
                    plaintiffs, the Lease Agreement did not have such effect and in fact contained a
                    clause which reinforced the requirement of physical redelivery.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_64"></a>64     Before analysing the parties’
                    submissions, I will first explain why I agree with the Assistant
                    Registrar’s views on the general common law requirement for physical
                    redelivery.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(1)   The general rule at common law</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_65"></a>65     The requirement of physical redelivery is
                    intrinsically tied to the distinctive nature of a bareboat
                charter.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_66"></a>66     A bareboat charter essentially operates as a
                    lease of the vessel to the charterer. The services of the master and crew may or
                    may not be superadded but, ultimately, what is critical is that they are for all
                    intents and purposes the servants of the charterer, and, through them, the
                    possession and control of the vessel is vested in the charterer (see Sir Bernard
                    Eder <em>et al</em>, <em>Scrutton on
                        Charterparties and Bills of Lading</em> (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 22nd Ed,
                    2011) (“<em>Scrutton</em>”) at para 4-002).
                    It has therefore been said that the hallmark of a bareboat charter is the
                    transfer of <em>possession and control</em> of the vessel
                    from the owner to the charterer (see <em>The “Guiseppe di
                        Vittorio”</em> [1998] 1 Lloyd’s Rep 136 at 156). A
                    bareboat charter does not transfer legal or beneficial title in the vessel to
                    the charterer but, because possession and control of the vessel resides in him
                    for the duration of the charter, it is not incorrect to speak of him as having
                    temporary ownership of the vessel or as being its owner <em>pro
                        hac vice</em> (see <em>Medway Drydock &amp; Engineering
                        Co Ltd v MV Andrea Ursula</em> [1973] 1 QB 265 at 269). This
                        <em>semblance</em> of ownership explains why I stated
                    at the outset of this judgment that third parties may well believe or assume, in
                    their dealings with the bareboat charterer, that they are in fact dealing with
                    the vessel’s true owner.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_67"></a>67     It is useful, for present purposes, to observe
                    how the key elements of a bareboat charter, <em>viz</em>,
                    the transfer of possession and control, are absent in other forms of charters.
                    As explained in <em>Scrutton</em> at para 4-003, under a
                    charter which is not by demise, the owner agrees to render services by his
                    master and crew to carry goods put on board his ship by or on behalf of the
                    charterer. In these situations, control and possession remains with the owner at
                    all times through the master and crew who continue to be his servants. This is
                    so notwithstanding the temporary right of the charterer to have his goods loaded
                    and conveyed in the vessel.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_68"></a>68     The fundamental difference between a bareboat
                    charter and other forms of charters is described succinctly in Tan Lee Meng,
                        <em>The Law in Singapore on Carriage of Goods by
                        Sea</em> (Butterworths Asia, 2nd Ed, 1994) at p 219, where the learned
                    author states:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… Whereas a shipowner who has demised his vessel lets out the
                        entire vessel and hands over total control and possession to the demise
                        charterer, a shipowner who has entered into a time charterparty or a voyage
                        charterparty is merely letting out the cargo carrying capacity of the
                        vessel, which is manned by his own master and crew and the vessel remains in
                        the shipowner’s possession and under his control.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_69"></a>69     With these general observations in mind, I
                    turn now to consider the cases on physical redelivery. I begin with <em>The Turakina</em> which, as the Assistant Registrar observed
                    at [77] of the Judgment, has been referred to in almost every case which has
                    dealt with the point of law that concerns us here. In that case, the ship,
                        <em>Turakina</em>, was sub-demise chartered from Deli
                    Shipowners BV (“Deli”) to South Pacific Shipping Ltd
                    (“SPS”) on the standard form known as Barecon 89. She was arrested
                    in Sydney by the plaintiff stevedoring company pursuant to a claim for services
                    rendered. The owner then applied for a release of the vessel on the basis that
                    the court’s admiralty jurisdiction had been improperly invoked. The
                    owner’s case was that the vessel was no longer on demise charter at the
                    time when the proceedings for arrest were instituted because Deli had validly
                    terminated it by issuing to SPS a notice of termination the day before. As in
                    the present case, the crucial question which arose in <em>The
                        Turakina</em> was whether the notice of termination was adequate to
                    terminate the demise charter or whether physical redelivery was additionally
                    required for this purpose. In this regard, the shipowner sought to rely on
                    several cases involving the effective cancellation of <em>time
                        charters</em> by the issuance of withdrawal notices to argue that
                    Deli’s notice was sufficient for terminating the <em>demise
                        charter</em>. Tamberlin J was not persuaded by this approach. He
                    rightly recognised at 675 that there was a “significant
                    distinction” between a time or voyage charter and a demise charter before
                    going on to observe as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… This distinction resides in the fact that in a non-demise charter
                        there is no requirement for delivery or transfer of possession to the
                        charterer at the commencement of the charter. Accordingly, redelivery cannot
                        require a transfer back of possession. In such a case, the services provided
                        to the charterer are terminated upon notice of withdrawal. However,
                            <em>in the case of a demise charter the vessel itself is
                            let and possession is taken by the charterer. Therefore</em>,
                            <b><em>once the vessel is withdrawn from the service of the
                            charterer, an obligation to redeliver possession arises because
                            possession has been delivered at the commencement of the
                            charter</em></b><em>. Redelivery, in its natural and
                            ordinary meaning, denotes a delivery back of that which was originally
                            delivered.</em> … [emphasis added in italics and in bold
                        italics]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_70"></a>70     The logic applied by Tamberlin J is simple
                    and, in my view, sound. A bareboat charter commences only when the twin
                    ingredients of possession and control have been transferred from owner to
                    charterer. It is therefore brought to an end only if there is, by the same
                    token, a transfer back of possession and control. It is difficult to see how
                    that can be effected without a physical redelivery of the bareboat chartered
                    vessel. Applying that reasoning, in the absence of physical redelivery, the
                    demise charter was found to have remained valid in <em>The
                        Turakina</em> and the owner’s application for the vessel’s
                    release was accordingly dismissed. This finding was further reinforced by the
                    terms of the bareboat charter which, at Cl 10(a), expressly stipulated that
                    hire shall continue to be payable until the day and hour of redelivery of
                    possession of the vessel. Tamberlin J then went on to observe at 677 that there
                    was also no step or acknowledgment by the bareboat charterer to “give
                    effect to the redelivery”. This observation, as will be elaborated below,
                    became the source of inspiration for the doctrine of constructive
                    redelivery.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_71"></a>71     The subsequent case of <em>The
                        Rangiora</em> involved the arrest of three of <em>Turakina’s</em> sister ships in Auckland, New Zealand. These
                    vessels were also demise chartered by SPS from Deli on the Barecon 89 form. Deli
                    had issued termination notices prior to the commencement of various <em>in rem</em> actions against the vessels and, again, the
                    question arose as to whether or not the court’s <em>in
                        rem</em> jurisdiction had been properly invoked. Giles J noted at 52
                    that the question of whether redelivery was necessary to terminate the demise
                    charters constituted “the fulcrum of the case” and, on this
                    crucial question, he agreed with Tamberlin J’s views in <em>The Turakina</em>. The following passage from Giles J’s
                    judgment at 55 is relevant:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In my opinion, <em>bearing in mind the two fundamental
                            planks of a demise charter – the parting of both possession and
                            control – the contract continues to have effect until both are
                            withdrawn</em>, (albeit unilaterally, in a breach situation), from
                        the demise charterer. <em>Notice of termination achieves
                            resumption of, or cancellation of control but it does not effect
                            redelivery.</em> … [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_72"></a>72     In summary, the complete transfer of
                    possession and control from the shipowner to the charterer is the very
                    quintessence of a bareboat charter. Thus, physical redelivery (which effects a
                    reversion of the transfer of possession and control) is necessary for its
                    termination.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(2)   Can one contract out of the general rule?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_73"></a>73     Mr Heng submitted that the parties in the
                    instant case had contracted out of the general rule requiring physical
                    redelivery. He referred me to several provisions of the Lease Agreement to make
                    good his submission. Before dealing with the factual analysis whether the
                    contractual provisions were sufficient to allow the parties to contract out of
                    the general requirement for physical redelivery, I should state that I have
                    serious reservations whether this could be done as a matter of
                law.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_74"></a>74     The mere issuance of termination notices in
                        <em>The Turakina</em> and <em>The
                        Rangiora</em> were held to be insufficient to terminate the respective
                    bareboat charters in the absence of physical redelivery. However, in <em>The Rangiora</em>, Giles J went on to observe that it is open
                    for maritime parties to make specific provision as to how redelivery is to be
                    effected upon early termination. On the facts, however, Giles J held at 56 that
                    the Barecon 89 form used in <em>The Turakina</em> and
                        <em>The Rangiora</em> did not provide for termination
                    in the absence of physical delivery:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I agree with the submission made by both Counsel for the plaintiffs that
                            <b><em>the deficiency here lies in the drafting of the
                            contract</em></b>. I hesitate to criticize a standard form deriving
                        its pedigree from the Baltic and International Maritime Council. But, the
                        reality is that at English law (and German law) a demise charter necessarily
                        envisages a parting with possession and control. <em>The
                            Barecon 89 form goes to great length to deal with redelivery at
                            expiration of charter period; it expressly provides for withdrawal for
                            breach but it fails to address how "redelivery" is to be secured in that
                            situation. </em><b><em>I have no doubt that an
                            experienced craftsman could cover "redelivery" in an early termination
                            context in a way which would be contractually effective.</em></b> It
                        might include a "deeming" provision incorporating directions where a vessel
                        was at sea and/or providing for a procedure constituting recovery of
                        possession irrespective of the charterer’s obligations to others.
                            <em>For whatever reason that has been overlooked in the
                            present form.</em> It is thus left to the Court to resolve, paying
                        due regard to the common law. … [emphasis added in italics and in
                        bold italics]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_75"></a>75     It is correct that the Barecon 89 form
                    contains a particular provision that is wholly consistent with the continuation
                    of the bareboat charter up to the point of physical redelivery. This is found in
                    Cl 10(a), the relevant portion of which prescribes that the bareboat
                    charterer’s obligation to pay hire shall “<em>continue until the date and hour when the Vessel is redelivered</em>
                    by the Charterers to her Owners” [emphasis added]. As Giles J noted in
                        <em>The Rangiora</em> at 55, the fact that the contract
                    recognises the continuing obligation to pay charter-hire until redelivery
                    supports the view that redelivery is indeed necessary to terminate the bareboat
                    charter. Tamberlin J also recognised at 676 of <em>The
                        Turakina</em> the importance of Cl 10(a) when he stated that this
                    clause was a sufficient answer to the shipowner’s submission that SPS had,
                    upon issuance of the termination notice by Deli, been reduced to a mere
                    involuntary bailee of the vessel.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_76"></a>76     However, I fail to see how parties can
                    contract out of the requirement of physical delivery. If it is accepted that the
                    requirement for physical redelivery as a requirement for termination stems from
                    the unique nature of a bareboat charter (<em>viz</em>, that
                    it effects the complete transfer of possession and control), I do not see how
                    parties can simply contract out of its performance. Until physical redelivery is
                    achieved, the bareboat charterer continues to enjoy the full rights of control
                    and possession of the vessel. Perhaps more crucially, third parties will
                    continue to deal with bareboat charterers on the basis of their actual control
                    and physical possession of the vessel.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_77"></a>77     It may be queried whether the view which I
                    have preferred here is unduly prejudicial to shipowners. Damien J Cremean has,
                    for instance, expressed the opinion in <em>Admiralty
                        Jurisdiction: Law and Practice in Australia, New Zealand, Singapore and Hong
                        Kong</em> (The Federation Press, 3rd Ed, 2008) at p 185 that
                    “there will occur cases where one would want to say a demise charter is
                    over even though possession has not been able to be retaken – perhaps the
                    demise charterer has put it out of the owner’s power to do so”. The
                    concern articulated here seems to be one of fairness – why should a
                        <em>shipowner</em>, who may experience difficulties
                    securing the immediate or prompt redelivery of his vessel upon valid contractual
                    termination, continue to be exposed to the risk of having his vessel arrested in
                    the intervening period as a result of the <em>charterer’s</em> unauthorised trading of the same? There is no
                    doubt some attraction in this view but, to my mind, it fails to take into
                    account the position of <em>third parties</em> in the
                    overall calculus of competing interests.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_78"></a>78     It is pertinent to stress that third parties
                    who provide services to or load cargo on vessels will often be unaware that the
                    particular vessel is on bareboat charter. Previously, this placed them in an
                    acutely vulnerable position because bareboat chartered vessels were insulated
                    from arrest. Following legal reforms in many jurisdictions, this is no longer
                    the case (see [4] above). The consultation paper prepared by the
                    Attorney-General’s Chambers which preceded the 2004 Amendment in Singapore
                    noted that, although allowing a bareboat chartered vessel to be arrested might,
                    at first blush, appear rather “startling” as it effectively
                    allowed recovery against the shipowner for the liabilities of the charterer,
                    this was nevertheless internationally acceptable and, on the whole, desirable
                    because “an effective admiralty regime should not cast the burden of
                    determining ownership or other relationship with the vessel on the person
                    dealing with the vessel” (see <em>Admiralty Jurisdiction
                        of the High Court: Arrest of Ships on Demise Charter to Secure the
                        Obligations of the Demise Charterer (Consultation Paper)</em> (24
                    April 2003) LLRD No 1/2003 at paras 4.3–4.4 and 4.8). The legislative
                    scheme in Singapore today – as it is the case across many leading maritime
                    jurisdictions – therefore appears to have struck the balance in favour of
                    third parties who can now deal with a vessel safe in the knowledge that,
                    regardless of whether the party with whom they directly transact is the owner or
                    bareboat charterer, they can arrest the vessel as security for their
                    claims.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_79"></a>79     In my judgment, holding that a valid <em>contractual</em> termination suffices to bring a bareboat
                    charter to an end in the absence of physical redelivery may upset the
                    aforementioned balance. This is because third parties will find that it is no
                    longer safe to assume that they have contracted with either the owner or
                    bareboat charterer of a vessel in <em>all</em>
                    circumstances. If they deal with the vessel after contractual termination but
                    before redelivery, it is possible that they may have in fact dealt with
                        <em>neither</em> – the owner certainly does not
                    have control and possession of the vessel during this curious period where she
                    is in “limbo” whereas the party in full possession and control is
                    no longer the bareboat charterer following contractual termination. In that
                    event, the third party will have no basis for arresting the vessel and is thus
                    left without security for its claim. This appears to me to cut against the
                    spirit of the 2004 Amendment which, as I have stated, was aimed at lifting third
                    parties from the burden of determining the true state of the relationship
                    between owners and charterers.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_80"></a>80     I recognise, however, that it may still be
                    possible for third parties to arrest the vessel in certain limited situations
                    notwithstanding the contractual termination of the bareboat charter. This is
                    where it is shown that the master had acted with the ostensible authority of
                        <em>the owner</em> in dealing with third parties, in
                    which event the court’s admiralty jurisdiction may yet be validly invoked
                    on the basis of the owner’s <em>in personam</em>
                    liability. This was found to be so in the case involving the <em>Socofl Stream</em> (discussed below) which is, unsurprisingly, also
                    the principal authority relied on by KRC and Mercuria to resist the striking out
                    of their alternative claims against HKC in ADM 198/2011 and ADM 201/2011.
                    On this view, one may argue that allowing a shipowner to contract out of the
                    general rule may not be as harsh on third parties as it appears.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_81"></a>81     I am not persuaded by this argument. It is
                    important to appreciate that the <em>Socofl Stream</em>
                    exception does not arise automatically by operation of law. Instead, it is a
                    fact-specific finding limited to circumstances resembling that in the <em>Socofl Stream</em> as discussed at [117]–[121] below.
                    If it were otherwise, it would entirely defeat the shipowner’s purpose in
                    terminating the bareboat charter to begin with (which is to prevent the vessel
                    from being arrested in satisfaction of <em>in personam</em>
                    claims against the bareboat charterer). The <em>Socofl
                        Stream</em> exception remains only of limited application and, with
                    that being so, I am not convinced that it affords sufficient protection to third
                    party interests.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_82"></a>82     Therefore, in my view, allowing a shipowner to
                    contract out of the general rule requiring physical redelivery works unfairness
                    on third parties because, ultimately, in the absence of such redelivery, it is
                    difficult to see how the change in legal status of the vessel can be made
                    apparent to them. A shipowner is fully aware that, by executing a bareboat
                    charter, he vests complete possession and control of his vessel in the charterer
                    who, as the vessel’s owner <em>pro hac vice</em>, can
                    incur liabilities in respect of the vessel’s use <em>vis-à-vis</em> third parties (even to the extent of exposing the
                    vessel to the possibility of arrest). In other words, an owner who lets his
                    vessel out on bareboat charter does so with his eyes wide open: he knows the
                    risks attendant to such an arrangement and has made a considered commercial
                    decision to proceed. By contrast, a third party has little way of knowing
                    whether the vessel he is dealing with is on bareboat charter, let alone that the
                    bareboat charter has been terminated.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_83"></a>83     When I examine the balance of competing
                    interests in this context, it seems eminently fair to me that the risk ought to
                    fall on the shipowner. I therefore consider the better position to be that
                    parties <em>cannot</em> contract out of the general common
                    law rule which requires physical redelivery to bring an end to a bareboat
                    charter.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_84"></a>84     I should point out, however, that the position
                    which I have stated here has not been shared elsewhere. A case illustrating the
                    proposition that parties can contract out of the general rule is <em>The Socofl Stream (jurisdiction)</em>. There, the court had
                    to deal with an application by Sovremenniy Kommercheskiy Flot
                    (“Sovcomflot”) to strike out the <em>in
                        rem</em> proceedings commenced by CMC (Australia) Pty Ltd
                    (“CMC”) against the ship <em>Socofl
                        Stream</em> in February 1999 on the basis that the court lacked
                    jurisdiction. The relevant persons named in the writ issued by CMC were
                    Sovcomflot, Kamchatka Shipping Company (“Kamchatka”), and Aurora
                    Navigation SA (“Aurora”). Sovcomflot had demise chartered the
                    vessel from its owners, Aurora, in 1990 and, in turn, sub-demise chartered it to
                    Kamchatka in 1993. On 15 December 1998, Sovcomflot issued a notice purporting to
                    terminate the sub-demise charter on the basis that Kamchatka had failed to make
                    two quarterly payments of hire. Sovcomflot subsequently demanded redelivery of
                    the vessel but Kamchatka did not comply and continued to trade the vessel by
                    loading cargo (which was the subject of the proceedings) in Singapore and Port
                    Klang, Malaysia in early January 1999. The <em>Socofl
                        Stream</em> was finally arrested by Sovcomflot on 25 January 1999
                    after it had entered the Port of Brisbane. In its striking out application,
                    Sovcomflot argued that its 15 December 1998 notice was effective in terminating
                    the sub-demise charter, notwithstanding Kamchatka’s failure to redeliver
                    the vessel. Thus, Sovcomflot argued, the court had no <em>in
                        rem</em> jurisdiction over the vessel since Kamchatka was no longer
                    the demise charterer at the date of commencement of the proceedings by CMC in
                    February 1999.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_85"></a>85     One of the central questions which arose in
                        <em>The Socofl Stream (jurisdiction)</em> was the
                    nature of the relationship between Sovcomflot and Kamchatka at the commencement
                    of CMC’s action. Did Kamchatka remain the sub-demise charterer given its
                    continued possession and control of the vessel? Or had Sovcomflot’s
                    termination notice brought an end to the sub-demise charter at an earlier time?
                    Moore J held that the latter view was correct. A key plank of his reasoning
                    concerned Art 11(2)(a) of the sub-demise charter, which read (see [9]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(2)(a) If any Event of Default occurs and is not remedied within seven (7)
                        business days from the date of telex notice by the Owner [<em>ie</em>, Aurora] or Disponent Owner [<em>ie</em>, Sovcomflot] as the case may be to the Charterer
                            [<em>ie</em>, Kamchatka], then the Owner or
                        Disponent Owner may, by telex notice to the Charterer, forthwith terminate
                        this Agreement and upon such termination the Charterer shall forthwith pay
                        to the Owner or Disponent Owner as the case may be a sum equal to the then
                        outstanding Charter Hire Principal together with all other sums then due and
                        unpaid under this Agreement and any other indebtedness of the Charterer
                        under other agreements with the Owner and Disponent Owner and interest on
                        the Charter Hire Principal calculated at the Default Rate for such period of
                        time as the Charter Hire Principal remains overdue, whereupon the
                        Charterer's obligation to pay the Charter Hire shall cease and the Owner or
                        Disponent Owner as the case may be shall thereupon transfer title to the
                        Vessel to the Charterer in the manner <em>mutatis
                            mutandis</em> provided in Articles 17 and 18 below.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_86"></a>86     In Moore J’s view at [27]–[28],
                    this provision conferred on Sovcomflot a “clear contractual right”
                    to terminate the sub-demise charter by giving a telex notice and, in such
                    circumstances, it was “difficult to avoid a conclusion that … the
                    charterer ceased to be a demise charterer from the time of termination at least
                    in the absence of provisions in the charterparty that suggested some other
                    result”. Moore J distinguished <em>The Turakina</em>
                    by observing as follows at [27]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In the present case the structure and terms of the 1993 sub-demise
                        charterparty are <em>materially different</em> to those
                        of the charterparty considered by Tamberlin J in <em>The
                            "Turakina"</em> and there is <em>a clear
                            contractual right</em> conferred by article 11(2)(a) on Aurora or
                        Sovcomflot to terminate the 1993 sub-demise charterparty by giving a telex
                        notice. It was exercised by Sovcomflot. <em>There was no
                            equivalent power to terminate in the charterparty considered by
                            Tamberlin J.</em> … [T]he 1993 sub-demise charterparty
                        clearly contemplated, in my opinion, the termination of the demise charter
                        by the notice. <em>Unlike the charterparty in The "Turakina",
                            the 1993 sub-demise charterparty did not contain provisions which fairly
                            unambiguously point to the continuation of the demise charter pending
                            redelivery of the vessel.</em> … [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_87"></a>87     With respect, I do not find the distinction
                    drawn by Moore J to be entirely convincing. Why should the contractual right to
                    withdraw the vessel and to terminate by telex make such a significant
                    difference? In my view, the latter is no different from the contractual right to
                    withdraw the vessel for non-payment and to claim damages as was the case in
                        <em>The Turakina</em>. Neither clause changes the fact
                    that the bareboat charterer continues to enjoy actual control and possession of
                    the vessel pending actual physical redelivery.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_88"></a>88     It is worth noting that the revised Barecon
                    2001 form, which succeeded Barecon 89, was introduced to address the practical
                    difficulties faced by owners in retaking possession of their vessels when the
                    bareboat charter is terminated while the vessel is on the high seas. Clauses 28

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_89"></a>89     The decision of Rares J in <em>The Hako Fortress</em> is instructive in explaining how Cll 28 and 29
                    are intended to operate (see [61], [63] and [64]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The terms of the Barecon 89 and 2001 forms <em>differed
                            materially</em> on the circumstances in which the owners could
                        withdraw the vessel and its consequences: see M Davis: <em>Bareboat Charters</em>, 2nd ed, LLP London, 2005, at
                        [28.13]–[28.14]. <em>More importantly, cl 29 of the
                            Barecon 2001 form was a new provision that Davis observed at [29.01] was
                            designed to clarify and strengthen the owners’ position if the
                            charter was terminated under cl 28 and to address the practical
                            difficulties that may occur in such circumstances.</em> As he
                        pointed out if the owners terminated a demise charter while the ship was on
                        the high seas, they were in a potentially vulnerable position if they were
                        unable, then and there, to retake possession. Clearly, cl 29 was formulated
                        with this in mind.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<em>I am of opinion that as a matter of principle the terms
                            of cll 28 and 29 of the Barecon 2001 form of charterparty can operate as
                            they were intended without requiring the owners, first, to physically
                            retake possession of the ship following her withdrawal and the
                            termination of the charterparty.</em> … The charterer
                        becomes entitled to possession of the ship under and by virtue of the
                        contractual rights that the owners confer on it by the terms of the demise.
                        But that right to possession and control can be affected by another of the
                        terms of the Barecon 2001 form. Thus, <em>cl 29 provides that
                            upon withdrawal of the ship and termination of the charter, the nature
                            of the charterer’s possession changes from possession for the
                            charterer’s use and benefit to possession as a gratuitous bailee
                            for the owners</em>. Possession of the latter kind is
                        substantively different in character to the plenary right to possession and
                        use of the ship formerly enjoyed by the charterer while the charter remained
                        on foot.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">When the charterer is in possession as a gratuitous bailee under cl 29, he
                        holds the ship for the sole use and benefit of the owners. When, however, he
                        is in possession because of the demise of the ship to him, the charterer
                        holds her for his own use and benefit. <em>The effect of the
                            withdrawal and termination of the charter under cl 29 is the same as a
                            physical redelivery to the owners because the charterer has lost his
                            contractual authority and right to use and employ the ship as he
                            pleases.</em> …</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_90"></a>90     While the intention behind Barecon 2001 might
                    have been to address the redelivery issue, it is not clear to me how making the
                    bareboat charterer a gratuitous bailee, on paper, can dispense with the general
                    requirement for physical redelivery. While it appears to be a neat legal
                    solution that seems to notionally re-vest possession and control in the
                    shipowner, it does not change the reality on the ground (or at sea, as is the
                    case here). Third party rights and liabilities arise from the <em>actual</em> operation of the vessel by the bareboat charterer by
                    reason of the <em>actual</em> transfer of complete control
                    and possession of the vessel to the bareboat charterer. Similar concerns were
                    expressed in <em>ASP Holdings</em> where Cll 28 and 29 of
                    Barecon 2001 came up for consideration. For the sake of comity, Finkelstein J
                    felt constrained to rule at [13] that, consistent with Moore J in <em>The Socofl Stream (jurisdiction)</em>, Cll 28 and 29 entitled
                    an owner to terminate a demise charter by merely issuing such notice. However,
                    Finklestein J nonetheless expressed reservations about the notion that one could
                    contract out of the requirement for physical redelivery at
                    [13]–[15]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Comity requires me to apply <em>The Socofl
                            Stream</em> and thus hold that in the case of this charterparty,
                        in particular because of cll 28 and 29, the charter can be terminated on
                        written notice. Clause 28 provides for termination by notice and cl 29 says
                        that when the charter is at an end the charterer is the “gratuitous
                        bailee” of the vessel.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">If I may say so, this is a troubling conclusion. It is troubling because
                        until the owner actually withdraws the vessel not only does the charterer
                        retain possession it still mans and supplies her. The problem becomes acute
                        if the notice of termination is served while the vessel is at sea. Applying
                            <em>The Socofl Stream</em>, she is not under demise
                        while returning to port. If that be true it may surprise the owner to learn
                        that the master now has ostensible authority to bind it. There is also the
                        possibility that the owner may decide to retake possession at the next port
                        of call or at a convenient port or place as contemplated by cl 29. The
                        result of the application of <em>The Socofl Stream</em>
                        is that the owner has control of the vessel during the voyage. The true
                        position is probably different.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I prefer the view that it is not until the vessel has been withdrawn that
                        the demise comes to an end for it is only then that the charterer has lost
                        exclusive possession of the vessel. That the charterparty describes the
                        charterer’s possession before delivery as that of “gratuitous
                        bailment’’ is not to the point. <em>The real
                            relation between the charterer and the vessel cannot be disguised by the
                            use of an inapposite label or description.</em> I appreciate,
                        however, that others take a different view.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_91"></a>91     While others might have been of a different
                    view from Finklestein J, his concerns certainly resonated with me. I do not see
                    how the parties’ attempt at constituting the charterer as a
                    “gratuitous bailee” can be effective in transferring possession
                    and thereby bring about an end to the charter. Having reviewed the authorities,
                    the Assistant Registrar concluded at [112] of the Judgment that since a bareboat
                    charterparty is in essence a contract between the owner and the charterer,
                    parties are free to include such terms as to how possession of the vessel is to
                    be terminated. With respect, I do not fully agree with this statement. The
                    question of repossession goes right to the heart of whether the bareboat charter
                    remains in force and, that being the case, I do not consider it to be within the
                    parties’ private sphere to stipulate when or how this may occur <em>short of what the general law requires</em>. As I have
                    stressed in this judgment, a bareboat charter is only at an end in law if the
                    two ingredients of control and possession <em>in fact</em>
                    revest in the owner – parties cannot, through the use of an inapposite
                    label, declare this to be the case when that is not reflected in the reality of
                    their situation.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(3)   Had the parties contracted out of the general
                rule?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_92"></a>92     For completeness, I will now examine whether,
                    even assuming that it were possible to contract out of the general rule
                    requiring physical delivery, this is provided for in the Lease
                Agreement.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_93"></a>93     Mr Heng drew my attention to two provisions.
                    First, he pointed out that Art 24(2) of the Lease Agreement conferred a right on
                    HKC to terminate the Lease Agreement upon issuance of a notice. This provision,
                    he argued, closely resembled Art 11(2)(a) of the sub-demise charter in <em>The Socofl Stream (jurisdiction)</em> which, as will be
                    recalled, conferred a clear contractual right on the owner to terminate the
                    sub-demise charter by telex notice. Second, Mr Heng pointed me to Art
                    24(4), which stated that Sejin shall immediately halt use of the Vessel and
                    return it to HKC in the event of termination. He argued that, cumulatively,
                    these provisions suggested that the parties had intended to contract out of the
                    requirement of physical redelivery, as was found to be the case in <em>The Socofl Stream (jurisdiction)</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_94"></a>94     While there is some force in Mr Heng’s
                    submission (assuming that it is possible to contract out of the general rule
                    requiring physical redelivery), I do not see how he can overcome Art 26(3) of
                    the Lease Agreement which provides:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-Heading1">
<b>Article 26 (Return of
                            Vessel)</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">3. In the event [HKC] delays the return procedure stated in the previous
                        clause, [Sejin] shall continue to pay the lease fee to [HKC] up till the
                        point when [HKC] confirms the return of the Vessel. The validity of this
                        contract shall remain in force and effect up till the aforementioned
                        confirmation by [HKC].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_95"></a>95     As the plaintiffs rightly pointed out, Art
                    26(3) is akin to Cl 10(a) of the Barecon 89 form which was considered in
                        <em>The Turakina</em> and <em>The
                        Rangiora</em> in that it specifies that hire shall continue to be
                    payable by Sejin up to the point when HKC confirms the return of the Vessel.
                    This clause reinforces the fact that the Lease Agreement is consistent with the
                    general requirement for physical redelivery.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_96"></a>96     Mr Heng submitted that Art 26(3) was a
                    “red herring”. He emphasised that Art 26(3) only operated where
                    HKC has delayed the return of the Vessel and that this was not the case on our
                    facts. I am not persuaded by this narrow reading of Art 26(3). If Mr Heng were
                    correct, Sejin could deliberately delay the return of the Vessel without
                    suffering financial penalty and conversely, HKC could, by deliberately delaying
                    the return of the Vessel, continue to keep Sejin’s payment obligations
                    alive, notwithstanding the latter’s desire to return the Vessel. This
                    construction makes no commercial sense. In my view, the better reading of Art
                    26(3) is that Sejin is under a continuing obligation to make rental payments up
                    till the point that redelivery is made and HKC confirms the return of the
                    Vessel. This is so regardless of the party responsible for the delay. This is
                    because, in the absence of such redelivery, the parties do not consider the
                    Lease Agreement to have come to an end. This view is reinforced by the final
                    sentence in Art 26(3) which unambiguously and unqualifiedly states that the
                    Lease Agreement “shall remain in force and effect” until HKC
                    confirms the return of the Vessel.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_97"></a>97     Indeed, this also appears to be how the
                    parties themselves understood Art 26(3) because the evidence before me suggests
                    that Sejin did in fact continue to be charged charter-hire subsequent to the 4
                    April Notice. As shown in the 4 April Notice (see [15] above), HKA demanded
                    outstanding lease payments amounting to 289,430,562 Korean Won (approximately
                    US$261,445.52 at the current exchange rate) at the time of the purported
                    termination. However, by the time HKA issued its 14 June 2011 letter warning
                    Sejin that its conduct amounted to embezzlement (see [22] above), HKA now
                    demanded a significantly higher overdue lease amount of 190,000,000 Korean Won
                    (approximately US$171,628.71) plus US$210,000 (which makes a total of
                    US$381,628.71). As no explanation has been provided by HKA or Mr Sejun Kim
                    on behalf of HKC for the difference in the amounts, and given the interlocutory
                    nature of the applications, it is permissible to draw the inference at this
                    stage that this increase could well be due to the fact that Sejin continued to
                    be charged charter-hire under the Lease Agreement which remained in full effect.
                    On this view of events, it would appear that the parties themselves interpreted
                    Art 26(3) the same way which I have, <em>viz</em>, that
                    charter-hire continued to be payable by Sejin until the Vessel was redelivered,
                    irrespective of the fact that HKC was not responsible for the delay in
                    redelivery.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_98"></a>98     In light of the above, I find that HKC’s
                    appeal also fails on the physical redelivery issue. In my view, a bareboat
                    charter can only be terminated with the physical redelivery of the vessel.
                    Further, even if it were possible to contract out of that general rule (which I
                    doubt), I find that the Lease Agreement did not have such an effect and in fact
                        <em>reinforced</em> the general requirement of physical
                    redelivery at common law. Therefore, even if the 4 April Notice were valid,
                    I find that the Lease Agreement had not been validly terminated as physical
                    delivery had not been effected. Thus, Sejin continued to be the demise charterer
                    at the time the plaintiffs commenced their respective <em>in
                        rem</em> actions.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The constructive redelivery issue</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_99"></a>99     I have thus far held that HKC has failed on
                    both the contractual termination and physical redelivery issues. For
                    completeness, given the Assistant Registrar’s ruling on the doctrine of
                    constructive redelivery and the parties’ extensive submissions on this
                    issue, I will go on to explain why I think that HKC also fails on the
                    constructive redelivery issue.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_100"></a>100    Like the doctrine of contracting out
                    discussed above, the doctrine of “constructive redelivery” also
                    appears to mitigate the perceived harshness of the general requirement of
                    physical redelivery. This concept was first raised in <em>The
                        Turakina</em> (see [70] above). It seems to me that the point was
                    raised somewhat in passing without the benefit of full arguments as to whether
                    such a doctrine should be accepted in the first place. Tamberlin J had reached
                    the conclusion that (due to the intrinsic nature of a bareboat charter and the
                    terms of the Barecon 89 form) redelivery was essential to bring the bareboat
                    charter to an end. It was then argued by the applicant that withdrawal of the
                    vessel <em>ipso facto</em> constituted constructive
                    redelivery. This submission was eventually rejected by the court on the facts.
                    However, Tamberlin J appeared to implicitly endorse the doctrine of constructive
                    redelivery when he went on to observe at 677 that the “notion of
                    redelivery of possession of the vessel suggests some step or acknowledgment by
                    the charterer to give effect to the redelivery”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_101"></a>101    Since <em>The
                        Turakina</em>, several cases have referred to the doctrine of
                    constructive redelivery but, to the best of my knowledge, none until the
                    decision by the Assistant Registrar has actually found constructive redelivery
                    of a vessel to have been made out. Before examining the reasons which persuaded
                    the Assistant Registrar to break new ground in holding that the Vessel was
                    constructively redelivered, it may be useful to first examine the necessity for
                    such a doctrine.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(1)   Should the doctrine of constructive redelivery form part of
                our law?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_102"></a>102    I agree with Ms Tan Hui Tsing (“Ms
                    Tan”), counsel for KRC and Frumentarius, that the courts typically resort
                    to constructive analogies to address a gap in the law that, if left unaddressed,
                    would result in an inequitable or unfair outcome. I begin by echoing the
                    observation of Lionel Smith in “Constructive Trusts and Constructive
                    Trustees” [1999] 58 CLJ 294 that “[w]e have quite a lot of
                    ‘constructive’ in different parts of our law”, such as the
                    vehicle of the constructive trust, constructive knowledge, and constructive
                    possession to name but a few. It is clear that in appending the term
                    “constructive” to these various orthodox concepts, the law
                    essentially projects legal <em>fictions</em> into the
                    analytical process (see Nancy J Knauer, “Legal Fictions and Juristic
                    Truth” [2010] 23 St Thomas L Rev 70 at p 71). As Sir Robert Megarry
                    once stated extra-judicially, the term “constructive” seems to
                    simply mean that “[i]t isn’t, but has to be treated as if it
                    were” (see “Historical Development” in <em>Special Lectures of The Law Society of Upper Canada 1990: Fiduciary
                        Duties</em> (Toronto, 1991) 1 at p 5). It is clear that the law does
                    not conjure up and employ legal fictions for no good reason. There is always
                    some underlying motivation behind their creation and sustained usage. For
                    instance, it is something used to enable courts to incrementally test and probe
                    the boundaries of a potential new rule before definitively acknowledging it as
                    such (see, <em>eg</em>, Maksymilian Del Mar, “Legal
                    Fictions and Legal Change” (2013) 9 Int JLC 442 at p 450 on
                    “exploratory fictions”), or as a means of articulating a rational
                    basis for and achieving coherence with existing legal precepts (see, <em>eg</em>, Roscoe Pound, <em>Jurisprudence</em> (The Lawbook Exchange Ltd Union, 1959) at p 450 on
                    “dogmatic fictions”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_103"></a>103    For present purposes, however, I consider
                    that the term “constructive” may also be used to avoid the
                    potential injustice that may result from the rigid application of orthodox
                    principles (in this case, the general rule on physical redelivery). The
                    “constructive trust” is a fitting example and I should clarify
                    here that I am specifically referencing that class of constructive trusts which
                    Millett LJ (as he then was) identified in <em>Paragon Finance plc
                        v D B Thakerar &amp; Co (a firm)</em> [1999] 1 All ER 400 at 409 as
                    one where the defendant had never assumed or intended to assume the office of a
                    trustee at all but is yet made liable to account as a “constructive
                    trustee” by reason of some fraud or wrongdoing on his part such as by
                    rendering his dishonest assistance in the misapplication of trust assets or in
                    knowingly receiving the same (see also <em>Williams v Central
                        Bank of Nigeria</em> [2014] 1 AC 1189 at [9], <em>per</em> Lord Sumption). As Justice James Edelman has observed,
                    extra-judicially, in “Two Fundamental Questions for the Law of
                    Trusts” (2013) 129 LQR 66 at p 76, the constructive trust is used in
                    this context as “a method of imposing liability to account in equity
                        <em>as if</em> the defendant <em>were a
                        trustee</em>” [original emphasis] when, in truth, he is not.
                    This is no doubt a form of fictional reasoning but the law resorts to it because
                    it would be unconscionable, for example, to allow the defendant to profit
                    unjustly from his participation in an unlawful transaction. Viewed in this way,
                    it is clear that the use of “constructive” reasoning in this
                    context was necessitated by the need to address a “gap” in trusts
                    law. Another relevant example in this connection concerns a legal concept which
                    I have already examined in some detail above, <em>viz</em>,
                    the doctrine of apparent authority, which is sometimes also referred to as
                    “constructive agency” (see, <em>eg</em>, Gail
                    Pearson and Simon Fisher, <em>Commercial Law: Commentary and
                        Materials</em> (LBC Information Services, 1st Ed, 1999) at
                    p 390). The use of this concept may again be regarded as being fictional
                    since it only arises in circumstances where there is no <em>actual</em> authority but it is necessary for reasons of fairness and
                    justice to recognise that the agent in question was nevertheless cloaked with
                    the authority of his apparent principal to avoid prejudice to third parties who
                    have transacted with him. In other words, the inadequacy of the orthodox notion
                    of actual authority (the application of which would not lead to a just outcome)
                    again provides an impetus for the law’s recognition of apparent or
                    constructive authority despite the latter’s undeniably fictional
                    character.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_104"></a>104    With that in mind, I now return to the issue
                    at hand, <em>viz</em>, the notion of constructive
                    redelivery in the context of bareboat charters. Having considered the issue, I
                    do not see where the <em>need</em> lies for its creation
                    and acceptance into Singapore maritime law. As I have explained at
                    [77]–[83] above, as between the owner and innocent third parties, it is
                    not unfair that third parties should be able to proceed <em>in
                        rem</em> against the vessel so long as such liabilities arise and the
                    suit is commenced <em>prior</em> to physical redelivery of
                    the vessel. To my mind, it does not appear that there is any injustice which
                    needs to be remedied so I do not see the need for such a doctrine in our law.
                    Further, I am of the view that importing such a doctrine would, instead, visit
                    significant injustice on <em>third parties</em>, who have
                    no way of knowing if the bareboat charterer with whom he is transacting has
                    already terminated the bareboat charter by effecting constructive delivery. My
                    previous comments, though made in the context of the notion of contracting out
                    of the general rule, also apply readily in this context. On our facts, this
                    outcome is also a just one. HKC knowingly allowed Sejin to continue to represent
                    itself as the bareboat charterer of the Vessel to third parties like the present
                    plaintiffs notwithstanding the purported termination.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_105"></a>105    As a concluding remark, I note that the
                    cases which accept the doctrine of constructive delivery <em>also</em> held that it is possible to contract out of the requirement
                    for physical redelivery. With respect, it seems to me that both concepts are not
                    compatible. If parties can contract out of the requirement of physical
                    redelivery then there is clearly no “gap” which needs to be
                    filled. In these circumstances, I do not see why the doctrine of constructive
                    delivery is still needed.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(2)   Had the Vessel been constructively redelivered?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_106"></a>106    However, should it come to pass that,
                    contrary to my holding, there is place for such a doctrine, then, in my view,
                    constructive redelivery is still not made out on the facts. I begin by reviewing
                    the observations made in <em>The Turakina</em> and
                        <em>The Rangiora</em> on this issue. In determining
                    whether a vessel could be regarded to have been constructively redelivered,
                    Tamberlin J in <em>The Turakina</em> held at 677 that
                    the inquiry should be focussed on “some step or acknowledgment <em>by the charterer</em> to give effect to the
                    redelivery” [emphasis added]. This is understandable because physical
                    redelivery requires a clear act by the charterer; thus, constructive redelivery,
                    as an equitable substitute, must likewise emanate from the conduct of the
                    charterer. Tamberlin J did not provide examples of such “steps”
                    but in <em>The Rangiora</em>, Giles J observed at 55 that
                    it would suffice if the owner’s agent attended onboard the vessel to
                    announce that it had retaken possession of the vessel or if the owner issued
                    proceedings seeking repossession. However, I note that these examples concern
                    acts by the <em>owner</em> and not the <em>charterer</em> and therefore may not be particularly useful to
                    illustrate conduct sufficient to constitute constructive redelivery. In any
                    event, as highlighted by Mercuria’s counsel, Mr Philip Tay (“Mr
                    Tay”), such examples are tantamount to a physical retaking of the vessel
                    by the owners.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_107"></a>107    In finding that the Vessel was
                    constructively redelivered, the Assistant Registrar relied on the following
                    conduct of Sejin and found that any one of them was sufficient:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_107-p2_a"></a>(a)     The implicit acknowledgment of the
                        termination by Mr Park, the CEO of Sejin, at a meeting in mid-April 2011 in
                        which he requested that HKC withdraw the 4 April Notice.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_107-p2_b"></a>(b)     Sejin’s letter of 4 July 2011
                        to HKA stating that it “wanted to return the ship safely through the
                        ship’s normal sailing route but [that] the situation does not allow us
                        to do that so far”.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_107-p2_c"></a>(c)     Finally, Sejin’s letter of 15 July 2011 stating
                        that it “will do our best to return the ship to Korea as soon as
                        possible”.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id=""></a>It did not matter to HKC for the purposes of setting aside
                            the <em>in rem</em> writs which of the three dates
                            terminated the bareboat charter because the earliest of the <em>in rem</em> writs was issued by Winplus on 28 July
                            2011 while the latest of the three dates occurred on 15 July 2011,
                                <em>prior</em> to the issuance of any of the
                                <em>in rem</em>
                writs.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_108"></a>108    After examining the evidence before me, I am
                    not able to agree with the Assistant Registrar that constructive redelivery had
                    been effected. As a starting point, I first observe that certainty is critical
                    in the shipping trade since it invariably involves multiple third party
                    interests. Therefore any step or conduct as regards redelivery by the bareboat
                    charterer must be clear and unequivocal. The examples cited by counsel in their
                    further submissions bear this out. For pledges, constructive delivery or
                    possession can arise from the delivery of the keys to the property. A bank can
                    be regarded as being in constructive possession of goods upon the deposit of the
                    bill of lading which, in shipping parlance, is “the key to the
                    warehouse”. Likewise, a seller in possession can be considered to have
                    constructively delivered the chattel if he assents to hold the thing sold on
                    account for the buyer. In each of these examples, the conduct of the relevant
                    party is both clear and unequivocal.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_109"></a>109    As a preliminary point, I pause to note that
                    the Assistant Registrar stated at [129] of the Judgment that in <em>The Rangiora</em>, “a letter from the liquidators
                    acknowledging receipt of the notice of termination and accepting the termination
                    was sufficient to constitute constructive redelivery of the ship”. This
                    is incorrect. First, it was opposing counsel and not the court who was prepared
                    to accept in principle that the letter of acknowledgment could constitute
                    constructive redelivery (see <em>The Rangiora</em> at 50).
                    In any event, the concession was moot because the letter was not despatched
                    prior to the commencement of the action. Second, the court in fact found that
                    there was no redelivery – actual, symbolic or constructive (see <em>The Rangiora</em> at 55).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_110"></a>110    This brings me to the crux of the issue: was
                    the conduct of Sejin clear and unequivocal? In the present case, there was no
                    overt act by Sejin capable of representing redelivery. Instead HKC’s
                    reliance was on correspondence and matters alleged to have been said at a
                    meeting. It is therefore imperative to examine the context and factual matrix
                    surrounding the three events found to have been sufficient by the Assistant
                    Registrar.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_111"></a>111    First, as regards the meeting in mid-April
                    2011, she found that in requesting for the revocation of the 4 April Notice,
                    Sejin had implicitly acknowledged the termination of the Lease Agreement. While
                    that may be correct, it is not sufficient. It is important always to bear in
                    mind that, to bring an end to a bareboat charter, <em>both</em> control and possession must be withdrawn. As rightly
                    observed by Giles J in <em>The Rangiora</em> at 55,
                    “[n]otice of termination achieves resumption of, or cancellation of
                        <em>control</em> but it does not effect <em>redelivery</em>” [emphasis added]. An acknowledgement
                    of termination deals with the requirement of control but not with possession. On
                    the facts, there was no clear act which represented the reversion of possession.
                    Instead, the conduct of Sejin following the mid-April meeting was entirely
                    inconsistent with any intention to redeliver. On 23 May 2011, Sejin, in response
                    to HKA’s 9 May letter, informed HKA that it had entered into a
                    charterparty dated 13 May 2011 with Frumentarius. On 31 May 2011, Sejin provided
                    HKA with a written update that the Vessel had entered Belawan and was in the
                    process of loading palm oil cargo and that the Vessel would proceed next to
                    Dumai for additional loading and then onwards to the Mediterranean Sea and the
                    Black Sea for discharge. Sejin’s sailing instructions clearly showed that
                    it had no intention to redeliver the Vessel in response to the 4 April
                    Notice.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_112"></a>112    Second, neither the letter of 4 July 2011
                    nor the letter of 15 July 2011 was clear and unequivocal enough to constitute
                    constructive redelivery. On 4 July 2011, Sejin wrote that it “wanted
                    to return the return the ship safely through the ship’s normal sailing
                    route, but the situation does not allow us to do that”. On 15 July 2011,
                    Sejin wrote, “we will do our best to return the ship to Korea as soon as
                    possible”. These letters were couched in tentative and equivocal
                    language: “<em>wanted</em> to return….
                        <em>but</em> the situation does not allow us to”
                    and “we will <em>do our best</em> to return the
                    ship” [emphasis added]. The reason for this is clear from the context. At
                    the time the letters were authored, the Vessel – as HKC/HKA were well
                    aware – was already laden with cargoes which had yet to be delivered at
                    their discharge ports. Viewed holistically, what Sejin was in fact saying was
                    that it intended to continue using the Vessel to deliver the cargoes to their
                    discharge ports <em>before</em> contemplating the return of
                    the Vessel – it is clear that Sejin did not, through either of these
                    letters, evince a clear intention to redeliver the Vessel.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_113"></a>113    In the circumstances, I am unable to accept
                    that any of the three events constituted a clear and unequivocal step or
                    acknowledgment by Sejin to redeliver the Vessel to HKC in response to the 4
                    April Notice. Thus, HKC also fails on the issue of constructive
                    redelivery.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">HKC’s appeals</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_114"></a>114    This portion of the judgment deals with
                    HKC’s appeals against the Assistant Registrar’s decision to dismiss
                    its striking out applications in ADM 198/2011 and ADM 201/2011. I first
                    pause to observe that this alternative claim is only relevant if the <em>in rem</em> writs against Sejin as bareboat charterers are,
                    contrary to my primary finding, set aside. In these actions, KRC and Mercuria
                    claim, in the alternative, against HKC directly. The thrust of their argument is
                    that, in permitting cargo to be loaded onboard the Vessel and allowing the
                    master to issue bills of lading in respect thereof (notwithstanding the
                    termination of the Lease Agreement), HKC must be treated as having clothed the
                    master with the <em>ostensible authority</em> to enter into
                    contracts of carriage on its behalf as owner of the Vessel. If they are correct
                    that HKC is directly liable for their losses, there is no doubt that the Vessel
                    may be arrested as HKC is the owner of the Vessel. Ms Tan and Mr Tay, counsel
                    for KRC and Mercuria respectively, relied principally on the cases arising from
                    the arrest of the <em>Socofl Stream</em> to establish this
                    point.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_115"></a>115    HKC applied to strike out these alternative
                    claims against it on the basis that they were “factually
                    unsustainable”. The crux of Mr Heng’s case was that HKC had never,
                    by words or conduct, represented or permitted it to be represented that the
                    master had authority to act on its behalf in issuing the bills of lading or in
                    carrying the cargo owned by KRC and Mercuria. Mr Heng submitted that the
                    contrary was true instead: he argued that the facts showed that HKC had
                    consistently treated the Lease Agreement as having been terminated with the
                    issuance of the 4 April Notice, as evinced by HKC’s repeated demands for
                    the return of the Vessel.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_116"></a>116    I do not agree with Mr Heng’s
                    submissions. To begin with, I do not think that it is entirely accurate to state
                    that HKC had consistently treated the Lease Agreement as having been terminated
                    from the 4 April Notice onwards. That position may have been reflected in its
                    written correspondence with Sejin, but its conduct of <em>knowingly</em> permitting the Vessel to be traded even after the 4
                    April Notice suggests otherwise. Furthermore, I do not see how HKC’s
                    conduct of repeatedly demanding the redelivery of the Vessel takes
                    Mr Heng’s case very far. Those communications were wholly private in
                    nature and were never made known to third party shippers dealing with the Vessel
                    (such as KRC and Mercuria) who would ordinarily assume that they were
                    transacting with the actual or disponent owner of the Vessel. Publicly, the
                    picture was very different. It appeared that HKC <em>knowingly</em> permitted the Vessel to be traded even after the 4
                    April Notice. If the Lease Agreement had been terminated, as HKC argued, it
                    should and could have taken steps to ensure that third parties were aware of
                    this in order to avoid attracting potential liability to itself through the
                    continued trading of the Vessel. HKC was slow, however, to take any such steps
                    prior to the loading of KRC and Mercuria’s cargo at Belawan and Dumai
                    respectively. The decisions arising from the arrest of the <em>Socofl Stream</em> are highly instructive in this regard and I turn
                    now to consider them.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The Socofl Stream cases</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_117"></a>117    The factual matrix leading to the arrest of
                    the <em>Socofl Stream</em> has already been outlined at
                    [84] above. It will be recalled that Sovcomflot purportedly terminated the
                    bareboat charter on 15 December 1998. On 25 December 1998, Sovcomflot
                    demanded that the vessel be redelivered but did not nominate a port for this to
                    be done. On 30 December 1998, Kamchatka replied stating that it disputed the
                    debt claimed by Sovcomflot and that, until the parties’ rights and
                    obligations had been finally determined, “we … do not propose to
                    return possession of the … vessel to you or to whoever may be entitled
                    thereto” (see <em>The Socofl Stream
                        (jurisdiction)</em> at [7]). As Moore J noted at [8], it was at least
                    implicit in this response that Kamchatka intended to continue to use the vessel
                    for trading as it had done up to that point as the sub-demise charterer, pending
                    resolution of Sovcomflot’s disputed debt. Following this, Kamchatka
                    continued to deploy the vessel for the carriage of goods. It loaded goods
                    belonging to CMC in Singapore and Port Klang in early January 1999 before
                    it was finally arrested on 25 January 1999 by Sovcomflot in Brisbane. CMC
                    commenced <em>in rem</em> proceedings against the vessel in
                    February 1999 and Sovcomflot’s application to strike it out for want of
                    jurisdiction was the subject of the proceedings in <em>The Socofl
                        Stream (jurisdiction</em>).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_118"></a>118    I have already stated how, in <em>The Socofl Stream (jurisdiction</em>), Moore J found that the
                    sub-demise charter had been validly terminated by Sovcomflot through its
                    issuance of the termination notice. CMC’s invocation of the court’s
                    admiralty jurisdiction on the basis that <em>Kamchatka</em>
                    was the relevant person was therefore invalid. However, that was not the end of
                    the matter. As with KRC and Mercuria here, CMC also argued, in the alternative,
                    that <em>Sovcomflot</em> had clothed the master with
                    ostensible authority to bind it in respect of the bills of lading issued by
                    permitting the vessel to be traded notwithstanding the termination of the
                    sub-demise charter. Moore J expressed the view at [31] that this submission was
                    “not untenable” and he had the opportunity to revisit it more
                    fully when the merits of CMC’s claim came before him in <em>CMC (Australia) Pty Ltd v ‘Socofl Stream’</em> [2000] FCA
                    1681 (“<em>The Socofl Stream (merits; 1st
                        instance)</em>”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_119"></a>119    In <em>The Socofl Stream
                        (merits; 1st instance)</em>, Moore J held that Sovcomflot was liable
                    to CMC on the basis that it had clothed the master with ostensible authority. In
                    arriving at this view, Moore J placed importance on the fact that Sovcomflot was
                    contractually obliged to nominate a port for redelivery but had failed to do so.
                    He reasoned as follows at [87]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Sovcomflot's demand for redelivery in its telex of 25 December 1998, in
                        which it demanded that Kamchatka "forthwith re-deliver the above vessel to
                        the disponent owner as soon as possible at a safe port to be nominated by
                        us, failing which re-delivery the disponent owner (or their agent) may
                        itself enter upon and repossess the vessel," was a barren one in the absence
                        of the nomination of a port for redelivery. Moreover, <em>the
                            failure of Sovcomflot to nominate a port might reasonably have been
                            taken by Kamchatka to be an indication that Sovcomflot was not prepared
                            to assert or enforce its legal rights, at least fully</em>.
                        Sovcomflot neglected to nominate a port for redelivery even when Kamchatka
                        made it plain (again) in its telex of 30 December 1998 that it proposed to
                        continue to trade. <em>Sovcomflot thus afforded Kamchatka the
                            opportunity to continue to trade using the Vessel under the command of
                            the Master. Sovcomflot effectively clothed the Master with authority to
                            issue bills of lading on behalf of the "owner", that is, the person who
                            was, at that time, in fact and in law the demise charterer. Sovcomflot
                            would have had no reasonable basis, in my opinion, for assuming that
                            what had occurred in late December 1998 between it and Kamchatka would
                            be known to shippers who might use the Vessel before Sovcomflot regained
                            physical possession of it. It should have known that by allowing
                            Kamchatka to trade in the way just discussed, shipowners would enter
                            contracts of carriage on the assumption that the Master could bind the
                            owner.</em> [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_120"></a>120    Sovcomflot’s appeal against Moore
                    J’s decision was heard by Ryan, Tamberlin, and Conti JJ who delivered a
                    joint judgment in <em>The Ship “Socofl Stream” v
                        CMC (Australia) Pty Ltd</em> [2001] FCA 961 (“<em>The Socofl Stream (merits; appeal)</em>”). Counsel for
                    Sovcomflot attacked Moore J’s reasoning on the issue of ostensible
                    authority by arguing that it rested on the implied finding that, had Sovcomflot
                    demanded the redelivery of the vessel to a port nominated by it, Kamchatka would
                    necessarily have complied. He argued that, on the facts, Kamchatka would have
                    ignored such a demand. The appellate judges stated at [20] that it was
                    “unnecessary to resolve this question”. Instead, they held that,
                    for the purpose of determining whether the master had been clothed with
                    ostensible authority, it was necessary to focus on the events which transpired
                    between Sovcomflot’s issuance of the termination notice and the time
                    CMC’s cargo was loaded and the bills of lading issued. On this analysis,
                    they had no doubt that Sovcomflot – by its conduct of allowing cargo to be
                    loaded onto the vessel rather than taking steps to make clear that it was no
                    longer on demise charter – had represented to third parties that the
                    master had ostensible authority to bind it which was relied on by CMC (see
                    [37]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In the present case, it was said that there was no evidence of reliance by
                        CMC on any conduct. We disagree. <em>In our view, the
                            relevant conduct by Sovcomflot was its allowing the "Socofl Stream" to
                            take on cargo after 15 December 1998 for which the master or his agent
                            issued bills of lading. The evidence does not exclude the natural
                            inference that </em><b><em>Sovcomflot, at any time
                            after 15 December 1998, could have made clear by arresting the ship (as
                            it ultimately did) or otherwise, that the ship no longer had the
                            disponent owner's authority to take on cargo and issue bills of
                            lading</em></b><em>. CMC relied on the conduct of
                            Sovcomflot which we have just identified by having its agents at
                            Singapore and Port Klang put consignments of steel on board the vessel
                            and obtain bills of lading in respect of those consignments in the usual
                            way.</em> [emphasis added in italics and in bold italics]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_121"></a>121    While the courts at first instance and on
                    appeal focused on different aspects of Sovcomflot’s conduct, it seems
                    clear to me that the general thrust of their reasoning was similar. The point
                    was that, following Sovcomflot’s termination of the demise charter, it was
                    informed of the possibility that Kamchatka might continue trading the vessel
                    and, despite knowing that, Sovcomflot did not do anything to prevent Kamchatka
                    from perpetuating this state of affairs. In the circumstances, Sovcomflot could
                    not argue that the master had no authority to bind it when issuing bills of
                    lading to third party shippers who loaded cargo onto the vessel. After all, as
                    the appellate court observed in <em>The Socofl Stream (merits;
                        appeal)</em> at [22], such third parties generally operate on the
                    assumption that they are dealing with either the actual or disponent owner of
                    the vessel and would not know that there was a demise charter that had been
                    terminated:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…
                        <em>The assumption to be imputed to CMC is that, when the
                            ship, in the person of the Master, received cargo on board and issued
                            bills of lading, that was done on behalf of the actual or disponent
                            owner of the ship for the time being.</em> On that analysis,
                        although there may have been a "complete change" of ownership by reason of
                        Sovcomflot's termination of the demise charter to Kamchatka, <em>that did not change any assumption which might reasonably have
                            been made by third parties dealing with the ship</em>. …

<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Whether the master had ostensible authority to bind HKC </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_122"></a>122    The parallels between the <em>Socofl Stream</em> cases and the present case are clear. In both
                    cases, the vessels in question were under demise charters which were purportedly
                    terminated by the issuance of a notice. Demands were also similarly made for the
                    redelivery of the vessel but these were not complied with. The demise charterers
                    in both cases also communicated their intentions to continue trading the vessel
                    which they went on to do by loading cargo belonging to the respective
                    plaintiffs.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_123"></a>123    In fact, the argument for ostensible
                    authority appears to be even stronger in this case. In the <em>Socofl Stream</em> cases, Sovcomflot was not provided with details of
                    the shippers, whereas, here, Sejin provided full details of the shippers to HKC.
                    HKC was therefore in a better position than Sovcomflot was to prevent the
                    loading of cargoes and could have done so by taking the simple step of
                    contacting the shippers but it failed to do so despite being informed of the
                    details of prospective fixtures and an update on the movement of the Vessel on
                    23 and 31 May 2011 respectively (see [19]–[20] above). By the time HKA
                    issued its formal written reply some two weeks later on 14 June 2011, the Vessel
                    had already completed loading cargoes belonging to KRC and Mercuria respectively
                    and issued separate bills of lading in respect of each.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_124"></a>124    I should mention that Mr Sejun Kim has
                    stated in his affidavit that HKC was “very upset” to learn from
                    Sejin’s 23 May 2011 letter that Sejin refused to return the Vessel. He
                    stated that HKC then “complained” about the prospective fixtures,
                    “objected” to the continued use of the Vessel, and
                    “demanded” its immediate return. Notably, however, there was no
                    documentary proof which showed that HKC did any of these things. This is
                    particularly striking given that, during the critical period after the 4 April
                    Notice had been issued, the parties frequently communicated their respective
                    positions through written correspondence. Mr Sejun Kim’s bare assertions
                    in this respect were unsupported with reference to the objective evidence before
                    me.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_125"></a>125    However, even if I accept Mr Sejun
                    Kim’s assertions to be true, I fail to see how this assists HKC’s
                    case. The purported termination of the Lease Agreement and the subsequent
                    demands for redelivery were known only to the immediate contracting parties.
                    What is important was that the Vessel’s change in status had not been
                    brought to the attention of the outside world by some manifest act of HKC. As I
                    had pointed out earlier in this judgment, third parties in the position of KRC
                    and Mercuria do not have the benefit of a public registry to check whether a
                    vessel is on bareboat charter. They therefore could not have been expected to
                    know that the Lease Agreement had at one time been in force, let alone that it
                    had been terminated. On the other hand, HKC had full knowledge of the state of
                    play: it knew of the purported termination of the Lease Agreement and that,
                    despite the purported termination, Sejin still intended to load cargo onto the
                    Vessel. By failing to take any overt steps to prevent that, HKC must be taken to
                    have represented to third parties that the master had the authority to bind
                    it.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_126"></a>126    In this connection, it must be emphasised
                    that Sejin’s continued trading of the Vessel could hardly be described as
                    surreptitious. Sejin was open in providing explicit information regarding the
                    Vessel’s trading route under the prospective fixtures and also the names
                    and addresses of the charterers whom it had contracted with, such as
                    Frumentarius. Mr Tay rightly pointed out in his submissions that HKC could
                    easily have contacted these charterers to inform them that Sejin no longer had
                    any right to continue with the Vessel’s employment and that cargo should
                    not be loaded on board. In fact, a more effective means at HKC’s disposal
                    to prevent the Vessel from being traded was simply to have obtained a warrant
                    for her arrest. This had in fact been contractually provided for in Art 26(5) of
                    the Lease Agreement which states that HKC may unilaterally retrieve the Vessel
                    at Sejin’s expense if Sejin delays the return of the Vessel. However, this
                    right was never exercised. Mr Sejun Kim’s explanation for HKC’s
                    inaction in this regard was that he “did not know where the Vessel was or
                    how to retrieve the Vessel”. That, however, did not strike me as a
                    convincing reason, especially when Sejin had provided an update on the
                    Vessel’s location at Belawan and its subsequent trading route. In this
                    regard, I note that Sovcomflot’s representative made similar arguments in
                        <em>The Socofl Stream (merits; 1st instance)</em>, but,
                    likewise, this argument did not gain much traction before Moore J (see
                    [15]–[17]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Mr Izmailov said during cross-examination that when the charterparty was
                        terminated no port for re-delivery was nominated because Sovcomflot did not
                        know where the Vessel was. He appeared to accept that, in theory, he could
                        have contacted Kamchatka to ascertain the location of the Vessel but said
                        that to do so would have been useless. He also accepted that a way of
                        finding out the whereabouts of the Vessel would have been to use the Lloyd's
                        Register and other services which provided updates on the location of
                        vessels. He asserted that after the notice of termination had been given,
                        any trading by Kamchatka would be "illegal". He appeared to accept, however,
                        that the Vessel might continue to trade after the notice had been given. He
                        said that his expectation was, at the time the notice was given, that
                        Kamchatka would agree to the notice and provide, I infer, a trading schedule
                        of the Vessel identifying where it was located. …</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Mr Neill, CMC's solicitor, gave evidence about steps Sovcomflot could have
                        taken to locate the Vessel. It was admitted over objection though the
                        general thrust of the evidence was not challenged. Some of it was
                        self-evident. The first means of locating the Vessel was by asking
                        Kamchatka. The second was using one of two commercial tracking services,
                        namely MRC or one maintained by Lloyd's. The third was through Sovcomflot's
                        London solicitors though on the basis they would also use these commercial
                        tracking services. The last was for Sovcomflot to inquire of their
                        shipbroker. …</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<em>I am satisfied that it would have been open to

                        for Sovcomflot argued, that "it may have been possible, if Sovcomflot had
                        ordered its affairs entirely in order to protect the interests of persons
                        such as [CMC], there were things which Sovcomflot could have done which may

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_128"></a>128    Here, HKC did not need any assistance in
                    locating the Vessel. HKC was kept informed of the Vessel’s sailing route
                    at all material times. In light of the above, I fail to see how KRC and
                    Mercuria’s alternative claims against HKC were “factually
                    unsustainable” as Mr Heng argued. The manner in which events unfolded
                    between the issuance of the 4 April Notice and the completion of loading at
                    Belawan and Dumai supports the view that the master was clothed with ostensible
                    authority to bind HKC. In the result, I find that KRC and Mercuria’s
                    alternative claims should not be struck out.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_129"></a>129    Let me be clear. A finding of ostensible
                    authority is necessarily <em>fact-specific</em> (see also
                    [81] above). I have arrived at this finding because of HKC’s conduct in
                        <em>knowingly</em> allowing Sejin to continue loading
                    cargoes notwithstanding the purported termination and its abject failure to take
                    any steps to regain possession of the Vessel. It is not the case that every
                    shipowner, after having terminated a bareboat charter, will inevitably
                    thereafter be liable for the trading activities of the vessel on basis of the
                    master’s ostensible authority. This would lead to the ironic situation
                    where shipowners, in seeking to defeat <em>in rem</em>
                    claims against the bareboat charterer by terminating the bareboat charter at the
                    earliest opportunity, nevertheless end up with the same liability in a different
                    form, <em>ie</em>, in the form of a direct claim by virtue
                    of the doctrine of ostensible authority. This anomalous outcome was also noted
                    by Finkelstein J in <em>ASP Holdings</em> in the passage
                    which I have quoted above at [90].</p>

                        <em>in rem</em> writs. I hold that Sejin was, on a
                    balance of probabilities, still the bareboat charterer of the Vessel at the time
                    the plaintiffs’ respective actions were commenced. I have given five
                    alternative reasons for reaching this conclusion, although the last two are
                    essentially <em>obiter</em>, given that the determination
                    of the contractual termination issue against HKC is sufficient for me to allow
                    the plaintiffs’ appeals:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_130-p2_a"></a>(a)     First, the 4 April Notice was
                        invalidly issued by HKA because the right of termination had not been
                        transferred to HKA under the ATA and/or the NCT.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_130-p2_b"></a>(b)     Second, the Lease Agreement had not
                        been validly terminated by HKA because <em>HKC</em> did
                        not form the opinion that Sejin was facing difficulties in continuing its
                        normal business activities required for the right to termination under Art
                        24(2) and the 4 April Notice had, in any event, failed to identify the
                        “cause” which led it to form such an
                    opinion.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_130-p2_c"></a>(c)     Third,
                        the non-payment of hire <em>simpliciter</em> was not a
                        proper ground for the immediate termination of the Lease Agreement under Art
                        24(2).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_130-p2_d"></a>(d)     Fourth,
                        physical redelivery is required at common law to terminate a bareboat
                        charter and even if this general rule can be contracted out of (a
                        possibility which I have expressed my doubts on), that does not appear to be
                        what the parties had done, especially given the presence of Art 26(3) in the
                        Lease Agreement.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_130-p2_e"></a>(e)     Fifth, even if the doctrine of constructive redelivery were accepted
                        as a part of our law (a position which I have also expressed reservations
                        on), the Vessel had not been constructively redelivered to HKC because there
                        was no clear and unequivocal act by Sejin capable of representing redelivery
                        on the facts of this case.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_131"></a>131    I also dismiss HKC’s appeals in RA
                    8/2014 and RA 7/2014 to strike out KRC and Mercuria’s alternative claims
                    in ADM 198/2011 and ADM 201/2011 respectively. I find that KRC and
                    Mercuria’s claims are not factually unsustainable and thus should not be
                    struck out.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_132"></a>132    In the court below, the Assistant Registrar
                    awarded HKC 90% of the costs for the setting aside applications and ordered
                    costs against HKC in favour of KRC and Mercuria in respect of the unsuccessful
                    striking out applications. The costs orders were to be taxed if not
                    agreed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_133"></a>133    Before me, the plaintiffs have succeeded in
                    their respective appeals while HKC’s appeals have been dismissed. There is
                    no reason for me to depart from the usual order for costs to follow the event. I
                    invited the parties to submit on costs. Their submissions on costs in the event
                    that the plaintiffs’ appeals are allowed and HKC’s appeals are
                    dismissed ranged from $12,000 to $19,500 plus reasonable disbursements for the
                    hearing below (HKC’s new counsel who did not have conduct of the case
                    below, did not submit on costs for the hearing below) and $5,000 to $7,000 for
                    the plaintiffs’ appeals and $3,000 for HKC’s appeals. While HKC was
                    represented by the same counsel for all the proceedings, the plaintiffs were
                    separately represented except in the case of Frumentarius and KRC. They were
                    represented by the same counsel, Ms Tan, who rightly submitted that there should
                    only be one set of costs for Frumentarius and KRC.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_134"></a>134    Although the facts are relatively
                    undisputed, the appeals involved novel and interesting points of law. The
                    hearing spanned a total of 14 calendar days though much time was spent on the
                    unnecessary dispute over Korean law. However, it was HKC who put Korean law in
                    issue. Though it might not have been necessary for the plaintiffs to respond to
                    HKC’s reliance on Korean law, as was the experience of Mercuria, it was
                    not unreasonable for them to have done so. Therefore, I would not discount the
                    costs incurred in respect of the Korean law issue. Taking into account all the
                    circumstances, I order HKC to pay the following costs:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_134-p2_a"></a>(a)     To Winplus – costs fixed at
                        $15,000 for the hearing below and $5,000 for the appeal in RA 426/2013, both
                        inclusive of disbursements.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_134-p2_b"></a>(b)     To Frumentarius and KRC – one set of costs fixed
                        at $15,000 for the hearing below, $5,000 for the appeals in RA 1/2014 and RA
                        2/2014, and $3,000 for RA 8/2014, all inclusive of
                    disbursements.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_134-p2_c"></a>(c)     To
                        Mercuria – costs fixed at $15,000 for the hearing below, $5,000 for
                        the appeal in RA 6/2014, and $3,000 for RA 7/2014, all inclusive of
                        disbursements.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">A <em>coda</em> on the use of expert evidence in
                the proof of foreign law</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_135"></a>135    This <em>coda</em> is
                    necessitated by my observation that even though HKC’s applications first
                    came up for hearing before the Assistant Registrar on 11 October 2012, the
                    next day of hearing only commenced some nine months later on 2 July 2013. In my
                    view, this lengthy delay between hearings is regrettable. After having reviewed
                    the record of the proceedings below, it is clear that this delay was a result of
                    a dispute between the parties over the opinion expressed by one of the Korean
                    law experts. However, I am of the view that <em>all</em>
                    the opinions filed in these proceedings were ultimately indistinguishable from
                    submissions which offered the court no substantive assistance in terms of
                        <em>proof of foreign law</em>. All that trouble could
                    have been avoided if an expert’s role in providing an opinion on foreign
                    law was properly understood at the outset. That role, as I will explain, is also
                    a targeted one where, as in the present case, the expert is asked to provide an
                    opinion to aid the local court in the <em>construction of private
                        documents</em> such as the Lease Agreement, NCT, and
                ATA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_136"></a>136    In order to illustrate why the proceedings
                    below were so protracted, it is necessary for me to first set out the various
                    expert opinions in some detail.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The prominent use of expert opinions below</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The expert evidence on Korean law</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_137"></a>137    There were three Korean law experts who had
                    each filed multiple opinions in the proceedings below:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_137-p2_a"></a>(a)     Prof Kim was the expert appointed
                        by HKC. He filed a total of three affidavits exhibiting his opinions prior
                        to the commencement of the hearings below.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_137-p2_b"></a>(b)     Mr Soo Keun Kyung (“Mr Kyung”)
                        was the expert appointed by Winplus. He filed two affidavits exhibiting his
                        opinions prior to the commencement of the hearings below and a third
                        affidavit thereafter to make a minor correction to his first
                    opinion.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_137-p2_c"></a>(c)     Mr Jong
                        Hyeon Choi (“Mr Choi”) was the expert jointly appointed by
                        Frumentarius and KRC. He filed two affidavits exhibiting his opinions prior
                        to the commencement of the hearings below. As I will explain, the opinion
                        provided in his second affidavit was the source of the parties’
                        dispute below and that led to him filing three further affidavits to clarify
                        his position.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_137-p2_d"></a>(d)     To the credit of Mercuria, it consistently maintained the view that Korean
                        law was irrelevant to the determination of the issues before the court and
                        therefore elected not to file any affidavit on Korean law. Unfortunately,
                        Mercuria was alone in this view.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_138"></a>138    Each of the three experts filed at least two
                    rounds of opinions prior to the commencement of the hearings below. I note that
                    the views expressed in these opinions, in particular those of Prof Kim and Mr
                    Kyung, covered extensive ground but, unfortunately, none was particularly
                    relevant. Once one cuts through the chaff, it becomes apparent that, on the
                    crucial question which the experts sought to provide an opinion on –
                    <em>viz</em>, whether the 4 April Notice had terminated the
                    Lease Agreement under Korean law – there essentially emerged two
                    fundamental points of disagreement which were alluded to earlier in this
                    judgment at [13] and [16]. In my view, these two points are best presented by
                    tracking how they arose in the different rounds of exchanges between the
                    experts.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_139"></a>139    In the first round of opinions, the central
                    point of departure between the experts was whether the 4 April Notice had been
                    issued in compliance with Art 24(2) of the Lease Agreement so as to constitute a
                    valid termination. In Prof Kim’s opinion, Art 24(2) enabled HKC to
                    exercise a right of <em>immediate</em> termination; hence
                    the reasons justifying such termination had to be “very serious
                    ones”. He then went on to emphasise that Sejin’s failure to make
                    rental payments for the past six months had resulted in arrears of a
                    “very substantial amount”. When this was taken together with the
                    sharp drop in the price of the Vessel and the poor market conditions (reasons
                    which were not stated in the 4 April Notice), Prof Kim concluded that there was
                    “enough for HKC to form its view” under Art 24(2) and to issue a
                    termination notice as it did. Mr Choi disagreed. In his view, Art 24(2) clearly
                    required a termination notice to specify the “cause” for
                    termination but this was absent from the 4 April Notice whose validity was
                    therefore “disputable”. This point was similarly raised by Mr
                    Kyung.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_140"></a>140    I pause here to make an important
                    observation. The first set of legal opinions was disappointingly short on legal
                    analysis. None of the experts endeavoured to provide any explanation whatsoever
                    as to how their views were derived from particular Korean law principles or
                    rules of interpretation and no such sources of foreign law had been cited in
                    support of the conclusions reached. One is therefore left with the distinct
                    impression that the experts’ conclusions were grounded in little more than
                    their personal opinion rather than the result of a considered application of
                    Korean law. Their opinions were entirely unhelpful and revealed a fundamental
                    misapprehension of the role of expert evidence in the proof of foreign law. It
                    therefore came as no surprise that the experts’ further round of opinions
                    was afflicted with the same problems.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_141"></a>141    The second round of expert opinions was
                    dominated by the differing views of Prof Kim and Mr Kyung on the rather separate
                    question of whether <em>HKA</em> could terminate the Lease
                    Agreement by issuing the 4 April Notice (see [16] above). I should explain that
                    this issue came to be at the forefront of their considerations because, in the
                    first round of opinions, Mr Kyung noted that Prof Kim had wrongly assumed the 4
                    April Notice to have been issued by <em>HKC</em> (rather
                    than <em>HKA</em>, as was the case). Mr Kyung pointed out
                    that this was a “fundamental error” of fact and that Prof
                    Kim’s opinion on the effectiveness of the 4 April Notice should be
                    rejected as a result.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_142"></a>142    Prof Kim sought to overcome Mr Kyung’s
                    objection in his second opinion by stating that, even if HKA had sent the 4
                    April Notice, this did not cause it to be invalid. He pointed to the NCT which
                    appeared to transfer, in addition to the credits under the Lease Agreement,
                    certain other “right[s]” or “status” to HKA (see
                    [13] above). In Prof Kim’s interpretation, these terms encompassed the
                        <em>right to terminate</em> the Lease Agreement and so
                    HKA could properly issue the 4 April Notice. Alternatively, Prof Kim stated
                    that, even if HKC had retained the right to terminate, “HKA can be said
                    to have terminated the Lease Agreement for and on behalf of HKC” as its
                    authorised agent. It bears mention that none of these views were supported by
                    any references to Korean law principles. In short, it was simply a matter of
                    interpretation of the contractual documents before the court. In my view, such
                    an argument could well have been presented by counsel before me in their own
                    right. There was no enhancement in the value of the argument by having it
                    articulated through the Korean law experts.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_143"></a>143    As for Mr Kyung, he maintained in his second
                    opinion that the issuance of the 4 April Notice by HKA (as opposed to HKC) was a
                    fundamental defect. In particular, he disagreed with Prof Kim on the effect of
                    the NCT. According to Mr Kyung, the NCT was “merely a notice” and
                    so could not exceed the ATA in terms of what was transferred. Since the ATA only
                    purported to transfer the <em>credits</em> under the Lease
                    Agreement, it followed that HKA could not acquire the altogether separate right
                    to terminate the same despite what the NCT purported to transfer. It is again
                    noteworthy, however, that Mr Kyung’s opinion here was similarly bereft of
                    any references to Korean law principles although it is correct as a legal
                    submission (see [44] above).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_144"></a>144    As for Mr Choi, his second opinion was
                    silent on whether the 4 April Notice could be issued by HKA. This
                    “silence” became the source of much controversy in the proceedings
                    below and that ultimately led to the wholly unnecessary delay between
                    hearings.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_145"></a>145    To be fair to the experts, it was not the
                    case that their submissions were entirely devoid of references to legal
                    authority. For example, the exchange between Mr Kyung and Prof Kim over the
                    validity of the ATA in transferring the lease credits to HKA (see [11] above)
                    was keenly contested on a point of legal principle. In his first opinion, Mr
                    Kyung pointed out that Art 37 of the Lease Agreement required the transfer of
                    rights belonging to HKC to be “with prior consent from [Sejin]”,
                    yet the ATA, which purported to transfer HKC’s right to the lease credits
                    to HKA, appeared to have been executed without such consent. In response, Prof
                    Kim relied heavily on a judgment of the Supreme Court of Korea to establish
                    that, as a matter of Korean law, an agreement not to transfer credits without
                    the prior consent of the obligor (<em>ie</em>, Sejin) could
                    only be raised against the transferee (<em>ie</em>, HKA)
                        <em>if</em> the transferee knew of the agreement in the
                    first place, and there was nothing to suggest that HKA knew of Art 37 of the
                    Lease Agreement between HKC and Sejin.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_146"></a>146    The problem, however, was that these
                    references were of little assistance because they ultimately pertained to a moot
                    point. The scope of what the ATA purported to transfer was merely the <em>credits</em> under the Lease Agreement (see [11] and [44]
                    above). Even if HKC succeeded in proving that the ATA was valid, this would only
                    mean that the right to receive the credits was indeed transferred to HKA.
                    However, the transfer of <em>credits</em> under the Lease
                    Agreement does not, in and of itself, answer the critical question of whether
                    HKA could properly <em>terminate</em> the Lease Agreement
                    by issuing the 4 April Notice. The central inquiry is still whether the
                        <em>right to terminate the Lease Agreement</em> had
                    been transferred to HKA and that point, in the experts’ views at least,
                    turned on the construction of the words “right” or
                    “status” in the <em>NCT</em> which,
                    unfortunately, was a subject on which conclusions were reached without adequate
                    reference to legal authority. In this regard, I note that the question of the
                    validity of the ATA featured neither in the Assistant Registrar’s decision
                    nor was it raised on appeal before me.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_147"></a>147    It is therefore regrettable that the
                    experts’ opinions on the appropriate construction of the <em>NCT</em> were not supplemented with references to Korean law
                    principles in the same way their opinions on the validity of the ATA
                    were.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The protracted nature of the proceedings below</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_148"></a>148    In the proceedings below, HKC was
                    represented by Ms Vivian Ang (“Ms Ang”) but, by the time of the
                    appeal before me, HKC had engaged new solicitors and was represented by Mr Heng.
                    As for the plaintiffs in the four admiralty actions, they were represented by
                    the same counsel throughout. Winplus was represented by Ms Sharmini,
                    Frumentarius and KRC were represented by Ms Tan, and Mercuria was represented by
                    Mr Tay.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_149"></a>149    The first day of hearing before the
                    Assistant Registrar commenced on 11 October 2012. It is notable that, at the end
                    of this hearing, Ms Ang was recorded as having submitted that Mr Choi had
                    “no issue with the April termination notice”. It appears that what
                    Ms Ang had meant by this submission is that Mr Choi agreed with Prof Kim that
                    the NCT was effective in transferring the right to terminate the Lease Agreement
                    to HKA. This point was only followed up on some time later by Ms
                Tan.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_150"></a>150    The parties appeared before the Assistant
                    Registrar the next day but this hearing was adjourned because an objection was
                    raised that certain Korean documents which Prof Kim had referred to in his
                    opinions had not been translated in full. Prof Kim was given until 5 November
                    2012 to file and serve an affidavit with all additional translations and the
                    Assistant Registrar also fixed four additional days of hearing on 19, 20, 21 and
                    23 November 2012. On 5 November 2012, however, Ms Ang’s firm wrote to
                    inform the court that her clients were unable to complete the translation of all
                    the relevant Korean documents as they were quite substantial and requested for a
                    one week extension. In light of this, the court wrote to all parties two days
                    later informing them to attend a special pre-trial conference
                    (“PTC”) on 15 November 2012.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_151"></a>151    At the 15 November 2012 PTC, the Assistant
                    Registrar inquired into the status of the translation and was informed that the
                    relevant documents had already been filed and served. However, the Assistant
                    Registrar was then informed by Ms Tan that Mr Choi had filed a third affidavit
                    to clarify that, contrary to Ms Ang’s submission on the first day of
                    hearing, he did <em>not</em> agree with Prof Kim’s
                    opinion on the effect of the NCT but was, instead, aligned with Mr Kyung on this
                    issue. Ms Ang objected to this. In her view, Mr Choi was taking a
                    “radically different” position in his third affidavit and thus she
                    requested for time to advise her clients on the legal avenues available to them,
                    including making an application under O 40A r 4 of the ROC for leave to put
                    questions to Mr Choi in relation to his third affidavit. In the result, the
                    Assistant Registrar vacated the four hearing dates which had earlier been
                    scheduled and directed that if Ms Ang were minded to make an application under O
                    40A r 4, she was to do so by 29 November 2012.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_152"></a>152    The parties next attended before the
                    Assistant Registrar at a PTC on 13 December 2012. Ms Ang informed the
                    Assistant Registrar that she had yet to file an application under O 40A r 4. She
                    explained that she had held back from doing so because her clients were
                    exploring the possibility of transferring the issues which were subject to
                    Korean law to be heard by the Korean courts. This was the first time that the
                    other parties had heard of this proposal and, in the face of their resistance,
                    Ms Ang eventually agreed to have the matter proceed in Singapore. She sought an
                    extension of time to file the O 40A r 4 application and the Assistant Registrar
                    directed that this be done by the following day. This was duly complied with. Ms
                    Ang filed Summons No 6434 of 2012 (“SUM 6434/2012”) on 14
                    December 2012 seeking leave to put questions to Mr Choi regarding his third
                    affidavit. The hearing of this summons was fixed for 15 February
                2013.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_153"></a>153    Prior to the hearing of SUM 6434/2012, Mr
                    Choi filed a fourth affidavit on 11 January 2013 in which he maintained that his
                    third affidavit was merely clarificatory in nature and did not constitute a
                    substantive change in his position. He explained that his silence on the effect
                    of the ATA and NCT in his second opinion did not mean that he agreed with Prof
                    Kim’s views and reiterated that he shared the same opinion as Mr Kyung on
                    this issue. In conclusion, he stated that it was unnecessary for questions to be
                    put to him pursuant to O 40A r 4. I pause to observe that Mr Choi was right in
                    saying that his silence did not mean that he had agreed with Prof Kim as the
                    burden of proof of foreign law rests with the party asserting it. However, after
                    several rounds of hearings on 15, 20 February and 22 April 2013, the Assistant
                    Registrar eventually granted leave for questions to be put to Mr Choi who was,
                    in turn, required to provide his answers by 10 May 2013. Mr Choi complied by
                    duly filing a fifth affidavit within the stipulated time. However, nothing of
                    note emerged from this application.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_154"></a>154    This long-drawn skirmish over Mr
                    Choi’s position on the ATA/NCT issue finally drew to a close at a special
                    PTC on 19 June 2013. The Assistant Registrar was informed that HKC would not be
                    filing further affidavits in reply to Choi’s third, fourth, and fifth
                    affidavits and this paved the way for HKC’s setting aside and striking out
                    applications to recommence hearing. This was scheduled to take place on 2 July
                    2013, regrettably almost nine months after the first day of
                hearing.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_155"></a>155    There were 13 days of hearings between 2
                    July 2013 and the final day on 20 September 2013. Having perused the Notes of
                    Evidence below, it is plain to me that the parties spent a considerable amount
                    of this time poring over the experts’ various rounds of opinions and
                    pitting one against the other on the two material points of departure that arose
                    from their first two rounds of opinions. Was this at all necessary?
                    Unfortunately not. The opinion of a foreign law expert is used to <em>prove</em> the <em>content</em> of that
                    foreign law by reference to relevant sources of law. However, not only were the
                    opinions poor guides to the content of Korean law, the parties themselves did
                    not appear to think that the case would have been decided differently if Korean
                    law, rather than Singapore law, applied. That being the case, I fail to see how
                    it was relevant or useful for the parties to trawl through the opinions as they
                    did below. Given this state of affairs, I consider it beneficial to express some
                    views on the proof of foreign law in general before expounding, in particular,
                    on what an expert’s opinion on foreign law should seek to encompass,
                    particularly where the matter concerns the construction of private
                    documents.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_156"></a>156    Before doing so, I should mention that, from
                    my reading of the Judgment below, little weight, if any, was eventually accorded
                    to the opinions of the Korean law experts. Although the contest on the differing
                    opinions on Korean law dominated the hearings before the Assistant Registrar,
                    the opinions barely featured in the Judgment. Of the four principal grounds of
                    her decision summarised in [33(a)] above, the only issue in which the Assistant
                    Registrar appeared to have peripherally relied on Korean law was whether HKA
                    could exercise the right of termination. In this regard, she preferred
                    Mr Kyung’s opinion over Prof Kim’s that the ATA did not
                    transfer the right to terminate and that the NCT could not transfer more rights
                    than those transferred under the ATA. In my view, that was a conclusion capable
                    of being reached based on a simple construction of the terms of the ATA and the
                    NCT. The experts did not add any value to the analysis of that issue which, in
                    any case, is a matter ultimately for the court to construe.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Proof of foreign law</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">General principles</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_157"></a>157    It is well-established that the content of
                    foreign law is a question of fact which must be pleaded and proved. In general,
                    however, parties are not <em>obliged</em> to do so even if,
                    according to the rules of private international law, the issue at hand is
                    governed by foreign law. Indeed, parties often have sound reasons for choosing
                    to ignore foreign law. Undertaking to prove foreign law can be an expensive
                    exercise. Furthermore, where an application of foreign law will lead to the same
                    result as an application of the law of the forum, it is also unnecessary (see
                    Pippa Rogerson, <em>Collier’s Conflict of Laws</em>
                    (Cambridge University Press, 4th Ed, 2013) at p 50).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_158"></a>158    Where, however, a party has pleaded and
                    wishes to prove foreign law, he has two modes by which he can adduce such proof.
                    As the Court of Appeal noted in the leading case of <em>Pacific
                        Recreation Pte Ltd v S Y Technology Inc and another appeal</em> [2008]
                    2 SLR(R) 491 (“<em>Pacific Recreation</em>”)
                    at [54], such a party has the option of (a) directly adducing raw sources of
                    foreign law as evidence; and/or (b) adducing the opinion of an expert on foreign
                    law. However, as the Court of Appeal went on to observe at [60], even if raw
                    sources of foreign law were admissible under the Evidence Act (Cap 97, 1997 Rev
                    Ed) (“Evidence Act”), it is still “preferable” for
                    them to be accompanied by expert opinions whenever possible. This is simply
                    “a matter of prudence” because our courts may well find it
                    difficult to competently interpret such raw sources of foreign law unaided (see
                        <em>Wong Kai Woon alias Wong Kai Boon and another v Wong Kong
                        Hom alias Ng Kong Hom and others</em> [2000] SGHC 176 at
                [55]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_159"></a>159    Where the foreign law is not proved, the
                    content of foreign law will be presumed to be the same as the law of the forum
                    (see <em>Goh Chok Tong v Tang Liang Hong</em> [1997] 1
                    SLR(R) 811 at [84]). This result is unsurprising. As the Court of Appeal
                    explained in <em>EFT Holdings, Inc and another v Marinteknik
                        Shipbuilders (S) Pte Ltd and another</em> [2014] 1 SLR 860 at [57],
                    the court lacks knowledge of foreign law and must therefore be informed of its
                    content by evidence from the parties. In the absence of satisfactory proof of
                    foreign law, Singapore courts will simply apply Singapore law. The court will
                    generally not take judicial notice of foreign law, subject to the exceptions
                    provided in s 59 of the Evidence Act.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The role of the foreign law expert generally</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_160"></a>160    The role of an expert in providing an
                    opinion on foreign law was neatly summarised by Evans LJ in <em>MCC Proceeds Inc v Bishopsgate Investment Trust plc and others</em>
                    [1999] CLC 417 (“<em>MCC Proceeds</em>”) and
                    adopted by the Court of Appeal in <em>Pacific
                        Recreation</em> at [76]. According to Evans LJ, the three main duties
                    of a foreign law expert are:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(1) to inform the court of the relevant contents of the foreign law;
                        identifying statutes or other legislation and explaining where necessary the
                        foreign court's approach to their construction;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(2) to identify judgments or other authorities, explaining what status
                        they have as sources of the foreign law; and</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(3) where there is no authority directly in point, to assist the English
                        judge in making a finding as to what the foreign court's ruling would be if
                        the issue was to arise for decision there.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_161"></a>161    It is clear from this exposition that the
                    foremost function of an expert witness on foreign law is to inform the court of
                    the relevant <em>contents</em> of the foreign law and he
                    does so chiefly by placing the relevant sources of foreign law before the court,
                    whether they be statutory or in the form of foreign decisions (see <em>Pacific Recreation</em> at [77]). Indeed, this is a
                    requirement under O 40A r 3(2)(<em>b</em>) of the ROC which
                    states that an expert’s report must “give details of any literature
                    or other material which the expert witness has relied on in making the
                    report”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_162"></a>162    Evans LJ acknowledged, however, that there
                    may well be circumstances where there is no authority directly in point. In such
                    circumstances, there is much greater scope for the expert to give opinion
                    evidence on the matter. However, it is notable that Evans LJ stressed at [24] of
                        <em>MCC Proceeds</em> that the expert’s role was
                    still restricted to “predict[ing] the likely decision of a foreign
                    court” and not to “press upon the English judge the
                    witness’s personal views as to what the foreign law might be”. This
                    merely expresses the commonsensical view that the court can derive no meaningful
                    assistance from the bare assertions of experts on foreign law advanced without
                    any objectively explicable basis. This point was reinforced by the Court of
                    Appeal in <em>Pacific Recreation</em> at [85]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Whatever the case, it is clear that the expert cannot merely present his
                        conclusion on what the foreign law is without also presenting the underlying
                        evidence and the analytical process by which he reached his conclusion.
                        …</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_163"></a>163    In the event that there are relevant sources
                    of foreign law, the expert’s role generally extends further than simply
                    placing them before the court: he should also explain the effect of such foreign
                    law because the raw contents on their own might often mislead persons not
                    familiar with the particular system of law (see <em>Pacific
                        Recreation</em> at [78]). Therefore, where the expert has cited
                    foreign cases, he should seek to explain how the foreign court would regard it
                    in terms of its precedential value. Likewise, where the court is concerned with
                    the construction of a foreign statute, the expert should set out the relevant
                    foreign rules of statutory construction and state his views on the meaning and
                    effect of the foreign statute in question (see <em>Pacific
                        Recreation</em> at [79]). I pause to observe that it is somewhat
                    ironic that <em>Pacific Recreation</em> was repeatedly
                    cited by HKC to remind the opposing experts of their <em>duties</em> to the court even though the more important lesson to be
                    extracted from <em>Pacific Recreation</em> concerned the
                        <em>role</em> of experts in the proof of foreign
                    law.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The limited role of the foreign law expert in the construction of
                private documents</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_164"></a>164    It is important to note for present
                    purposes, however, that the foreign law expert’s role is more
                    circumscribed where he is asked to provide the court with an opinion concerning
                    the construction of a private document. In such circumstances, expert evidence
                    is only admissible for the “limited purpose” of identifying the
                    relevant foreign law principles of construction and <em>not</em> for the additional purpose of expressing an opinion as to
                    the true construction applying those principles (see <em>Phipson
                        on Evidence</em> (Hodge M Malek gen ed) (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 18th Ed,
                    2013) at para 33-83; see also Richard Fentiman, <em>International

                    6.39). This nuanced distinction was also recognised by the Court of Appeal in

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_165"></a>165    The proposition set out by Waller LJ in

                    Lloyd’s Rep 655 in the passage above has been repeatedly endorsed by the
                    English courts (see, <em>eg</em>, <em>Rendall v Combined Insurance Co of America</em> [2005] EWHC 678
                    (Comm) at [68]; <em>Commissioners for Her Majesty’s Revenue

                    [2012] EWHC 1807 (Ch) at [41]). A good illustration of its application can be
                    seen in <em>Rouyer Guillet Et Compagnie v Rouyer Guillet &amp; Co
                        Ltd</em> [1949] 1 All ER 244. There, the defendants were English
                    companies which had applied to stay an action for passing off against them
                    commenced by the plaintiff French company. The applications essentially turned
                    on the construction of two sources of foreign law: (a) a 1925 French statute;
                    and (b) a document which was, in effect, the articles of association of the
                    French company. Expert evidence was adduced in respect of both these matters and
                    what is particularly instructive is the different treatment accorded to each of
                    them by the English Court of Appeal. This can be seen in the speech of Lord
                    Greene MR (with whom Somervell and Evershed LJJ agreed) at 244:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<em>I must make it clear that the evidence of French law is
                            subject to </em>
<b><em>a certain differentiation
                            </em></b>
<em>as between the evidence of the meaning of
                            the law of 1925 and the evidence of the meaning of the
                            articles.</em> As I understand the law of England, evidence as to
                        the meaning of the statute is to be obtained from the evidence of expert
                        French witnesses and the decisions of the French courts. On a matter of
                        French law the decision of a French court would be most persuasive.
                            <em>On the other hand</em>, <b><em>evidence on the construction of a private document, such as articles of

                            technical terms, but evidence as to its meaning after those aids have
                            been taken into account is not admissible. It is for the court to
                            construe the document, having fortified itself with the permissible

                        italics]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_166"></a>166    The origin of the principle as articulated
                    above appears to stretch back to the early case of <em>The
                        Duchess Di Sora v AL Phillipps and others, executors, etc</em> (1863)
                    10 HLC 624 (“<em>Di Sora</em>”). In <em>Di Sora</em>, the court had to construe a particular article
                    in a pre-nuptial agreement executed in Rome in the Italian language between
                    parties domiciled there. Many Italian witnesses were examined at the first
                    instance hearing in order to elucidate the legal meaning and effect of this
                    single article. When the matter came up before the House of Lords, however, it
                    was noted that there appeared to be some confusion over the role of expert
                    opinion in the construction of a foreign private document. This state of
                    relative uncertainty was neatly summed up in the opening passages of Lord
                    Chelmsford’s speech at 636–637:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">My Lords, this case, in which the evidence fills so large a volume, and
                        which has occupied so many days in hearing the arguments only of the counsel
                        for the Appellants, turns upon the construction of one short clause in a
                        written contract executed in a foreign country. Hence has arisen the
                        necessity of having recourse to witnesses skilled in the law of that
                        country, in order to assist the English Judge in his duty of construing the
                        clause in question. This necessity has given rise to a controversy at the
                        bar as to the extent to which the Judge requires and is bound to accept the
                        opinions of these skilled witnesses. The limits within which experts in
                        foreign law (always assuming their credibility), are to be authoritative in
                        cases in which their aid is required, seem never to have been exactly
                        defined. …</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… [It] is said on one side, that upon a question of the
                        construction of a contract, the province of the witnesses ought to be
                        confined to giving information as to the law of the country applicable to
                        the case, and as to the sense of words and phrases in the instrument which
                        bear a peculiar or technical meaning, or which, taken together, require a
                        peculiar construction, and that the mind of the Judge will then be
                        sufficiently instructed to enable him to assume the office of construction
                        which properly belongs to him.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">On the other side it is contended that the skilled witnesses must be the
                        guides of the Judge, and must lead him by the hand throughout; that they
                        must not only inform his mind as to the law, but must teach him the correct
                        construction of the instrument itself. …</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_167"></a>167    Lord Chelmsford then went on to explain why,
                    of the two contrasting approaches as set out above, the latter was wrong in
                    principle. In his view, the true construction to be placed on a private document
                    was a question of law to be answered by the judge who would, if he merely
                    adopted the views of the foreign experts uncritically, be derelict in his
                    duties. Viewed in this manner, the role of the expert must therefore be confined
                    to the giving of evidence on the <em>content</em> of the
                    foreign law, such as the relevant rules of construction. As Lord Chelmsford
                    stated at 638–639 of <em>Di Sora</em>:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…
                        <em>[I]t is difficult to understand how the construction of a
                            contract can be a question of fact. The construction of a contract is
                            nothing more than the gathering of the intention of the parties to it
                            from the words they have used.</em> If the law applicable to the
                        case has ascribed a peculiar meaning to particular words, the parties using
                        them must be bound to that meaning; but if there is no such established
                        sense, the intention must be collected in the ordinary manner from the
                        language employed, and we know from experience that different minds often
                        arrive at opposite conclusions of intention from the same expressions.
                            <b><em>The meaning of a foreign instrument, therefore
                            (cleared of the difficulty of technical terms), cannot be a fact to be
                            proved; it is at the utmost merely a probable opinion of the witnesses
                            as to the construction which would be likely to be put upon it by the
                            foreign tribunal. And if the Judge is implicitly to receive the opinion
                            of the witnesses, or of the majority of them, they in fact perform his
                            office, and construe the instrument for him.</em></b></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…
                        <b><em>The office of construction of a written instrument,

                            person's assistance. In the first place he must have a translation of

                        witness as to the meaning and also the grammatical construction of the
                        words. <em>He must then have the way cleared for him by
                            explanatory evidence, of any words which are of a technical description,
                            or which have a peculiar meaning, different from that which, literally
                            translated into our language, they would bear; and, if there is any
                            established principle of construction of the particular instrument by
                            the foreign tribunal, proof of it must be given.</em><b><em>But the witnesses having supplied the Judge with all
                            these facts, they must retire and leave his sufficiently informed mind

                            intention of the parties; or, in other words, of construing the language

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added in italics and in bold italics]</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The quality of the expert evidence in the present case</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_168"></a>168    Armed with a proper appreciation of the
                    foreign law expert’s role, especially in the context of construing private
                    documents, I turn now to consider the opinions of the three Korean law experts
                    here to determine whether the experts had kept within their remit.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_169"></a>169    In <em>Wu Yang Construction
                        Group Ltd v Zhejiang Jinyi Group Co, Ltd and others</em> [2006] 4
                    SLR(R) 451 at [14], Andrew Phang Boon Leong J (as he then was) stated that the
                    ability of the (domestic) court to make an informed decision on a question
                    determinable by reference to foreign law “is dependent largely on the
                    quality of the expert evidence adduced”. It should be clear by now that I
                    was less than impressed by the quality of the expert opinions in the present
                    case. Round after round of opinions were filed but, each time, they were wide
                    off the mark in terms of what <em>should</em> have been
                    addressed. There was little attempt by any of the experts to put forward and
                    explain the sources of foreign law which they were relying on to aid the
                    court’s construction of the Lease Agreement, ATA and NCT, but where they
                    did cite such foreign sources of law, for example to establish the validity of
                    the ATA, this turned out to be irrelevant. To put it bluntly, the experts were
                    offering their personal views of the matter instead of assisting this court with
                    evidence of the content of foreign law. In <em>The
                        “H156”</em> [1999] 2 SLR(R) 419, G P Selvam J noted
                    perceptively at [14] that the expert opinion there consisted only of “one
                    judgmental sentence” which was also unaccompanied by any propositions of
                    foreign law or foreign materials to support the expert’s conclusion. In
                    these circumstances, Selvam J witheringly described the expert’s report at
                    [27] as a mere “pretended opinion” and held that any reliance
                    placed on it would be “completely misconceived because there was no
                    opinion before the court”. In my view, Selvam J’s observations are
                    equally applicable in the present case.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_170"></a>170    To compound matters, the experts’
                    opinions here were not only problematic for what they lacked but also for what
                    they contained. In my view, the experts were effectively making <em>submissions</em> on what the true construction of the
                    relevant documents should be. In doing so, they had clearly overstepped their
                    role which, as I have explained, is limited only to the provision of the rules
                    of construction under Korean law. For example, it was not for Prof Kim to opine
                    on the meaning of the terms “right” and “status” as
                    used in the NCT and to conclude that incorporated within these terms was
                    precisely the right to terminate the Lease Agreement as HKC hoped to establish.
                    Neither was it for Mr Kyung and Mr Choi to interpret the requirements of Art
                    24(2) of the Lease Agreement and conclude that the 4 April Notice was
                    deficient by reference to those requirements. They merely expressed their own
                    views on these issues without attempting to provide the court with any source of
                    Korean law in aid of their conclusions.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_171"></a>171    To clarify, I am not suggesting that the
                    experts were necessarily wrong in their submissions. All I am saying is that
                    this is not the role of the foreign law expert. It is the court’s duty to
                    determine the correct construction of a private document but, unfortunately, the
                    parties appeared not to have appreciated this point. The protracted battle over
                    the expert opinions (which dominated the hearings below) only served to prolong
                    matters unnecessarily and at great cost. It is hoped that, in future, such a
                    misunderstanding on the role of foreign law experts will not be repeated. Having
                    said that, it is the duty of the Singapore instructing counsel to apprise the
                    foreign law experts of their limited and targeted role.</p>
