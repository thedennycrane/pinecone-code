class="font-weight-bold">Introduction</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">1 These reasons concern the costs of certain proceedings both at trial and on appeal. In the proceedings from which the present appeal was brought, CPIT Investments Ltd (“CPIT”) brought claims against Qilin World Capital Ltd (“Qilin”) arising from a loan agreement (“the Loan Agreement”) secured by certain shares.  CPIT asserted that Qilin had wrongfully disposed of these shares when it was not entitled to do so under the Loan Agreement, and thus held the proceeds on constructive trust for CPIT. On 17 July 2017, the learned trial judge (Vivian Ramsey IJ) made an order that Qilin held HK$31.25m on constructive trust for CPIT and granted related relief.  But he also dismissed CPIT’s claim that Qilin’s conduct had caused a very large fall in the value of certain other shares owned by CPIT which were not used as security for the loan  (see <span class="font-italic">CPIT </span><span class="font-italic">Investments Ltd v Qilin World Capital Ltd</span> [2017] 5 SLR 1 (“<span class="font-italic">CPIT v </span><span class="font-italic">Qilin (trial judgment)</span>”).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 By Civil Appeal No 126 of 2017 (“CA 126”), Qilin appealed against the orders relating to the constructive trust. By Civil Appeal No 145 of 2017 (“CA 145”), CPIT appealed against the order rejecting its claim that Qilin was responsible for the fall in the value of its shares.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">3 On 5 March 2018, the trial judge made costs orders reflecting CPIT’s success before him. He ordered Qilin to pay S$47,906.20 by way of costs and disbursements for interlocutory applications, S$384,000.00 as costs for the rest of the proceedings, and S$28,600.26 plus HK$648,427.57 as disbursements for the proceedings, excluding interlocutory applications (see <span class="font-italic">CPIT Investments Ltd v </span><span class="font-italic">Qilin World Capital Ltd</span> [2018] SGHC(I) 02 (“<span class="font-italic">CPIT v </span><span class="font-italic">Qilin (costs judgment)</span>”)).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">4 On 6 March 2018, this court allowed Qilin’s appeal and dismissed CPIT’s appeal (see <span class="font-italic">Qilin</span><span class="font-italic"> World Capital Ltd v CPIT Investments Ltd</span> [2018] SGCA(I) 01).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">5 That disposed of all issues between the parties except costs.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The submissions of the parties</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">6 On 23 April 2018, CPIT’s solicitors informed Qilin’s solicitors that on 20 April 2018 they had been discharged as CPIT’s solicitors and they had no instructions to file costs submissions on behalf of CPIT.  On 24 April 2018, Qilin’s solicitors filed written submissions concerning costs. Thereafter, the Registry informed CPIT by letter that if it had any views on the issue of costs, it should provide these views to the court by 21 June 2018. No response was received. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">7 It is desirable at the outset to note that in their letter of 23 April 2018, CPIT’s solicitors contended in effect that it was not open to Qilin to seek the costs, or all the costs, of the proceedings at trial. They requested Qilin’s solicitors to bring the following points to this court’s attention, which they have done: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The direction from the Court of Appeal on 10 April 2018 was for parties to deal with the question of costs of the appeals. It did not include the costs of the proceedings below, which was not the subject of Qilin’s Notice of Appeal in CA 126.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The trial judge held that Qilin was in breach of the terms of the Loan Agreement by disposing of the shares used as security (see <span class="font-italic">CPIT v </span><span class="font-italic">Qilin (trial judgment) </span>at [79] and [91]).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) The trial judge also found that Qilin was in repudiatory breach of the Loan Agreement and that CPIT was entitled to terminate the Loan Agreement as it did on 4 January 2016. Qilin did not appeal against this finding.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) The trial judge dismissed Qilin’s counterclaim for loss arising from CPIT’s allegedly wrongful repudiation of the Loan Agreement. Qilin did not appeal against this finding.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) Apart from the fact that Qilin’s counterclaim had been dismissed, the Court of Appeal only ordered CPIT to return the money that Qilin had paid to CPIT pursuant to the lower Court’s judgment in favour of CPIT. CPIT’s solicitors suggested this was relevant to how costs would be affected by an offer to settle made by Qilin on 29 November 2016.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">8 It is desirable to put to one side an interesting question: do persons who were once solicitors for a party to litigation but have since been discharged have any entitlement to be heard?</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">9 As to point (a), the fact that the costs of the first instance proceedings were absent from Qilin’s Notice of Appeal is not surprising. The Notice of Appeal was filed on 20 July 2017.  The decision of the trial judge on costs was published on 5 March 2018. Despite the fact that the costs of the proceedings below are not mentioned in the Notice of Appeal, the court is entitled and empowered to deal with the costs of the proceedings below. Even if the Notice of Appeal is to be regarded as deficient in this respect, it is a deficiency which could readily be cured by amendment. In the circumstances an amendment is not necessary.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">10 As to points (b)-(d), these factors do not deal with the fact that the result of Qilin’s appeal was to deprive CPIT entirely of the fruits of its victory at trial. The fact that certain findings were made against Qilin, and the fact that no appeal was brought in these respects by Qilin, overlooks the difficulties that appeals are made against orders, not findings. The orders of the trial judge in favour of CPIT have been set aside. The failure of Qilin in some respects at trial was not such as to justify departing from the principle that, <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span>, costs follow the event. Nevertheless, Qilin’s failure in relation to certain aspects of its case will be considered in relation to one of Qilin’s arguments (see [23]–[24] below).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">11 Point (e) will be referred to later.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The trial judge’s costs orders</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">12 In dealing with the issue of costs, the trial judge issued a closely reasoned judgment which contains a careful exposition of the principles applicable to costs in the Singapore International Commercial Court. These reasons for judgment on costs should not be read as taking issue with the trial judge’s reasoning on costs. They simply have a different starting point. His reasoning on costs begins with a particular view of how the substantive issues in the litigation should be resolved. This court’s reasoning begins with a different view of how the substantive issues should be resolved.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">13 It is worth noting that, with regard to the costs of the proceedings at first instance, Qilin has sought to be compensated in amounts which are substantially similar to those awarded by the trial judge to CPIT, subject to adjustments to reflect its success on appeal.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">14 Qilin’s success in its appeal has the consequence that the trial judge’s costs orders in favour of CPIT must be set aside, subject to any material consideration urged by CPIT to the contrary. Since nothing has been urged apart from the five points summarised above, there is no reason why the trial judge’s costs orders should not be set aside. It is now necessary to examine what orders should be made in their place.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Interlocutory applications</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">15 There were six interlocutory applications where costs were ordered to be in the cause. The sums claimed by Qilin correspond with those ordered by the trial judge in favour of CPIT after the conclusion of the trial, save in relation to one component.  It is reasonable to uphold Qilin’s claim, save in relation to that component. The component concerns High Court Summons No 171 of 2016 (“SUM 171”). In disposing of that application, the trial judge awarded CPIT S$2,000 in costs and S$400 in disbursements.  Qilin submitted that it should be awarded S$3,500 in costs and S$550 in disbursements. Qilin submitted that the trial judge’s award of S$2,000 plus S$400 in disbursements to CPIT was reduced from CPIT’s claim for S$3,000 plus S$494 “given that the application related to the <span class="font-italic">alter ego </span>argument that had been dismissed in the Merits Judgment”. Qilin continued: “Having won on appeal, Qilin is entitled to increased costs and disbursements because it had to address the <span class="font-italic">alter ego </span>arguments that were dismissed in the Merits Judgment”.  In our view, Qilin is not entitled to any costs at all for SUM 171. That involved an application by CPIT for leave to serve the writ and statement of claim out of the jurisdiction. Naturally, Qilin did not appear at this hearing. It made no submissions. It filed no affidavits. It incurred no costs. It is also unclear what basis Qilin has for contending that it is entitled to S$550 in disbursements. So far as Qilin incurred costs on the <span class="font-italic">alter ego </span>issue at the trial, there is no reason why the relatively low figures involved should not be treated as subsumed in the overall costs order for the proceedings at first instance excluding the interlocutory applications. Hence Qilin is entitled to the costs and disbursements ordered by the trial judge to CPIT below, save for those relating to SUM 171. This totals S$41,500 in costs and S$4,022 in disbursements.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Pre-trial conferences and case management conferences</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">16 In relation to pre-trial conferences and case management conferences, Qilin claimed a total of S$11,500 in costs. It claimed S$500 for each of the seven pre-trial conferences, S$1,000 for each of five case management conferences held before trial, and S$3,000 for one case management conference held after trial for the purpose of the parties making submissions on costs.  Given the length and nature of the proceedings, these claims are reasonable. Hence Qilin’s claim for S$11,500 succeeds.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Other proceedings at first instance</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">17 Qilin sought costs in the sum of S$50,000 for the proceedings in the High Court up until 28 June 2016, when the dispute was transferred to the SICC. The trial judge felt it was appropriate to award CPIT S$50,000 for this period, but deducted S$5,000 from this sum to account for the aspects of CPIT’s claim which had failed (see <span class="font-italic">CPIT v </span><span class="font-italic">Qilin (costs judgment) </span>at [45]). It is reasonable to award Qilin S$50,000 in respect of this period, given that it has successfully resisted all of CPIT’s claims.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">18 Qilin sought costs in the sum of S$206,000 for the period from 28 June 2016 up to the commencement of the trial on 13 December 2016.  The trial judge awarded CPIT S$210,500 for the same period (see <span class="font-italic">CPIT v </span><span class="font-italic">Qilin (costs judgment) </span>at [46] and [47]).  Qilin’s claim is thus reasonable and is accepted.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">19 Qilin also sought costs in the sum of S$300,000 for trial and post-trial matters. The trial judge awarded CPIT only S$128,500 for the equivalent period (see <span class="font-italic">CPIT v </span><span class="font-italic">Qilin (costs judgment) </span>at [47]).  Two factors support the size of Qilin’s claim, at least to a degree.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">20 One factor is that Qilin incurred the costs of engaging Senior Counsel. The complexity of the case and the size of the sums in dispute justified that course.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">21 The second factor is that the trial judge was dealing with a state of affairs in which CPIT had defeated Qilin on one issue, but Qilin had won on a claim involving a much greater monetary sum. This court has to deal with a state of affairs in which Qilin’s defeat on the first issue has been reversed, but its victory on the second issue has been confirmed. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">22 Qilin also relied on two other factors. One is that at trial it “had to address a greater number of issues, <span class="font-italic">eg</span>, the <span class="font-italic">alter ego</span> issue”.  The other supposed “issues” are not specified. No allowance should be made for them. Some allowance should be made for the <span class="font-italic">alter ego </span>issue. It is included in the figure of S$225,000 awarded below.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">23 The other factor on which Qilin relied to justify its claim for S$300,000 was that “the costs should reflect that Qilin had made CPIT an offer to settle”. The offer was made on 29 November 2016, shortly before the trial began. Qilin’s submissions were very brief: “as CPIT has obtained a judgment not more favourable than the terms of the [offer to settle], the [c]ourt should take into consideration the [offer to settle] in awarding costs”.  The submission did not explain how the judgment was not more favourable to CPIT than the offer to settle, or, cast another way, that the judgment was more favourable to Qilin than its offer to settle. The offer to settle required CPIT to pay HK$1.25m in interest;  the outcome of the proceedings is that CPIT is not required to do this. In that respect, the outcome was less favourable to Qilin than the offer to settle. The offer to settle also required CPIT to relinquish its claims on the remaining shares used as security for the Loan Agreement which Qilin had not disposed of.  In that respect, the outcome of the proceedings is about the same as that of the offer to settle, had it been accepted. The offer to settle also required each party to bear its own costs.  In this respect the outcome of the proceeding is much worse for CPIT than the offer to settle.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 It might be possible to demonstrate that Qilin has achieved an outcome more favourable than the terms of the offer to settle to a degree sufficient to justify an increase in Qilin’s recoverable costs. But Qilin did not attempt to demonstrate this with any clarity. It did not deal with point (e) in the letter from CPIT’s solicitors dated 23 April 2018. If CPIT had accepted Qilin’s offer, Qilin would have received HK$1.25m in interest (S$210,000), but it would have had to bear its own costs to that point. Qilin has not revealed what its <span class="font-italic">actual </span>costs were, but its claim for S$206,000 up to 13 December 2016 is being upheld. That suggests that acceptance of Qilin’s offer by CPIT would have left Qilin bearing a loss, given that it would also have had to bear the costs of the interlocutory steps where costs had been ordered to be in the cause up to the date of acceptance. Another matter is that the basis of Qilin’s offer has not been vindicated by events. The basis of the offer was that Qilin was entitled to keep selling the shares used to secure the loan, while also receiving some interest under the Loan Agreement. Yet the trial judge found that Qilin was in breach of the Loan Agreement and that CPIT was entitled to terminate it.  His conclusions on these points were not challenged on appeal.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 In all the circumstances, it is not possible to conclude that Qilin has established that the outcome of the proceedings is so significantly superior to Qilin’s offer as to justify an increase in the costs otherwise recoverable.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 The claim that Qilin receive S$300,000 in relation to the costs of the first instance proceedings for the period from the commencement of the trial is rejected. A reasonable figure is S$225,000.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Disbursements arising from the first instance proceedings</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 Qilin claims S$28,600.26 as disbursements for the proceedings below excluding interlocutory applications.  This sum is reasonable, since it corresponds with the amount allowed to CPIT by the trial judge.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 Qilin also claims S$74,000 for the costs of engaging an expert on the value of CPIT’s shares.  That sum is reasonable.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 Qilin also claims HK$1,328,089.94 and US$94,897.40 in legal fees for advice on Hong Kong law from Reed Smith LLP and FisherBroyles LLP respectively. This claim amounts to about S$350,000.00. CPIT only claimed about HK$25,000 (or S$4,200) in legal fees for advice on Hong Kong law.  Qilin did not explain how it came to incur such high costs for advice on Hong Kong law. Nor did it clarify which aspects of the proceedings below required extensive advice on Hong Kong law. Apart from brief references in relation to stamp duties in Hong Kong, the trial judge did not mention Hong Kong law in the trial judgment. Given these uncertainties, the court declines to fix the amount of disbursements and instead proposes to order that they be taxed if not agreed.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Costs of CA 126</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 Qilin claims S$70,000.  That seems reasonable.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 Qilin also claims disbursements of S$65,218.17.  The bulk of that sum comprises a figure of S$52,000 in estimated hearing fees,   but the size of this claim has not been explained.

<p><strong><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">Case summary</span></strong></p>
<p><em><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">Qilin World Capital Limited v CPIT Investments Limited </span></em><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">[2018] SGCA(I) <span style="color: black;">04</span><em><br/>
Civil Appeals Nos 126 and 145 of 2017</em></span></p>
<p><font face="Calibri">--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</font></p>
<p><strong><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">Decision of the Court of Appeal (delivered by International Judge Dyson Heydon):</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">Background to the appeal</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">1          CPIT Investments Limited (“CPIT”) brought claims against Qilin World Capital Ltd (“Qilin”) arising from loans made under a loan agreement (“the Loan Agreement”) secured by certain shares. CPIT claimed that Qilin had wrongfully disposed of these shares in breach of the Loan Agreement, and thus held the proceeds on constructive trust for CPIT. In <em>CPIT Investments Ltd v Qilin World Capital Ltd </em>[2017] 5 SLR 1, the learned trial judge, Vivian Ramsey IJ, found that Qilin held HK$31.25m on constructive trust for CPIT. However, he also dismissed CPIT’s claim that Qilin’s conduct caused a large fall in the value of certain other shares owned by CPIT which were not used as security for the loan.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">2          Qilin appealed against the orders relating to the constructive trust. CPIT appealed against the order rejecting its claim that Qilin was responsible for the fall in value of its other shares which were not used as security for the loan.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">3          Shortly before the Court of Appeal issued its judgment on Qilin’s appeal and CPIT’s cross appeal, the trial judge issued his decision on the costs of the proceedings at first instance (see <em>CPIT Investments Ltd v Qilin World Capital Ltd </em>[2018] SGHC(I) 02). He ordered Qilin to pay CPIT a total of S$431,906.20 in costs and S$28,600.26 plus HK$648,427.57 in disbursements.  </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">4          On 6 March 2018, the Court of Appeal issued its judgment on Qilin’s appeal and CPIT’s cross appeal in <em>Qilin World Capital Ltd v CPIT Investments Ltd </em>[2018] SGCA(I) 01. The court reversed the trial judge’s finding that Qilin held HK$31.25m on constructive trust for CPIT. It also upheld the trial judge’s finding that Qilin did not cause the fall in the value of CPIT’s shares. The result was that CPIT failed entirely to obtain any compensation from Qilin.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">5          The present judgment dealt with the costs and disbursements of the appeals, as well as the costs and disbursements of the proceedings at first instance.</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">Decision on costs</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><em><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">The proceedings at first instance</span></em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">6          With regard to the costs of the proceedings at first instance, the Court of Appeal noted that the trial judge had issued a closely reasoned judgment on costs which contained a careful exposition of the principles applicable to costs in the Singapore International Commercial Court (“SICC”). The court did not take issue with the trial judge’s reasoning in this regard. However, the trial judge’s costs orders were made on the basis that CPIT had been partially successful in its claims. It was necessary to set aside the trial judge’s costs orders, in light of the fact that CPIT’s claims had failed entirely, following Qilin’s successful appeal (at <strong>[12]–[14]</strong>).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">7          The court noted that, with regard to several aspects of the proceedings at first instance, Qilin had sought to be compensated in amounts that were substantially similar to those ordered by the trial judge in favour of CPIT. With regard to these aspects of the proceedings at first instance, the court found that the costs sought by Qilin were generally reasonable and awarded Qilin the following:</span></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
<li style="color: #000000; font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif; font-size: 11pt; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal;">
<p style="text-align: justify; color: #000000; font-family: 'Calibri',sans-serif; font-size: 11pt; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">S$41,500 in costs and S$4,022 in disbursements in respect of the six interlocutory applications where costs had been in the cause (at <strong>[15]</strong>);</span></p>
</li>
<li style="color: #000000; font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif; font-size: 11pt; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal;">
<p style="text-align: justify; color: #000000; font-family: 'Calibri',sans-serif; font-size: 11pt; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">S$50,000 in costs for the proceedings in the Singapore High Court from commencement until 28 June 2016, when the matter was transferred to the SICC (at <strong>[17]</strong>);</span></p>
</li>
<li style="color: #000000; font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif; font-size: 11pt; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal;">
<p style="text-align: justify; color: #000000; font-family: 'Calibri',sans-serif; font-size: 11pt; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">S$206,000 in costs for the proceedings from 28 June 2016 up until commencement of the trial on 13 December 2016 (at <strong>[18]</strong>);</span></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">8          The court also found that Qilin was reasonable in seeking costs of S$11,500 for pre-trial conferences and case management conferences, and awarded Qilin this sum (at <strong>[16]</strong>).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">9          With respect to the trial itself and post-trial matters, Qilin had sought costs in the sum of S$300,000, whereas the trial judge awarded CPIT only S$128,500 for the equivalent period. The Court of Appeal found that the size of Qilin’s claim was partly supported by the fact that it had reasonably engaged the services of a Senior Counsel, given the complexity of the case and the large sums in dispute (at <strong>[20]</strong>). It was also supported by the fact that Qilin had succeeded entirely in resisting CPIT’s claims (at <strong>[21]</strong>). However, the court found that an offer to settle made by Qilin to CPIT did not justify an increase in the costs otherwise recoverable. The outcome of the proceedings was not significantly more favourable to Qilin compared to the terms of its offer. Further, the basis of the offer, which assumed that Qilin had not breached the Loan Agreement and was still entitled to receive interest, had not been vindicated by the outcome of the proceedings (at <strong>[25]</strong>). Taking the circumstances in the round, the court awarded Qilin S$225,000 in costs for the trial and post-trial proceedings (at <strong>[26]</strong>).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">10        With respect to disbursements, the court granted Qilin’s claims for S$28,600.26 in standard disbursements, and S$74,000 for the costs of engaging an expert on the value of CPIT’s shares (at <strong>[27]–[28]</strong>). However, it was unclear how Qilin had incurred some HK$1,328,089.94 and US$94,897.40 in legal fees for advice on Hong Kong law, and the court ordered that these disbursements be taxed if not agreed (at <strong>[29]</strong>).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">The appeals</span></em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">11        The court found that Qilin’s claims for S$70,000 and S$100,000 in costs (for Qilin’s own appeal and CPIT’s cross appeal, respectively) were reasonable and awarded Qilin the sums it sought (at <strong>[30] </strong>and <strong>[32]</strong>). However, the size of the sums sought by Qilin as disbursements for the appeals had not been adequately explained and the court ordered that these be taxed if not agreed (at <strong>[31] </strong>and <strong>[32]</strong>).</span></p>
