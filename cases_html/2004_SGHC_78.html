</p>
<p class="Judg-Author" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">Kan Ting Chiu J:</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">1          This action arises out of a joint venture between the two parties in this action to provide horizontal directional drilling technology and services in India.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">2          The defendant, Romar Positioning Equipment Pte Ltd, is a Singapore company which has contacts with a company in India, Reliance Engineering &amp; Associates Private Ltd (“Reliance”), which was looking for providers of specialised drilling technology and services. The plaintiff, Merriwa Pty Ltd, is an Australian company with the relevant know-how.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">3          The plaintiff and the defendant agreed that the defendant alone would contract with Reliance, but the contracted works and services were to be done by the plaintiff and the defendant. The plaintiff and the defendant entered into two agreements on 1 December 2000, a Service Agreement and a Partnership Project Agreement.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">4          The plaintiff’s action against the defendant is that the latter failed to discharge its obligation under cl 2.3 of the Service Agreement which provided that:</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">(a)        In consideration for [the plaintiff] as equal (gain or loss) partner in the partnership in providing the contractor’s representatives, [the defendant] agrees to pay [the plaintiff] an amount equal to all payments received by [the defendant] reduced by the reasonable expenses incurred by [the defendant], then divided by two (2). (ie. A 50/50 partnership)</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">(b)        Within 3 business days after [the defendant] receives payment under paragraph 2.3 of the special conditions for on-site services of the contractor’s representatives [the defendant] will provide to [the plaintiff];</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">(i)         the details of all monies received and all reasonable expenses incurred by it under the Head Contract; and</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">(ii)        a cheque in payment of half of the net amount in accordance with clause 2.3(a) hereof.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">and the plaintiff sought accounts from the defendant.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><strong>The defence</strong></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">5          Just one defence was raised, that parties have entered into a Deed of Settlement and Release (“the deed”) on 8 February 2002 which constituted a satisfaction and discharge of the plaintiff’s claim.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">6          The defence pleaded was that:</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">9          On or about 8<sup>th</sup> February 2002, after Jonathan Lim [managing director of the defendant] had returned from Perth, the Plaintiffs and the Defendants entered into a Deed of Settlement and Release for a sum of US$325,000.00 in settlement of all claims, demands, suits proceedings, rights and causes of action whether present or accruing at any time in the future in respect of or howsoever connected with the Service Agreement dated 1<sup>st</sup> December, 2000.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">10         In pursuant [<i>sic</i>] of the Deed of Settlement and Release, the Defendants made payments of US$250,000.00 on 8<sup>th</sup> February 2002 and US$50,000.00 on 31<sup>st</sup> May 2002.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">11         On 31<sup>st</sup> July 2002, the Defendants purchased a bank draft for US$25,000.00 being the final payment to the Defendants under the Deed of Settlement and Release. However, the Plaintiffs had refused to accept payment and attempted to repudiate the said Deed.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">12         In the premises, by reason of the Deed of Settlement and Release, there has been satisfaction and discharge of the Plaintiffs’ alleged cause/s of actions.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><strong>The deed</strong></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">7          Clauses 1, 2 and 7 of the deed provided that:</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">1          [The defendant] agrees that it shall pay or cause to be paid to [the plaintiff] (or such person or company as may be nominated by James Johnson [managing director of the plaintiff] for and on behalf of [the plaintiff] the sum of USD Three Hundred and Twenty Five Thousand (US$325,000.00) which sum shall be paid to the nominee in the follow manner</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">(a)        the sum of USD$250,000.00 upon the signing of this agreement</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">(b)        the sum of USD$50,000.00 on or before 31 May 2002</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">(c)        the sum of USD$25,000.00 on or before 31 July 2002</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">2          In consideration of each of the parties entering into this Deed and <i>upon the final payment referred to in clause 1</i> above each party will release and discharge each other party from and against all claims, demands, suits, proceedings, rights and causes of action whether present or accruing at any time in the future in respect of or how so ever connected with the Agreement.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">7          The parties acknowledge that <i>this agreement is not effective until all funds referred to in clause 1 and 2 above have been received</i> into [the plaintiff’s] solicitors bank account and confirmation of that receipt has been provided by [the plaintiff’s] solicitors.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">[emphasis added]</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">8          The deed was entered into at a meeting between Jonathan Lim Keng Hock, the defendant’s managing director, and James Robert Johnson, the plaintiff’s managing director.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">9          The plaintiff pleaded in para 21 of its statement of claim that by a letter through its solicitors dated 29 July 2002, it gave notice to the defendant that it no longer considered itself bound by the deed.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">10        The defendant’s position is that it received the letter of 29 July on 2 August 2002</span><a href="#_ftn1" id="_ftnref1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span lang="EN-GB"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span lang="EN-GB">[1]</span></span></span></span></a><span lang="EN-GB">.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><strong>The evidence</strong></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">11        It was not disputed that the defendant had made the first two payments under cl 1 of the deed.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">12        The payment of the third payment presented greater difficulties for the Defence.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">13        The wording of para 11 of the defence gave a hint of the difficulties. The assertion that the defendant had purchased a bank draft for US$25,000 on 31 July 2002 is curious because the defendant’s obligation was not to obtain the bank draft, but to pay the plaintiff. Perhaps it is intended to imply that payment was tendered, but no payment was tendered.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">14        The contemporaneous documents revealed more about the third payment. On 28 June 2002 the defendant’s solicitors wrote to the plaintiff’s solicitors that the last payment was conditional upon the defendant receiving a copy of the deed executed by the plaintiff.</span><a href="#_ftn2" id="_ftnref2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span lang="EN-GB"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span lang="EN-GB">[2]</span></span></span></span></a> <span lang="EN-GB">The defendant or its solicitors probably gave further thought to the correctness of this assertion, as it was not raised in the pleaded defence.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">15        On 1 August 2002 (one day after the date for the last payment and one day before the receipt of the letter dated 29 July), they wrote again to the plaintiff’s solicitors to inform them that a banker’s draft for US$25,000 had been issued, and would be released to them in exchange for the executed deed.</span><a href="#_ftn3" id="_ftnref3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span lang="EN-GB"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span lang="EN-GB">[3]</span></span></span></span></a> <span lang="EN-GB">There was no evidence that the draft was tendered to the plaintiff or its solicitors at any time.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">16        In the light of this evidence paras 11 and 12 of the defence were not made out as there was no payment or tender or rejection on 31 July 2002.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">17        It was not pleaded or submitted on behalf of the defendant that cll 2 and 7 of the deed should not bear their literal and unambiguous meaning. From my reading, I have no reason to hold that they should not.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">18        It is not clear from the arguments whether the defendant takes the position that the letter of 29 July relieved it from making the last payment on 31 July. To sustain the defence, the following questions must be addressed:</span></p>
<p class="Judg-2" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">(a)        Did the letter received on 2 August have any bearing on the defendant’s failure to pay on 31 July?</span></p>
<p class="Judg-2" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">(b)        If it had a bearing, did the defendant accept that the deed was no longer binding?</span></p>
<p class="Judg-2" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">(c)        If the defendant accepted that the deed was no longer binding, can it rely on the deed as a defence?</span></p>
<p class="Judg-2" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">(d)        If the defendant did not accept that the deed was no longer binding, can it ignore the express requirements of cll 2 and 7 and rely on the deed as a defence?</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">19        On the evidence before me, the answers are all “no”. The defence appears to be that the deed continues to be effective despite the non-compliance with cl 1(c) and the specific provision of cl 7, without resolving the contradiction or justifying the stance.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">20        In the circumstances, the defence relying on the deed failed on the facts and in law, and judgment was entered in favour of the plaintiff with costs.</span></p>
