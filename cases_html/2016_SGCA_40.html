In the case of a condominium project, besides the <span class="font-italic">developer</span>, there will be professionals like the architects who design the project and the main contractor who undertakes to build the project in accordance with the approved plans. Various sub-contractors who carry out specific areas of work relating to the project (<span class="font-italic">eg</span>, piling, electrical, plumbing <span class="font-italic">etc</span>) are also often involved.  Under the Building Control Act (Cap 29, 1999 Rev Ed) (“BCA”), the developer is required to appoint a <span class="font-italic">builder</span>, who is the main contractor, “to carry out [the] building works” (s 8(1)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>)) and an <span class="font-italic">architect</span> “to prepare the plans of the building works in accordance with the Act” (unless an architect has been appointed by the builder) (s 8(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)).  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 In the normal course of events, unless the developer wishes to retain the residential units in the condominium as an investment <br/>(for example, by leasing the units out and collecting rent), he will place the units on the market for sale to potential home buyers. Every buyer who purchases a unit from the developer will enter into a contract of sale and purchase with the developer. Upon completion of the development, each buyer of a unit becomes a subsidiary proprietor. All the subsidiary proprietors of a development will eventually form the <span class="font-italic">management corporation</span> of that condominium development (or, to be precise, the strata title plan) (s 10A of the Land Titles (Strata) Act (Cap 158, 2009 Rev Ed)). The management corporation may “sue and be sued in respect of any matter affecting the common property” (s 24(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the Building Maintenance and Strata Management Act (Cap 30C, 2008 Rev Ed) (“BMSMA”)). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">3 The central issue in the present appeal was whether, and to what extent, the <span class="font-italic">management corporation</span> had <span class="font-italic">recourse in tort</span> against the <span class="font-italic">builder</span> and the <span class="font-italic">architect </span>for building defects in the common property of the condominium development where the defects were not caused by the negligence of the builder and/or architect, but by the negligence of their sub-contractors. The key contention advanced by the appellant was that the builder and the architect were subject to a <span class="font-italic">non-delegable dut</span><span class="font-italic">y </span>in tort to ensure that the building and design (respectively) of the condominium was carried out<span class="font-italic"> </span><span class="font-italic">without negligence</span> on the part of any of their sub-contractors. Effectively what the appellant here sought to assert was that the builder and architect could be held liable in tort for <span class="font-italic">any negligence</span> <span class="font-italic">of their </span><span class="font-italic">independent sub-contractors</span>. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">4  At the conclusion of the hearing, we were not satisfied that the builder and the architect owed such a duty in law and hence dismissed the appeal. We now set out the detailed grounds for our decision.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Background facts</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">5  The appellant, Management Corporation Strata Title Plan No 3322 (“the MCST”), was the management corporation of The Seaview condominium (“The Seaview”). The Seaview was completed in 2008 with six 22-storey residential blocks of apartments, comprising 546 residential units. The respondents were Tiong Aik Construction Pte Ltd, the builder of The Seaview (“the Main Contractor”), and RSP Architects Planners &amp; Engineers (Pte) Ltd, the architect of The Seaview (“the Architect”).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">6 In Suit No 563 of 2011 (“S 563/2011”), the MCST brought proceedings against four defendants in respect of defects in the common areas of the condominium, namely, the developer, the Main Contractor, the Architect and one of the Architect’s sub-contractors. The MCST cited only the Main Contractor and the Architect as the respondents to this appeal, leaving out the developer and the Architect’s sub-contractor. In other words, the MCST had decided not to pursue the appeal against the latter two defendants. The claims made by MCST in the action against the Main Contractor and the Architect were as follows:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Against the Main Contractor – (a) in tort for failing to carry out the construction works in a good and workmanlike manner and/or in accordance with approved plans, specifications and industry standards; and (b) for breach of warranties which were issued jointly and severally by the Main Contractor and their sub-contractors to the developer and subsequently assigned to the MCST.

</div>
</div> The present appeal arose from the Judge’s decision on the preliminary issues, which is reported as <span class="font-italic">MCST Plan No 3322 v </span><span class="font-italic">Mer Vue Developments Pte Ltd</span> <span class="font-italic">and </span><span class="font-italic">ors</span> [2016] 2 SLR 793 (“the Judgment”).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The decision below</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">10  The Judge considered the nature of the relationship between the parties in the context of <span class="font-italic">possible vicarious liability</span>, and concluded as follows:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a)  The Main Contractor and the Architect were independent contractors of the developer (the Judgment at [69] and [70]).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The nine nominated sub-contractors and twelve domestic sub-contractors were independent contractors of the Main Contractor (the Judgment at [86]). </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Squire Mech Private Limited and Sitetectonix Pte Ltd were independent contractors of the Architect (the Judgment at [90] and [91]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">In addition, the Judge found that proper care had been exercised by the Main Contractor and the Architect in their appointment of the independent contractors (the Judgment at [93]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">11 The Judge also considered the question of <span class="font-italic">non-delegable duties</span> which arose under both statute and the common law (the Judgment at [27]). The Judge recognised that in law, if a non-delegable duty were breached, an employer could be held liable for the negligence of its independent contractors (the Judgment at [16]). On the facts, the Judge held:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) A new common law category of non-delegable duties for construction professionals should not be created (the Judgment at [26]). Instead, construction professionals were only under a common law duty not to <span class="font-italic">unreasonably</span> delegate any of its professional responsibilities (the Judgment at [56]–[57]). It followed that the only common law non-delegable duties which the Main Contractor and the Architect were subject to were those which were well-established in common law (the Judgment at [17], [21], [22] and [26]). </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The Architect and the Main Contractor were subject to statutory non-delegable duties under ss 9 and 11 of the BCA respectively, but these duties were limited to those stated in the BCA, which concern only building safety, construction in accordance with the relevant approved plans, compliance with building regulations and provisions of the BCA, and compliance with the terms and conditions imposed by the Commissioner of Building Control (the Judgment at [42] and [47]).  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">12 Several <span class="font-italic">specific defects</span> were also considered by the Judge (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the “Fibre Optic Cable”, “Poolside Landscaping”, and “Foul Smell” issues). He found as follows:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The Fibre Optic Cable issue concerned alleged incomplete and/or inconsistent fibre optic cabling. The fibre optic cable was installed by Singtel and any negligence relating to the installation of the cables would not lie with how the defendants had performed their contracted work, save for the Main Contractor’s possible lack of care over its control over the construction site (the Judgment at [101]).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The Poolside Landscaping issue concerned the alleged negligent design of the trees and plants around the pool which led to the nuisance of small leaves falling into the pool. This was designed by Sitetectonix Pte Ltd, who would <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> be liable for its own negligence. The Architect would not be vicariously liable for Sitetectonix Pte Ltd’s negligence in this regard, if any (the Judgment at [102]–[103]). Further, there was no evidence that the developer had condoned Sitetectonix Pte Ltd’s alleged negligent acts (the Judgment at [108]).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) The Foul Smell issue concerned bad odours in the kitchen and wash areas as well as adjoining bathrooms and some bedrooms in various apartment units. This stemmed from an alleged defect in the design of the plumbing and sanitary system, which fell within the scope of Squire Mech Private Limited’s contracted work. The Judge found that neither the Architect nor the developer would be liable in tort for Squire Mech Private Limited’s negligence in relation to this issue, if any (the Judgment at [116] and [122]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">13 Finally, the Judge held that the BMSMA did not give the MCST a <span class="font-italic">private right of action against the developer for breach of statutory duties</span> (the Judgment at [132]).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Issues on appeal </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">14  The Judge’s decision covered a broad array of issues, but the MCST ultimately only appealed against <span class="font-italic">one</span> aspect of the Judge’s decision. We noted that the scope of the MCST’s appeal had evolved quite significantly. The Notice of Appeal initially filed by the MCST suggested that the appeal would be a wide-ranging one. It was clear when the Appellant’s Case was filed, however, that the MCST had substantially narrowed the scope of its appeal and was only taking issue with the Judge’s finding on <span class="font-italic">non-delegable duties</span>.  Based on the Appellant’s Case, the appeal centred on whether the Main Contractor and the Architect owed the MCST <span class="font-italic">non-delegable duties </span>in tort under<span class="font-italic"> statute and/or common law</span> to build and design The Seaview with reasonable care (“the Proposed Non-Delegable Duty”).

</div>
</div>
</div> During oral submissions, however, counsel for the MCST, Mr Ang Cheng Hock, SC (“Mr Ang”), informed us that he was not pursuing the submission that the respondents were subject to statutory non-delegable duties under the BCA. The scope of the appeal was therefore further narrowed, and focused <span class="font-italic">solely</span> on whether the Main Contractor and the Architect owed the MCST non-delegable duties <span class="font-italic">under common law</span> to build and design The Seaview with reasonable care. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">15 As mentioned at [4] above, we dismissed the appeal and found that the non-delegable duty advanced by the MCST did not exist under statute or common law. We shall explain our decision by first considering the nature of non-delegable duties in the law of tort. We shall then explain why we thought Mr Ang was correct to abandon the submission that a statutory non-delegable duty existed in the form advanced in the Appellant’s Case. We shall finally consider the principles governing non-delegable duties under the common law, and explain why we concluded that there was no basis to find that the Proposed Non-Delegable Duty should be recognised in the present case. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Setting aside the preliminary issues determination</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">16 Before we explain our decision proper, we should mention that a question as to the appropriateness of the preliminary issues determination arose in the course of the oral hearing before us. Mr Ang informed the court that the MCST was not necessarily seeking a positive, favourable determination on the issue of non-delegable duties at this stage of proceedings. Instead, it would have been content if the court set aside the Judge’s determination on the preliminary issues and ordered that these issues be decided <span class="font-italic">de novo</span> at the end of the main trial. Mr Ang’s submission was that the question of non-delegable duties could only properly be decided in the context of all the evidence, and was not a matter suitable for preliminary determination. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">17 The respondents strongly objected to this suggestion. Both Mr Ravi Chelliah (“Mr Chelliah”), counsel for the Main Contractor, and Mr Melvin Chan (“Mr Chan”), counsel for the Architect, submitted that it would be inappropriate for this court to set aside the Judge’s preliminary issues determination and direct that the question of non-delegable duties be heard <span class="font-italic">de novo</span><span class="font-italic">.</span> They emphasised that the MCST did not appeal against the Judge’s initial order to have these matters heard as preliminary issues. It would be unjust for the court to <span class="font-italic">now</span> set aside the determination after time and costs had been expended on a ten-day trial during which witnesses were extensively cross-examined and the MCST had the chance to adduce whatever evidence it needed. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">18 We agreed. First, the MCST could have, but <span class="font-italic">did not</span>, appeal against the Judge’s direction that there would be a trial of the preliminary issues listed at [8] above. Second, even during the trial, the MCST had the opportunity to adduce the necessary evidence for a proper determination of the non-delegable duties issue, and was even at liberty to submit before the Judge that the presence of non-delegable duties was fact specific and may depend on the type of building defect in question. This submission, however, was never made at trial and was only raised by Mr Ang on appeal. We therefore found that it was not appropriate to reopen the issue of whether the preliminary issues trial was correctly ordered to begin with. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The nature of non-delegable duties in tort </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">19  We begin with a conceptual analysis of the nature of non-delegable duties in tort and how it relates to vicarious liability and the independent contractor defence. As the Judge held, tortious liability is generally circumscribed by the “fundamental fault-based principle in the law of torts that liability lies with the party that has engaged in the tortious acts in question” (the Judgment at [39]). In this regard, Lord Sumption JSC, in delivering the leading judgment in the United Kingdom Supreme Court (“UKSC”) decision of <span class="font-italic">Woodland v Swimming Teachers Association and others</span> [2014] AC 537 (“<span class="font-italic">Woodland</span>”), held at [5]: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The law of negligence is generally fault-based. Generally speaking, a defendant is personally liable only <span class="font-italic">for doing negligently that which he does at all</span>, or for omissions which are in reality a negligent way of doing that which he does at all. The law does not in the ordinary course impose personal (as opposed to vicarious) liability for what <span class="font-italic">others</span> do or fail to do. This is because, as Cory J observed, delivering the judgment of the majority in the Supreme Court of Canada in <span class="font-italic">Guardian ad litem of Lewis v British Columbia</span> [1997] 3 SCR 1145, para 18, a common law duty of care</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">“does not usually demand compliance with a specific obligation. It is <span class="font-italic">only when an act is undertaken</span> <span class="font-italic">by a party</span> that a general duty arises to perform the act with reasonable care.”</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"> …[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">In other words, in the context of the tort of negligence, a person is generally only held liable for his <span class="font-italic">own </span>carelessness, and not for the carelessness of <span class="font-italic">others</span>. The reason for this is that the nature of the duty imposed by common law is merely to <span class="font-italic">do what you </span><span class="font-italic">are required to do</span> <span class="font-italic">with reasonable care</span>. One implication of this is that if the performance of a particular task is delegated to another party, the party who was originally responsible for the performance of that task (under, for example, contract) would, ordinarily, not be subject to <span class="font-italic">any</span> tortious liability for the negligent performance of that task (since he did not personally perform the task). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">20 Vicarious liability stands, in a sense, as a derogation from this principle, or as a “true exception” to this, in the words of Lord Sumption JSC in <span class="font-italic">Woodland</span> at [3]. It permits the imputation of secondary tortious liability on an employer on the basis of its employee’s primary tortious liability (Gary Chan Kok Yew, <span class="font-italic">The Law of Torts in Singapore </span>(Singapore Academy of Law, 2nd Ed, 2016) (“<span class="font-italic">Gary Chan</span>”) at para 19.001). The employer is liable not because of its <span class="font-italic">own</span> negligence, but because of its <span class="font-italic">employee’s </span>negligence. The principles of vicarious liability, however, do not extend to imposing liability on employers for the negligence of their <span class="font-italic">independent contractors</span>. There is no basis in the doctrine of vicarious liability for suing an employer in tort for the negligence of its independent contractors. An employer may thus raise the independent contractor defence (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, that the negligent party was an independent contractor, not an employee) against a claim of vicarious liability. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">21 A <span class="font-italic">separate</span> legal basis for such a cause of action may, however, exist in the doctrine of <span class="font-italic">non-delegable duties</span>. The liability incurred upon a breach of a non-delegable duty is <span class="font-italic">not vicarious</span> (<span class="font-italic">The “Lotus M”</span> [1998] 1 SLR(R) 409 (“<span class="font-italic">The Lotus M</span>”) at [37]). Non-delegable duties are <span class="font-italic">personal</span> duties, the delegation of which will not enable the duty-bearer to escape tortious liability because the legal responsibility for the proper performance of the duty resides, in law, in the duty-bearer (<span class="font-italic">Woodland</span> at [7]). The High Court of Australia (per Gleeson CJ) has described such duties as “duties [which] cannot be discharged by delegation... [or] by entrusting its performance to another” (<span class="font-italic">State of New South Wales v </span><span class="font-italic">Lepore</span> [2003] 212 CLR 511 (“<span class="font-italic">Lepore</span>”) at [20]). While the task of performing a non-delegable duty may be delegated, the person owing the duty remains legally responsible for the conduct of those employed to perform the duty (<span class="font-italic">Lepore</span> at [145]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">22 From another perspective, it has been said that “the concept of personal duty departs from the basic principles of liability and negligence by substituting for the duty to take reasonable care a more stringent duty, <span class="font-italic">a duty to ensure that reasonable care is taken</span>” [emphasis added] (<span class="font-italic">Commonwealth of Australia v </span><span class="font-italic">Introvigne</span> [1981–1982] 150 CLR 258 (“<span class="font-italic">Introvigne</span>”) at 270–271, per Mason J). Separately, Lord Sumption JSC described a non-delegable duty as a duty which “extends beyond being careful, to procuring the careful performance of work delegated to others” (<span class="font-italic">Woodland</span> at [5]). In this regard, the duty may be said to be “analogous to that assumed by a person who contracts to do work carefully” (<span class="font-italic">Woodland</span> at [7]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">23 It should be clarified that the concept of non-delegable duties does not <span class="font-italic">p</span><span class="font-italic">er se</span> import a higher or absolute standard of care. Referring to non-delegable duties, Gleeson CJ helpfully explained in <span class="font-italic">Lepore</span> at [26]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… It also seems clear that the increased stringency to which he was referring lay, not in the extent of the responsibility undertaken (reasonable care for the safety of the pupils), but in the inability to discharge that responsibility by delegating the task of providing care to a third party or third parties. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">Kirby J made the same point in <span class="font-italic">Lepore</span> at [291]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">However, the non-delegable nature of the duty was not designed, as I read the cases, to expand the <span class="font-italic">content</span> of the duty imposed upon the superior party to the relationship, so as to enlarge that duty into one of strict liability or insurance. … [emphasis in original]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 From the above, it is clear that where a party is subject to non-delegable duties, he will be held liable in tort if those duties are breached, <span class="font-italic">even if</span> he had non-negligently delegated the performance of those duties to an independent contractor, and it was the independent contractor who was negligent. In this sense, non-delegable duties create an exception to the rule that an employer cannot be liable for the negligence of its independent contractors (<span class="font-italic">Management Corporation Strata Title Plan No 2297 v Seasons Park Ltd</span> [2005] 2 SLR(R) 613 (“<span class="font-italic">Seasons Park</span>”)<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [38]). As the Judge held at [16] of the Judgment, however, this is <span class="font-italic">not an exception which</span> <span class="font-italic">extends the doctrine of vicarious liability</span>; the tortious liability imposed pursuant to a breach of non-delegable duties is <span class="font-italic">primary</span>, rather than <span class="font-italic">secondary</span> (<span class="font-italic">Gary Chan</span> at para 19.103). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 In sum, it may be said that there are at least two<span class="font-italic"> separate</span> legal doctrines<span class="font-italic"> </span>which permit “derogation” from the fault-based principle and impose tortious liability on a defendant for the negligence of another: the first is vicarious liability, where an employer may be subject to tortious liability for the negligence of its employee; and the second is non-delegable duties, where a party may be subject to tortious liability even if the negligent party was its independent contractor. In this sense, vicarious liability and liability which arises out of non-delegable duties may be said to be closely linked doctrines. Conceptually, however, the doctrines are separate and distinct.  As this court observed in <span class="font-italic">Chandran</span><span class="font-italic"> a/l Subbiah v Dockers Marine Pte Ltd</span> [2010] 1 SLR 786 at [13]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">An employer may, at common law, be made liable to an employee who sustains an injury in the course of employment in two<span class="font-italic"> distinct</span>, but not mutually exclusive, ways. One is through the <span class="font-italic">doctrine of vicarious liability</span> where the employer is made liable for the negligence of another employee. This is sometimes called <span class="font-italic">secondary liability</span>. The other route that may be available is if the employer has been <span class="font-italic">personally in default of the non-delegable duty of care</span> to take care of the health and safety of its employees. This type of liability is typically known as <span class="font-italic">employer’s liability or primary liability</span>. … [emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 At this juncture, we pause to mention that the Judge’s finding that the respondents’ sub-contractors were independent contractors (and not employees) was not challenged on appeal. Hence, the MCST could no longer rely on vicarious liability to hold the respondents liable for their sub-contractors’ negligence. Instead, the MCST’s contention on appeal was that the Main Contractor and the Architect were subject to particular <span class="font-italic">non-delegable duties</span> which were breached by their<span class="font-italic"> sub-contractor’s negligence</span>. Tortious liability therefore remained with the Main Contractor and the Architect. These contentions will now be examined. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Statutory non-delegable duty</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27   As mentioned at [14] above, Mr Ang did not pursue the argument that the Main Contractor and the Architect were subject to liability on account of their breach of a <span class="font-italic">statutory non-delegable duty</span>. In our view, he was right not to do so. Nevertheless, given that extensive submissions were made on this point in both the parties’ written cases, we thought it appropriate to express our views on it. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 A statute can give rise to non-delegable duties in tort. Whether a particular statute does so is a question of construction (<span class="font-italic">Clerk &amp; </span><span class="font-italic">Lindsell on Torts </span>(Michael A Jones gen ed) (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 21st Ed, 2014) at para 6-61). Where they do arise, the non-delegable duties in tort would be <span class="font-italic">identical in content</span> to the statutory duties imposed by the Act. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 In the present case, the Judge found that the BCA did give rise to statutory non-delegable duties in tort (see [11(b)] above). This finding was not challenged on appeal. The arguments, however, centred on the <span class="font-italic">scope</span> of these non-delegable duties. In its Appellant’s Case, the MCST submitted that the Judge had adopted too narrow an interpretation of the statutory non-delegable duties established by the BCA because he focused too closely on the wording of ss 9 and 11 of the BCA. As framed by the MCST, the statutory non-delegable duty owed by the Main Contractor and Architect was to “build and design [The Seaview] with reasonable care”.

The other express duties related to specific obligations which were not relevant to the present case. More importantly, nothing in the express words of the BCA countenance the imputation of the Proposed Non-Delegable Duty. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 In our view, the absence of any express statutory language to ground the Proposed Non-Delegable Duty was dispositive of the matter. Indeed, in <span class="font-italic">Seasons Park</span> at [40], this court required the appellant to point to the “specific provisions” in the relevant Acts or rules which supported the statutory non-delegable duty asserted. In this regard, we found that the language of the BCA was clear – the duties imposed on builders and architects were limited in the manner described at [33] above. Nevertheless, in light of the MCST’s written submissions, we also considered whether the broader statutory scheme and object of the BCA justified a broader view of the duties imposed under the BCA. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Objectives of the BCA</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 We agreed with the MCST that: (a) under the BCA, the builder and the architect (as opposed to their sub-contractors) were two key parties upon whom legal responsibility for the proper construction of a building lay; (b) an important objective of the BCA was to protect the occupiers/owners of the premises; and (c) the BCA sought to maintain and promote high standards of professionalism, competence and quality among construction professionals in Singapore. These factors alone, however, were not sufficient to support a finding that the Proposed Non-Delegable Duty existed. This was because the BCA only sought to impose legal responsibility and protect building occupiers and owners in respect of <span class="font-italic">building</span><span class="font-italic"> and structural safety</span>, and <span class="font-italic">not</span> in relation to other aspects of the construction such as workmanship or aesthetic flaws. That this is so was clear from the express provisions of the BCA, as discussed above. Additionally, the Parliamentary debates leading to the enactment of the BCA also lend support to this view.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Parliamentary debates</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36  The present BCA was enacted in 1989 to “ensure that... buildings [were] designed, checked, constructed and maintained to safe standards” (<span class="font-italic">Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report </span>(30 March 1988) vol 50 (“<span class="font-italic">1988 Parliamentary Debates</span>”) at col 1739 (S Dhanabalan, Minister for National Developmment)). Mr Dhanabalan further explained that the Building Control Bill sought to:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) enhance the powers of the Building Authority in relation to regulation of building works and safety of buildings; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) implement a system of independent checking of structural plans by accredited checkers.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(see the <span class="font-italic">1988 Parliamentary Debates</span> at col 1739)</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 The intended  singular focus on structural soundness and safety, to the<span class="font-italic"> exclusion</span> of other aspects of the construction such as poor workmanship, was evident in Mr Dhanabalan’s speech (<span class="font-italic">1988 Parliamentary Debates</span> at col 1757):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">I think if we can concentrate on controlling the quality of buildings at the design and construction stage, we would have gone a long way to ensure that buildings are sound structurally for a long, long time. This is what the new Bill will do, ie, design checked, constructed and maintained to safe standards.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">As to how poor workmanship is covered by the Bill, the Member said that <span class="font-italic">there is a gap in the Bill</span>. It is true<span class="font-italic">. We are concerned not with the aesthetics</span>. But we are concerned with the structural soundness of the building under the Act. Poor workmanship can be quite a subjective and contentious issue. What appears to be poor workmanship to some people may be acceptable to others. And what appears to be acceptable at one time may not be acceptable at another time. Many people in Singapore were quite prepared to accept buildings of poor workmanship, <span class="font-italic">poor tiling, poor finishes</span>, when there was a boom because people thought they could buy and sell the flat or the house within a few months and they were getting a building or a house or a flat at a good price so they did not bother about poor workmanship. Once, of course, the real estate market collapsed, then people became very conscious about workmanship.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">It is very <span class="font-italic">difficult to </span><span class="font-italic">legislate good workmanship</span>. <span class="font-italic">It is something that buyers must demand and be intelligent and discerning consumers when they buy homes</span>. ...</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 It is thus clear that the BCA, when first enacted, was intended to deal exclusively with the structural soundness of buildings, and not with poor workmanship or aesthetics. Poor workmanship included things like “poor tiling” and “poor finishes” – the kind of building defects which were the subject of S 563/2011. Indeed, the Minister emphasised that poor workmanship was “difficult to legislate”, and that it was incumbent on the <span class="font-italic">buyers themselves</span> to be “intelligent and discerning consumers” when buying their homes. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 Parliament maintained its focus on structural safety and soundness of buildings in the 2007 debates on amendments to the BCA. The then Minister of State for National Development, Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien, opened her speech in support of the amendment bill by citing the Nicoll Highway collapse in 2004 as a “wake-up call for the construction industry” (<span class="font-italic">Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report </span>(20 September 2007) vol 83 (“<span class="font-italic">2007 Parliamentary Debates</span>”) at col 2054). She concluded her opening speech by emphasising that “building safety cannot be left to chance, and complacency has no place in any construction project” (<span class="font-italic">2007 Parliamentary Debates</span> at col 2062). Parliament’s continued concern about structural safety was also clearly evident in the remaining speeches given during the <span class="font-italic">2007 Parliamentary Debates</span>. Significantly, there was no evidence that Parliament intended to extend the scope of the BCA to deal with poor workmanship, which had nothing to do with structural soundness. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 Finally, we should mention that the latest Parliamentary debates on the BCA took place in 2012 (see <span class="font-italic">Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report </span>(10 September 2012) vol 89), where the key concern was improving energy efficiency in the building sector. Thus, while it is fair to say that the BCA has expanded its focus beyond issues of structural safety, to include concerns of environmental sustainability, issues of poor workmanship have never, to date, been included as part of the <span class="font-italic">raison d'être</span> of the BCA.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Conclusion on statutory non-delegable duties</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 To conclude, we found that there was no basis for the submission that the BCA imposed a wide-ranging statutory duty, which extended beyond structural soundness, on the Main Contractor or the Architect. Both the express statutory language and the relevant Parliamentary debates clearly show that it was Parliament’s intention for the BCA to have a far narrower focus. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 In this regard, we could not agree with the submission of the MCST that it was artificial or arbitrary to draw a distinction based on whether the subcontractor’s negligence resulted in non-compliance with the building regulations <span class="font-italic">etc</span>. First, the focus of the BCA was on structural soundness and safety, to the exclusion of workmanship defects. Second, even if a case could be made out that such a focus was unduly narrow, this was a distinction drawn by Parliament and it was not for the court to question or undermine that distinction.   </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Common law non-delegable duty</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 The MCST’s main case on appeal was that construction professionals should be subject to certain <span class="font-italic">common law </span><span class="font-italic">non-delegable duties</span>. Specifically, the submission was that the Main Contractor and Architect should be subject to a common law non-delegable duty to build and design The Seaview with reasonable care. We thus had to consider whether such a duty could be brought under the existing categories of common law non-delegable duties, and if not, whether the categories of common law non-delegable duties should be expanded to impose such a duty on construction professionals.   </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 The Singapore courts have not, to date, fully explored the basis and scope of common law non-delegable duties in Singapore law. This gap in our jurisprudence may, however, be a consequence not just of a lack of opportunity, but of the difficulties in propounding a coherent theoretical basis to delineate the nature and scope of these duties. This court observed in <span class="font-italic">Seasons Park</span> at [39] that “no general principle can be deduced as to the circumstances under which such non-delegable duty arises in common law”, and did not attempt to rationalise the relatively established categories under which non-delegable duties arose. Indeed, as John Murphy opined in his article, “Juridical Foundations of Common Law Non-Delegable Duties” (published in Jason W Neyers <span class="font-italic">et al</span> eds, <span class="font-italic">Emerging Issues in Tort Law</span> (Hart Publishing, 2007) at p 369), despite the “fairly sizeable number of well-settled instances in which non-delegable duties have been imposed”, there remained “conceptual uncertainty behind which such duties seem to be veiled”. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The discrete categories of non-delegable duties</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 We will first consider the “well-settled instances” in which non-delegable duties were thought to arise. In Singapore, as the Judge observed (the Judgment at [18]), non-delegable duties have mainly been considered and established in the area of <span class="font-italic">employee safety</span>. In <span class="font-italic">The Lotus M</span>, a few of the appellant’s employees were working on board the respondent’s ship. As a result of the respondent’s negligence, an explosion occurred on board the ship and the appellant’s employees suffered serious injuries. In determining whether the appellant was entitled to an indemnity from the respondent, the court had to consider whether the appellant could be held legally liable to its employees for the accident (<span class="font-italic">The Lotus M</span> at [27]). In finding that the appellant could be held legally liable on the basis that it was subject to a non-delegable duty as an employer, the court observed (<span class="font-italic">The Lotus M</span> at [22] and [30]): </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">22 … There is also no denying that in law [the appellant] has a duty to take reasonable care to provide a safe system of work for Ang when working on the <span class="font-italic">Lotus M</span>. It is settled law that such a duty of care is either personal or non-delegable meaning, “that if (the duty) is not performed, it is no defence for the employer to show that he delegated its performance to a person, whether his servant or not his servant, whom he reasonably believed to be competent to perform it. Despite such delegation the employer is liable for the non-performance of the duty – <span class="font-italic">per</span> Lord Brandon in <span class="font-italic">McDermid</span><span class="font-italic"> v Nash Dredging &amp; Reclamation Co Ltd</span> [1987] AC 906 at 919C–D...</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">30 We cannot emphasise too strongly that the duty to take reasonable care to provide a safe system of work rests on the employer and that it is non-delegable. ...</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 The employer’s non-delegable duty to take reasonable care for its employees’ safety was reaffirmed in <span class="font-italic">Chandran</span><span class="font-italic"> a/l Subbiah v Dockers Marine Pte Ltd</span> [2010] 1 SLR 786 at [17] and [19]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">17 A distinctive feature of an employer’s duty of care to his employees for their safety is that it is <span class="font-italic">personal </span>and<span class="font-italic"> </span>therefore<span class="font-italic"> non-delegable</span>. This means that the employer cannot escape liability simply by baldly asserting that another party was negligent and responsible for the employee’s injury. ...</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">19 This much can now be emphatically stated. An employer cannot wash his hands off all responsibility for the safety of his employees simply because the employees are sent to work at a site controlled by others. The law continues to place on an employer an obligation to take reasonable care for its employees’ safety. ...</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis in original]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 For completeness, we should mention that in other jurisdictions, non-delegable duties have also been recognised to arise in several other contexts: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Hospitals and health authorities have been observed to owe non-delegable duties to their patients (see for instance, <span class="font-italic">Cassidy v Ministry of Health</span> [1951] 2 KB 343 at 363–365, per Denning LJ; and <span class="font-italic">X (Minors) v Bedfordshire County Council</span><span class="font-italic"> and other appeals</span> [1995] 2 AC 633 at 740, per Lord Browne-Wilkinson). Indeed, the Singapore High Court recently considered the possibility of non-delegable duties arising in the hospital-patient context. In <span class="font-italic">Hii</span><span class="font-italic"> Chii Kok v Ooi Peng Jin London Lucien and another</span> [2016] 2 SLR 544 (“<span class="font-italic">Hii</span><span class="font-italic"> Chii Kok</span>”), the High Court had to consider whether the<span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)"> </span>National Cancer Centre of Singapore Pte Ltd owed non-delegable duties to a patient who eventually underwent surgery at the Singapore General Hospital. While the learned judge found that a non-delegable duty was not owed on the facts, he observed that “the existence of a non-delegable duty of a hospital for the functions it undertakes <span class="font-italic">turns centrally on the responsibility for the care, supervision and control that it has assumed</span> for those functions in relation to the patient, a vulnerable person who has placed himself under the hospital’s direct care, supervision and control” [emphasis added] (<span class="font-italic">Hii</span><span class="font-italic"> Chii Kok </span>at [70]). The possibility of a non-delegable duty arising in this context was therefore left open. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b)  Schools and school authorities have been found to owe non-delegable duties to their students (see for instance <span class="font-italic">Woodland</span>, discussed at [56]–[59] below, and <span class="font-italic">Introvigne</span> at 269–270, per Mason J). </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Non-delegable duties have also been held to arise in cases involving extra-hazardous operations (see <span class="font-italic">Honeywill</span><span class="font-italic"> &amp; Stein Ltd v Larkin Bros (London’s Commercial Photographers) Ltd</span> [1934] 1 KB 191 at 197).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 The examples listed above are <span class="font-italic">non-exhaustive</span> of the different instances in which non-delegable duties have been found to arise in other jurisdictions. While we broadly agree that these categories of non-delegable duties are sensible and instructive in guiding the development of Singapore law, whether and to what extent Singapore law should recognise a non-delegable duty in <span class="font-italic">each</span> of the above scenarios was not a question that arose on the facts before us and remains to be decided should the appropriate case come before our courts. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Rationalising the discrete categories</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 In 1967, Prof P S Atiyah observed that there was a general lack of success in finding a unifying theme which would explain all the cases in which the courts have imposed liability on an employer for the acts of independent contractors (P S Atiyah, <span class="font-italic">Vicarious Liability in the Law of Torts</span> (Butterworths, 1967) at p 336). More than forty years later, the UKSC observed in the same vein that “English law has long recognised that non-delegable duties exist, but it does not have a single theory to explain when or why” (<span class="font-italic">Woodland</span> at [6]). Indeed, the High Court of Australia has generally also taken a critical attitude towards the lack of conceptual unity underlying the doctrine of non-delegable duties (<span class="font-italic">Lepore</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [152], [153], [246], [247] and [289]; <span class="font-italic">Leichhardt</span><span class="font-italic"> Municipal Council v Montgomery</span> [2007] 230 CLR 22 (“<span class="font-italic">Leichhardt</span>”) at [142], [155], [156] and [187]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 Notwithstanding the multitude of critical voices, attempts have been made to identify a common element or rationale which can justify or explain the established categories of non-delegable duties. These attempts have broadly coalesced into a <span class="font-italic">single</span>, if slightly amorphous, account of non-delegable duties, which has now come to be widely accepted. Borrowing the words of Kirby J in <span class="font-italic">Leichhardt</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [123], the element thought to be common across the categories of non-delegable duties is that the duty bearer has <span class="font-italic">undertaken or assumed responsibility </span>to the claimant in circumstances where the relationship involves a kind of “special dependence” or “particular vulnerability”.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 We start by considering the jurisprudence from the High Court of Australia. In <span class="font-italic">Introvigne</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at 271, the High Court of Australia (per Mason J) observed that “the law has, for various reasons, imposed a special duty on persons in certain situations to take particular precautions for the safety of others”. This general statement was concretised and further refined by Mason J himself in <span class="font-italic">Kondis</span><span class="font-italic"> v State Transport Authority</span> [1984] 154 CLR 672 (“<span class="font-italic">Kondis</span>”) at 687:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… However, when we look to the classes of case in which the existence of a non-delegable duty has been recognized, it appears that there is <span class="font-italic">some element in the relationship between the parties</span> that makes it appropriate to impose on the defendant a duty to ensure that reasonable care and skill is taken for the safety of the persons to whom the duty is owed. As I said in <span class="font-italic">Introvigne</span> “the law has, for various reasons imposed a special duty on persons in certain situations to take particular precautions for the safety of others”. ...</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The element in the relationship between the parties which generates a special responsibility or duty to see that care is taken may be found in one or more of several circumstances. ... In these situations the special duty arises because <span class="font-italic">the person on whom it is imposed has undertaken the care, supervision or control of the person or property of another or is so placed in relation to that person or his property as to assume a particular responsibility for his or its safety, in circumstances where the person affected might reasonably expect that due care will be exercised</span>. …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 This authoritative exposition of the common “element in the relationship between the parties” across the categories of non-delegable duties was subsequently cited with approval in <span class="font-italic">Burnie</span><span class="font-italic"> Port Authority v General Jones Pty Ltd</span> [1992–1994] 179 CLR 520 (“<span class="font-italic">Burnie</span><span class="font-italic"> Port Authority</span>”). The majority of the High Court of Australia added that this common element could be referred to as “the central element of control” , and that “[v]iewed from the perspective of the person to whom the duty is owed, the relationship of proximity giving rise to the non-delegable duty of care in such cases is marked by special dependence or vulnerability on the part of that person” (<span class="font-italic">Burnie</span><span class="font-italic"> Port Authority</span> at 550–551). Subsequently, in <span class="font-italic">Leichhardt</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [78], Kirby J described Mason J’s attempt to “describe, categorise and explain the common elements of the non-delegable duties of care accepted by Australian law” as an “influential attempt”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 It should be added, however, that Mason J’s attempt to identify an underlying rationale or common element across <span class="font-italic">all</span> categories of non-delegable duties has achieved, at best, a qualified success. In <span class="font-italic">Lepore</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [255], Gummow and Hayne JJ observed that the presence of the common characteristics identified in <span class="font-italic">Kondis</span> did not <span class="font-italic">necessar</span><span class="font-italic">ily</span> import a non-delegable duty:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Several categories of cases in which the duty to take reasonable care is non-delegable were identified by Mason J in <span class="font-italic">Kondis</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>... [e]ach is identified as a relationship in which the person owing the duty either has the care, supervision or control of the other person or has assumed a particular responsibility for the safety of that person or that person’s property. <span class="font-italic">It is not suggested, however, that all relationships which display these characteristics necessarily import a non-delegable duty.</span> [emphasis added] </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 Further, Kirby J observed in <span class="font-italic">Leichhardt</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [78] that Mason J himself conceded that relationships giving rise to non-delegable duties may rest on “different foundations”. Rather than having found a <span class="font-italic">complete</span> account of non-delegable duties, Kirby J opined that Mason J was merely suggesting “elements of a coherent theory” (<span class="font-italic">Leichhardt</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [85]). In his judgment, Kirby J adopted John Murphy’s suggestion that an “assumption of responsibility” in relationships involving “particular vulnerability” or “special dependence” was the defining characteristic of cases in which non-delegable duties arise (<span class="font-italic">Leichhardt</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [117], [122] and [123]). It should be noted, however, that the other members of the High Court in Australia in <span class="font-italic">Leichhardt</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>were generally pessimistic about the possibility of establishing a sound doctrinal foundation or finding conceptual unity amongst the categories of non-delegable duties (per Gleeson CJ<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [24], per Hayne J at [142], [155] and [156], and per Callinan J at [187]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 Moving on to the position in the United Kingdom, the present legal position on non-delegable duties has been authoritatively set out in the recent UKSC decision, <span class="font-italic">Woodland</span>. Indeed, this is the authority which the parties and the Judge (see the Judgment at [20]–[23]) primarily relied on as authoritatively setting out the law on non-delegable duties. <span class="font-italic">Woodland</span> has also been cited and followed in other Singapore High Court decisions such as <span class="font-italic">BNM (</span><span class="font-italic">administratrix of the estate of B, deceased) on her own behalf and on behalf of others v National University of Singapore and another</span> [2014] 2 SLR 258 at [55]–[62] and <span class="font-italic">Hii</span><span class="font-italic"> Chii Kok </span>at [63]–[71]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 <span class="font-italic"> </span> In <span class="font-italic">Woodland</span>, the question was whether the respondent education authority was responsible for the appellant’s injuries, which were sustained during swimming lessons organised by the school.

In finding that the appeal provided a “useful occasion” for reviewing the law on “non-delegable duties of care” (<span class="font-italic">Woodland</span> at [2]), the UKSC considered the key categories of non-delegable duties established in common law jurisdictions and attempted to derive general principles therefrom. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 Noting that English law did not have a “single theory to explain when or why” non-delegable duties existed in common law (see [49] above), Lord Sumption JSC observed that there were “two broad categories of case[s] in which such a duty has been held to arise” (<span class="font-italic">Woodland</span> at [6]):</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The first is where “the defendant employs an independent contractor to perform some function which is either inherently hazardous or liable to become so in the course of his work” (<span class="font-italic">Woodland</span> at [6]).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The second concerns cases with three critical characteristics (<span class="font-italic">Woodland</span> at [7]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">First, it arises not from the negligent character of the act itself but because of an antecedent relationship between the defendant and the claimant. Second, the duty is a positive or affirmative duty to protect a particular class of persons against a particular class of risks, and not simply a duty to refrain from acting in a way that foreseeably causes injury. Third, the duty is by virtue of that relationship personal to the defendant.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 After considering the various scenarios in which the courts have held that non-delegable duties under the second category arise, Lord Sumption JSC identified five defining features of such cases (<span class="font-italic">Woodland</span> at [23]): </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The claimant is a patient or a child, or for some other reason is <span class="font-italic">especially vulnerable or dependent on the protection of the defendant</span> against the risk of injury. Other examples are likely to be prisoners and residents in care homes. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) There is an antecedent relationship between the claimant and the defendant, independent of the negligent act or omission itself, (i) which places the claimant in the actual <span class="font-italic">custody, charge or care</span> of the defendant, and (ii) from which it is possible to impute to the defendant the <span class="font-italic">assumption of a positive duty to protect the claimant from harm</span>, and not just a duty to refrain from conduct which will foreseeably damage the claimant. It is characteristic of such relationships that they involve an <span class="font-italic">element of control</span> over the claimant, which varies in intensity from one situation to another, but is clearly very substantial in the case of schoolchildren. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) The <span class="font-italic">claimant has no control</span> over how the defendant chooses to perform those obligations, ie whether personally or through employees or through third parties. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) The defendant has delegated to a third party some function which is an integral part of the positive duty which he has assumed towards the claimant; and the third party is exercising, for the purpose of the function thus delegated to him, the defendant’s custody or care of the claimant and the element of control that goes with it. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) The third party has been negligent not in some collateral respect but in the performance of the very function assumed by the defendant and delegated by the defendant to him.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 <span class="font-italic">Woodland</span> thus did not purport to find a <span class="font-italic">single</span> unifying theory for <span class="font-italic">all</span> the instances of non-delegable duties. Nevertheless, the UKSC did attempt to delineate the general features of <span class="font-italic">most</span> categories of non-delegable duties, leaving out only the cases involving “extra hazardous” operations, which Lord Sumption JSC described as a “large, varied and anomalous class of cases” found on “arbitrary distinctions between ordinary and extraordinary hazards” (<span class="font-italic">Woodland</span> at [6]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 From the above, it can be seen that the collective wisdom of the courts leans towards the conclusion that while there does not exist a <span class="font-italic">single</span> theory which can explain <span class="font-italic">every</span> category of non-delegable duties, there are certain defining features which characterise <span class="font-italic">many</span> of the established instances in which non-delegable duties arise. We agreed. In coming to this conclusion, we were cognisant of the “obvious dangers... in elevating historical categories into a genus that is no more than retrospective rationalisation” (<span class="font-italic">Leichhardt</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [116], per Kirby J). Indeed, the categories of non-delegable duties might have developed in a piecemeal manner in response to necessity and the overriding demand of justice in particular cases. Nevertheless, to forge a principled path forward, we found it helpful and necessary, as far as was possible, to identify the underlying normative threads running across the different categories of non-delegable duties. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61  In this regard, it seemed to us that Lord Sumption JSC’s detailed exegesis of the defining features of cases in which a majority of the non-delegable duties arise (see [57(b)] and [58] above) was a good <span class="font-italic">starting point</span> for the development of the law on non-delegable duties in Singapore. Not only were the parties in agreement that this should be so, we were of the view that the principles laid down in <span class="font-italic">Woodland</span> were sensible and were capable of explaining the existing circumstances in which Singapore courts have recognised non-delegable duties (in particular, in the employer-employee context (see [45]–[46] above)).  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 In our judgment, moving forward, to demonstrate that a non-delegable duty arises on a particular set of facts, a claimant must <span class="font-italic">minimally</span> be able to satisfy the court either that: (a) the facts fall within one of the established categories of non-delegable duties; <span class="font-italic">or</span> (b) the facts possess <span class="font-italic">all</span> the features described at [58] above. However, we would hasten to add that (a) and (b) above merely lay down <span class="font-italic">threshold</span> requirements for satisfying the court that a non-delegable duty exists – the court will additionally have to take into account the fairness and reasonableness of imposing a non-delegable duty in the particular circumstance, as well as the relevant policy considerations in our local context. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 We would nevertheless emphasise that we agreed with the High Court of Australia that non-delegable duties are and should remain <span class="font-italic">exceptional</span>, and that its development should proceed only “on the basis of a clear analogy to a recognised class and then only for compelling reasons of legal principle and policy” (<span class="font-italic">Leichhardt</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [104], per Kirby J). This is especially because, as observed by Gleeson CJ in <span class="font-italic">Leichhardt</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [23], non-delegable duties are in many instances duties which the duty bearer cannot fulfil:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… A “special” responsibility or duty to “see” or “ensure” that reasonable care is taken by an independent contractor, and the contractor’s employees, goes beyond a duty to act reasonably in exercising prudent oversight of what the contractor does. <span class="font-italic">In many circumstances, it is a duty that could not be fulfilled.</span> How can a hospital ensure that a surgeon is never careless? If the answer is that it cannot, what does the law mean when it speaks of a duty to ensure that care is taken? … [emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">Thus, due consideration must be given to the burden that a non-delegable duty imposes on the duty-bearer. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Non-delegable duties for construction professionals</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 We turn now to the facts of the present case. The key issue was whether construction professionals – here, the Main Contractor and the Architect – should generally be subject to a non-delegable duty to build and design buildings with reasonable care. As mentioned at [29] above, this duty would effectively place legal responsibility on the Main Contractor and Architect to ensure that <span class="font-italic">all</span> aspects of the building and design of the condominium, and not just building structural soundness and safety, were completed with reasonable care. The Main Contractor and the Architect would, under the duty, become the insurers against all kinds of defect.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 Mr Ang did not contend that the Proposed Non-Delegable Duty fell within any existing, established category of non-delegable duties; nor did he submit that a similar duty has previously been recognised in any past judicial decision, whether local or foreign. He submitted, however, that the creation of a new category of non-delegable duties for construction professionals was justifiable and desirable on both legal principle and general policy grounds. He also submitted that creating this new category of common law non-delegable duties would be consistent with the object and spirit of the BCA. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 Based on Mr Ang’s submissions, the following sub-issues arose for consideration:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Should non-delegable duties be owed in respect of pure economic loss?</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Would the creation of the Proposed Non-Delegable Duty be consonant with the object and spirit of the BCA? </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Would the creation of the Proposed Non-Delegable Duty be in line with the existing common law principles on non-delegable duties? </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) Were there compelling policy reasons to accept the Proposed Non-Delegable Duty?</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Pure economic loss </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 On behalf of the Architect, Mr Thio Shen Yi, SC (“Mr Thio”) submitted that based on the existing authorities, non-delegable duties were created to protect vulnerable persons from <span class="font-italic">physical harm or injury</span>; protection from pure economic loss was a “long way removed” from this.

<div class="FootnoteRef text-justify"> Second Respondent’s Case at para 78   </div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> It is undoubtedly correct that the existing cases (in the employment, school or hospital context <span class="font-italic">etc</span>) on non-delegable duties have <span class="font-italic">largely</span> concerned <span class="font-italic">personal injury</span> (see [45]–[47] above). But are there compelling reasons to restrict <span class="font-italic">a priori</span> the categories of non-delegable duties to only cases concerning personal injury? We did not think so.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 First, the existing authorities do not restrict non-delegable duties to only cases concerning personal injury. The High Court of Australia has observed that non-delegable duties were not restricted<span class="font-italic"> </span>to safeguarding persons from personal injury. As noted above at [51], Mason J held the following in <span class="font-italic">Kondis</span> at 687:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">As I said in <span class="font-italic">Introvigne</span> “the law has, for various reasons imposed a special duty on persons in certain situations to take particular precautions for the safety of others”. That statement should be expanded by adding a reference to<span class="font-italic"> safeguarding or protecting the property of other persons</span>, a matter which did not present itself for consideration in <span class="font-italic">Introvigne</span>. [emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">While Mason J did not expressly state that such a duty could extend to include safeguarding a person from sustaining pure economic losses, this observation demonstrates at least that personal injury is not the sole form of harm which non-delegable duties may arise to protect. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 Second, as noted at [23] above, the non-delegable nature of a duty has nothing to do with the <span class="font-italic">content </span>of the duty, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the level of care required by the duty, but relates instead to whether the duty, whatever it may be, can be completely discharged by a reasonable delegation of the task to a third party. This in turn depends generally on the nature of the relationship between the parties and what the duty bearer has undertaken to do (see [50] above). In our view, if the requisite relationship and undertaking exists, then even if the loss relates solely to a vulnerable victim’s economic well-being, a non-delegable duty could arise. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 Third, and finally, we accepted Mr Ang’s submission that because Singapore does not have an exclusionary rule in respect of pure economic loss (unlike English law), there should not be an <span class="font-italic">absolute bar</span> to the creation of non-delegable duties in respect of pure economic loss. In <span class="font-italic">RSP Architects Planners &amp; Engineers v Ocean Front Pte Ltd</span><span class="font-italic"> and another appeal</span> [1995] 3 SLR(R) 653 (“<span class="font-italic">Ocean Front</span>”) at [27], [74] and [75], this court recognised that even if the only loss arising from the negligent construction of a building was pure economic loss, such loss was nevertheless recoverable. This was also the holding of the court in <span class="font-italic">RSP Architects Planners &amp; Engineers v MCST Plan No 1075</span> [1999] 2 SLR(R) 134 (“<span class="font-italic">Eastern Lagoon</span>”), which affirmed <span class="font-italic">Ocean Front</span> (see the discussion at [16]–[32]). Therefore, short of a compelling justification, we found no reason to revive the exclusionary rule when considering the question of non-delegable duties. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Object and spirit of the BCA</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">71  While Mr Ang did not pursue the argument that the respondents were subject to a statutory non-delegable duty to build and design The Seaview with reasonable care, he submitted that it would be consistent with the object and spirit of the BCA to impose such a non-delegable duty in common law on the respondents. Mr Ang emphasised that ss 8(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) and (<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the BCA specifically required the appointment of builders and architects, and that the BCA imposed significant responsibilities on them in respect of the building and design of the condominium.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">72 In our judgment, the reasons for our conclusion that there was no basis for finding a broad statutory non-delegable duty to build and design The Seaview with reasonable care similarly justified rejecting this alternative submission. As mentioned at [41] above, we found that the express statutory language and the Parliamentary debates clearly showed that the BCA was never intended to deal with poor workmanship, but only with the structural safety and soundness of a building (and now, also environmental sustainability). In the circumstances, it was difficult to see how imposing a broad non-delegable duty of care on construction professionals, which extended far beyond ensuring structural safety and soundness of a building, would be consistent with the object and spirit of the BCA. In fact, given Parliament’s clear intention <span class="font-italic">not</span> to impose statutory duties on builders and architects in relation to poor workmanship and to place the responsibility on buyers to be discerning, it could even be said that establishing such a broad non-delegable duty of care would be <span class="font-italic">inconsistent</span> with Parliament’s intentions.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Consistency with existing common law principles</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">73 As mentioned at [61] above, the <span class="font-italic">Woodland</span> principles serve as a good starting point to consider whether the creation of a new category of non-delegable duties would be justified. Indeed, the parties in their submissions were in agreement that this was the right way forward. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">74 Mr Ang submitted that the defining features of the second category of non-delegable duties identified in <span class="font-italic">Woodland</span> (cited at [58] above) were present in the relationship between the MCST and the respondents:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) There was an antecedent relationship or assumption of duty towards the MCST by the Main Contractor and the Architect by reason of their agreement to be appointed as the required “competent professionals” under the BCA. The MCST is the developer’s successor and should not be viewed differently from the developer.

<div class="FootnoteRef text-justify"> Appellant’s case at para 81(3)</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">75 We began by considering the relationship between the MCST and the respondents. In this regard, we noted that there was <span class="font-italic">no direct contractual relationship</span> between them. The Main Contractor and the Architect individually contracted with the <span class="font-italic">developer</span>, and <span class="font-italic">not with each other</span><span class="font-italic"> (or the MCST)</span>. At that stage too, the MCST had not yet come into existence. That said, this did not automatically foreclose the possibility of an assumption of responsibility. In this regard, the observations of this court in <span class="font-italic">Eastern Lagoon</span> at [38] were germane and instructive:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">... RSP were involved in the development of the condominium right from the start. They were engaged by the developers to design and supervise the construction of the condominium including the common property and <span class="font-italic">the developers relied on the exercise of reasonable care and skill of their architects and they (the architects) undertook such responsibilities</span>. RSP as the architects were aware at that time that the developers would apply for subdivision of the units and upon completion of the construction of the units they would apply to register a strata title plan and apply for the issue of separate subsidiary strata certificates of title to the units. They were also aware that upon the registration of the strata title plans the management corporation would come into existence. <span class="font-italic">Vis-à-vis</span> the developers there was an assumption of responsibility of professional competence on the part of the architects and the architects knew that the developers would be relying on their exercising reasonable care and skill. <span class="font-italic">The management corporation which later came into existence was merely a statutory creation and was a successor to the developers with respect to the common property.</span> <span class="font-italic">In respect of such common property the architects knew that the management corporation would be in charge and would be managing the common property and would depend on their care and skill in the design and supervision of the construction of the common property.</span> In such a situation there was <span class="font-italic">sufficient degree of proximity in the </span><span class="font-italic">relationship between the management corporation and the architects</span> as would give rise to a duty on the part of the architects to avoid the loss as sustained by MCST in this case. [emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">76 As can be seen from the passage cited above, the court reached the conclusion that the architects did assume responsibility to the management corporation (even though they contracted with the <span class="font-italic">developer</span><span class="font-italic">s</span> only and not the management corporation) on the following grounds:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The architects assumed responsibility <span class="font-italic">towards the developer</span><span class="font-italic">s </span>because the developers relied on the architects’ exercise of reasonable care and skill. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The management corporation was the <span class="font-italic">successor to the developers</span> with respect to common property.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) The architects knew that the management corporation would come into existence, manage the common property, and whatever duty the architects owed to the developer would be transmitted to the management corporation.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">The same reasoning should apply, in our view, to builders (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the Main Contractor). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">77 It thus could be said that there was a degree of proximity and assumption of responsibility in the relationship between the MCST and the respondents. Having said that, it is important to note that the discussion in <span class="font-italic">Eastern Lagoon</span> took place in the context of establishing a<span class="font-italic"> duty of care in negligence</span>. The question which therefore remained was whether the degree of proximity and assumption of responsibility, although sufficient for establishing an ordinary tortious duty of care, was sufficient for establishing a <span class="font-italic">non-delegable duty of care</span>.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">78 We did not think it was. We noted that a number of the key features identified in <span class="font-italic">Woodland</span> were not present in the relationship between the MCST and the respondents. First, and most importantly, the MCST was in no sense ever in the “custody, care and charge” of the respondents (see point (2) at [58] above). Unlike the relationship between a school and its students, a hospital and its patients, or an employer and its employees, where it could meaningfully be said that the latter was in the “custody, care and charge” of the former, the MCST was never under the guardianship of the Main Contractor and/or the Architect. Indeed, it must be borne in mind that the MCST only came into existence <span class="font-italic">after</span> the Main Contractor and the Architect had finished their job. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">79 This point was underscored by the fact that neither of the respondents ever exercised any <span class="font-italic">control</span> over the MCST. It is worth repeating that the High Court of Australia in <span class="font-italic">Burnie</span><span class="font-italic"> Port Authority</span> at 551 found the “element of control” to be the defining feature of the relationships from which non-delegable duties arise (see [52] above). The most that could be said was that the Main Contractor and/or the Architect undertook their roles in the construction project <span class="font-italic">reasonably foreseeing</span> that any negligence by it or its subcontractors may cause harm to the MCST. This falls far short of the type of custodial relationships necessary to give rise to non-delegable duties. As Mason J observed in <span class="font-italic">Kondis</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at 687, “[t]he foreseeability of injury is not in itself enough to generate the special duty”. We agreed. In our judgment, the reasonable foreseeability of harm was a threshold requirement for establishing a basic tortious duty of care, and could not possibly be a <span class="font-italic">sufficient basis</span> for inferring an undertaking to indemnify the plaintiff from an independent contractor’s negligence. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">80 Second, we found that the MCST was not “especially vulnerable or dependent on the protection of the [respondents] against the risk of injury” (<span class="font-italic">Woodland</span> at [23], see also point (1) at [58] above). The “risk of injury” to the MCST in this case was the risk of pure economic loss arising from building defects in the common property. It was clear to us that the MCST was entirely able to protect itself against such a risk, independent of the respondents. As Mr Chelliah pointed out in his submissions,

<div class="FootnoteRef text-justify"> First Respondent’s Case at para 73</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> the MCST had alternative avenues of recourse, including a claim for breach of the contract against the developer, as well as a claim under the contractual warranties it has <span class="font-italic">vis-à-vis</span> the Main Contractor. Indeed, we would point out that in this case, the only reason why the MCST would not be able to recover substantial damages in contract against the developer (even if contractual breach is proved) was its <span class="font-italic">own failure</span>, and/or that of the relevant subsidiary proprietors, to join all the consenting subsidiary proprietors as parties to the suit prior to the expiry of the relevant limitation period (see <span class="font-italic">Management Corporation Strata Title Plan No 3322 v </span><span class="font-italic">Mer Vue Developments Pte Ltd </span>[2016] SGCA 38). Further, Parliament’s intention, as revealed in the Parliamentary debates, was to place the responsibility on buyers themselves to be discerning consumers and to take adequate measures to protect themselves against poor workmanship (see [38] above). Bearing all these circumstances in mind, we found that the MCST was in no sense especially vulnerable or dependent on the respondents for protection against the risk of economic loss arising from building defects in the common property. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">81 Third, we would point out that but for the fact that the developer had a claim in contract against the respondents, even the developer itself might not be able to defeat the defence of independent contractor if the claim of the developer against the respondents were entirely in tort. The developer was certainly not in the “custody, care and charge” of the respondents. It was free to contract with any builder and was free to set its own terms in relation to the construction of the project. It was particularly significant that the construction contract entered into between the developer and the Main Contractor expressly contemplated that the Main Contractor would engage sub-contractors of various trades and that the developer would accept the warranty certificates issued by the sub-contractors. All these were clearly inconsistent with the alleged idea that the Main Contractor was to be responsible for the wrongdoings of the sub-contractors. Looking at the transaction in its entirety,   it was wholly commercial. No party was especially vulnerable or dependent such as to require any special protection of the law. If the developer truly wanted to hold the Main Contractor liable for the negligence of its sub-contractors, it could have insisted on a contractual clause to that effect. Perhaps, it was all a matter of costs. If, however, no contractor was prepared to accept such a clause, then surely that would only mean the industry was not prepared to accept the extended liability. In the case of the Architect, the same rationale should apply. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">82 In the result, we found that nothing on the present facts satisfied the features elucidated in <span class="font-italic">Woodland</span> for a non-delegable duty of care to arise. We would also add that we could not see how the position of the MCST, being, as it asserted, the successor of the developer, could be any better than that of the developer. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Policy considerations</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">83 Finally, Mr Ang submitted that there were compelling policy reasons for recognising the Proposed Non-Delegable Duty:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Industry practice and expectations were that the respondents would take responsibility for building defects, even if the works were performed by a subcontractor.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">84 Policy considerations have no doubt been relevant to the development of this area of the law. In <span class="font-italic">Leichhardt</span> at [91], Kirby J observed that the “imposition of legal liability for the acts of others” was a category of liability which “has always been accepted as being based on considerations of legal policy”. In <span class="font-italic">Farraj</span><span class="font-italic"> and another v King’s Healthcare NHS Trust and another</span> [2010] 1 WLR 2139 (“<span class="font-italic">Farraj</span>”) at [91], Dyson LJ observed:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… I think that it is better to acknowledge that the question whether an employer owes a non-delegable duty of care to his employees to provide a safe system and whether a hospital generally owes a non-delegable duty to its patients <span class="font-italic">is one of policy for the courts to determine by reference to what is fair, just and reasonable</span>. … [emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">85 Indeed, going back to the origins of non-delegable duties in the employer-employee context, it has been recognised that the development of those duties was motivated by the policy consideration of avoiding the problems created by the doctrine of common employment (<span class="font-italic">Farraj</span> at [74], per Dyson LJ; <span class="font-italic">Liechhardt</span> at [155], per Hayne J; and <span class="font-italic">Lepore</span> at [250], per Gummow and Hayne JJ). It would thus not be a stretch to say that the creation of the categories of non-delegable duties was largely motivated by considerations of policy. This would explain the common critical view that the doctrine lacked a sound doctrinal foundation (<span class="font-italic">Leichhardt</span> at [142], per Hayne J), or that the cases were “no more than pragmatic responses to perceived injustices” (<span class="font-italic">Lepore</span> at [246], per Gummow and Hayne JJ). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">86 The historical relevance of policy considerations to the development of non-delegable duties is thus undeniable. Moving forward, we agree that policy considerations ought to remain relevant. We would not venture any firm view as to whether it can ever be justified in the future to develop new categories of non-delegable duties on an <span class="font-italic">ad hoc</span> basis. By its very nature, this is a fact-sensitive question. The case for it must be very compelling. Caution must be the order of the day. It is vital to ensure that there is coherence and consistency in the doctrine. As we mentioned at [63] above, there is much to say in favour of the view that the development of new categories of non-delegable duties should proceed only “on the basis of a clear analogy to a recognised class and then only for compelling reasons of legal principle and policy” (<span class="font-italic">Leichhardt</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [104], per Kirby J). Policy has to operate within the confines of legal principle. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">87 In the present case, for the reasons set out above, we found that existing legal principles simply did not permit the introduction of the Proposed Non-Delegable Duty. We also found that the policy considerations raised by Mr Ang were hardly compelling to justify an extension of the existing principles governing non-delegable duties. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">88 We did not consider Mr Ang’s submission on industry practice and expectations persuasive. He did not produce <span class="font-italic">any evidence</span> to support his case that industry practice and expectations were that the builder and/or architect would take responsibility for all building defects. Further, even if industry practice and expectations were indeed as he described, we did not think that this compelled the recognition of the Proposed Non-Delegable Duty. As noted above (at [81]), the imposition of liability on the builder and/or architect could be attained <span class="font-italic">via</span> contractual arrangements which the industry players were free to enter into, and did not justify what would be, in our view, an unprincipled expansion of the categories of non-delegable duties.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">89 The slightly more weighty policy argument, in our view, was that imposing liability on the builder and/or architect would enhance and facilitate the recourse which management corporations would have for building defects in common property. This essentially related to the points made at [83(b)]–[83(d)] above. While we recognised that without a non-delegable duty imposed on the builder and architect, management corporations might have to take up additional applications to ascertain the correct defendant, and might even end up suing a defendant who could not meet the full judgment sum, we found that this was part and parcel of any litigation and was an ordinary risk endemic in any investment, including the purchase of a property. In addition, the fear that there might not be sufficient proximity between the sub-contractor whose negligence actually caused the MCST loss was, in our judgment, completely unfounded and Mr Ang did not surface to us any case in which this was a problem. Finally, we would reiterate the point we made at [80] above that the MCST had alternative avenues of recourse in contract. The purported need to simplify the legal process of recovering damages for the MCST was not persuasive. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">90 On the whole, therefore, we did not think that the MCST had made out a case for the imposition of the Proposed Non-Delegable Duty on the Main Contractor and/or the Architect. Furthermore, given the increasing specialisation in the construction industry, which necessitates sub-contracting, it would be excessively onerous to impose legal liability on the respondents for defective building works which they might not even be equipped or qualified to undertake and/or supervise.   </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"></div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"></div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"></div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">91 To sum up, having considered the BCA, the relevant common law principles, as well as the policy concerns at play, we found that there was no basis to establish the Proposed Non-Delegable Duty. We therefore dismissed the appeal of the MCST in Civil Appeal No 37 of 2016. Costs of the appeal were awarded to the respondents. </div><div class="Judg-Sign text-left">Chao Hick Tin  Andrew Phang Boon Leong       Steven Chong<br/>Judge of Appeal Judge of Appeal        Judge </div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Samuel Seow and Jolene Lim (Samuel Seow Law Corporation); Ang Cheng Hock, SC, Ramesh Kumar and Benjamin Koh (Allen &amp; Gledhill LLP) (instructed) for the appellant;<br/>Ravi Chelliah, Sally Kiang and Edmund Chain (Chelliah &amp; Kiang LLC) for the first respondent;<br/>Thio Shen Yi, SC, Melvin Chan Kah Keen, Koong Len Sheng and Tan Tho Eng (TSMP Law Corporation) for the second respondent.<br/></div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
