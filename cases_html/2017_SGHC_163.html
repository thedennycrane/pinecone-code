In its amended form, the OS stated that the requirements as to the qualifications of the President under Art 19 of the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore (1999 Rev Ed) (“Constitution”), as well as recent amendments to introduce a framework for reserved elections under Art 19B of the Constitution, were inconsistent with Art 12 of the Constitution.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 The OS was filed on 22 May 2017 and named the Government (as represented by the Attorney-General) as the defendant. A hearing was scheduled on an expedited basis on 15 June 2017 as both parties agreed that there was some urgency for the OS to be heard. Indeed, I was given to understand that the sitting President’s term of office would expire on 31 August 2017 and that the writ for the upcoming Presidential election would be issued shortly.

</div>
</div> Having heard the parties, I dismissed the OS. I now set out the grounds for my decision. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Preliminary applications</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">3 The plaintiff, a former practising lawyer, filed the OS in his personal capacity. He styled himself as a “public interest litigator”. Before the hearing of the OS proper, the plaintiff made three preliminary applications. The first was an oral application for the proceedings to be heard in open court. The second, Summons No 2619 of 2017 (“SUM 2619/2017”), was an application for the Deputy Attorney-General, Mr Hri Kumar Nair <span class="font-italic">SC</span> (“Mr Kumar”), to be disqualified from having conduct of the proceedings on behalf of the Government. The third, Summons No 2710 of 2017 (“SUM 2710/2017”), was an application to amend the OS and to add new prayers to the same. I shall briefly address these preliminary applications <span class="font-italic">seriatim</span>.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The oral application for proceedings to be heard in open court</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">4 I start with the plaintiff’s oral application for the proceedings to be heard in open court. The plaintiff contended that this was a constitutional hearing since the OS affected the “fundamental rights of all citizens”. He likened it to an application under O 53 of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2014 Rev Ed) (“Rules of Court”) for judicial review, which would be heard in open court (subject to leave being granted). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">5 Mr Kumar, who appeared on behalf of the defendant, objected and pointed out that O 28 r 2 of the Rules of Court would govern the proceedings. This rule provides as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Hearing of originating summons (O. 28, r. 2)</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">2.</span>  All originating summonses shall be heard in Chambers, subject to any express provision of these Rules, any written law, any directions of the Court or any practice directions for the time being issued by the Registrar.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">6 Mr Kumar submitted that there was no exception contemplated for “constitutional” matters and that there was no special reason why an exception should be made in the present case. Moreover, Mr Kumar highlighted that the nature of the applications before the court involved scandalous allegations and remarks which were political attacks. He submitted that the plaintiff was motivated by a personal agenda to seek a hearing in open court. That agenda was already laid bare by his posts on Facebook, where he had sought crowdfunding for his litigation.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">7 For a while, the plaintiff maintained that matters of public importance going to the heart of the Constitution were being surfaced by him in the public interest. Somewhat abruptly, he then changed course and made an oral application to “convert” the OS to an application under O 53 of the Rules of Court for judicial review. He stated that he intended to seek a prohibitory order restraining the Prime Minister from proceeding with the upcoming Presidential election. Mr Kumar pointed out that this was essentially an attempt to avoid having to obtain leave to commence proceedings under O 53 of the Rules of Court and that, in any case, very different substantive reliefs were being sought.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">8 I dismissed the plaintiff’s oral application for the proceedings to be heard in open court and directed that the hearing of the OS before me continue in chambers as scheduled by the registry. I saw no reason to depart from the general rule in O 28 r 2 of the Rules of Court. Moreover, I saw no basis to allow a “conversion” of the OS to an application under O 53 of the Rules of Court. This was a barefaced attempt by the plaintiff to ignore and circumvent the requirement for leave under O 53 of the Rules of Court while hoping to have the hearing conducted in open court to suit his own purposes.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The application to disqualify Mr Kumar (SUM 2619/2017)</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">9 In SUM 2619/2017, the plaintiff applied for Mr Kumar to be disqualified from having conduct of the proceedings on behalf of the Government. This was on the ground that Mr Kumar, being a former People’s Action Party Member of Parliament (“PAP MP”) from 2011 to 2015, was partisan and in a position of conflict. The relevant portion of the application stated as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Mr Hri Kumar Nair, being a former member of the People's Action Party (PAP) and Member of Parliament (MP) for Bishan-Toa Payoh Group Representation Constituency (GRC) between 2011 and 2015, has partisan interest in this matter and is therefore conflicted in his duty to serve the interest of the public as Deputy Attorney-General and ought thereby be discharged from acting further in this matter.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">10 The plaintiff contended that Mr Kumar would not be able to fairly discharge his duties to the public as well as the Government. The plaintiff then went on at some length on the difficulty that various key appointment holders supposedly faced on account of the Prime Minister having the power and discretion to decide on such appointments, including the appointment and removal of judges and the Attorney-General. He also alluded to the importance of public perception and natural justice.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">11 Mr Kumar responded in these terms: he was appearing as counsel for the Government and it would be for the Government to complain if he was thought to be in a position of conflict given his former role as a PAP MP and his present role in advising and representing the Government. In any event, there was no case authority which established that public perception was a relevant consideration in determining whether he ought to be disqualified.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">12 I dismissed SUM 2619/2017 as I saw no basis in support of the application other than mere speculation and conjecture. I saw no reason why Mr Kumar would be unable to conduct his case fairly and objectively without conflict, having regard to the interests of the public and the Government.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The application to amend the OS (SUM 2710/2017)</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">13 The third, and final, preliminary application was SUM 2710/2017. This was filed by the plaintiff on 13 June 2017, just two days before the scheduled hearing of the OS on 15 June 2017. However, before I could proceed to hear the parties on the merits of the application, the plaintiff peremptorily announced that he would appeal against my dismissal of SUM 2619/2017. He also mentioned other possible applications he was planning to make, such as seeking a declaration that the Judiciary was “not capable of being independent” since the Prime Minister had complete control over all key appointments. The plaintiff then asserted that the matter should not proceed any further until his intended application for a declaratory order was dealt with.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">14 This was a rather curious and unexpected turn of events but it eventually transpired that the plaintiff was trying to seek an adjournment to read the submissions and authorities tendered by the defendant. He explained that he suffered from bipolar disorder, was a disabled person and had not slept the night before. If an adjournment was not allowed, he would have to go to see his doctor and obtain a medical certificate. He complained that he would be hampered in conducting his case if an adjournment was not granted.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">15 Mr Kumar objected to an adjournment. He pointed out that the plaintiff had agreed that the hearing should take place on an expedited basis, given that the sitting President’s term of office would expire on 31 August 2017 and that the writ for the upcoming Presidential election would be issued shortly. The plaintiff had informed the registry that he would be willing to take any hearing date before 20 June 2017. As such, the hearing date was well within his contemplation. Mr Kumar also highlighted that the plaintiff had failed to comply with the registry’s timelines for the filing of his submissions. In any event, the materials and authorities tendered by the defendant would not be new or surprising to the plaintiff since they related to the basic structure doctrine (arising from the decision of the Indian Supreme Court in <span class="font-italic">Kesavananda</span><span class="font-italic"> Bharati v State of Kerala </span>AIR 1973 SC 1461 (“<span class="font-italic">Kesavananda</span>”)) and the ambit of various constitutional provisions. I noted that these were matters the plaintiff himself had raised in his affidavit filed and affirmed on 22 May 2017 in support of the OS (“Supporting Affidavit”) and his skeletal arguments.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">16 The plaintiff emphasised that he was a constitutional law expert. Mr Kumar was quick on the uptake and responded that all the relevant cases should then be familiar to him and pose no difficulty or challenge. He submitted that the application for an adjournment was sought only to delay the proceedings and to give the plaintiff more time to consider making other possible applications. It was brought to my attention that the plaintiff had made a Facebook post the night before the hearing which plainly belied his claims of being inadequately prepared and tired. In this post, the plaintiff proclaimed to all and sundry that the “guns [were] blazing”, suggesting that he was ready and eager to put forward his arguments in court the next day. The plaintiff also appeared exuberant and confident, given his broadcasted plan of “[g]oing to club street for champs [<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, champagne] and a cigar”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">17 The plaintiff did not dispute making the Facebook post. His further response was simply that he had just texted his doctor. Presumably, if he had done so, this must have taken place in the midst of Mr Kumar’s submissions. I did not seek to verify whether such text exchanges with his doctor were indeed taking place, although I had observed the plaintiff to be checking his mobile phone regularly during the hearing. I had warned him that while he could conduct research online if he needed to do so, he was not to post anything on social media in the course of the hearing or to record the proceedings. The plaintiff claimed that his doctor had informed him to proceed to see him.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">18 I found the plaintiff’s efforts to procure an adjournment patently contrived and unconvincing. He only had himself to blame if he was truly inadequately prepared and tired. Moreover, the defendant had complied with the registry’s prescribed timelines for the filing of submissions. All said, the plaintiff’s complaints rang hollow and were also ironic insofar as he had himself failed to comply with the timelines for the filing of his submissions. I should add that for the entire time I had heard submissions up until this point (which was approximately 70 minutes into the hearing), the plaintiff’s energies and enthusiasm in putting forth his case certainly did not appear to wane in any way. For these reasons, I did not allow the adjournment sought by the plaintiff.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">19 Returning to SUM 2710/2017 proper, it is apposite at this juncture to set out the terms of the OS as it originally stood:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">1.  The elements of the Elected Presidency Scheme (“EPS”) is incapable of being construed as being consistent with Article 12 of the Constitution in that; it deprives citizens the right to stand for public office, namely the office of the Elected Presidency (“EP”),</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">2. The elements of the EPS is incapable of being construed as being consistent with Article 12 of the Constitution in that; it is discriminatory on the grounds of ethnicity and is contrary to Article 12(2) of the Constitution.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">20 In SUM 2710/2017, the plaintiff sought the following prayers:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">1. For leave to amend the following :</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">a.  The requirements as to the Qualifications of President under Article 19 of the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore (the “Constitution”) are incapable of being construed as being consistent with Article 12 of the Constitutions, in that it deprives citizens of the equal right to stand for public office, namely the office of the Elected Presidency (“EP”);</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">b.  The amendments to the Elected Presidency Scheme (the “EPS”) under the new Article 19B of the Constitution are incapable of being construed as being consistent with Article 12 of the Constitution, in that it is discriminatory on the grounds of race and is contrary to Article 12(2) of the Constitution;</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">c.  The amendments to the EPS, as introduced by the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore (Amendment) Act 2016, are incapable of being law as the amendments were politically motivated and passed in bad faith to block the candidacy of Mr Tan Cheng Bock, the erstwhile member of the People's Action Party (PAP);</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">d.  The appointment of Mr Lee Hsien Loong as the third Prime Minister (12 August 2004 to present) contravened Article 12(2) of the Constitution, in that it was done pursuant to a policy that was discriminatory on the ground of race;</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">e.  The appointment of Mr Goh Chok Tong as the second Prime Minister (from 28 November 1990 to 12 August 2004) contravened Article 12(2) of the Constitution, in that it was done pursuant to a policy that was discriminatory on the ground of race;</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">f.  Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam failed to assert his constitutional right to be considered equally for the office of Prime Minister, thereby failing in his ministerial responsibility to uphold Article 12(2) of the Constitution;</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">g.  Mr S Dhanabalan failed to assert his constitutional right to be considered equally for the office of Prime Minister, thereby failing in his ministerial responsibility to uphold Article 12(2) of the Constitution.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">21 When I proceeded to deal with SUM 2710/2017, this was only in relation to prayers 1(c) to 1(g) as the defendant did not object to the amendments sought by way of prayers 1(a) and 1(b). The plaintiff went on at some length with a diatribe outlining his views on Singapore politics and policies, such as how the 2016 amendments to the Constitution were politically motivated to keep Mr Tan Cheng Bock out of the running as a potential candidate for the Presidency. Tangentially, the plaintiff then pointed to supposedly racially-discriminatory pronouncements made by former Prime Minister Mr Lee Kuan Yew in 1990, which resulted in Mr S Dhanabalan being discriminated against so that Mr Goh Chok Tong would be the Prime Minister succeeding Mr Lee Kuan Yew. He associated this with a regime of “apartheid” based on “eugenics”. Hence, he argued that the appointments of Mr Goh Chok Tong and Mr Lee Hsien Loong as Prime Ministers thereafter were made in contravention of Art 12 of the Constitution. Finally, the plaintiff maintained that Deputy Prime Minister Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam and Mr S Dhanabalan had failed to assert their constitutional rights and failed in their ministerial responsibility in not coming forward to uphold Art 12 of the Constitution.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">22 Mr Kumar pointed out, firstly, that the application to amend the OS was filed late in breach of the timelines prescribed by the registry. On the substantive aspects, Mr Kumar submitted that even if the amendments in prayers 1(c) to 1(g) were allowed, the application was bound to fail. The submissions mirrored those being made in the OS to some extent, including an argument that the plaintiff had no standing to make the application in prayer 1(c): Mr Tan Cheng Bock, a former PAP MP and Presidential election candidate, was not himself mounting a legal challenge on the same basis. With respect to prayers 1(d) to 1(g), these would also introduce matters that had nothing to do with the terms of the OS in its original form, which centred on the EPS. As the causes of action were unrelated, it would not be appropriate to add them, and it would be prejudicial to the defendant if this were to be allowed. Moreover, the appointments of Mr Goh Chok Tong and Mr Lee Hsien Loong as Prime Ministers were political in nature and were not justiciable matters. In respect of Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam and Mr S Dhanabalan, no constitutional rights had been violated and any challenge was legally unsustainable. In addition, it was contended that the plaintiff had no factual basis for prayers 1(c) to 1(g).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">23 I accepted Mr Kumar’s submissions and allowed the plaintiff leave to amend the OS only insofar as the original prayers 1 and 2 were to stand amended in the terms set out in prayers 1(a) and 1(b) of SUM 2710/2017. Prayers 1(c) to 1(g) of SUM 2710/2017, which sought to add new prayers, were disallowed. The substance of the OS thus remained much the same as what was originally filed.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The OS</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 Turning now to the substantive aspects of the OS (in its amended form), the two prayers framed by the plaintiff, to recapitulate, were in the following terms:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">a. The requirements as to the Qualifications of President under Article 19 of the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore (the “Constitution”) are incapable of being construed as being consistent with Article 12 of the Constitutions, in that it deprives citizens of the equal right to stand for public office, namely the office of the Elected Presidency (“EP”);</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">b.  The amendments to the Elected Presidency Scheme (the “EPS”) under the new Article 19B of the Constitution are incapable of being construed as being consistent with Article 12 of the Constitution, in that it is discriminatory on the grounds of race and is contrary to Article 12(2) of the Constitution;</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 By the first prayer, the plaintiff essentially sought to impugn Art 19 of the Constitution, which sets out the qualifications of the President, on the basis of inconsistency with Art 12 of the Constitution. By the second prayer, the plaintiff essentially sought to impugn Art 19B of the Constitution, which sets out the framework for reserved elections, on the basis of inconsistency with Art 12(2) of the Constitution. The plaintiff did not file any further affidavit in support of the OS as amended. His only affidavit before me was therefore the Supporting Affidavit. In it, the plaintiff also referred to the basic structure doctrine.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 An overview of the relevant constitutional provisions is perhaps apposite at this point.

It is the onus on the judiciary to protect this explicit right to vote where arisen before the courts; and accordingly, the right to political participation and to stand for any public office, including an Elected Presidency, once they meet the right qualifications, just like the right qualification to stand in general election (or by-election), whatever the case may be.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-underline">Basic Structure Doctrine &amp; Right to Stand for Public Office</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">8.  The EPS goes against the Basic Structure Doctrine as it goes against the fundamental rights of a Singapore citizen, herein their right to stand for public office. Per <span class="font-italic">Kesavanda</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>it was written “A constitutional amendment that sought to destroy the basic structure of the constitution would be beyond the power of parliament could be struck down by the courts”, and “every provision of the Constitution can be amended provided in the result the basic foundation and structure of the Constitution remains the same”. The EPS seeks to destroy the basic structure of the Constitution and pose a risk of it being significantly altered and changed – thereby going against the very construct of the Singapore Constitution as so framed.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">9.  The Basic Structure Doctrine connotes that any constitutional amendment that goes against the basic structure or key tenets of the constitution will be deemed invalid. I purport that the EPS is a constitutional amendment that goes against the basic structure doctrine as an overarching parliamentary power, that mandated a constitutional amendment independently, separate of the other two organs of state.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">10.  As such, this is also a breach of the rule of law – as a key part of the Constitution. The rule of law where interpreted as a key principle of constitutionalism, assumes a division of governmental powers or functions that inhibits the exercise of arbitrary state power. The Basic Structure Doctrine is also accepted and recognised by the Malaysian Courts, in the landmark case of <span class="font-italic">Sivarasa</span><span class="font-italic"> Rasiah</span>.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-underline">Discrimination on grounds of ethnicity</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">11. The recent amendments made to the EPS where an election will be reserved for a particular racial group goes against Article 12(2) of the Constitution, which states, “Except as expressly authorised by this Constitution, there shall be no discrimination against citizens of Singapore on the ground only of religion, race, descent or place of birth in any law or in the appointment to any office or employment under a public authority ...”. Thus, the racial requirement in the upcoming reserved election and the hiatus-trigger status serves as discrimination on the above prohibited classification as highlighted by the Constitution and is therefore constitutionally prohibited in its execution.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">12.  I therefore submit that the EPS as per Article 12 of the Constitution causes discrimination on the grounds of ethnicity. No citizen of Singapore or candidate of the presidency should be discriminated against grounds of race for reasons of applying for elected presidency.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">13.  The selection of the elected candidate should be based upon merit, all other relevant requirements being fulfilled and withstanding.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-underline">The Legality Principle &amp; Independent Judicial Review</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">14.  In respect of the EPS and the recent changes passed by Parliament, I posit that there should be imposed legal constraints on the limitation of parliamentary power through court-adjudicated judicial review. As critically, for any legal framework to operate as it should, the Government itself had to abide by the law. The Basic Structure Doctrine further posits that there is a basic structure to the Constitution that constrains the legislature. This presents that, parliament cannot amend certain fundamental features or elements of the Constitution on its own without independent judicial review, as per the Legality Principle in <span class="font-italic">Chng</span><span class="font-italic"> Suan Tze</span>, which connotes that all power has legal limits. The amended changes to the EPS is therefore unconstitutional. It is an inherent principle that fundamental rights should be protected by an according impartial and independent judiciary.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">15.  Singapore remains committed to the Rule of Law as a foundational principle, with the Constitution reigning as the supreme law of the land, entrenched within this are the Separation of Powers, the Basic Structure Doctrine. The EPS therefore goes against the basic structure doctrine and is also incapable of being construed as being consistent with Article 12 of the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore, is in contravention to the Basic Structure Doctrine, depriving citizens of the fundamental right to stand for public office, and promotes discrimination on the grounds of ethnicity, thereby proving it to be unconstitutional.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">...</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 The plaintiff tendered skeletal arguments during the hearing, in which he outlined his arguments. He began by stating that his application entailed addressing “the question of our inalienable right to equality enshrined under Article 12 of the Constitution, namely Singapore citizen’s equal right to stand for elections regardless of class, status, position of institutional power in society or wealth” and “regardless of our colour or variety of speech or belief, namely, race, language or religion”. I reproduce below the following paragraphs of the plaintiff’s skeletal arguments:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Notion of representative democracy </span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">2. Our constitution is founded on the notion of representative democracy which essentially encompasses the notion of of inalienable rights as citizens, that is, the equal right to stand to stand for election regardless of status or colour and the right to equal treatment before the law is preserved within Dicey’s principle of rule of law in that all are equal before the law and are entitled to equal protection and that no one is above the law.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Separation of powers</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">3. The notion that the aforesaid inalienable right to equality as enumerated under paragraph 1 above cannot be impeached or limited by way of a legislation brings us to the notion of separation of powers which forms the foundation of modern constitutional democracy inspired by Montesqieu’s doctrine of separation of powers. that the Executive Legislature and the Judiciary as being independent arms of the state. This doctrine recognises the fundamental role of the judiciary to curb the excesses of the Executive.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">4. Hence the amendments under Article 19B is not capbable of being construed as law because it essentially removes the power of the judiciary to check on the constitutional breaches of fundamental guarantees like the right to equality as explained earlier. The notion of inalienability of fundamental rights, namely, right to equality under article 12 and 12(2) are non derogable rights. Any attempt to redefine the notion of equality like the case of the EPS is a surreptitious attempt to dismantle fundamental right (to equality) and put into disrepute the notion of inalienable rights and fundamental guarantees like the right to vote and the equal right to stand for elections.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Basic Feature Doctrine</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">5. The notions of representative democracy and separation of powers brings us to the next foundation of constitutional democracy, namely the Basic feature Doctrine. in other words there are certain basic features of the constitution like the separation of powers and inaliable rights which form the gundamental gurantees of the Singapore constitution cannot be abrogated, amended or removed by way of parliamentary enactment or legislation. This is the position in the common wealth countries including India, South African and Malaysia.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Is Basic Feature Doctrine recognised in Singapore?</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">The answer is yes:</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 The plaintiff then went on to quote an article by Asst Prof Swati Jhaveri in its entirety. The plaintiff did not state the provenance of this article, but I gathered that it was a blog post that was downloaded and printed off the Internet (Swati Jhaveri, “Recent Judicial Comments on the Basic Structure of the Constitution” (20 April 2016) (https://singaporepubliclaw.com/2016/04/20/ recent-judicial-comments-on-the-basic-structure-of-the-constitution/)). The plaintiff then went on to assert, without further elaboration, that “Basic Feature Doctrine was also recognised by the Malaysian courts recently”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 During the hearing, the plaintiff tendered a second article written by Calvin Liang and Sarah Shi which was published in the Singapore Law Gazette (Calvin Liang &amp; Sarah Shi, “The Constitution of Our Constitution: A Vindication of the Basic Structure Doctrine” (http://www.lawgazette.com.sg/ 2014-08/1104.htm) (“The Constitution of Our Constitution”)). Relying on both articles, and also on Chan Sek Keong CJ’s paper based on his lecture delivered at the Rule of Law Symposium 2012 (Chan Sek Keong, “The Courts and the ‘Rule of Law’ in Singapore” [2012] Sing JLS 209 (“The Courts and the ‘Rule of Law’ in Singapore”)), the plaintiff asserted that the basic structure doctrine was central to a framework of constitutional democracy and was part of Singapore law. The basic structure doctrine, as formulated by the Indian Supreme Court in <span class="font-italic">Kesavananda</span>, operates to invalidate constitutional amendments in violation of the “basic structure” of the Constitution. In the present case, it would therefore have operated to prevent attempts to abrogate or amend the non-derogable and fundamentally-guaranteed rights in the Constitution. The plaintiff appeared to contend that this would include the right to equal protection in Art 12 of the Constitution, flowing from which the right to vote and the right to stand for elections ought to be guaranteed as fundamental and inalienable rights for all citizens.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 The plaintiff further contended that the three recent decisions of the Court of Appeal cited in The Constitution of Our Constitution supported his submission that the basic structure doctrine was recognised in Singapore, namely <span class="font-italic">Yong </span><span class="font-italic">Vui Kong v Attorney-General </span>[2011] 2 SLR 1189 (“<span class="font-italic">Yong </span><span class="font-italic">Vui Kong 2011</span>”), <span class="font-italic">Tan </span><span class="font-italic">Eng Hong v Attorney-General</span> [2012] 4 SLR 476 (“<span class="font-italic">Tan </span><span class="font-italic">Eng Hong</span>”) and <span class="font-italic">Vellama</span><span class="font-italic"> d/o Marie Muthu v Attorney-General</span> [2013] 4 SLR 1 (“<span class="font-italic">Vellama</span>”). He had acted as counsel in all three cases. He maintained that the notion of a constantly-evolving Constitution could not be right as the Constitution could not simply be changed willy-nilly. In his view, the less one changed the Constitution, the more stable it was.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 In his reply submissions, the plaintiff disputed Mr Kumar’s point that he had no standing to bring the application. Relying on <span class="font-italic">Tan </span><span class="font-italic">Eng Hong</span>, he submitted that it was not necessary for him to assert a private right or show that he had suffered special damage. He maintained that he had a real and genuine interest in the subject-matter. Notwithstanding that he had no personal interest in politics or in becoming a candidate for the Presidency, even as a bystander or “busybody”, he could come to court to seek to correct a “flagrant abuse by the State”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 The plaintiff further claimed that his challenge was premised on Art 12 of the Constitution as the appointment of the President was made by the Prime Minister on the ground of race and the former came under the “puppetry” of the latter. Finally, the plaintiff asserted that wool was being pulled over the eyes of the electorate. He maintained that Art 19B of the Constitution excluded the possibility of other minorities (such as Eurasians, Sri Lankans and Sikhs) being considered within the reserved elections framework, and that a race issue “suddenly” emerged overnight.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Summary of the defendant’s submissions</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 The defendant’s written submissions proceeded on certain assumptions as to the basis for the plaintiff’s application, given that it was unclear what was being sought in the OS. Aside from arguing that the plaintiff had no standing to bring the application, the defendant’s primary arguments were as follows. First, it was submitted that the basic structure doctrine was not recognised in Singapore and was incompatible with our constitutional framework. Next, it was submitted that there was no unqualified constitutional right to stand for President. Lastly, it was submitted that the reserved elections framework (introduced by Art 19B of the Constitution) was not racially discriminatory. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 In his oral submissions, Mr Kumar made the preliminary point that the plaintiff had no standing as it was not suggested that any of his private rights had been violated. Mr Kumar submitted that the plaintiff’s own rights under Art 12 of the Constitution had not been violated, since the plaintiff had disavowed any interest in running for the Presidency. In addition, the plaintiff had not demonstrated any exceptionally grave or widespread illegality or an egregious breach of law that might afford him standing to maintain the action. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 In <span class="font-italic">Teo</span><span class="font-italic"> Soh Lung v Minister for Home Affairs and others</span> [1989] 1 SLR(R) 461 (“<span class="font-italic">Teo</span><span class="font-italic"> Soh Lung</span>”), F A Chua J rejected the application of the basic structure doctrine in Singapore, and Mr Kumar submitted that this remained good law and ought to be followed. A key aspect of Chua J’s reasoning was that the basic structure doctrine, if adopted, would amount to judicial usurpation of the legislative function. Mr Kumar accepted that it could be broadly postulated that there was a “basic structure” to the Constitution in the sense that the Constitution rested on overarching principles such as the rule of law and the separation of powers. However, the basic structure doctrine went further to prevent Parliament from amending certain “basic features” of the Constitution, even if all prescribed procedures for amendment had been lawfully complied with. He added there had been no universal acceptance of the basic structure doctrine, which was, in any event, controversial. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 Mr Kumar contended that the basic structure doctrine would not apply to the EPS. In particular, it was pointed out that Art 368 of the Constitution of India (“the Indian Constitution”) only provided for amendment, while Art 5 of the Constitution specifically contemplated that an amendment to the Constitution included a repeal of its provisions. On the basis of an equivalent provision in the Constitution of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka, the Sri Lankan court had refused to adopt the basic structure doctrine.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 Mr Kumar traced the legislative history to Art 5 of the Constitution which showed that the power to amend the Constitution was not substantively limited. If the basic structure doctrine were found to be applicable, it would sanction a retrograde concept which impeded progressive changes to the Constitution, including changes to remove disenfranchisement. Should it be found to apply, it could only prevent amendments which were fundamental and essential to the political system, for instance, where judicial powers were being removed by such amendments. Tracking the origins of the EPS, Mr Kumar further highlighted that, historically, there was no popularly-elected Presidency until 1991 when the Constitution was amended. This exposed the logical flaw in the plaintiff’s arguments: how could there have been a breach in 1991, when the pre-1991 position in fact did not even allow for an elected Presidency and the corresponding right to stand for elections? Art 19 of the Constitution could not be characterised as a derogation of rights when the changes enabled a more open system where a President could be elected, compared to the pre-existing system which did not allow for such.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 As for the plaintiff’s contention (or supposed contention, since he was not clear) that the requirements for pre-qualification of Presidential election candidates were discriminatory and in violation of Art 12(1) of the Constitution, Mr Kumar submitted that this was unobjectionable as Art 19 of the Constitution was rationally related to the purpose of identifying qualified candidates and did not violate Art 12 of the Constitution as intelligible differentiators had been employed. It was not sufficient for the plaintiff to merely suggest that he might have a different opinion on the qualifying criteria. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 Finally, Mr Kumar submitted that the recently-introduced reserved elections framework in Art 19B of the Constitution was not discriminatory or in violation of Art 12(2) of the Constitution. Art 19B of the Constitution sought to ensure multiracial representation and therefore could not be said to be racially discriminatory. In any event, the Constitution was not race-neutral and the point had been specifically considered by the Presidential Council for Minority Rights (“PCMR”). In addition, Art 152 of the Constitution expressly enjoined the Government to care for the interests of racial and religious minorities. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">My decision</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Standing</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 I address first the issue of standing. In <span class="font-italic">Vellama</span>, the Court of Appeal observed (at [34]) that the rules on standing espouse an ethos of judicial review focused on vindicating personal rights and interests through adjudication rather than determining public policy through exposition. The court went on to say that matters of public policy are the proper remit of the Executive, and decoupling judicial review from the fundamental precepts of adversarial litigation would leave the courts vulnerable to being misused as a platform for political point-scoring. In <span class="font-italic">Jeyaretnam</span><span class="font-italic"> Kenneth Andrew v Attorney-General</span> [2014] 1 SLR 345 (“<span class="font-italic">Jeyaretnam</span>”), the Court of Appeal noted (at [34]) that the rules on standing in public law are put in place in order to prevent the wastage of the court’s time and public money by the multiplicity of litigation brought by busybodies that could amount to an abuse of the legal process. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 In this regard, the defendant submitted that an individual had to satisfy one of the following criteria in order to establish standing: (a) a violation of a right personal to him; (b) an interference with, or violation of, a public right which had caused him special damage which distinguished his claim from those of other potential litigants in the same class; or (c) where no correlative rights, private or public, were generated by the alleged breach of public duty, a breach of sufficient gravity such that it would be in the public interest for the courts to hear the case.

</div> [emphasis added] – which was precisely what did <span class="font-italic">not</span>, in and of itself, give rise to standing.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 With regard to (b), the defendant relied on <span class="font-italic">Vellama</span>, where the Court of Appeal held (at [31]) that the applicant who asserts no more than a public right must demonstrate that the interference with, or violation of, such a public right has caused him “special damage”. As to the distinction between public and private rights, the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Tan </span><span class="font-italic">Eng Hong </span>held (at [69]) that a public right is one which is held and vindicated by public authorities, whereas a private right is one which is held and vindicated by a private individual. In <span class="font-italic">Vellama</span>, the Court of Appeal elaborated on this, stating (at [32]–[33]) that:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… Where the alleged interference with the public interest also affects an applicant’s private right, the court will recognise the applicant’s standing to seek relief. This is so regardless of the existence of identical private rights held by other potential litigants in the same class as the applicant …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Where the applicant asserts no more than a public right which is <span class="font-italic">shared in common</span> with other citizens, however, standing accrues only if a nexus between the applicant and the desired remedy is established by demonstrating “special damage”. Public rights are shared in common because they arise from public duties which are owed to the general class of affected persons as a whole. It is in this sense that public rights are “held and vindicated by public authorities” … As public rights are shared with the public in common, an applicant cannot have standing unless he has suffered some “special damage” which distinguishes his claim from those of other potential litigants in the same class. …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis in original]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 The Court of Appeal went on to emphasise (at [33]) that if “special damage” were not to be required, it is likely that the courts will be inundated by a multiplicity of actions, some raised by mere busybodies and social gadflies, to the detriment of good public administration; the requirement is a safeguard against essentially political issues, which should be more appropriately ventilated elsewhere, being camouflaged as legal questions. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 In the present case, it would appear that the plaintiff was attempting to assert a public right which he shared in common with other citizens, seeing as to how he alluded to an “equal right to stand for elections”

There was no nexus between the plaintiff and the prayers sought in the OS, and it was impossible to see how he could be said to have suffered any “special damage” which distinguished his claim from those of other potential applicants in the same class.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 As for (c), the defendant relied on <span class="font-italic">Jeyaretnam</span>, where the Court of Appeal opined (at [62]) that “special damage” might also possibly encompass those rare and exceptional situations where a public body has breached its public duties in such an egregious manner that the courts are satisfied that it would be in the public interest to hear it. However, the court reiterated that this is a very narrow avenue which concerns only extremely exceptional instances of very grave and serious breaches of legality. The court went on to hold (at [64]) that in the rare case where a non-correlative rights generating public duty is breached, and the breach is of sufficient gravity such that it would be in the public interest for the courts to hear the case, an applicant <span class="font-italic">sans </span>rights may be accorded <span class="font-italic">locus </span><span class="font-italic">standi </span>as well, at the discretion of the courts. In this category of cases, there has to be “some exceptionally grave or widespread illegality” or “egregious breaches of the law” (<span class="font-italic">Jeyaretnam</span> at [60]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 In the present case, there was really nothing in the plaintiff’s submissions which disclosed any breach of sufficient gravity to make it in the public interest for the courts to hear the case, so as to confer standing on the plaintiff. Moreover, it was undisputed that Arts 19 and 19B of the Constitution were both validly enacted in accordance with the stipulated procedures. Specifically, the amendments that brought them into effect were procedurally regular and validly effected pursuant to the power to amend as set out at Art 5 of the Constitution. In the circumstances, I was of the view that the plaintiff failed to establish standing based on this criterion as well.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 All things considered, the plaintiff had no standing and the OS failed at this preliminary hurdle. Adopting the language used in the cases, the plaintiff was a mere busybody and a social gadfly. He was not serious about making legal arguments. Instead, by seeking to ventilate essentially political issues which were barely camouflaged as legal questions, he was patently and unacceptably attempting to misuse the court as a platform for political point-scoring. Fundamentally, he was neither directly nor personally affected by Art 19 or Art 19B of the Constitution. The plaintiff did not seriously dispute this, notwithstanding his somewhat flippant claim that, while he did not presently have any interest in standing for the upcoming Presidential election, he might later change his mind. At the same time, there was also no discernible breach of sufficient gravity to make it in the public interest for the courts to hear the case.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 For completeness, I will nevertheless proceed to set out my views on the substantive merits of the OS. I have set out the plaintiff’s submissions at some length at [29]–[35] above. The lack of clarity to the plaintiff’s precise grounds of challenge was at once both troubling and bizarre. In the end, I took the view that the most sensible thing to do was to give the plaintiff the benefit of the doubt and approach matters by taking his case at its highest. In this regard, it appeared to me that the clearest version of the plaintiff’s case was to be found in the Supporting Affidavit. Using this as a point of reference, I gathered that the plaintiff’s case, at its highest, comprised three separate grounds of challenge based on: (a) the basic structure doctrine; (b) Art 12(1) of the Constitution; and (c) Art 12(2) of the Constitution. Also, notwithstanding some references to the “right to vote” in the Supporting Affidavit and the plaintiff’s skeletal arguments, it was clear that the plaintiff was not contending that this right had been violated. Rather, as will be seen, his complaint related to the “right” to stand for public office/elections. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The basic structure doctrine</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 In the Supporting Affidavit, the plaintiff contended that the “basic structure” offended in this case was the “right to stand for public office”.

</div>
</div> Although not entirely clear, it appeared that, to the plaintiff, this “right to stand for public office” flowed from Art 12 of the Constitution. It was not altogether clear whether this ground of challenge was targeted at Art 19 or Art 19B of the Constitution, or both. Notwithstanding, I again took the plaintiff’s case at its highest and assumed that he was seeking to impugn both Arts 19 and 19B of the Constitution. Thus, this ground of challenge was premised on two assumptions: (a) that the basic structure doctrine applied in Singapore; and (b) that the “right to stand for public office” formed part of the “basic structure” of the Constitution.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(1) Applicability of the basic structure doctrine in Singapore</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 The basic structure doctrine is sometimes also referred to as the basic features doctrine. Notwithstanding that there may be valid distinctions between the two terms, neither party appeared to regard the two terms as different and I will therefore proceed on this basis in these grounds of decision. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 The basic structure doctrine has its origins in the decision of the Indian Supreme Court in <span class="font-italic">Kesavananda</span>. As noted by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Yong </span><span class="font-italic">Vui Kong v Public Prosecutor</span> [2015] 2 SLR 1129 (“<span class="font-italic">Yong </span><span class="font-italic">Vui Kong 2015</span>”) (at [69]), the basic structure doctrine postulates that there are certain fundamental features of a constitution that cannot be amended by Parliament. This is even if the prescribed procedures enabling amendment are adhered to. The basic structure doctrine has not received explicit judicial recognition as being part of Singapore law. To the contrary, it was rejected by Chua J in <span class="font-italic">Teo</span><span class="font-italic"> Soh Lung</span>. Chua J held (at [34], [35] and [47]) that:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">If the framers of the Singapore Constitution had intended limitations on the power of amendment, they would have expressly provided for such limitations. But Art 5 of the Constitution does not put any limitation on the amending power.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">If the courts have the power to impose limitations on the Legislature’s power of constitutional amendments, they would be usurping Parliament’s legislative function contrary to Art 58 of the Constitution. …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">I am of the view that the <span class="font-italic">Kesavananda</span> doctrine is not applicable to our Constitution. Considering the differences in the making of the Indian and our Constitution, it cannot be said that our Parliament’s power to amend our Constitution is limited in the same way as the Indian Parliament’s power to amend the Indian Constitution. …</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 When the matter went on appeal, the Court of Appeal considered it unnecessary to consider the applicability of the basic structure doctrine (<span class="font-italic">Teo</span><span class="font-italic"> Soh Lung v Minister for Home Affairs and others</span> [1990] 1 SLR(R) 347 at [44]).<span class="font-italic"> </span>In <span class="font-italic">Cheng Vincent v Minister for Home Affairs</span><span class="font-italic"> and others</span> [1990] 1 SLR(R) 38, Law Kew Chai J concurred (at [32]) with Chua J’s rejection of the basic structure doctrine in <span class="font-italic">Teo</span><span class="font-italic"> Soh Lung</span>. A few points were clear. First, no Court of Appeal decision had squarely addressed the issue of whether the basic structure doctrine applied in Singapore. Second, the prevailing position taken by the High Court answered this question in the negative. Third, however, this position was not binding on me. That said, various subsequent cases and commentaries appeared to support the basic structure doctrine, and it is to these that I now turn.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 In <span class="font-italic">Mohammad </span><span class="font-italic">Faizal bin Sabtu v Public Prosecutor</span> [2012] 4 SLR 947 (“<span class="font-italic">Mohammad </span><span class="font-italic">Faizal</span>”), Chan CJ (sitting as the High Court) held (at [11]) that “[t]he principle of separation of powers, whether conceived as a sharing or a division of sovereign power between these three organs of state, is therefore <span class="font-italic">part of the basic structure of the Singapore Constitution</span>” [emphasis added]. It appeared that Chan CJ was saying, firstly, that there is a “basic structure” to the Constitution and, secondly, that the principle of separation of powers forms part of this “basic structure”. However, Chan CJ made no reference to <span class="font-italic">Kesavananda</span> or <span class="font-italic">Teo</span><span class="font-italic"> Soh Lung</span> and it was therefore unclear if the “basic structure” he had in mind was the same as that contemplated by the basic structure doctrine. Indeed, it would appear that those cases would not have, in any event, been relevant in the context of <span class="font-italic">Mohammad </span><span class="font-italic">Faizal</span>, which dealt with the constitutionality of certain provisions in s 33A of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2008 Rev Ed). In Kevin YL Tan, “Into the matrix: Interpreting the Westminster model constitution” in <span class="font-italic">Constitutional Interpretation in Singapore: Theory and practice</span> (Routledge, 2017) (Jaclyn L Neo ed) (“<span class="font-italic">Constitutional Interpretation in Singapore</span>”) ch 3, Prof Kevin YL Tan in fact suggested (at p 69) that Chan CJ’s reference to the “basic structure” of the Constitution was <span class="font-italic">not</span> a reference to the basic structure doctrine. Prof Tan then went on to argue (at pp 69–70) that:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… Chan CJ’s ‘basic structure’ argument [in <span class="font-italic">Mohammad </span><span class="font-italic">Faizal</span>] is quite different and rather more limited in scope. The ‘basic structure’ of the Constitution derives from the Westminster model which separates or distributes state power between the three functional branches of government, and which ‘adopted and codified most, if not all, of the laws, customs, conventions and practices of the British constitutional and parliamentary system’. Chan CJ’s ‘basic structure’ derives from the matrix of the Westminster model and is grounded in history, legal precedent, and the logic of legal continuity. Put another way, so long as Singapore purports to have a constitution founded on the Westminster model, such a basic structure must exist. It would be an abuse and travesty to otherwise call it a Westminster-style constitution.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">By adopting the ‘basic structure’ argument, the court puts minimal constraints on Parliament’s powers to amend the Constitution. Provided the requisite procedures are followed and the necessary majorities obtained, the Constitution may be amended. The only constraints are those imposed by the structural matrix and by the common law. This necessarily limits what the courts can do to thwart Parliament’s power, unlike the much more expansive ‘basic features’ doctrine under which a constellation of judicially determined extra-constitutional ‘features’ serve to limit the amendment power of the Constitution itself. The latter is not a structural argument but was formulated by the Indian judges reading the Preamble and the whole scheme of the Constitution. Such an interpretive approach gives judges much greater latitude in determining what constraints it can place on parliamentary power.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 In Andrew J Harding, “Does the ‘basic structure doctrine’ apply in Singapore’s Constitution? An inquiry into some fundamental constitutional premises” in <span class="font-italic">Constitutional Interpretation in Singapore</span> ch 2, Prof Andrew J Harding similarly suggested (at p 32) that Chan CJ’s reference to the Constitution’s “basic structure” in <span class="font-italic">Mohammad </span><span class="font-italic">Faizal</span> was not a reference to the basic structure doctrine. Instead, Prof Harding characterised Chan CJ’s approach – of interpreting constitutional provisions in line with the separation of powers as an aspect of “basic structure” – as “unexceptional”. Pointedly, Prof Harding concluded (at p 44) that “[u]nder Singapore’s current constitution, it is not convincingly arguable that the basic structure doctrine applies in Singapore”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 However, in <span class="font-italic">Yong </span><span class="font-italic">Vui Kong 2015</span>, the Court of Appeal read (at [69]) Chan CJ’s remarks in <span class="font-italic">Mohammad </span><span class="font-italic">Faizal</span> as a reference to the basic structure doctrine. The court further stated that “[a]n example of a feature that is part of the basic structure of the Constitution is the separation of powers (as was held in <span class="font-italic">Mohammad </span><span class="font-italic">Faizal</span>)” and that “[a]nother example is possibly the right to vote”. It then observed (at [71]) that “in order for a feature to be considered part of the basic structure of the Constitution, it must be something fundamental and essential to the political system that is established thereunder”. These points were made in the context of the constitutionality of caning. Ultimately, however, the Court of Appeal declined (at [72]) to express any view on the applicability of the basic structure doctrine in Singapore since it was not considering the validity of a constitutional amendment.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 In The Courts and the ‘Rule of Law’ in Singapore, Chan CJ stated, extra-judicially (at p 223), that:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-italic">The judicial power is part of the basic structure of the Constitution</span> and its exercise through judicial review is the cornerstone of the ‘rule of law’. It is the means by which the courts check illegality, whether of legislative or executive acts. …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">Given the subsequent reference made by Chan CJ in this paper to <span class="font-italic">Kesavananda</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>and <span class="font-italic">Teo</span><span class="font-italic"> Soh Lung</span>, it would appear that, in this instance, Chan CJ had in mind the basic structure doctrine.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 In The Constitution of Our Constitution, Liang and Shi relied on the Court of Appeal’s decisions in <span class="font-italic">Yong </span><span class="font-italic">Vui Kong 2011</span>, <span class="font-italic">Tan </span><span class="font-italic">Eng Hong</span> and <span class="font-italic">Vell</span><span class="font-italic">ama</span>, as well as Chan CJ’s decision in <span class="font-italic">Mohammad </span><span class="font-italic">Faizal</span> and his extra-judicial comments in The Courts and the ‘Rule of Law’ in Singapore, to argue (at para 44) that “the Singapore Constitution does possess a basic structure”, and (at para 51) that the separation of powers and what they term the “legality principle” (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, that all power has legal limits) are “among the components of the basic structure”. Insofar as the three Court of Appeal decisions were concerned, these cases referred to neither <span class="font-italic">Kesavananda</span> nor <span class="font-italic">Teo</span><span class="font-italic"> Soh Lung</span>, and I doubted that they could be said to represent the Court of Appeal’s recognition or endorsement of the applicability of the basic structure doctrine in Singapore. What was noteworthy, however, were the following passages (at paras 38 and 46), which were endorsed in full by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Yong </span><span class="font-italic">Vui Kong 2015</span> (at [71]): </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The basic structure is intrinsic to, and arises from, the very nature of a constitution and not legislative or even judicial fiat. At its uncontentious minimum, a constitution sets out <span class="font-italic">how political power is organised and divided between the organs of State in a particular society</span>. In other words, the constitution is a power-defining and, therefore, power-limiting tool. …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… <span class="font-italic">the basic structure is a limited doctrine</span>. <span class="font-italic">It is arguable that fundamental rights are not a necessary part of the basic structure of a constitution.</span> This is because fundamental rights relate to rights and liberties of citizens and do not define the limits to the powers of and checks on each organ of the State. What is not fundamental to a constitution cannot form part of its basic structure. …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 I noted that the basic structure doctrine was not without its critics. As an example, the following caution sounded by Asst Prof Jaclyn L Neo in an opinion in The Straits Times (Jaclyn L Neo, “Should constitutional principles be eternal?” <span class="font-italic">The Straits Times</span> (6 October 2014)) bears repeating:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">In conclusion, a note of circumspection. It is easy to support the basic features doctrine when we all agree on what these “features” are. But what if we don’t? We should remind ourselves that the doctrine may fly in the face of popular sovereignty.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The assertion that there is an unwritten constraint against ever altering certain features must be regarded with some suspicion lest those who assume the power to determine those features end up elevating themselves, intentionally or otherwise, to the status of demigods.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 Asst Prof Neo’s call for circumspection in supporting the basic features doctrine was echoed and indeed amplified by the defendant. Citing the decision of the United States Supreme Court in <span class="font-italic">Leser</span><span class="font-italic"> et al v Garnett et al</span> 258 US 130 (1922) to demonstrate the “problematic nature” of the basic structure doctrine, the defendant emphasised that no generation had an exclusive claim on constitutional wisdom. The defendant therefore submitted that, in the context of Singapore, Parliament’s power to consciously change the Constitution through the prescribed constitutional procedure should be seen as an instrument by which each generation of Singaporeans could work out their constitutional destiny, and this power should not be curtailed by the court.

</div>
</div>
</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 When I considered the cases and commentaries cited at [58]–[62] above, what became apparent was that any ostensible support of the basic structure doctrine was rather more minimalist and related to a “thin” conception of the same. The academic niceties are perhaps best left to be canvassed and tested in other <span class="font-italic">fora</span>. However, what seemed clear was that any perceived support for the basic structure doctrine, whether by way of <span class="font-italic">dicta</span> or extra-judicial or academic commentary, had generally taken a conservative and limited form. Prof Tan’s views (see [58] above) were paradigmatic of this approach. In this regard, Asst Prof Neo in Jaclyn L Neo, “Introduction: Judging the Singapore Constitution” in <span class="font-italic">Constitutional Interpretation in Singapore</span> rationalised (at p 13) Prof Tan’s argument as a “modest” one premised on acceptance of “the basic structure of the Westminster constitution doctrine”. Above all the nuanced distinctions, what the cases and commentaries generally agreed upon was that the basic structure doctrine did not apply in its full force in Singapore.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 That said, the “thin” conception of the basic structure doctrine appeared to be no more than a broad restatement of the truism that the Constitution rests on an overarching principled framework embracing the precepts of the rule of law and the separation of powers. This was not altogether dissimilar from the defendant’s acknowledgment in its submissions that there was a “basic structure” to the Constitution in the sense that the Constitution rested on the selfsame overarching principles. On the other hand, I noted the defendant’s submission that these overarching principles essentially served to inform the interpretation of the Constitution, but that this was “no more than a specific application of the general principle of purposive statutory interpretation”.

</div>
</div>
</div> I noted also that the amendments which brought forth Arts 19 and 19B of the Constitution would not conceivably offend this “thin” conception of the basic structure doctrine. These amendments did not involve any curtailment of the judicial power or any other incursions into the precepts of the rule of law and the separation of powers. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 For the purposes of these grounds of decision, I do not think that it is fruitful for me to go beyond this level of generality and attempt to opine on whether there are further granular elements to the “basic structure” of the Constitution, and what these may be. This is all the more so given the broader power of amendment under Art 5 of the Constitution (which includes the power to repeal constitutional provisions), as compared to the Indian Constitution. This suitably recognised the need for a degree of flexibility which was necessary and appropriate in the context of our unexpected journey into nationhood. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 I do not propose to venture a more conclusive view or to delve into a fuller exploration of this question for present purposes, as my decision in the present case did not depend on whether the basic structure doctrine was or was not part of Singapore law. As Mr Kumar rightly suggested, it was not strictly necessary for me to decide the OS on this basis: even assuming that the basic structure doctrine did apply (in its full force, and not just by means of a “thin” conception), it would not extend to the amendments that brought forth Arts 19 and 19B of the Constitution (see [69]–[73] below). As such, I declined to make a definitive ruling on this point. For the purposes of these grounds of decision, I would confine my observations solely to what I have set out above.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(2) The “right to stand for public office”</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 Even if the basic structure doctrine did apply in Singapore (in its full force, and not just by means of a “thin” conception), it was clear to me that the amendments that brought forth Arts 19 and 19B of the Constitution would not have offended the basic structure doctrine because the “right to stand for public office” would not have fallen within its ambit. Given the plaintiff’s submissions on this issue (see [54] above), it was plain that the “right to stand for public office” which came within his contemplation comprised the <span class="font-italic">unqualified </span>right of <span class="font-italic">any </span>citizen to stand for elections, not only for the office of the President, but for any public office. It will be recalled that the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Yong </span><span class="font-italic">Vui Kong 2015</span> observed (at [71]) that “in order for a feature to be considered part of the basic structure of the Constitution, it must be something <span class="font-italic">fundamental and essential to the political system that is established thereunder</span>” [emphasis added]. The “right to stand for public office” urged by the plaintiff was clearly not such a feature.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 I examine first the office of the President. In this regard, the defendant pointedly submitted that an unqualified right to stand for the office of the President could not be “fundamental and essential” to the Constitution when the Presidency was not even a popularly-elected office for 28 years after Singapore’s independence. The defendant further pointed to the fact that an elected Presidency only came into being in 1991, with the first popular election held in 1993. Before that, therefore, no one had a right, let alone an unqualified right, to stand for the office of the President.

There being no pre-existing right (whether unqualified or otherwise) to stand for the office of President prior to 1991, it could not be seriously argued that a right (again, whether unqualified or otherwise) to stand for the office of President was one that was “fundamental and essential” to the political system established under the Constitution.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">71 The defendant further submitted, in the context of Art 19 of the Constitution, that since the eligibility criteria for the President were introduced in 1991, there had been several popular elections for President, which Singaporeans had participated in without any challenge against the constitutionality of the process, or the individuals who held the office of President. The point was that it was incredible to say, after all this time, that some deep violence had been inflicted on the Constitution.

</div> With respect, I did not agree that the mere fact that there had been no prior challenges to the validity of the EPS automatically amounted to a validation of its legitimacy. However, I accepted that it was relevant to consider that the EPS had withstood the test of time, at least since its introduction in 1991. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">72 Insofar as the plaintiff’s purported “right to stand for public office” related to <span class="font-italic">other</span> public offices, this was a complete non-starter. In this regard, I agreed with the defendant that an unqualified “right to stand for public office”, far from being “fundamental and essential” to the political system established under the Constitution, was inconsistent with our constitutional framework. In this connection, the defendant highlighted several constitutional offices which were not popularly elected, including judges, the Attorney-General, members of the Public Service Commission and permanent secretaries.

Hence, even if the basic structure doctrine did apply in Singapore, the amendments that brought forth Arts 19 and 19B of the Constitution would not have offended it. I would finally also observe that the plaintiff had, in the Supporting Affidavit, accepted that any right to stand for the office of President was contingent on a person “meet[ing] the right qualifications”

</div> This object was evident from the Second Reading of the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore (Amendment No 3) Bill (Bill 23 of 1990) (“the 1990 Bill”), where then First Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Defence Mr Goh Chok Tong explained (<span class="font-italic">Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report</span> (5 October 1990) vol 56 at cols 559–560):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The criteria for Elected President are very important. Some Members have argued that perhaps we are not stringent enough. But I think more have argued that perhaps the criteria are too restrictive. They want the criteria to be widened so that more can stand for election as Elected President. The list that we have in the Bill indicating who are deemed to have the qualifications, such as Ministers, Judges, Chairman of statutory boards and Boards of Directors of big companies, are <span class="font-italic">no more than a proxy for the attributes that we are looking for</span>. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-italic">We are actually looking for people with competence</span>. They must be competent people before they can stand for election. Secondly, <span class="font-italic">they must be trustworthy</span>. Thirdly, <span class="font-italic">they must have sound judgement</span>. That means, when they look at the situation they can come to the right conclusion. They assess people, they know who are opportunists, who are crooks and who are honest people. That is very important. <span class="font-italic">They must have the moral courage</span> because the President may come from the same party as the Prime Minister. But if he disagrees with the Prime Minister on the use of reserves for wasteful welfare programmes, then the Elected President must have the moral courage to tell the Prime Minister that he is not going to spend the reserves. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Lastly, and I think this is also an important quality, <span class="font-italic">the President must have physical courage</span>. Physical courage comes in because it is possible that a government could have won an election on the promise of spending the reserves with welfare programmes, and having been elected, that government has been stopped by the President from spending it. Can you imagine the groundswell that could be agitated, the intimidation that could be mounted on the President, the harassment that he will get, because the President is one man and he is not out there politicking?

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">87  In arguing that Art 19B of the Constitution was not racially discriminatory, the defendant relied heavily on the analysis of the PCMR on the reserved elections framework (<span class="font-italic">Report of the Presidential Council for Minor</span><span class="font-italic">ity Rights on the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore (Amendment) Bill (Bill No 28/2016)</span> (Pres Co 21 of 2016, 25 November 2016) (“PCMR Report”)). The PCMR’s views do not, and cannot, bind the courts. Moreover, the PCMR’s role does not correspond exactly with Art 12(2) of the Constitution. As pointed out by the defendant, the role of the PCMR includes scrutinising Bills passed by Parliament for “differentiating measures”.

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> A “differentiating measure” is defined in Art 68 of the Constitution as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">“differentiating measure” means any measure which is, or is likely in its practical application to be, disadvantageous to persons of any racial or religious community and not equally disadvantageous to persons of other such communities, either directly by prejudicing persons of that community or indirectly by giving advantage to persons of another community;</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">88  Notwithstanding, I agreed fully with the analysis of the PCMR and was of the view that its reasons for concluding that Art 19B of the Constitution would not, if enacted, be a “differentiating measure” as defined under Art 68 of the Constitution, applied equally to the question at hand, namely, whether Art 19B of the Constitution was inconsistent with Art 12(2) of the same.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">89 First, the PCMR noted that the framework for reserved elections applies equally to three racial communities, namely, the Chinese community, the Malay community and the Indian or other minority communities (PCMR Report at para 4):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The framework for reserved elections applies equally to three racial communities: the Chinese community, the Malay community, and the Indian and other minority communities. The three recognised communities fairly represent the broad racial makeup of Singapore, and each community is not advantaged or disadvantaged vis-à-vis the other communities.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">90 In my view, this was the strongest argument against the plaintiff’s challenge on the basis of Art 12(2) of the Constitution. The <span class="font-italic">equal</span> application of the reserved elections framework to the three racial communities was absolutely fatal to his case. The same hiatus applies to all three racial communities without exception. As the PCMR noted, each community is not advantaged or disadvantaged vis-à-vis the other communities. There was clearly and categorically no “discrimination” to speak of.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">91 Second, the PCMR stated that the purpose of reserved elections is also not discriminatory. Rather, the purpose of reserved elections is to <span class="font-italic">ensure</span> that the office of President will be representative of our multiracial society and to <span class="font-italic">foster</span> multiracialism (PCMR Report at para 5):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The purpose of reserved elections is also not discriminatory. Reserved elections are meant to ensure that, over the long term, the office of President will continue to represent our multiracial society. The measure is borne out of a recognition that, while race neutrality is and remains a Singaporean ideal, active measures must from time to time be taken to foster multiracialism. Such measures, if tailored properly, should not be seen as disadvantaging any particular racial community.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">92 Thus, far from engendering a racially-discriminatory framework, Art 19B of the Constitution in fact aims to <span class="font-italic">promote</span> multiculturalism. There was nothing which could be said to be discriminatory about this purpose.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">93 Third, the PCMR observed that the reserved elections mechanism is tailored to be minimally intrusive (PCMR Report at para 6):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">In this regard, the reserved elections mechanism is tailored so as to be minimally intrusive. The default position will continue to be open elections for which all qualified individuals for which all qualified individuals are able to stand, regardless of their race. Reserved elections are meant to be a long-stop measure, triggered only by a five-term hiatus. The mechanism will not come into play if candidates from each of the major communities are regularly returned in open elections. In the case of elections reserved for any of the three recognised communities, the Council is satisfied that there is an adequate pool of candidates qualified to stand.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">94 I accepted that this argument may not be particularly relevant in the context of Art 12(2) of the Constitution. However, it was helpful to bear in mind that open elections remain the default position, with reserved elections being only a long-stop measure. The reserved elections framework is appropriately tailored to meet its purpose in a minimally-intrusive way. The wood should not be missed for the trees.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">95 In the premises, there was similarly no basis for the plaintiff’s attempt to impugn Art 19B of the Constitution on the basis of its purported inconsistency with Art 12(2) of the same.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">96 At this juncture, I pause to make a final observation. If the plaintiff had intended to mount a <span class="font-italic">bona fide</span> and serious legal challenge to the legitimacy or constitutional validity of the EPS, it did not help that he did not seem concerned to take proper account of the facts and correctly appreciate the law before launching into sweeping and baseless allegations. Aside from vacillating over whether he was proceeding with the OS or seeking to commence judicial review proceedings (see [7] above), a simple case in point illustrates this. As mentioned earlier, the plaintiff maintained that the wool was being pulled over the eyes of the electorate and that other minorities were excluded under the reserved elections framework (see [35] above). This was plainly erroneous since Art 19B(6) of the Constitution defines a “community” to mean: (a) the Chinese community; (b) the Malay community; or (c) the Indian <span class="font-italic">or other minority</span> communities. Art 19B(6) of the Constitution further clarifies that a “person belonging to the Indian or other minority communities” means “any person of Indian origin who considers himself to be a member of the Indian community and who is generally accepted as a member of the Indian community by that community, <span class="font-italic">or any person who belongs to any minority community other than the Malay or Indian community</span>” [emphasis added]. There was simply no question of other minorities being excluded under the reserved elections framework. The plaintiff was but conjuring controversy when there was, in fact, none.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">97 I was impelled to agree with the defendant that the OS was an “extraordinary” application.

</div>
</div> The plaintiff’s grounds of challenge were repeatedly unclear and there was no indication as to the specific relief or remedy being sought. What the plaintiff appeared to be primarily intent on doing was to ventilate his polemical views on politics and governance in Singapore. This much was plain from how the gravamen of his contentions pertained to political issues. Insofar as his submissions went, they were long on rhetoric but short on coherence and substantive legal merit.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">98 I found that the plaintiff had no standing to bring the OS. It was insufficient that the plaintiff personally did not see eye-to-eye with the qualifying criteria in Art 19 of the Constitution or the reserved elections framework in Art 19B of the same. I also found that there was, in any event, no merit to the substantive issues raised by the OS. Even though the plaintiff had sought to portray the OS as a serious-minded constitutional challenge, the reality fell far short of this. To the contrary, the OS was unmeritorious in almost every conceivable aspect and I had no hesitation in dismissing it accordingly.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">99 I did not accept the plaintiff’s argument that costs should not be ordered against him on account of the OS having been brought in the public interest. The plaintiff had no standing (see [43]–[52] above). The OS was thus an abuse of process which, as the defendant pointed out, the court should not be made to suffer.

</div> As such, costs ought to follow the event. I also had regard to the plaintiff’s frequent gratuitous forays into irrelevant and irreverent sidebars as well as his scathingly intemperate allegations and insinuations. After one or two initial reminders that he was straying into irrelevancy, I formed the view that unless intervention was absolutely necessary, such reminders would serve little purpose as they would only result in protracted protestations and further unproductive exchanges.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">100 Having regard to the plaintiff’s status as a litigant-in-person, I did not think the defendant’s suggested costs amount of $25,000 (excluding disbursements) for a one-day hearing was appropriate. I therefore ordered the plaintiff to bear the defendant’s costs fixed at $6,000. In addition, I ordered him to bear the defendant’s reasonable disbursements as quantified. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">101 The parties were able to reach an understanding as to whether the costs order would be immediately enforceable and also as to the abridgement of time for filing a notice of appeal and the time-frame for the plaintiff’s provision of security for costs of the appeal. The plaintiff has since filed his notice of appeal on 22 June 2017. </div><div class="Judg-Sign text-left"></div><div class="Judg-Sign text-left">See Kee Oon<br/>Judge</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">The plaintiff in person;<br/>Deputy Attorney-General Hri Kumar Nair <span class="font-italic">SC</span>, Aurill Kam, Seow Zhixiang, Germaine Boey and Jamie Pang (Attorney-General’s Chambers) for the defendant.</div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
