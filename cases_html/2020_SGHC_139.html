</div> According to Koh, he emphasised at that meeting that, as Zhao was the Guangxin Group’s representative on Vermont’s board of directors, the Guangxin Group should bear full responsibility for Zhao’s wrongful trading. Further, the breach of the Trading Limit and resulting losses were hidden from Poh and Koh. Hence, they and Vermont should not be held responsible for Zhao’s actions. Lu, then a director of Goldsland, Sin Hua and the Respondents, allegedly agreed that the Guangxin Group would be responsible for the consequences of Zhao’s trading and not the minority shareholders and Vermont.

</div> However, Yang apparently decided to unilaterally close all of Vermont’s open trade positions at a significant loss, and Poh and Koh only found out about this on 29 June 2016 at a meeting in Hong Kong. Poh claimed that Yang’s actions were a breach of his duties to act in Vermont’s best interest and prevented Vermont from using its revenue stream to sustain its operations and reduce any debt owed to third parties. In early July 2016, Yang and Mac disappeared. Around September or October 2016, Yang was removed as a director of Vermont and replaced by Zou Bin, who was the director and chief executive of Goldsland. Poh claimed that Zou Bin refused to engage the Applicants on continuing Vermont’s business.

Essentially, there are two interrelated factors in determining good faith: <span class="font-italic">Ang Thiam Swee v Low Hian Chor</span> [2013] 2 SLR 340 (“<span class="font-italic">Ang Thiam Swee</span>”) at [23] and [27] to [30]. First, the applicant must honestly or reasonably believe that a good cause of action exists for the company to prosecute. He may be found to lack good faith if it is shown that no reasonable person in his position, and knowing what he knows, could believe that the company had a good cause of action to prosecute. The second is whether the applicant is seeking to bring the derivative action for a collateral purpose as to amount to an abuse of process. The best way to demonstrate good faith is to show that the company has a legitimate claim which its directors are unreasonably reluctant to pursue with the appropriate rigour or at all: <span class="font-italic">Pang Yong Hock</span><span class="font-italic"> and another v PKS Contracts Services Pte Ltd</span> [2004] 3 SLR(R) 1 (“<span class="font-italic">Pang Yong Hock</span>”) at [20].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 However, the legal merits of a proposed derivative action alone should not be used to determine good faith. An applicant may seek to bring a statutory derivative action in good faith “<span class="font-italic">even where there is no arguable or legitimate case</span> to be advanced” [emphasis added]: <span class="font-italic">Ang Thiam Swee </span>at [29]. Conversely, an applicant with a legitimate case may be found to lack good faith if the applicant “is so motivated by vendetta, perceived or real, that his judgment will be clouded by purely personal considerations”:<span class="font-italic"> Pang Yong Hock </span>at [20]. He has to demonstrate that he is or may be “genuinely aggrieved” and that his collateral purpose is sufficiently consistent with the purpose of “doing justice to a company”: <span class="font-italic">Ang Thiam Swee</span> at [29] and [31].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 As to whether the proposed derivative action is <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> in the company’s interest, the applicant must show that the claim is “legitimate and arguable”. The claim must be such that the company will stand to gain substantially in money or money’s worth if proved. At the leave stage, the threshold is low and only the most obviously unmeritorious claims will be excluded. Additionally, the court may examine “whether it would be in the practical and commercial interests of the company for the action to be brought”: <span class="font-italic">Ang Thiam Swee</span> at [53]–[56].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 The Applicants submitted as follows. First, it is <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> in Vermont’s interests for leave to be granted because the alleged debts are not genuine. Even if they were genuine, they were procured by the Majority Directors in breach of their fiduciary duties by failing to disclose their conflicts of interest, and with the dishonest assistance of, and/or in conspiracy with, Goldsland and/or Sin Hua. The Majority Directors had caused Vermont to allow Default Judgments to be entered into in Suits 260 and 261 without the approval of its board of directors or shareholders, or engaging external counsel to advise Vermont. Goldsland and Sin Hua are also estopped from recovering the loans due to the Guangxin Agreement. Second, the Applicants are acting in good faith because they have an honest belief that Vermont has legitimate defences and cogent claims against Goldsland, Sin Hua and the Majority Directors.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 Li, for VGL, submitted that it is not <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> in Vermont’s interests for leave to be granted. Vermont has no defence to Suits 260 and 261 as the debts which form the subject matter of the Suits (“the Alleged Debts”) are <span class="font-italic">bona fide</span>. The Credit Facility was approved by Vermont’s directors and all parties were well aware of the relationship between Goldsland, Sin Hua and Vermont. Even if the Majority Directors did breach their fiduciary duties, some of them, such as Yang, have seemingly absconded, so any judgment obtained by Vermont against them would be a paper judgment. In addition, the Guangxin Agreement did not exist. Furthermore, Vermont has ceased operations since April 2016 and has no funds to support the Applicants’ litigation.

The merits of the defence do not constitute the sole consideration, but it is a “certainly highly significant” factor to be weighed against other relevant considerations such as the applicant’s explanation both for the default and any delay, as well as any prejudice to the other party: <span class="font-italic">Mercurine Pte Ltd v Canberra Development Pte Ltd </span>[2008] 4 SLR(R) 907 at [60], [65] and [98].

</div> First, Goldsland and Sin Hua have taken inconsistent positions in Suits 260 and 261 vis-à-vis the HK Proceedings. The total debt allegedly owed by Vermont for payments made to its suppliers is pleaded differently in the HK Proceedings and the Singapore proceedings. Second, Poh claimed that Goldsland made only a short-term bridging loan of about US$3.6 million around 14 June 2010 to Vermont (“2010 STBL”). Third, the 1st Goldsland Breakdown of Debts filed by Goldsland in the HK Proceedings (which purportedly showed that Goldsland had advanced at least US$60 million to Vermont) is inaccurate because only the 2010 STBL was recorded but not subsequent repayments. Fourth, while Goldsland’s pleadings in Suit 260 and in the HK Proceedings state that it made the payments directly to third parties on Vermont’s behalf, the 1st Goldsland Breakdown of Debts showed payments made directly to Vermont. Fifth, the extracts derived from the “Kingdee system” (“Kingdee Documents”) – the alleged common accounting system used by Goldsland, Sin Hua and the Respondents and which is supposedly a contemporaneous record – further cast doubt on the legitimacy of the Alleged Debts in Suits 260 and 261. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 Further, Poh claimed to have no knowledge of the Alleged Debts and of Suits 260 and 261 until it was too late. The Applicants were initially unaware that Vermont was served with court papers, and the Suits were only brought to their attention later on 20 March 2018.

</div> Again, if the audit confirmation for 2012 showed that, as of 31 December 2011, the amount owing by Vermont to Goldsland and Sin Hua are US$18,980,804.08 and US$18,354,233.65 respectively, these figures would have been based on a running account carried forward from 2010 and before (see the audit confirmation of 1 February 2011) and subsequently carried forward to 2017. However, as earlier stated, it is doubtful if any amount owing in 2010 were the subject of Suits 260 and 261. Thus, the audit confirmations do not show how the sums in the Suits are supported, and there are no other documents to show the breakdown of the Alleged Debts.

This is even after Tang Ke had asked Vermont’s directors whether to engage lawyers to defend the Suits and after<span class="font-italic"> </span>he had (in his 16 April 2018 email) asked for advice on the Default Judgments. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 The circumstances show that the Applicants have a legitimate and arguable case to assert that their delay in applying to set aside the Default Judgments was reasonable. First, the Applicants claimed that they had left the day-to-day running of Vermont to the Majority Directors (see also [51(a)] above). The transcript of the 14 May 2018 Directors’ Meeting showed the Applicants were constantly asking Zou Bin about the Suits and Zou Bin had replied that the evidence against Vermont in the Suits was “pretty clear”. Second, the Applicants were not provided with the relevant information surrounding the Suits by the Majority Directors, despite their requests for them (see [55(b)] above). Poh had attested that the “relevant documents in relation to the [Suits] were never made available to [the Applicants]” and that his letter dated 9 July 2018 “was completely ignored”

First, they had breached the double employment rule by causing Vermont to enter into the respective debts with Goldsland and Sin Hua without obtaining Vermont’s informed consent, when they were also directors in Goldsland and Sin Hua. Second, the Majority Directors (Zou Bin, Zhong and Tong) acted in conflict of interest when they allowed the Default Judgments to be entered against Vermont. The Majority Directors also breached their fiduciary duties: (a) by authorising the alleged debts in excess of US$1 million without all the shareholders’ consent (particularly the Applicants’) in writing, in breach of the Shareholders’ Agreement; and (b) when they authorised loans to be taken from Goldsland or Sin Hua to finance Vermont’s wrongful and speculative trading in breach of the Bunker Trading System.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 The Respondents disputed the above.

</div> The Applicants were at all times aware of the corporate structure of the Guangxin Group, and of the relationship between Goldsland, Sin Hua and Vermont. The Default Judgments were entered as the Alleged Debts were “undisputed debts well recorded in [Vermont’s] accounting records, and [Vermont] has no valid defence”. Further, the loan that was taken out was approved at the 2 Dec 2011 Meeting, and was in Vermont’s best interests. But for the loan, Vermont would have breached its contractual obligations, would not have been able to issue letters of credit to counterparties, and would not have obtained various business opportunities. Finally, Vermont’s debts were incurred as a result of payments made by Goldsland and Sin Hua to third party creditors. Even if Zhao had misused funds, Goldsland and Sin Hua did not know of this and had extended the loans on the basis that it would be used for Vermont’s <span class="font-italic">bona fide</span> business operations. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 A director owes a duty to act <span class="font-italic">bona fide </span>in the best interests of the company. This common law duty is also statutorily enshrined as the duty to act “honestly” in s 157(1) of the Companies Act: <span class="font-italic">Townsing Henry George v Jenton Overseas Investment Pte Ltd (in liquidation) </span>[2007] 2 SLR(R) 597 (“<span class="font-italic">Townsing</span>”) at [59].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 As an important facet of the duty of honesty, a director owes a duty of undivided loyalty to his company (<span class="font-italic">Townsing</span> at [60]). This encompasses two further distinct rules – the “no-profit rule” which proscribes the director from making a profit out of his fiduciary position, and the “no-conflict rule” which includes two different aspects that proscribes two different types<span class="font-italic"> </span>of conflicts. The first proscribes the director from putting himself in a position where his own <span class="font-italic">interests</span> and his <span class="font-italic">duty</span> to his principal are in conflict: <span class="font-italic">Ho Yew Kong v Sakae Holdings Ltd and other appeals and other matters </span>[2018] 2 SLR 333 at [135]; <span class="font-italic">Nordic International Ltd v Morten Innhaug </span>[2017] 3 SLR 957 (“<span class="font-italic">Nordic International</span>”) at [53]–[54]. The second prohibits the director from acting in a situation where there is a conflict between his <span class="font-italic">duties</span> owed to more than one principal. The latter rule can be divided into four sub-categories, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the “double employment rule”, the “duty of good faith”, the “no inhibition principle”, and the “actual conflict rule” (see <span class="font-italic">Townsing</span> at [64]–[65], citing <span class="font-italic">Bristol and West Building Society v Mothew </span>[1998] Ch 1). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 To release a director from his breach of duty, the informed consent of the shareholders is required. Alternatively, a director’s acts may be authorised by a resolution of the board of directors at a meeting convened and conducted in accordance with the company’s constitution, or by informal but unanimous assent of all the directors: <span class="font-italic">Ho Kang Peng v Scintronix Corp Ltd (formerly known as TTL Holdings Ltd) </span>[2014] 3 SLR 329 at [52], [58] and [59]; <span class="font-italic">Nordic International </span>at [92].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 The remedy for a breach of fiduciary duty depends on whether the breach was a non-custodial or custodial breach. In the former, the usual remedy would be a compensatory monetary award such as equitable compensation, and alternatively an account of profits where the fiduciary earned profits from the breach. In the latter, an award of substitutive compensation may be awarded against the fiduciary: <span class="font-italic">Sim Poh Ping v Winsta Holding Pte Ltd and another and other appeals</span> [2020] 1 SLR 1199<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [104]–[105], [108]–[109] and [124]–[126].</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-justify font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Breach of duty in allowing Default Judgments to be entered against Vermont</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 In the present case, I find that there is a legitimate and an arguable claim against some of the Majority Directors for breaches of their duties, in particular the duty to act in Vermont’s best interest and to avoid positions of conflict, in allowing the Default Judgments to be entered against Vermont.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">71 The relevant Majority Directors at the material time and presently were also directors of Goldsland and/or Sin Hua. Their duties to Goldsland and Sin Hua would have been to pursue the Alleged Debts and obtain judgment in Suits 260 and 261, while their duty to Vermont would have been to scrutinise Goldsland and Sin Hua’s claims to see if Vermont had a credible defence. The Majority Directors, being also directors of Goldsland and/or Sin Hua, would have known of the Suits when they were filed. They did not obtain the informed consent of the Applicants (who were also shareholders of Vermont) as to whether Vermont should defend the Suits. Further, the Respondents claimed that the Alleged Debts in the Suits were “undisputed debts”.

</div> The evidence, as a whole, suggests that there was an attempt to conceal the Suits from the Applicants until late in the day and that the Majority Directors did not intend for Vermont to defend the Suits because they had predetermined that Vermont had no valid defence (see also [57]–[60] above).

Ms Sia suggested that such consent could be inferred from Poh having signed the audit confirmation for 2011 evidencing some US$17 million loaned to Vermont by Goldsland. However, this did not necessarily show that Poh had acquiesced to exceeding the borrowing limit or how the US$17 million came about; as can be seen, Goldsland reverted on the audit confirmation to correct that what was owed to it was some US$13.26 million whilst about US$4.49 million was owed to Sin Hua. Further, Mr Seah had shown that the audit confirmation could not be relied on, and in any event Koh did not sign the audit confirmation.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">77 Therefore, the evidence shows a legitimate and arguable claim that Zhao had breached his fiduciary duty to act <span class="font-italic">bona fide </span>in Vermont’s best interests because he caused Vermont to trade in breach of the Trading Limit and caused loss to Vermont.

The suspicious method of procurement and repayment of the alleged loans also showed that Goldsland or Sin Hua had knowledge that the loans were wrongfully provided.

</div>
</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">80 Vermont’s Majority Directors were <span class="font-italic">concurrently</span> directors of Goldsland and/or Sin Hua at the material time. Pertinently, Zhao was concurrently a director of Vermont, VGL, Goldsland and Sin Hua. Consequently, it is arguable that the Majority Directors’ knowledge of their conflict of duties to Goldsland and Sin Hua, on the one hand, and Vermont, on the other, and of any wrongful trading by Zhao, can be attributed to Goldsland and Sin Hua. Goldsland and Sin Hua had provided the alleged loans to Vermont and then sued Vermont for repayment of the loans in Suits 260 and 261, whilst Vermont would seemingly allow the Default Judgments to be entered (see [57]–[58] above). As I had also found, the veracity of the Alleged Debts is doubtful and the evidence suggests that the Majority Directors (who were also directors of Goldsland and/or Sin Hua at the material time) knew of this. The fact that Goldsland did not name Vermont’s present Majority Directors in the EJD Application pertaining to Vermont is telling and buttresses the inference that Goldsland and Sin Hua’s assistance to the Majority Directors is dishonest. As the threshold at this stage is low (see [28] above), I am satisfied that Vermont has a legitimate and arguable claim in dishonest assistance against Goldsland and Sin Hua. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">81 As for the Applicants’ intended claim for conspiracy against Goldsland, Sin Hua and/or the Majority Directors, I am satisfied that there is a legitimate and arguable case. The evidence suggests that the premise for the Default Judgments (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the Alleged Debts) was suspect, and that: (a) the Majority Directors would have known about Suits 260 and 261 and the Default Judgments obtained; (b) the Majority Directors had given the Applicants little time to deal with the Suits; (c) Zou Bin had little basis for insisting that the evidence against Vermont in the Suits was “pretty clear”; and (d) the Applicants were not given the requisite information on the Alleged Debts that they asked for. It must be remembered that Goldsland and Sin Hua indirectly owned 70% of Vermont and, by 22 March 2018 (a day before the Default Judgments were entered), they indirectly owned all of Vermont. It cannot be put past that in Vermont failing to defend the Suits and allowing the Default Judgments to be entered, Goldsland’s claim in the HK Proceedings against the Applicants on the Counter-Guarantees would be bolstered.<span class="font-weight-bold font-italic"> </span>Even if the evidence at this stage does not particularise in detail the conspiracy, the threshold for granting leave under s 216A of the Companies Act is low. The facts supporting the intended claim for dishonest assistance and conspiracy were also similar.

</div> They want to keep Vermont alive. Poh attested that although Vermont had lost its MPA Licence, that did not mean that Vermont had to cease operations. It had vessels that it could charter and could still turn a profit because of its “foundation and customer base in trading”. Poh claimed that it was normal market practice for a company without bunker supply or operating licences to trade through other companies that had the requisite licences, which Vermont did when it was incorporated and before it obtained a bunker supply licence from MPA. Poh also claimed that some bunker supply companies with the requisite licences had approached him subsequently to suggest that Vermont trade through them.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">84 The question is whether it would be <span class="font-italic">prima facie </span>in Vermont’s interest to commence a derivative action when winding up is an available alternative. In this regard, I refer to <span class="font-italic">Tam Tak Chuen v Eden Aesthetics Pte Ltd and another (Khairul bin Abdul Rahman and another, non-parties) </span>[2010] 2 SLR 667 (“<span class="font-italic">Tam Tak Chuen</span>”). The applicant, Tam, and Khairul were equal shareholders and directors of Eden Aesthetics Private Limited (“EA”) and Eden Healthcare Pte Ltd (“EH”). Tam applied for leave to commence a derivative action on behalf of EA and EH against Khairul and KAR Pte Ltd (“KAR”), for an account of profits and for damages for losses suffered by EA and EH as a result of alleged breaches of Khairul’s director’s duties owed to them. It was alleged that Khairul diverted business away from EA and EH to KAR (of which he was the sole shareholder and director). Two months after Tam filed the derivative action, Khairul commenced proceedings to wind up EA and EH on the ground that it was just and equitable to do so.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">85 Judith Prakash J (as she then was), emphasised that there was <span class="font-italic">no rule </span>that “as long as the alternative of winding up the company was available, leave [for a derivative action] would be refused, however meritorious the proposed claim may be”: <span class="font-italic">Tam Tak Chuen </span>at [24]. The question was whether the remedy of winding up would be more beneficial to EA and EH than the commencement of derivative proceedings against Khairul and KAR. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">86 Prakash J held that winding up was the “less appropriate” course in the circumstances of that case. First, EA and EH had a <span class="font-italic">prima facie </span>meritorious claim against Khairul for breach of his directors’ duties. Second, a successful claim against KAR – which had made substantial revenues after the diversion – would be of monetary value to EA and EH and would not result in only a paper judgment. Third, winding up would incur EA and EH additional costs as they would have to pay the liquidator’s costs and the costs of solicitors to be instructed by the liquidator if the liquidator decided to sue Khairul and KAR. There would also be some delay in prosecuting the claim if EA and EH were wound up since the liquidator and his solicitors would have to study the companies’ records and the merits of the claims. On the other hand, Tam already had the necessary information and was prepared to fund the litigation.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">87 In the present case, I am satisfied that winding up is not more beneficial to Vermont than the commencement of the proposed derivative actions for the following reasons. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a)  First, Vermont has legitimate and arguable claims in Suits 260 and 261, and against the relevant Majority Directors, Goldsland and Sin Hua.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Second, if Vermont succeeds in defending the Suits and in its claim against the Majority Directors, Goldsland or Sin Hua, that would be of real monetary value to Vermont. The total quantum of the Default Judgments amount to US$40,804,754.94, while Vermont’s liabilities based on its financial statement for 2016 is US$46,228,148, which suggests that the bulk of Vermont’s current liabilities are due to the Default Judgments. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Third, Vermont may incur additional costs if it is wound up as it would have to pay both the liquidator’s costs and the costs of solicitors to be instructed by the liquidator if the liquidator decides to pursue the claims that are currently being contemplated. There might also be some delay in prosecuting any claims since the liquidator would need time to study Vermont’s records and the merits of the claims to determine if they should be pursued. The Applicants already have the necessary information after conducting their own investigations and are prepared to fund the litigation. Even if they were to hand over the fruits of their investigation to the liquidator to assist him, the liquidator would still need to exercise his own independent inquiry and judgment in determining if Suits 260 and 261 should be defended or whether to pursue claims against Goldsland, Sin Hua or the Majority Directors. Hence, a winding up may not necessarily be a less costly route for Vermont.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">88 Importantly, the present case involves significant issues of conflicts of duty. In this regard, the Court of Appeal’s decision in <span class="font-italic">Chong Chin Fook v Solomon Alliance Management Pte Ltd and others and another matter </span>[2017] 1 SLR 348 (“<span class="font-italic">Chong Chin Fook</span>”) is instructive. There, the Court granted conditional leave to the appellant – a minority shareholder and former sole director of an entity “Solomon” – to take over Solomon’s conduct of proceedings in an <span class="font-italic">ongoing </span>suit brought by it against the respondent majority shareholders. This is <span class="font-italic">even though</span> Solomon appeared to be diligently conducting the action. This was because the clear conflicts of interest on the part of Solomon’s two new directors meant that it was probable that Solomon would not prosecute the ongoing action diligently:  <span class="font-italic">Chong Chin Fook</span> at [76]–[83].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">89 In the present case, there are conflicts of duty on the part of the Majority Directors. Their decision not to defend Vermont in Suits 260 and 261 is one that is tainted by this conflict. It is telling that Vermont (via its Majority Directors) and VGL are resisting OS 166 and that Vermont is pursuing a winding up only in July 2019 after OS 166 had been filed, despite Li claiming that Vermont had been dormant since 2016 and had failed to satisfy the Default Judgments since March 2018. It would seem that the Majority Directors, acting on VGL’s instructions, are in a hurry to wind up Vermont <span class="font-italic">after</span> OS 166 was commenced by the Applicants. This suggests that VGL (which is owned by Sin Hua, which is in turn owned by Goldsland) is attempting to put a stop to the Applicants challenging the Alleged Debts underlying the Default Judgments, as the Alleged Debts would support Goldsland’s recovery against the Applicants in the HK Proceedings based on the Counter-Guarantees.

</div>
</div> It cannot be ignored that the HK Proceedings would enable a substantial recovery <span class="font-italic">directly against the Applicants</span>, when any recovery against Vermont in Suit 260 may be futile given its financial position. It is pertinent to note that Li is representing VGL in rigorously contesting OS 166, is representing Vermont in its winding up, and is also currently a director of Goldsland (and Sin Hua). Likewise Zou Bin, a Majority Director who is supporting the winding up of Vermont, is also currently a director of VGL, Goldsland and Sin Hua.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">90 However, I am cognisant that Vermont does not have the financial capability to engage in a protracted litigation. Nevertheless, the Applicants have agreed to bear all of Vermont’s ensuing legal costs for the proceedings in Suit 260 and Suit 261 and in its claims against the Majority Directors, Goldsland and Sin Hua. Vermont is also not yet in liquidation and, besides Goldsland and Sin Hua, there seems to be only one other creditor that has issued a statutory demand against Vermont.

</div> Critically, the quantum of the Default Judgments forms the bulk of Vermont’s total liabilities. If the Default Judgments are set aside and the claims against the Majority Directors, Goldsland or Sin Hua succeed, Vermont may well be able to continue operations and apply for a new bunker supply licence from MPA. Further, even if there is no longer any trust and confidence between VGL and the Applicants, the Applicants are not precluded from buying out VGL’s shares in Vermont (which they intimated they propose to do when Vermont’s assets become clear through the derivative action)

In this regard, VGL claimed that the Alleged Debts, and Vermont’s decision not to defend the Suits, were based on the audit confirmations (see [42] above). However, the evidence suggests that: (a) the underlying figures reflected in the audit confirmations could not be relied on; (b) various other documents which could have potentially supported the veracity of the figures in the Suits, such as Vermont’s financial statements, the Goldsland Breakdown of Debts and the Kingdee Documents, were not consistent; and (c) Li’s own evidence cast doubts on the claims in the Suits. The evidence does, as I have found, cast doubt on the legitimacy of the quantum of the Alleged Debts. Hence, I am satisfied that the Applicants have an honest and a reasonable belief that a good cause of action exists for Vermont to prosecute.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">93 The next issue is whether and why the Applicants had delayed taking out OS 166 to defend Suits 260 and 261 and whether their conduct in taking out OS 166 is for a collateral purpose as to amount to an abuse of process. First, I had accepted the Applicants’ explanation for any delay on their part to be reasonable. Next, I am satisfied that the Applicants’ conduct in taking out OS 166 is not for a collateral purpose. As I have observed earlier, they had called for a meeting of Vermont’s directors to query the bases for the Alleged Debts in the Suits. Furthermore, it is understandable and reasonable that the Applicants would need time to conduct their own investigations into Vermont’s defences in the Suits, since the Majority Directors had refused to provide them with information surrounding the Suits.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">94 Even if taking out OS 166 amounted to a collateral purpose for the Applicants to better defend themselves in the HK Proceedings, the question is whether the collateral purpose is sufficiently consistent with the purpose of doing justice to Vermont so that the Applicants are not<span class="font-italic"> </span>abusing the statute and Vermont as a vehicle for their aims and interests<span class="font-italic"> </span>(<span class="font-italic">Ang Thiam Swee</span> ([26] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) at [31]).

There is sufficient evidence to genuinely doubt the veracity of the Alleged Loans in Suits 260 and 261. It will do justice to Vermont if an unmeritorious judgment for repayment of a loan is set aside. There is also no evidence to suggest that the Applicants are “so motivated by vendetta” that their judgment will be “clouded by purely personal considerations”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">96 Further, allowing the Applicants control of Vermont’s defence in Suits 260 and 261 is not prejudicial to criminal investigations against them, since CPIB has seized the relevant documents necessary for its investigation.

</div> The Applicants’ proposed actions – to set aside the Default Judgments and to bring claims against the Majority Directors, Goldsland and Sin Hua – have hitherto not been commenced and it is clear that Vermont’s current Majority Directors did not and are not intending to diligently prosecute or bring these proposed actions.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">99 In the round, I am satisfied that it is <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> in Vermont’s interests for the proposed derivative actions to be brought. I thus grant the Applicants conditional leave (see [100] below) under s 216A of the Companies Act to bring the following proceedings, and to have full charge and control over the conduct of such proceedings, on Vermont’s behalf:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) To defend Suits 260 and 261 and to bring any counterclaims in those Suits.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) To bring any action against the present and/or previous directors of Vermont for breaches of directors’ duties and conspiracy and in relation to the Alleged Debts in Suits 260 and 261.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) To bring any action against Goldsland and/or Sin Hua for dishonestly assisting the present and/or previous directors of Vermont in the latter’s breaches of duties and for conspiracy.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">100 The Applicants’ application is granted subject to the following conditions:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The Applicants bear all of Vermont’s costs to be incurred in Suits 260 and 261 from the commencement of the application to set aside the Default Judgments until disposal of the Suits, and in any counterclaims, including any cost orders that may be made against Vermont.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The Applicants bear all of Vermont’s costs in bringing any action or claims against its present or previous directors, Goldsland or Sin Hua, including any counterclaims that such directors, Goldsland or Sin Hua may raise in Vermont’s actions/claims. The costs that the Applicants are to bear include any costs orders that may be made against Vermont.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">101 The Applicants will be reimbursed the costs (at [100] above) by Vermont only if Vermont succeeds in the respective actions, and up to the amount that it recovers in costs from the counterparties in the proceedings. Further, any party-and-party costs that Vermont recovers from an opposing party should first be applied to satisfy its outstanding obligation for costs to any opposing party (where a costs order is made in favour of that party) and it is only any balance remaining thereafter that is to be used to reimburse the Applicants for the costs borne by them on Vermont’s behalf.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">102 Unless the parties are able to agree on costs, they are to file written submissions, limited to five pages, as to the appropriate costs orders they contend I should make in OS 166. These submissions are to be filed and exchanged within one week of the date of this judgment.</div><div class="Judg-Sign text-left">Audrey Lim  <br/>Judge</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Seah Zhen Wei Paul, Chan Yi Zhang, Aditi Ravi and Bryan Seah (Tan Kok Quan Partnership) for the applicants;<br/>Alexander Yeo and Chew Jing Wei (Allen &amp; Gledhill LLP) for the first respondent;<br/>Jennifer Sia and Goh Hui Hua (NLC Law Asia LLC) for the second respondent. </div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div><div class="Judg-Quote-List text-justify"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
