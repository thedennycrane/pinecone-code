<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       This was an appeal against the decision of the
                    Judge (“the Judge”) in <em>Lee Shieh-Peen Clement
                        and another v Ho Chin Nguang and others</em> [2010] SGHC 12
                    which held that the Respondents were not in breach of, or in contempt of, a
                    Mareva injunction issued against them. At the conclusion of the hearing we
                    allowed the appeal and held that the Respondents were in breach of the Mareva
                    injunction. We now give our reasons.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Background </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       Lee Shieh-Peen Clement and Kong Yew Seng, the
                    plaintiffs in the main action and the first and second appellants in the appeal
                    (“the Appellants”), are both businessmen. Ho Chin Nguang
                    (“Ho”), the first defendant in the main action, is a friend of the
                    Appellants and is also a businessman. Ng Sow Moi (“Ng”), the
                    second defendant in the main action, is Ho’s wife, while Ho May Ing
                    (“May Ing”), the third defendant in the main action, is Ho’s
                    sister. For the purposes of the appeal, only Ho and Ng were the respondents and
                    they will hereinafter be referred to collectively as “the
                    Respondents”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       Sometime in May or June 2007, the Appellants
                    entered into a joint venture (“the Agreement”) with Ho to
                    incorporate a Chinese company (“the Company”) for the purposes of
                    taking over a Gold Mining Project in Myanmar (“the first
                    project”). While the exact oral terms of the Agreement on the first
                    project were disputed, what was not in dispute was that in pursuance of the
                    Agreement the Appellants in July/August 2007 issued two cheques for the total
                    sum of S$4 million to Ho for the purposes of the first project. These cheques
                    were deposited into a bank account in the name of the Respondents.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       In March 2008, the second appellant, Kong Yew
                    Seng, transferred another sum of S$4 million to Ho’s bank account for a
                    potential joint investment in an iron ore mine in China. The Appellants averred
                    that this sum of money was initially intended to be a bridging loan which could
                    be converted into an investment in the purchase of the mine should the due
                    diligence checks prove worthwhile. This bridging loan was also granted on the
                    condition that it would be repaid in full to the Appellants in three months from
                    the date of receipt of the said sum by Ho. However, with regard to this sum, the
                    Respondents denied that it was intended to be a bridging loan. Instead, they
                    asserted that the said sum was to all intents and purposes meant as a joint
                    investment by the Appellants for subsequent investments (“the second
                    project”) through the Company.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       Later the Appellants discovered that some of the
                    representations made by Ho in inducing the Appellants to be involved in the
                    first project and the bridging loan were false. In September 2008, Ho returned a
                    total of S$1.61 million to the Appellants. The Appellants also took away three
                    cars which were registered in Ho’s name, Ho’s UOB bank passbook,
                    identity card, passport and three of his watches. The Appellants alleged that
                    all the payments and chattels were handed over to the Appellants by the
                    Respondents on their own free will. These constituted part repayment of the
                    monies due and owing by the Respondents to the Appellants with respect to the
                    bridging loan. On the other hand, the Respondents contended that the Appellants
                    wanted to back out of the first project and unreasonably demanded for the refund
                    of S$4 million for the second project. Resorting to threats and harassments, the
                    Respondents alleged that the Appellants compelled the Respondents to return the
                    sum of S$1.61 million to them and also took away the abovementioned
                    items.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       On 31 March 2009, the Appellants commenced
                    Suit 285 of 2009, which is the main action against Ho, Ng and May Ing to recover
                    the sum of S$5.07 million to S$5.1 million. At the same time, the Appellants
                    also took out an <em>ex parte</em> application for a Mareva
                    injunction against all three defendants. On 7 April 2009, the Appellants
                    successfully obtained an <em>ex parte</em> interim Mareva
                    injunction against them. Under this order, the defendants were allowed to spend
                    only S$500 a week for ordinary living expenses and S$500 a week or a reasonable
                    sum on legal advice.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       The Appellants later withdrew their claim
                    against May Ing, and the <em>ex parte</em> interim Mareva
                    injunction granted on 7 April 2009 was replaced by a final Mareva
                    injunction on 31 July 2009 (“the Order”) against Ho and Ng,
                    the Respondents in this appeal. Under the Order, the Respondents were allowed to
                    spend S$1,500 a week towards their ordinary living expenses and S$1,500 a week
                    or a reasonable sum on legal advice and representation. The relevant terms of
                    the Order were:</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       On 17 November 2009, the Appellants

<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The decision of the Judge</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       On 11 December 2009 the committal
                    application came before the Judge who held that the Respondents had not breached
                    cl 2 of the Order (“clause 2” or “cl 2”) with
                    respect to the disclosure of the Respondents’ assets. In his view,
                    cl 2 by its express terms only required a one-off disclosure by an
                    affidavit listing out the assets of the Respondents and that had been done.
                    Clause 2 did not require the Respondents to file further affidavits to set out
                    assets which the Respondents might subsequently have acquired. On that basis,
                    Ho’s subsequent receipt of a monthly cash allowance of IDR 134,819,900
                    (“the monthly allowance”) from the Indonesian company PT Mega
                    Fortune (“PT Mega”) for his role as its advisor and Vice Chairman,
                    after the due submission by the Respondents of the affidavit of assets as
                    required by cl 2, was not an asset that was required to be disclosed by the
                    Respondents pursuant to the terms of the Order, in particular
                cl 2.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     The Judge also held that cl 1(4) of the
                    Order by its terms only restricted the disposal or dealing of disclosed assets.
                    It was concerned with the diminution of the disclosed assets. In his opinion,
                    the monthly allowance was not by its nature an asset within the contemplation of
                    the Order, and this was so even if we assumed that there was a continuing
                    obligation on the part of the Respondents to update and disclose after-acquired
                    assets. Accordingly, there was no breach arising from Ho’s receipt of the
                    monthly allowance.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     Moreover, the Judge was of the view that there
                    was no breach of the Order by the Respondents’ failure to provide an
                    estimate of the values of their shares in various companies. In light of the
                    fact that the shares were of private companies in multiple jurisdictions, the
                    Judge thought that no additional commercial purposes could be served by
                    requiring the Respondents to provide an estimate of the shares when the
                    Appellants had been given the relevant financial statements and were able to
                    arrive at their own conclusion as to the valuation of those assets. The Judge
                    was of the opinion that to require the Respondents to take the further step of
                    procuring independent valuations of unlisted companies would be unduly onerous
                    considering the interlocutory nature and the purpose of a Mareva
                    injunction.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     As regards cl 3 of the Order (“cl
                    3”), the Judge found that the Respondents were not in breach of that
                    clause when they failed to declare the sources of the funds from which they had
                    utilised to spend on their ordinary living and legal expenses. The Judge noted
                    Ho’s explanation in his affidavit that the funds in question were the
                    monthly cash allowances received by him subsequent to the filing of his
                    affidavit of assets on account of his role as advisor and Vice Chairman of PT
                    Mega. Moreover, given that Ho’s interest in PT Mega had been duly
                    disclosed in his affidavit of assets, and he had not drawn on or dissipated the
                    bank accounts and assets disclosed in his affidavit of assets, the Judge said it
                    would be a stretch to conclude that Ho was to be subject to committal
                    proceedings by virtue of having received subsequent advances or gifts which had
                    already been determined (see <a href="#p1_10">[10]</a> above) not
                    to constitute assets for the purposes of the Order.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     In the premises, the Judge found that there
                    was no breach of the Order on the part of the Respondents. Therefore, the
                    Appellants’ application to commit the Respondents was
                denied.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Issues arising in this appeal</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     On the submissions of the parties, there were
                    five main issues which arose in the appeal, namely:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_14-p2_a"></a>(a)     Whether the monthly allowance
                        received by Ho constituted an asset for the purposes of the
                    Order;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_14-p2_b"></a>(b)     Whether the
                        Order operates only to restrict the disposal or dealing of disclosed
                        assets;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_14-p2_c"></a>(c)     Whether
                        the Respondents disclosed sufficient details of their assets with respect to
                        cl 2;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_14-p2_d"></a>(d)     Whether the Respondents breached cll 3 and 4 in not informing the
                        Appellants about the monthly allowance from PT Mega before using it on their
                        monthly expenditure; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_14-p2_e"></a>(e)     Whether an order of committal was an appropriate sanction
                        for the breach or breaches of the Order.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">We will now
                    address each of these issues in turn.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">General approach</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     Before addressing these arguments, we must
                    emphasize the paramount importance of respecting and obeying orders of court.
                    The proper administration of justice proceeds on the basis that orders of court
                    would and should be observed. At the core of this principle of obeying court
                    orders is the public interest in the administration of justice, including the
                    dispatch of litigation as expeditiously as justice in the case requires. No
                    party should be allowed to disregard orders of court. As Yong Pung How CJ
                    put it in <em>Re Tan Khee Eng John</em>
                    [1997] 1 SLR(R) 870 at [14]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<em>We are inviting anarchy in our legal system if we allow
                            lawyers or litigants to pick and choose which orders of court they will
                            comply with</em>, or to dictate to the court how and when
                        proceedings should be conducted.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     It is within the purview of the courts to
                    ensure that its orders are not contravened or thwarted (see <em>Pertamina Energy Trading Ltd v Karaha Bodas Co LLC and others</em>
                    [2007] 2 SLR(R) 518). Accordingly, a court will not hesitate to punish
                    any lawyer or litigant who fails to obey its orders or who seeks to undermine
                    the effectiveness of its orders. The courts will jealously guard against any
                    interference by any party which would disturb the proper administration of
                    justice <em>(see Jasa Keramat Sdn Bhd v Monatech (M) Sdn
                        Bhd</em> [2001] 4 MLJ 577 at 592C-G).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     The Order which this appeal was concerned with
                    was a Mareva injunction. The object of such an interlocutory order is to prevent
                    a defendant from dissipating his assets and thus rendering nugatory a judgment
                    which might eventually be obtained by the plaintiff against him, when the assets
                    would otherwise have been available to satisfy the judgment. Therefore, the
                    Mareva injunction is an important weapon in the arsenal of the court in dealing
                    with such a situation. In this regard, we must stress that the party against
                    whom a Mareva injunction is issued must obey <em>both</em>
                    the letter and the spirit of the order (see <em>Pan-United Marine
                        Ltd v Chief Assessor</em> [2008] 3 SLR(R) 569 at [42] where
                    the Court of Appeal emphasized the importance of looking at both the letter and
                    the spirit of the law in a different context). If there is any real uncertainty
                    as to the scope of an order the proper thing for a party to do is to seek the
                    assistance of the court or, at the very least, inform the other party of the act
                    that is intended to be carried out. Deliberate concealment or what seems like
                    clever manoeuvres to get round a Mareva injunction will be dealt with
                    accordingly.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Was the monthly allowance received by Ho from PT Mega an asset within
                the scope of the Order?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     The Appellants argued that the Judge erred in
                    holding that Ho’s subsequent receipt of the monthly allowance after the
                    due submission of the affidavit of assets did not by its nature constitute an
                    asset for the purposes of the Order. In support of this argument, the Appellants
                    cited the case of <em>OCM Opportunities Fund II, LP and others v
                        Burhan Uray (alias Wong Ming Kiong) and others</em> [2004]
                    4 SLR(R) 74 (“<em>OCM Opportunities
                        Fund</em>”), where Belinda Ang Saw Ean J opined at [57]
                    that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The Mareva jurisdiction extends to all assets, whether tangible assets or
                        mere choses in action, provided that the defendant is the legal or
                        beneficial owner of them: see <em>The Practice and Procedure
                            of the Commercial Court</em> (5th Ed, 2000) at 138. <em>Salary, like fees and commission, is a chose in action and is
                            capable of being caught by an injunction</em>. A monthly salary
                        that is paid into a bank account is caught by an injunction as and when it
                        is paid into the account.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     In contrast, the Respondents argued that the
                    monthly allowance was not an asset for the purposes of the Order. Counsel for
                    the Respondents highlighted the fact that he did not hold the legal title to his
                    shareholding in PT Mega. Legal title was held by a proxy. Thus, it was a
                    relationship of trust and his receipt of the monthly allowance was dependent
                    upon him keeping his business counterparts happy. Moreover, Ho also claimed that
                    a substantial part of the monthly allowance was spent on paying for the expenses
                    of Ho’s business counterparts, their families and relations each time they
                    visited Singapore from Indonesia and China.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     The Respondents also pointed out that an asset
                    was defined as a resource owned by a person which has a present or future
                    economic value that can be realised. Implicit in that definition was the element
                    of certainty that the economic value is owned and could be realised or enforced.
                    The resource in question should not be gratuitous or dependent upon the goodwill
                    of others. Following from this argument, the Respondents further argued that
                        <em>OCM Opportunities Fund</em> was clearly
                    distinguishable from the present case because the monthly allowance received by
                    Ho was not a chose in action as it did not possess the element of contractual
                    certainty like that of a salary, fee, commission or a debt owed by PT Mega to
                    Ho. Instead, his entitlement to the monthly allowance was dependent on trust and
                    the continual maintenance of good relationships between Ho and his Indonesian
                    counterparts.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     We were unable to accept this argument of the
                    Respondent which had no basis in reality. Although Ho held his title to his
                    shareholding in PT Mega by proxy, that shareholding was no less his. Ho had
                    declared in his affidavit that the shareholding in PT Mega was an asset of his.
                    It was disingenuous of him to assert that just because the legal title to the
                    shareholding was held by a proxy that the shareholding did not belong to him.
                    Through his proxy Ho was holding 90% of the shares in PT Mega which appeared to
                    own assets of approximately US$13 million.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> Ho was the beneficial owner of that
                    portion of the shareholding in PT Mega. To all intents and purposes, Ho was in
                    complete control of PT Mega. Equally important, we also noted that there was no
                    evidence that his proxy had not been acting in the affairs of the company in
                    accordance with his instructions. Indeed, the fact that Ho was holding the
                    important positions of company advisor and Vice Chairman was indeed telling. As
                    his beneficial interest in the 90% shareholding in PT Mega had been declared to
                    be an asset of his, it must necessarily follow that whatever payments made by PT
                    Mega to him, under whatever guise or label, must also be caught by the Order. If
                    this were not to be the case, there would be such a wide gaping hole which would
                    render completely ineffective a Mareva injunction. In the circumstances, it was
                    entirely lame for Ho to assert that his receipt of the monthly allowance was
                    dependent purely on trust and the continual maintenance of good relationships
                    between him and his Indonesian counterparts.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     As regards the Respondents’ contention
                    that a substantial part of the monthly allowance received by Ho was spent on
                    paying for the expenses of Ho’s business counterparts, their families and
                    relations each time they visited Singapore, this was nothing more than a bare
                        <em>ex-post facto</em> assertion without any shred of
                    objective evidence in support. There was nothing to indicate how much of the
                    monthly allowance was in fact (if at all) utilised for such expenses. Indeed, Ho
                    had admitted that he could not produce any acknowledgment, invoice or payment
                    voucher to support those expenditures, notwithstanding his claims that his
                    Indonesian business counterparts and their family members visited Singapore very
                    frequently either to shop or to seek medical treatment, while his Chinese
                    business counterparts dropped by once or twice a year and spent more on meals
                    and entertainment.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     Accordingly, we found that the monthly
                    allowance received by Ho was not a gift or an advance, but a payment he was
                    entitled to on account of his being the <em>de facto</em>
                    owner of 90% of PT Mega. It was therefore an asset which came within the scope
                    of the Order.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Whether the Order applied to the disposal or dealing of
                after-acquired assets</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     It was not disputed that the
                    Respondents’ disclosed assets were not sufficient to meet the amount
                    injuncted by the Order, and the monthly allowance was an asset which was
                    acquired by Ho after the making of the affidavit of assets. The
                    Appellants’ case was that the Order operated to restrict the
                    Respondents’ disposal of all assets up to the value of S$5.1 million,
                    regardless of whether the assets up to this value were disclosed by the
                    Respondents or otherwise. Given that the Respondents’ disclosed assets
                    were insufficient to meet the amount injuncted under the Order, the monthly
                    allowance received by Ho, though received after he had filed his affidavit of
                    assets must likewise be caught by the Order.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     The Appellants further argued that it defied
                    logic and the very purpose of a Mareva injunction to limit its scope to only
                    disclosed assets. To take the view that a Mareva injunction is limited in its
                    scope to only disclosed assets would seriously undermine the object of a Mareva
                    injunction as it would mean that the defendant could freely use his newly
                    acquired assets as he pleases when he has yet to meet the amount injuncted in
                    the Order. Furthermore, such a narrow view of the Order would not only encourage
                    stealth and subterfuge, but also substantially emasculate the
                Order.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     To address this issue it would be necessary to
                    start from first principles. The undoubted object of the Mareva injunction is to
                    prevent the course of justice from being frustrated by a defendant’s
                    actions which would have the effect of rendering nugatory or less effective any
                    judgment or order which the plaintiff may thereafter obtain against the
                    defendant. In <em>Commissioners of Customs and Excise v Barclays
                        Bank</em> [2006] 3 WLR 1, Lord Bingham said at [10]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It is very well established that the purpose of a freezing injunction is
                        to restrain a defendant or prospective defendant from disposing of or
                        dealing with assets so as to defeat, wholly or in part, a likely judgment
                        against it. The purpose is not to give a claimant security for his claim or
                        give him any proprietary interest in the assets restrained: Gangway Ltd v
                        Caledonian Park Investments (Jersey) Ltd [2001] 2 Lloyd’s
                        Rep 715 , para 14, per Colman J. The ownership of the assets
                        does not change. All that changes is the right to deal with them.</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     The position is restated by Mark S W
                    Hoyle, <em>Freezing and Search Orders</em> (London:
                    Informa, 4<sup>th</sup> Ed, 2006) as follows at
                    para 1.18:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The single most effective reason for granting a Mareva injunction was, in
                        practical terms, encompassed within the need to prevent a defendant snapping
                        his fingers at a judgment of the court with financial impunity, because he
                        had arranged his affairs so as to leave no worthwhile assets within the
                        reach of the plaintiff judgment creditor [per Lord Denning MR in <em>Pertamina</em> [1978] 1QB 644 at p. 661,
                        referring to the words of Kerr J].</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The material provisions on the financial limit of the Order were set
                    out in cll 1(1) and 1(4) (see <a href="#p1_7">[7]</a>
                    above).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     The combined effect of these two provisions
                    was to injunct the amount of S$5.1 million. They did not say that the Order
                    would only apply to assets declared by the Respondent in his affidavit. The all
                    important thing which the Order sought to achieve was to secure for the
                    Appellants the sum of up to S$5.1 million. To read the Order as having been
                    “frozen” as at the date of the making of the affidavit would very
                    seriously emasculate it. As the Appellant so rightly pointed out, to construe
                    the Order so narrowly would encourage stealth and subterfuge and in turn
                    engender controversies as to the origin of particular assets. We would
                    illustrate the problems a narrow interpretation of such an Order would cause as
                    follows. Let’s say that shortly after the making of the affidavit of
                    assets the defendants have by a stroke of luck acquired new assets. On this
                    view, the defendants would be free to spend their new funds and the only way for
                    the plaintiff to stop this would be for him to apply for a fresh order. To
                    require the plaintiff to re-apply for a fresh order, he must have some basis to
                    allege that he suspects that the defendants have acquired new assets. If the
                    defendants do not disclose that they have new funds, and certainly on this
                    narrow view of such an Order Ho is not obliged to do so, the plaintiff will
                    remain in the dark and he would not have any basis to apply for a fresh order.
                    In any event to require the plaintiff to make a fresh application whenever he
                    suspects the defendants to be in possession of new funds would be too cumbersome
                    and would seriously undermine the utility of the Mareva
                injunction.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     In our opinion, contrary to the view of the
                    Judge, there was nothing in cl 1(4) which suggested that the Order only
                    applied to disclosed assets. Suppose a defendant deliberately refuses to
                    disclose an asset, what then is the position of that asset? Would it then become
                    an undisclosed asset and not be subject to the Order? This would be ridiculous.
                    It was clear on a plain reading of cl 1(4) that the Respondents could
                    dispose of or deal with their assets outside Singapore even when they have
                    inadequate assets in Singapore to meet the Appellants’ claim as long as
                    the total unencumbered value of their assets <em>in and outside
                        of Singapore</em> were above the stipulated sum of S$5.1 million. The
                    purpose of cl 1(4) was to underscore the fact that the Order was only to
                    attach up to the sum of S$5.1 million and nothing more and it in no way sought
                    to derogate from cl 1(1).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     The approach taken by the Judge is untenable
                    from another angle. It cannot be doubted that cl 1(4) operated from the
                    moment the Order was granted (see <em>Z Ltd v A-Z and
                        AA-LL</em> [1982] 1 QB 558 at 572) and the Respondents had
                    to comply with it upon being served. The Judge’s interpretation of
                    cl 1(4) that it applies only to restrict the disposal or dealing of
                    disclosed assets would lead to the illogical conclusion that the Order did not
                    freeze any assets at all until the Respondents disclosed their assets in an
                    affidavit. Such an interpretation would again render the Order nugatory.
                    Moreover, it would be contrary to the very purpose of a Mareva injunction to
                    limit the scope of such an injunction to disclosed assets which did not exceed
                    the amount provided for in the injunction, as it would make it meaningless for
                    the quantum of such an injunction to be specified since the injunction would
                    allow for the Respondents to diminish their total assets by using after-acquired
                    assets or monies without due regard to their liabilities under the
                    injunction.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     Finally we would add that we are fortified in
                    our view by the decision in <em>TDK Tape Distributor (UK) Ltd v
                        Videochoice Ltd and Others</em> [1986] 1 WLR 141
                        (“<em>TDK Tape</em>”), where it was held
                    that a Mareva injunction would encompass assets acquired after the date the
                    injunction was granted. In <em>TDK Tape</em>, the
                    defendants’ solicitors applied the proceeds of an insurance policy which
                    had matured upon the death of the defendant’s wife towards the settlement
                    of their outstanding fees, after the grant of the Mareva injunction.
                    Skinner J held that the policy was in existence at the time the defendant
                    disclosed his assets by affidavit, and it was not an after-acquired asset.
                    Equally significant is that Skinner J opined that even if the policy had
                    been an after-acquired asset, it would still have been caught by the injunction
                    (at 145):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It seems to me that it would be a negation of the purpose of that
                        injunction if, every time the defendant acquired some new asset or property,
                        it was up to the plaintiffs to discover that and make an application to the
                        court that the existing injunction be extended to deal with it. It seems to
                        me that <em>a Mareva injunction is looking to the future and
                            is dealing with the situation between the obtaining of the judgment and
                            its eventual execution, and it will cover any assets which are acquired
                            between the granting of the order and the eventual execution of any
                            judgment obtained in the action in question</em>.</p>

          <em>TDK Tape</em> was
                    cited with approval in <em>Soinco SACI and Another v Novokuznetsk
                        Aluminium Plant and Others</em> [1998] 2 WLR 334, where
                    Coleman J stated at 348-349:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<em>If the assets of a trading company caught by the order
                            were to be confined to those in existence at the date of the order, but
                            subject always to dissipation in the ordinary course of business, much
                            of the value of the Mareva jurisdiction would be destroyed</em>.
                        Every time further funds were received by a trading company in such a case
                        it would be necessary to apply for another injunction. The view on this
                        matter expressed obiter by Skinner J in T.D.K. Tape Distributor (U.K.)
                        Ltd. v Videochoice Ltd. [1986] 1 W.L.R. 141 at 145B-D reflects the
                        assumption which has consistently been adopted in this court.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Skinner J’s reasoning in <em>TDK
                        Tape</em> has also been adopted in other jurisdictions (see the
                    Malaysian case of <em>Yukilon Manufacturing Sdn Bhd &amp; Anor v
                        Dato ‘ Wong Gek Ming &amp; Ors</em> (No 4) [1998]

                        Limited v Arthur Tse Lup Kee</em>
                [1995] HKEC 353).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Did the Respondents breach cll 3 and 4 of the Order in not informing
                the Appellants about the monthly allowance before using it on their monthly
                expenditure?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     The Appellants argued that the Judge erred in
                    finding that the Respondents did not breach the Order when the Respondents
                    failed to declare the source of their funds before spending the same on their
                    monthly expenses. It seemed to us clear that the Judge had come to this view
                    primarily because he thought that the monthly allowance was not an asset within
                    the scope of the Order and that in spending the monthly allowance the
                    Respondents were therefore not required to make any declaration as to its source
                    pursuant to cl 3 of the Order. To repeat, what cl 3 demanded was that
                    the Respondents should not spend beyond the prescribed limits in respect of
                    their ordinary living expenses and legal fees and should further, before
                    spending any money on the aforesaid purposes inform the Appellants’
                    solicitors where the money was to come from (see cl 3 set out above at
                        <a href="#p1_7">[7]</a>).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     It was not disputed that Ho spent about
                    S$16,115.27 to S$19,615.27 per month between June and November 2009 and that
                    these sums exceeded the spending limits imposed on the Respondents by cl 3.
                    In addition, Ho had failed to inform the Appellants’ solicitors as to the
                    source of the fund from which the expenditures would be taken. <em>Prima facie</em>, the Respondents had breached both aspects
                    of the obligation under cl 3. However, the Judge agreed with the
                    Respondents, holding that there was no breach of the Order because Ho’s
                    interest in PT Mega had been duly disclosed in his affidavit of assets, and he
                    had not drawn on or dissipated the bank accounts and assets that he had
                    disclosed. It was clear that the Judge had arrived at this decision based on his
                    perception that the monthly allowance was a subsequent advance or gift which did
                    not constitute an asset for the purposes of the Order. However, if this were to
                    be the correct view of the monthly allowance, then even if Ho had started to
                    receive it before the grant of the <em>ex parte</em> Mareva
                    injunction, the Respondents could argue that every payment so received was a
                    gift, and thus was not caught by the Order. The fact that the monthly allowance
                    was received by Ho after the grant of the Mareva injunction would not have made
                    a difference.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     As we have ruled in <a href="#p1_23">[23]</a> above that the monthly allowance constituted an asset for
                    the purposes of the Order even though it was a payment received after the
                    Respondents had filed their affidavit of assets, we therefore held that the
                    Judge was in error in holding that the Respondents had not breached cl 3.
                    In fact the Respondents had admitted that they had breached cl 3 in not
                    accounting for their weekly expenditures. They said:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">...[w]e [the Respondents] had inadvertently failed to account to the
                        Plaintiffs [the Appellants] under the 2<sup>nd</sup>
                        Injunction Order dated 31<sup>st</sup> July 2009 and I wish
                        to apologise for our failure.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     Indeed, we would further hold that the
                    Respondents, in spending the sums in excess of what was permitted under
                    cl 3 had also committed a breach of that part of the Order. In passing, we
                    would mention that the Respondents made the argument that they should not be
                    compelled to reduce their ordinary standard of living with a view to putting by
                    sums to satisfy a judgment which may or may not be given in the future. This
                    argument is wholly without merit. Once a Mareva injunction is made against a
                    defendant and the assets which he discloses do not satisfy the sum to be
                    injuncted, the defendant would no longer have the liberty to spend his money as
                    he pleases. He is subject to the restrictions placed by the court.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     Lastly, before we move to the next issue we
                    wish to add that we did not think that the Respondents had breached
                    cl 4.This was because that clause concerned the Respondents’ dealing
                    or disposing of their assets in the ordinary course of business. We were here
                    concerned only with the expenditures incurred by the Respondents on living
                    expenses and legal fees, and not how they dealt with their assets in the course
                    of business. Thus there could not have been a breach of cl 4 because it was
                    inapplicable.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Have the Respondents disclosed sufficient details of their assets
                pursuant to cl 2 of the Order?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     On this issue, the Appellants submitted that
                    the Judge erred in finding that there was no breach of cl 2 despite the
                    Respondents’ failure to provide the value and details of the assets
                    comprising their disclosed shareholdings in a number of private companies
                    (“the Private Companies”). The Appellants accepted that the
                    Respondents had provided some financial statements relating to the Private
                    Companies, but argued that the veracity of these statements was doubtful. The
                    Appellants also disputed the Judge’s finding that they had conceded that
                    the Respondents had provided them with the latest available financial statements
                    of the Private Companies. They further argued that the Judge was wrong to find
                    that there was no additional commercial purpose in getting the Respondents to
                    provide their estimate of the value of their shareholdings in the Private
                    Companies because it was the Respondents’ duty to do so under the Order
                    and that case law required that the Respondents disclose at least the net asset
                    value of their shares in the Private Companies.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     We agreed with the Appellants that they had
                    not conceded that the Respondents had provided them with the latest available
                    financial statements relating to the Private Companies. Instead, the Appellants
                    only acknowledged that they had received documents from the Respondents which
                    were relevant to the Private Companies but that those documents did not provide
                    an estimate of the market values of the shares of the Private
                Companies.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     However, what was more problematic was the
                    Appellants’ assertion that the onus was on the Respondents to provide to
                    the Appellants an estimate of the values of their shareholdings in the Private
                    Companies. In support of this argument, the Appellants cited <em>OCM Opportunities Fund</em> at [41] which held that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">...To that extent, <em>in the case of shares in private
                            companies, there is normally no difficulty disclosing the value on a
                            simple net asset basis</em>, as this can be determined from the
                        accounts of the company concerned. A disclosure of the par value of the
                        shares, as some of the majority defendants had done, is not adequate.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     We would emphasise that these views expressed
                    in <em>OCM Opportunities Fund</em> should be construed in
                    their proper context. In that case, where the plaintiff was granted leave to
                    cross-examine the defendants on their affidavits of assets on the ground that
                    the information furnished was incomplete and lacking in particulars, the court
                    in addressing the law, approved the general proposition that a defendant was not
                    required to incur any expenses in order to obtain a valuation of his assets.
                    Instead, the defendant was only obliged to disclose the value of his assets to
                    the best of his ability. The court then stated that <em>merely
                        disclosing the par value</em> of the shares in private companies was
                    inadequate because there was usually no difficulty in disclosing the value of a
                    share in a company on a simple net asset basis based on the accounts of the
                    company.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     In the present case, there was clear
                    difficulty for the Respondents to disclose the value of the shares in each of
                    the Private Companies. As the Judge rightly pointed out, these shares in
                    question related to several private companies in multiple jurisdictions. While
                    the parties were in dispute as to which documents the Respondents had furnished
                    to the Appellants in relation to the Private Companies, the fact of the matter
                    was that the Respondent did supply the Appellants with the relevant financial
                    statements of the Private Companies.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     We agreed with the Judge that based on the
                    financial statements provided by the Respondents, the Appellants should and were
                    in fact able to arrive at their own conclusion as to the valuation of the shares
                    in question. To require the Respondents to take the further step of procuring
                    independent valuations of unlisted private companies would be unduly onerous
                    considering the interlocutory nature and the purposes of a Mareva injunction.
                    Accordingly, we found that the Respondents had disclosed sufficient details of
                    their assets pursuant to cl 2.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Whether an order of committal is appropriate for the breaches
                committed by the Respondents</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     The power to punish for contempt summarily is
                    intended to enable the court to deal with conduct which would adversely affect
                    the administration of justice. It is necessary to maintain the dignity and
                    authority of the court and to ensure a fair trial (see <em>Summit
                        Holdings Ltd and another v Business Software Alliance</em> [1999]
                    2 SLR(R) 592 at [19]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     The relevant principles pertaining to an order
                    of committal are stated in <em>Singapore Court Practice
                        2009</em> (Jeffrey Pinsler gen ed)(LexisNexis, 2009)
                        (“<em>Pinsler</em>”) at para 52/1/2
                    as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">As a general principle, the judgment creditor is expected to use
                        alternative enforcement methods before contemplating committal. Even if
                        those methods have been engaged without success, the court will not commit
                        the judgment debtor unless there is credible evidence that the
                        debtor’s non-compliance was wilful in the sense that he refused or
                        neglected to pay in spite of his ability to do so (Khoo Wai Leong,
                        Ronnie v Andrew J Hanam [2003] SGMC 41, para 35;
                        …</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The other purpose of the order is to punish the offender for his contempt
                        (Re Barrell Enterprises [1973] 1 WLR 19). …</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Committal to prison is normally a measure of last resort. Other options
                        are available to the court, and often the exercise of its discretion will be
                        based on the attitude of the offender. If he is apologetic and promises to
                        comply with the court order (or if he has already complied with it since the
                        service on him of the notice of motion for committal), the court may merely
                        reprimand him in strong terms. If he has yet to comply with the order, the
                        court may warn him that unless he does so he will be imprisoned.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Further, para 52/2/1 of <em>Pinsler</em>
                    reads:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The importance of these requirements was recently emphasized by KC
                        Vohrah J in Syarikat M Mohamed v Mahindapal Singh [1991]
                        2 MLJ 112, at 114: ‘… since committal proceedings are
                        quasi-criminal proceedings and the liberty of the subject is involved, the
                        procedural rules applicable must be strictly enforced.’ The point is
                        that the person against whom the committal proceedings are brought
                        ‘needs to know with particularity what charge or charges they are
                        faced with, charges which can land them in prison’ (at 115). The
                        learned judge ruled that as it is the specific purpose of the statement to
                        include these grounds, any omission to do so cannot be made good by setting
                        them out in the affidavit, the purpose of which is to merely verify the
                        statement. … (See Cartier International BV v Lee Hock Lee [1993]
                        1 SLR 616 in which the High Court reiterated these
                        requirements.)</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     In <em>P J Holdings Inc v
                        Ariel Singapore Pte Ltd</em> [2009] 3 SLR(R) 582 at [7],
                    Choo Han Teck J stated:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">...Order 45 r 5 (1)(<em>a</em>) applies only when “a person required by a judgment or
                        order to do an act within a time specified in the judgment or order
                            <em>refuses or neglects</em> to do it.”
                        [emphasis added] … In <em>Re Quintin Dick</em>
                        [1926] Ch 992, Romer J held that the term “refuse or
                        neglect” was not equivalent to “fail or omit”, and that
                        the former implied a conscious act of volition whereas the latter did not.
                        In <em>Ng Tai Tuan v Chng Gim Huat Pte Ltd</em>
                        [1990] 2 SLR(R) 231, Chao Hick Tin JC (as he then was)
                        expressed the view that the word “neglect” necessarily implies
                        some element of fault. He cited the case of <em>In re London
                            and Paris Banking Corporation</em> (1874) LR 19 Eq 444
                        where Sir G Jessel MR said, at p 446:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">… the word ‘neglected’ is not necessarily
                            equivalent to the word ‘omitted’. Negligence is a term which
                            is well known in law. Negligence in paying a debt on demand, as I
                            understand, is omitting to pay without reasonable excuse. Mere omission
                            by itself does not amount to negligence. ...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The word “refuse” has also been similarly defined. In
                            <em>DP Vijandran v Majlis Peguam</em> [1995]
                        2 MLJ 391 , the court noted that “[t]he ordinary
                        meaning of the word refuse is to decline to give”, and that
                        “failure is not synonymous with refusal” Similar sentiments
                        were also expressed by the tribunal in <em>Lowson v Percy
                            Main &amp; District Social Club &amp; Institute Ltd</em>
                        [1979] ICR 568. I agree with the foregoing cases. …</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     With respect to the question as to the proper
                    sanction to be imposed by this court, we had borne in mind the following
                    circumstances. First, the case of the Respondents was that the breaches which
                    they had committed were due to their failure to appreciate that the monthly
                    allowance constituted an asset under the Order. The Respondents had assumed that
                    since they had already disclosed all their assets in their affidavit of assets,
                    including Ho’s shareholding in PT Mega, Ho’s subsequent receipt of
                    the monthly allowance after the filing of the affidavit of assets would not
                    constitute an asset for the purposes of the Order. Hence the Respondents felt
                    they were free to spend the monthly allowance on their monthly expenditures
                    without informing the Appellants. Second, they claimed that this erroneous
                    assumption in their minds was contributed by the fact that the Appellants,
                    though aware that the Respondents had not written to them to account for their
                    monthly expenditures since the first injunction Order was served on the
                    Respondents on 7 April 2009, did not complain about this omission until
                    some six months later on 11 September 2009. The Respondents explained their
                    mental thoughts as follows<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span>:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">If the Defendants [Respondents] were aware that this cash allowance should
                        be disclosed and accounted for, they would have done so. After all, the
                            1<sup>st</sup> Defendant’s [Ho’s] interest
                        in PT Mega Fortune has been honestly disclosed. There is also nothing to
                        hide as the Defendant’s [Ho’s] cash allowance is used for the
                        Defendants’ [Respondents’] monthly expenses of S$16,115.27
                        – S$19,615.27 which are all entirely proper and reasonable.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     However, it was clear to us that the
                    Respondents were less than candid about their interests in PT Mega, especially
                    with regard to the details on the monthly allowance. Even though Ho holds an
                    overwhelming 90% of the shareholding in PT Mega and therefore has complete
                    control over the company which had assets totalling approximately US$13 million,
                    the Respondents had not provided any relevant documents to show how the monthly
                    allowance was arrived at. Moreover, no documents were adduced to confirm
                    Ho’s assertion that he only received the monthly allowance subsequent to
                    the Respondents having filed the affidavit of assets or that this was the only
                    payment he received from PT Mega. Accordingly, we were unable to accept the
                    Respondents’ claim that the breaches arose out of their non-appreciation
                    of the scope of the Order.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     However, we did not, in any event, feel that
                    this was a case which we needed to commit the Respondents, particularly Ho, to
                    prison. As mentioned in <em>Pinsler</em> (see <a href="#p1_45">[45]</a> above) committal to prison should normally be
                    a measure of last resort. The advantage which the Respondents had obtained in
                    breaching the Order was to have more money to spend. In this instance, we felt
                    that a financial sanction would be sufficient. In our opinion, an appropriate
                    order to make was to require the Respondents to restore S$200,000 into their
                    Singapore account within seven days, with proof of such restoration to be
                    furnished to the Appellants’ solicitors. This sum was computed based on
                    the monthly amounts which the Respondents had spent in excess of the limit laid
                    down in the two Mareva injunctions over the period of the breach. Furthermore,
                    in order to impress upon the Respondents the utmost importance of complying with
                    an injunction, and that they should not resort to unilateral interpretations
                    favouring themselves, we ordered that the costs for this appeal be awarded to
                    the Appellants on an indemnity basis. That should suffice to register the
                    court’s disapproval of their conduct.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     For the reasons above, we allowed the appeal
                    with the usual consequential orders, and with the Appellants being entitled to
                    costs on the indemnity basis here and costs on the standard basis
                below.</p>
