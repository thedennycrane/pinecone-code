<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       The two appeals before me originated
                                        from claims by two employees, namely Li Aidong and Xu
                                        Yuecheng (collectively “the employees”),
                                        against their former employer, Xuyi Building Engineering Co
                                        (“Xuyi”) for non-payment of their salary in
                                        arrears, overtime pay, additional payments for work during
                                        work on public holidays and rest days, and unauthorised
                                        deductions of salary during their period of employment. In
                                        the same action, Xuyi counter-claimed that the employees had
                                        terminated their employment without adequate notice and
                                        claimed against them for payment in lieu of
                                notice.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The claims and counter-claims were
                                        dealt with under Part XV of the Employment Act (Cap 91,
                                        2009 Rev Ed) (“the Act”) and were heard
                                        by an Assistant Commissioner of Labour (the
                                        “AC”). On the employees’ claims, the AC
                                        held that the salary system by which Xuyi was to pay the
                                        employees was time-based and consequently, the employees
                                        were entitled to additional payments for overtime work, and
                                        work on public holidays and on rest days. Conversely, the AC
                                        found that Xuyi was entitled to payment in lieu of notice as
                                        the employees failed to give sufficient notice before they
                                        left their jobs. Dissatisfied with the AC’s decision,
                                        both sets of parties appealed.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Facts</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       On 1 March 2008, the China
                                        Shanghai (Group) Corporation for Foreign Economic and
                                        Technological Cooperation (the “China Agent”)
                                        signed an agreement with Xuyi whereby the China Agent was to
                                        recruit Chinese workers for Xuyi.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       The two employees were recruited by
                                        the China Agent, and they came to Singapore and to work for
                                        Xuyi. Under the employment agreements, Xuyi was to pay the
                                        employees under a “Job Value System”
                                        (“JVS”). The system which was set out in
                                        cl 3.1 of the employment agreement was that:</p>

                                        two employees decided to leave their jobs, but they did not
                                        give sufficient notice of termination as required by
                                        s 10 of the Act. Instead, they lodged claims with the
                                        Commissioner of Labour for arrears of salary, and Xuyi
                                        counterclaimed from them payment in lieu of notice under
                                        s 11 of the Act.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Issues on appeal</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       There are five main issues in these
                                        appeals before the court:</p>

                                                notice.</div>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Time-based or task-based system of payment</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       In a time-based system, an employee
                                        is paid on an agreed amount for a period of work, <em>e.g</em>. $X an hour, and for
                                        task-based work, an employee is remunerated with an agreed
                                        amount for a specific task, <em>e.g</em>. $X for tiling a room. The
                                        distinction between the systems was important in the dispute
                                        between Xuyi and the two employees because an employee paid
                                        on a time-based system is entitled to additional payments
                                        for overtime work and work on rest days under ss 37 and 38
                                        of the Act.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       However, s 39 of the Act
                                        exempts an employer from paying the additional payments for
                                        task-based work. The provision states:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-Heading1">
<b>Task
                                                  work</b>

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">39. Nothing in this Part shall prevent any employer
                                                from agreeing with any employee that the salary of
                                                the employee shall be paid at an agreed rate in
                                                accordance with the task, that is, the specific
                                                amount of work required to be performed, and not by
                                                the day or by the piece.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Sections 37, 38 and 39 are within Part IV of the Act
                                        which applies to workmen and employees who come under
                                        s 35 of the Act. The effect of s 39 of the Act is
                                        that where a payment is agreed for a task, the worker shall
                                        be entitled to the agreed payment, but shall not be entitled
                                        to overtime or rest day payments.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       In the hearing before the AC, Xuyi
                                        contended that the JVS was akin to that of the task work
                                        regime under s 39 of the Act and as such it was
                                        exempted from making additional payments for overtime work
                                        and work on rest days. The employees, on the other hand,
                                        contended that they were remunerated on a time-based system,
                                        with an expected monthly salary of $1,250 to $1,500 referred
                                        to in cl 3.1 of their agreements, and that they were
                                        therefore entitled to additional payments for overtime work
                                        and work on rest days, and public holidays.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     Xuyi had argued that a task-based
                                        system was in operation. The evidence adduced by Xuyi was
                                        that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The workers are divided into groups of 2 to 5 persons
                                                initially. Each group will be allocated jobs at the
                                                beginning of the day. For example, the job is to
                                                construct a staircase from level 3 to level 4 and a
                                                group of 5 workers are assigned to this job. If the
                                                job can be completed within a day and the value of
                                                the job is $300.00, this amount will be shared among
                                                them, not equally, but based on each worker’s
                                                contribution using hours of work for
                                                calculation</p>
<p class="Judg-1">but it did not produce record of any agreement between
                                        it and the employees whereby the latter agreed to perform a
                                        task for an agreed sum before work commenced.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     This absence of evidence lead to
                                        the AC to hold that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I am of the view that Section 39 is not applicable in
                                                this case because there was no agreed rate for the
                                                job upfront and the amount of work to be done was
                                                also not specified.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     The AC was correct in this
                                        finding. In order to classify a remuneration system as
                                        task-based, the two essential elements must be identified:
                                        first, the task or job to be performed, and second, the
                                        amount of payment for the performance of that task. The
                                        system described by Xuyi did not show that the workers had
                                        the opportunity to agree on the payment for the task. For
                                        there to be a proper task-based agreement, the employees
                                        should be told in advance about the task involved, and the
                                        payment offered. It is not sufficient that they be informed
                                        at the beginning of the day; the employees must have the
                                        time to agree to the task and the payment. It is significant
                                        that Xuyi’s account of the system referred to
                                        notification of the task and the value, but not the
                                        employees’ acceptance.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     Employers are entitled to take
                                        advantage of the task work system to avoid having to make
                                        the payments prescribed in Part IV of the Act, but they must
                                        observe the letter and spirit of s 39 of the Act. In
                                        view of the disparity between parties in bargaining power,
                                        employers cannot contrive superficial task-based
                                        arrangements to deprive their employees of the additional
                                        payments. Task work systems should only be given effect to
                                        where the tasks and payments are clearly set out, and the
                                        employees have accepted them before undertaking the
                                        task.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Additional payments</p>

                                        not task-based, Xuyi has to make additional payments for
                                        overtime work and work on rest days provided in Part IV of

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     There is another form of

                                        employees who come under the Act. This provision was
                                        previously s 44 of the Act and came under Part IV of
                                        the Act but moved out of it when the Act was amended in

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     Mr Gan Kim Yong, Acting
                                        Minister of Manpower explained in the Parliamentary debates

                                                Paid public holidays and sick leave are
                                                well-established industry norms provided by nearly
                                                all employers. However, the Act currently only
                                                prescribes these benefits for those employees
                                                covered under Part IV. Clause 28 will extend
                                                these benefits to all employees covered under the
                                                Act. This amendment will maintain the flexibility of
                                                employers requesting employees to work on public
                                                holidays for an extra day's wage, or substitute a
                                                public holiday with another working day.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     It would appear that public
                                        holiday payments are due under a task-based system if an
                                        employee is required to work on a holiday. However, it is
                                        unclear how the payment is to be computed as
                                        “day’s salary” as contemplated in
                                        s 88(4) of the Act is set in a task-based system of
                                        payment. Perhaps the parties can circumvent this difficulty
                                        by agreeing on a “day’s salary” to be
                                        used for this purpose.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Basic rate of pay</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     Having established that additional
                                        payments are to be made to the employees, the two
                                        employees’ basic rate of pay has to be determined. The
                                        employees contended that the basic hourly rate should be
                                        calculated with reference to the range of $1,250 to $1,500
                                        as set out in cl 3 of the employment agreement. The
                                        employees took the low end of the range, $1,250, multiplied
                                        it by 12 months, and divided the result by the 52 number of
                                        weeks in a year and the 44 hours of work in a week,
                                        borrowing the formula set out in s 38 (6)(a) of the
                                        Act. Under this formula, the basic hourly rate is $6.56 per
                                        hour.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     Xuyi argued that the formula
                                        cannot be used to compute the basic rate of pay because the
                                        $1,250 mentioned in cl 3.1 was the monthly salary on
                                        “a perfect work attendance record”, which
                                        would include overtime work and overtime
                                payments.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     If the salaries of the workers
                                        were to be decided as time-based, another clause in the
                                        employment agreement, cl 3.2, should apply.
                                        Clause 3.2 states:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Employer shall under normal circumstances not execute
                                                time based system. The employer shall have the right
                                                to arrange or not to pre-arrange [the employees] to
                                                undertake work base on the time based system. The
                                                standard work time shall be 20 Singapore Dollars for
                                                every working day of 8 hours that is, 2.5 Singapore
                                                Dollars every hour. For the convenience of
                                                calculation, time based salary standard shall be
                                                calculated according to the length of time that [the
                                                employee] is at work and use the salary standard of
                                                28 Singapore Dollars for every working day of 8
                                                hours or a salary standard of 3.5 Singapore Dollars
                                                every hour. This is a salary standard of average
                                                hours and this standard has already included and
                                                taken into a round up consideration on the situation
                                                of the workers working overtime and working during
                                                public holidays. The workers shall not make
                                                additional request for any overtime salary or
                                                allowance. At the same time, this salary standard
                                                had already included and taken into consideration of
                                                the living expenses of the workers during their stay
                                                in Singapore and the management fee in the domestic

                                        that the basic hourly rate of pay is to be $2.50. However,

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     The AC modified the formula to use
                                        the agreed monthly pay instead of the weekly pay
                                        contemplated by s 38(6)(b) of the Act, and overlooked
                                        the fact that the payments of the two employees were not
                                        piece-rated. Well-intended as it was, the AC’s
                                        methodology was not acceptable. The payments must be worked
                                        out in accordance with the provisions of the Act.
                                        Extra-legislative improvisations cannot be employed. In this
                                        case, it was also unnecessary because the basic rate of pay
                                        of $2.50 an hour set out in the employment agreement should
                                        be used.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     After I made my finding that the
                                        employees are to be paid on a time-based basis at the basic
                                        rate of $2.50 per hour, I directed counsel for the parties
                                        to work out the amounts that were due to the two employees,
                                        including the additional payments. Ironically, it turned out
                                        that Xuyi had paid the two employees slightly more under the
                                        JVS than it would have paid on the time-based
                                system.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Half-hour safety meetings</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     This issue arises from the
                                        half-hour safety meetings that the employees were required
                                        to attend before the start of work each day. The AC found
                                        that the employees were to be paid for their attendance at
                                        these meetings. Section 2(1) of the Act defines
                                        “hours of work” as:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[T]he time during which an employee is at the disposal
                                                of the employer and is not free to dispose of his
                                                own time and movements exclusive of any intervals
                                                allowed for rest and meals</p>
<p class="Judg-1">As the employees were required by Xuyi to attend the
                                        meetings, the half-hours involved were working time. The
                                        AC’s finding was absolutely correct.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     There was another aspect of the
                                        AC’s ruling on the meeting hours that called for
                                        attention. After he found that the half-hour meeting time
                                        was working time, he added a half-hour to each day, although
                                        the half-hour was already clocked on the employees’
                                        time cards and regarded as working time. The correct
                                        position is for the clocked times to be used, without the
                                        reduction of a half-hour as Xuyi proposed, and without
                                        adding another half-hour.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Payment in lieu of notice</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     In the proceedings below, Xuyi
                                        counter-claimed against the employees for payments of salary
                                        in lieu of notice. While Li indicated to Xuyi his doubts
                                        over continuing his employment, Xu left Xuyi’s
                                        employment without any word. If the employees were obliged
                                        to give notice, the full statutory period of notice was not
                                        fulfilled because s 11(1) of the Act provides
                                        that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Either party to a contract of service may terminate
                                                the contract of service without notice or, if notice
                                                has already been given in accordance with section
                                                10, without waiting for the expiry of that notice,
                                                by paying to the other party a sum equal to the
                                                amount of salary at the gross rate of pay which
                                                would have accrued to the employee during the period
                                                of the notice and in the case of a monthly-rated
                                                employee where the period of the notice is less than
                                                a month, the amount payable for any one day shall be
                                                the gross rate of pay for one day’s
                                                work.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     The issue in this case was whether
                                        the employees were entitled to terminate their employment
                                        without notice. Section 11(2) of the Act provides
                                        that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Either party to a contract of service may terminate
                                                the contract of service without notice in the event
                                                of any wilful breach by the other party of a
                                                condition of the contract of service.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The employees argued on appeal that they were not
                                        required to give notice of termination under the Act since
                                        Xuyi committed a fundamental breach of their employment
                                        contract by refusing to pay them for salary for four months
                                        that was owed to them.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     In response, Xuyi stated that
                                        cl 3.4 of the agreement provided that the salaries were
                                        only paid to the workers after every three months of work,
                                        and were on every fourth month. Insofar as the payment
                                        periods were expressly spelt out and were not in
                                        contravention of the Act, Xuyi was not in breach of the
                                        contract in the scheduling of the payments.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     Xuyi’s breach was that it
                                        failed to compute the employees’ payments in
                                        compliance with the Act, and that can bring s 11(2) of
                                        the Act into play. The provision refers to “any
                                        wilful breach” of a condition of the contract of
                                        service. Counsel for the employees equated that to a
                                        fundamental breach. I do not think that was apt, and I would
                                        consider a wilful material breach would suffice.
                                        Sections 37, 38 and 88 of the Act apply to the
                                        employment agreements and operate as conditions of the
                                        agreements. A considered decision not to pay an employee in
                                        accordance to those provisions of the Act is a wilful
                                        material breach. Accordingly, the employees did not have to
                                        give notice of their resignation.</p>
