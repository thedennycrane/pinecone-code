The Defendant argued, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, that the Contract was frustrated in March 2012 when the sale of the sole product listed under Schedule A of the Contract had ceased. The Plaintiff on the other hand argued, amongst others, that the scope of the Contract was not limited only to the product listed under Schedule A, and that the Contract continued to operate between the parties even after March 2012. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Summary of the Plaintiff’s case</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">10 The Plaintiff argued that the Contract was not limited to the single product listed under Schedule A, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the Villages of Aina Le’a (“the Villages Product”), but covered other products which the Defendant was appointed to market on behalf of the Plaintiff. Therefore, the Contract was not discharged when the sale of the Villages Product ceased, and instead continued in operation after March 2012. The Contract had been breached by the Defendant given that he had promoted products sold by the Plaintiff on behalf of other entities, and in this regard breached the non-compete clauses in the Contract, which were valid restraint of trade clauses. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The proper interpretation of the Contract </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">11 The Plaintiff argued that its interpretation of the Contract as covering other products aside from the Villages Product was supported by the text, in particular cll 1, 10(a), and 10(c) of the Contract.

Its interpretation was also supported by the fact that the Defendant had sold other products on behalf of the Plaintiff even before March 2012, which is the relevant period in which the sale of the Villages Product came to an end and at which the Defendant claimed the Contract had been discharged.

I found also that the Defendant breached the Contract by his actions, and therefore damages were to be assessed. No vitiating factors operated.    </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 The Defendant’s defamation counterclaim was not made out as the letter dated 6 March 2015 was not defamatory. In any event, the defence of justification would have been established in the light of the finding that there was breach of the Contract.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Analysis </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 The following analysis will consider in turn:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) the proper interpretation of the Contract;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) whether there was frustration of the Contract;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) whether the Contract had been terminated;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) whether the restraint of trade clauses were enforceable;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) whether the Contract was breached; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(f) the Defendant’s defamation counterclaim. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Interpretation of the Contract</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 The first issue that had to be considered was the contractual obligation of the Defendant. The question of the proper interpretation of the Contract in the present case involved some intricacy. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 I had some sympathy for the Defendant’s submissions on the proper interpretation of the Contract which focused on its plain wording. That the preamble of the Contract tasked the Defendant with marketing the products stipulated in Schedule A, and that Schedule A only listed the Villages Product, seemed to suggest on its face that the Contract only covered the Villages Product. Such an interpretation of the Contract carried the force of simplicity and certainty. It also left the consequences for any shortcoming in the express wording of the Contract on its drafter, in this case the Plaintiff. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 Nevertheless, however attractive as this approach may be, I was satisfied that applying the current law on the interpretation of contracts which requires the assessment of both text and context, the proper interpretation is that the Contract covered all of the products which the Defendant was tasked with, given or undertook to promote, market or sell for the Plaintiff, including the Dolphin Product. This flowed from the context of the Contract as a whole, as well as the commercial objective of the Contract.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Law on contractual interpretation</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 In interpreting a contract, the court should balance both the text and the context of the agreement. The starting point of contractual interpretation is the text of the agreement (see <span class="font-italic">Y.E.S</span><span class="font-italic">. F&amp;B Group Pte Ltd v Soup Restaurant Singapore Pte Ltd (formerly known as Soup Restaurant (Causeway Point) Pte Ltd) </span>[2015] 5 SLR 1187 (“<span class="font-italic">Y.E.S</span><span class="font-italic">. F&amp;B Group Pte Ltd</span>”) at [32]; <span class="font-italic">Ngee Ann Development Pte Ltd v Takashimaya Singapore Ltd </span>[2017] 2 SLR 627 at [61]). However, where the text concerned is ambiguous, the relevant context would be of first importance (<span class="font-italic">Y.E.S</span><span class="font-italic">. F&amp;B Group Pte Ltd</span> at [34]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 In addition, even where the text itself may appear plain and unambiguous, where the unambiguous meaning of the text would lead to an absurd result, the court should undertake an examination of the context in order to determine if the text were indeed unambiguous as originally thought to be the case. This is since if the text of the agreement were indeed clear and unambiguous, there would be a confluence with context, in that the context would not call into question the plain meaning of the text itself (see <span class="font-italic">Y.E.S</span><span class="font-italic">. F&amp;B Group Pte Ltd</span> at [31]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 The context must however be weighed in the light of the objective evidence. In <span class="font-italic">Y.E.S</span><span class="font-italic">. F&amp;B Group Pte Ltd</span>, the Court of Appeal reiterated that the context cannot be used to justify the avoidance of a seemingly absurd result arising from a textual interpretation at all costs. In particular, a seemingly absurd result should not be evaded if the objective evidence shows that the absurd result was indeed within the contemplation of the parties at the time of contracting. In other words, context should not be used as a basis for the court to rewrite the contract. The court has to determine the intentions of the parties at the time they entered into the contract. The Court of Appeal stated at [32]:  </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[T]here must be a <span class="font-italic">balance</span> between the text and the context. In other words, the context <span class="font-italic">cannot </span>be utilised as an excuse by the court concerned to <span class="font-italic">rewrite</span> the terms of the contract according to <span class="font-italic">its </span>(<span class="font-italic">subjective</span>) view of what it thinks the result ought to be in the case at hand. … More specifically, whilst there is a need to avoid an absurd result, this aim cannot be pursued at all costs; it must necessarily give way if the objective evidence clearly bears out a <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">causative connection</span> between the absurd result or consequences on the one hand and the intention of the parties at the time they entered into the contract on the other. What we mean by this, essentially, is that if the objective evidence demonstrates that the parties had contemplated the absurd result or consequence, the court is not free to disregard this to reach what may seem to it to be a more commercially sensible interpretation of the contract. Avoiding an absurd result is thus <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">one factor</span> (albeit a not unimportant one) which is considered in the entire process of interpretation by the court. Put simply, the court <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">must</span> ascertain, based on <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">all the relevant objective evidence</span>, <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">the intention of the parties</span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic"> </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic font-underline">at the time they entered into the contract</span>. In this regard, the court should <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">ordinarily</span> start from the working position that the parties did not intend that the term(s) concerned were to produce an absurd result. <span class="font-italic">However</span>, this is <span class="font-italic">only</span> a <span class="font-italic">starting point</span> – <span class="font-italic">and no more</span>. It might, for example, well be the case that the <span class="font-italic">objective</span> evidence demonstrates that the parties were <span class="font-italic">aware of</span> the absurd result that might ensue from the said term(s), but <span class="font-italic">nevertheless proceeded</span> to enter into the contract in question …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis in the original]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 With these principles in mind, I consider in the following analysis the proper interpretation of the Contract.   </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Relevant clauses in the Contract</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 Several clauses in the Contract had to be interpreted in the present dispute. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 The preamble of the Contract reads:

The role of pleadings is to outline the party’s case in order to inform the court of the parameters of the dispute and the opponent party of the case it had to meet (see <span class="font-italic">PT Prima International Development v </span><span class="font-italic">Kempinski Hotels SA and other appeals</span> [2012] 4 SLR 98 at [35]). In <span class="font-italic">SIC College of Business and Technology Pte Ltd v Yeo </span><span class="font-italic">Poh Siah and others</span> [2016] 2 SLR 118, at [46], the Court of Appeal explained in relation to the law on pleadings that a court should not adopt an overly formalistic and inflexible rule-bound approach which might result in injustice. The Court of Appeal added that “Ultimately, the underlying consideration of the law of pleadings is to prevent surprises arising at trial…”</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 The Plaintiff had sufficiently pleaded its case.

In this case, there was no need for the Plaintiff to have listed in its statement of claim all of the relevant terms in the Contract which it sought to rely on to support its understanding of the scope of the Contract. The lack of the complete details of a party’s case in its pleadings is to be expected in the light of the role of pleadings as explained at [55].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 There was no infringement of the rule in <span class="font-italic">Browne v Dunn</span> either.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Clause 1: Clause 1 stated that the Defendant would receive a personal commission “in accordance to the type of product sold”, showing that more than one product was envisaged by the parties. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Clause 10(a): The products under cl 10(a) which the Defendant was prohibited from engaging in competing activities in included “insurance, stocks, bonds, private placement, unit trusts and/or any other forms of securities product(s)” which were non-land based products. The Villages Product was a land-based product and if the Contract were indeed intended to cover only the Villages Product, the inclusion of non-land based products under cl 10(a) would be inexplicable.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Clause 10(c) refers to the Defendant retaining control over, amongst others, “<span class="font-italic">jobs</span> accepted” [emphasis added].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 However, while all of these provisions may have showed that parties contemplated a variety of different products as falling within the scope of the Contract, they did not expressly exclude the possibility that there would only be one product included in the Contract, as specified by the text of the preamble and Schedule A. Therefore, it could not be said that cll 1, 10(a) and 10(c) plainly and unambiguously meant that the scope of products covered under the Contract extended to products other than that listed under Schedule A. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 The text of cll 1, 10(a) and 10(c) did suggest however that the relationship between the parties persisted and went beyond the marketing of the sole product listed under Schedule A. Therefore, while the text of the preamble and Schedule A were on its face plain and unambiguous and suggested that only one product was covered under the Contract, read with other clauses of the Contract, including cll 1, 10(a) and 10(c), the scope of products covered under the Contract was not clear cut. The text of the Contract was however not the end of the matter and the context had to be considered. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Interpretation based on context</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 The most crucial contextual factor that had to be taken into account was that the Contract, which took the form of a letter of appointment appointing the Defendant as Vice President and an independent contractor of the Plaintiff, was to govern the entirety of the relationship between the Plaintiff and the Defendant. While it is possible for a relationship to be concerned with only a single product, this conclusion would be less likely where there are indications that a continuous, prolonged relationship was intended to exist between the parties. Here, I found that the rest of the terms of the Contract pointed to such a relationship and that the focus of the Contract was on the relationship between the parties rather than on a specific product. Based on an examination of the Contract as a whole, the objective of the Contract was the delineation and governance of an ongoing relationship between the parties. That also to my mind accorded with the commercial objective of the parties. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 As the Contract was one which governed the appointment of the Defendant to a post within the Plaintiff company, in particular as a Vice President (albeit also as an independent contractor), I was of the view that the parties’ intention was not to have Schedule A which lists only one product, to delimit the entirety of the relationship between the parties. It would be incongruous for a contract intended to govern the entirety of a long-term relationship between the parties to have included only obligations relating to one product. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 The express inclusion of only the Villages Product under Schedule A could be explained as reflecting the fact that the Villages Product was the only product sold by the Plaintiff at the time of the conclusion of the Contract.

This included the fact that the Contract prevented the Defendant from engaging in competing activities across various types of products marketed by the Plaintiff as listed in cll 10(a)(i)–(iii) which covered property, insurance, and securities. The scope of confidential information protected under cl 11(a) was also much broader than would be the case if the Contract was intended by the parties to be limited to the single product listed under Schedule A.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">71 Against this context, the fact that subsequent amendments in the form of the addition of other products were made in relation to other third parties with whom the Plaintiff had entered into similar contracts, did not sway the matter – that exercise put the question beyond any doubt for those whose contracts were indeed amended and updated after the conclusion of the contract; it did not show however that the Contract between the Plaintiff and the Defendant which was not amended after its conclusion should be interpreted in the manner contended for by the Defendant.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">72 The Plaintiff pointed to the fact that the Defendant sold other products not listed under Schedule A on behalf of the Plaintiff prior to March 2012, in support of its interpretation.

We do, however, reiterate that any such evidence must satisfy the tripartite requirements of relevancy, reasonable availability and clear and obvious context mentioned in <span class="font-italic">Zurich Insurance</span> ([52] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) before it may be admitted to interpret a contract.

Such subsequent conduct was relevant since it shed light on what the parties had regarded their obligations <span class="font-italic">vis</span><span class="font-italic">-a-vis</span> each other under the Contract to be. In this regard, it assisted in the determination of what the parties’ objective agreement was at the point of conclusion of the Contract (as opposed to parties’ subjective intentions post-contract). That products other than the Villages Product were sold by the Defendant on behalf of the Plaintiff was also information that was reasonably available to both of the parties.

</div> such an explanation encounters too many difficulties to be viable.

</div> However, any informal contract or implied contract on the marketing of the other products would have to contain terms covering similar areas as those under the Contract, including terms concerning the payment of commissions, non-compete, and so on. In fact, though the Defendant’s case was that the Contract covered only the Villages Product, the Defendant’s testimony suggested that when he sold other products on behalf of the Plaintiff before March 2012, the Defendant did not consider himself free to sell those same products on behalf of other companies:

So the point of it is before March 2012 for, let’s say, the Dolphin product, if it had been marketed, or was being sold by some other company other than [the Plaintiff], would you have really considered yourself as being able to sell it for the other company?</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"> A. I think no, your Honour.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">79 I found that it was implausible for the parties to have intended their relationship to be governed by two separate arrangements in relation to the Villages Product and other products, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, one based on the express terms in the Contract and one based on informal arrangements. There was no evidence showing that such an arrangement was indeed intended by the parties. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">80 The sale of other products on behalf of the Plaintiff by the Defendant was therefore indicative of the objective intention behind the Contract and how the parties mutually viewed their obligations. It showed that the parties intended and considered other products aside from the Villages Product as falling within the scope of the Contract. Certainly had any dispute arisen between the parties concerning the sale of the other products, it was more probable than not that both parties would have looked to the terms of the written Contract, which showed that they mutually regarded themselves bound by the terms of the Contract in relation to those other products.   </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Conclusion on interpretation</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">81 In coming to these conclusions, I was mindful that the commercial objective of the parties should not be overly strained and that the court is not free to disregard the parties’ intentions based on its own view of what is the more commercially sensible interpretation of the contract. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">82 The Contract as a whole in this case pointed to the entirety of the relationship between the Plaintiff and the Defendant being governed by that Contract and this suggested that more than one product was included within its scope. This was in my view not a strained determination of the commercial objective which was not aligned with the parties’ intentions. This was especially since the Contract took the form of a letter of appointment, making the Defendant a Vice President, with the objective of marketing the product or products as an independent contractor. These various aspects are not usually contracted together, but that was the Contract as it stood. It was certainly not a contract drafted in the best possible way.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">83 Since the ambiguity in the Contract could be resolved by interpreting the Contract based on its context, the <span class="font-italic">contra</span><span class="font-italic"> proferentem</span> rule, invoked by the Defendant to argue that its interpretation should be accepted, was not applicable (see <span class="font-italic">Hewlett-Packard </span>at [51]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">84 Therefore, based on an interpretation of the Contract, I found that the Contract was not limited to the Villages Product and that other products marketed by the Plaintiff fell within its scope. In particular, though not expressly included under Schedule A, the Contract included the Dolphin Product which the Defendant marketed and sold on behalf of the Plaintiff.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">87 Frustration requires the occurrence of a supervening event after the formation of the contract which renders the contractual obligation “radically or fundamentally different” from what had been agreed in the contract (see <span class="font-italic">Alliance Concrete Singapore Pte Ltd v Sato Kogyo (S) Pte Ltd</span> [2014] 3 SLR 857 at [33]). Such a supervening event arises through no fault of either party. The effect of frustration is to discharge both parties from their contract automatically by operation of law. The doctrine is applied strictly based on a multi-factorial assessment, and operates to discharge the parties from their contract only in exceptional cases. As Rix LJ articulated in the English Court of Appeal decision of <span class="font-italic">Edwinton</span><span class="font-italic"> Commercial Corporation, v Tsavliris Russ (Worldwide Salvage &amp; Towage) Ltd (The Sea Angel)</span> [2007] 2 Lloyd’s Rep 517 at [111]: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">In my judgment, the application of the doctrine of frustration requires a multi-factorial approach. Among the factors which have to be considered are the terms of the contract itself, its matrix or context, the parties’ knowledge, expectations, assumptions and contemplations, in particular as to risk, as at the time of contract, … and then the nature of the supervening event, and the parties’ reasonable and objectively ascertainable calculations as to the possibilities of future performance in the new circumstances. … [T]he test of ‘radically different’ is important: it tells us that the doctrine is not to be lightly invoked; that mere incidence of expense or delay or onerousness is not sufficient; and that there has to be as it were a break in identity between the contract as provided for and contemplated and its performance in the new circumstances. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">88 As explained above, I rejected the Defendant’s interpretation of the Contract as covering only the Villages Product and found that the Contract covered all of the products which the Defendant was tasked with, given or undertook to promote, market or sell for the Plaintiff. In addition, the Contract, which took the form of a letter of appointment appointing the Defendant as a Vice President and independent contractor, governed the whole of the relationship between the Plaintiff and the Defendant. It therefore could not be said that the cessation of the sale of the Villages Product on its own rendered the obligations under the Contract radically different.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">89  In any event, I would not have found, even on the Defendant’s interpretation of the Contract as covering only the Villages Product, that there was frustration. Even if the Defendant’s interpretation of the Contract were accepted, the cessation of the sale of the Villages Product would not have amounted to a supervening event which frustrated the Contract. It may have released the Defendant’s obligation under the Contract to market the Villages Product but it did not follow that such cessation resulted in the Contract as a whole being frustrated. Exhaustion of the subject matter of the contract does not necessarily itself lead to frustration of the contract. For frustration to be applicable, it must be shown that the unavailability of the subject matter of the contract or the product(s) essential for the performance of the contract (in this case the Villages Product based on the Defendant’s interpretation of the Contract) was not within the contemplation of parties and thus had the effect of radically changing the obligation under the contract. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">90 Here, I found that the cessation of the sale of the Villages Product was an event that was within the contemplation of the parties. The Villages Product is a land-based product. The sale of the Villages Product was essentially the sale of land that is to be developed in a particular area in Hawaii.

</div> that while the doctrine of restraint of trade is equally applicable to a clause that restricts trading during the currency of the agreement, an approach leaning more towards freedom to contract as opposed to freedom to trade should be taken in relation to such clauses (as opposed to those that restrict trade post-termination of the relationship or agreement). In other words, primacy should be given to the contractual bargain struck between the parties in relation to a restraint of trade clause that operates during the continued existence of a relationship of employment, work or service between the parties. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">104 I found that the non-compete clauses in the Contract were enforceable as they protected legitimate proprietary interests of the Plaintiff and fulfilled the twin test of reasonableness. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Legitimate proprietary interest </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">105 On the facts, I found that the Plaintiff had a legitimate interest in ensuring that an independent contractor and Vice President it had hired to market products sold by the Plaintiff did not market those same products on behalf of other companies while the contract was still in operation between the parties. Cll 10 and 11 also protected the Plaintiff’s legitimate interest in safeguarding and maintaining its trade connections with its product suppliers and in preventing the use of its confidential information including price lists, marketing, sales information and business plans from being used by its own representative on behalf of other companies. These factors fell within the interests in protecting trade secrets and trade connections which the courts have recognised as legitimate proprietary interests justifying protection (see <span class="font-italic">Man Financial</span> at [81])</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Reasonableness </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">106 The test for reasonableness in relation to a restraint of trade clause is two-pronged.

</div> Indeed, the wording of cll 10 and 11 limited the Defendant’s activities to those in competition with the Plaintiff. The clauses were thus reasonable as between the parties since the product coverage was not excessively wide. It was also reasonable in the interests of the public given that the Plaintiff did not have a monopoly in the industry or over the sale of the products, and companies selling the same products could engage persons other than the Defendant to sell the products on their behalf. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">109 In terms of the geographical scope, the Defendant argued that the scope of cl 11(b)(i) which extended to Asia, was too wide to be reasonable since he was Singaporean and had only worked in Singapore.

I was also satisfied that the transcripts of the video recordings and reports from the private investigation company were admissible. Nothing came up in the trial that required a reconsideration of the admissibility of these sources of evidence and I remained of the view at the end of trial that the sources of evidence were admissible. Neither was I convinced that there was anything that rendered these pieces of evidence unreliable. The Defendant took issue with various aspects of the video evidence, including that they were copies rather than the originals, that there was a break in the chain of custody as the maker of the recordings had not been called as witnesses, and that there were breaks and skips in the recordings. I found however that the various steps taken by the private investigation company including in copying from the recording device and storing the footage on other devices did not render the footage inadmissible or unreliable.

</div> The relevant sections are ss 63–67 of the Evidence Act which concern proof of documentary evidence. “Document” is defined under s 3 of the Evidence Act to include, in addition to a document in writing, </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">d</span>) any disc, tape, sound-track or other device in which sounds or other data (not being visual images) are embodied so as to be capable (with or without the aid of some other equipment) of being reproduced therefrom;</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">e</span>) any film … tape, disc or other device in which one or more visual images are embodied so as to be capable (with or without the aid of some other equipment) of being reproduced therefrom; </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">116 Section 63 states that the content of documents may be proved by primary or secondary evidence. Section 66 encapsulates the best evidence rule and states that “[d]ocuments must be proved by primary evidence except in the cases mentioned in section 67”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">117 Section 64 of the Evidence Act defines primary evidence as being the document itself. Section 64, read with the definition of “document” under s 3, therefore treats any device in which visual and sound images “are embodied” as being primary evidence. Therefore, copies of video or sound recordings produced in court are “document[s]” and as such primary evidence. This is to my mind a reflection of the fact that any copy of a video or sound recording which captures events contemporaneously is in itself essentially real evidence and should be treated as such. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">118 In addition, Explanation 3 to s 64 of the Evidence Act also specifies that a copy can be primary evidence: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-italic">Explanation</span> 3.—Notwithstanding <span class="font-italic">Explanation</span> 2, if a copy of a document in the form of an electronic record is shown to reflect that document accurately, then the copy is primary evidence.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">“Electronic record” is in turn again defined under s 3 of the Evidence Act as being “a record, generated, communicated, received or stored by electronic, magnetic, optical or other means in an information system or transmitted from one information system to another”. Thus, an alternative ground to that under [117] for admission of the copies of video or sound recordings is that they are accurate copies and thus primary evidence for that reason.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">119 The evidence from the private investigators was to the effect that the copies of the video recordings came from the recording device, in that the original recordings were copied from the recording device to various devices. After the files had been copied to other devices, they were deleted from the recording device to free up space on the recording device.

</div> These were all to my mind immaterial and insufficient to render the recordings inadmissible. None of the skips in the videos which were of short durations could point to deliberate tampering of the evidence or undermine the reliability of the recordings as a whole. The skips, abrupt endings and differences in the nature of the files (distinct parts rather than continuous streams) did not show that there had been deliberate tampering of the video recordings and likely arose due to technical issues with the recording devices. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">121 Further, nothing was put to the Plaintiff witnesses that there was any portion that was inaccurate in reflecting the true events. The Defendant when he testified did not raise anything material that put the accuracy of these recordings into doubt – his primary contention was that he was merely playacting during the meetings, not that the recordings were inaccurate or that they were false in anyway. The Defendant did not suggest for instance that the video recordings, in ending abruptly or containing short skips, failed to portray the true events that occurred during the meetings; or that his conduct as reflected in the videos and relied on by the Plaintiff as constituting breach of the Contract were inaccurate or taken out of context. For this same reason, the fact that another video recording of the meeting on 19 November 2014 recorded by the Private Investigator was not produced in evidence (see [32] above) was immaterial. Indeed, the Defendant himself accepted that the video recordings were accurate, at least as to the material portions.

A translation certificate pursuant to Order 92 Rule 1 of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2014 Rev Ed) was also not necessary. Many conversations are conducted in a mixture of languages and so long as the predominant language used is English, it is not necessary, to my mind, for certification to be done. In any event, this has been addressed through the production of the relevant translation certificate by the Plaintiff, although at a relatively late stage.

<div class="FootnoteRef text-justify">  Defence and counterclaim (amendment no. 1) at p 21</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">133 For defamation to be made out, the following requirements must be established (see <span class="font-italic">Gabriel Peter &amp; Partners (suing as a firm) v Wee Chong Jin and others</span> [1997] 3 SLR(R) 649 at [24]; <span class="font-italic">Loh</span><span class="font-italic"> Siew Hock and others v Lang Chin Ngau</span> [2014] 4 SLR 1117 at [18]): </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The statement must be defamatory.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Such a statement must refer to the plaintiff.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) The statement must be published or caused to be published by the defendant.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">In relation to the requirement in (a), a statement is defamatory in nature if it is one that tends to lower the reputation of the plaintiff in the esteem of right-thinking members of society generally; causes the plaintiff to be shunned or avoided; or exposes the plaintiff to hatred, contempt or ridicule (see <span class="font-italic">Golden Season Pte Ltd and others v </span><span class="font-italic">Kairos Singapore Holdings Pte Ltd and another</span> [2015] 2 SLR 751 at [36]). As noted in Gary Chan Kok Yew &amp; Lee Pey Woan, <span class="font-italic">The Law of Torts in Singapore</span> (Academy Publishing, 2nd Ed, 2016) at para 12.017, the test of lowering the reputation of the plaintiff appears to be that most widely referred to in Singapore, and will be the test considered here.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">134 In the assessment of the meaning of the words claimed to be defamatory, the test to be applied is an objective one. The court decides the meaning the words would have conveyed to an ordinary, reasonable person using his general knowledge and common sense; the meaning intended by the maker of the defamatory statement is irrelevant (<span class="font-italic">Microsoft Corp and others v SM Summit Holdings Ltd and another and other appeals</span> [1999] 3 SLR(R) 465 at [53]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">135 I found that the remarks made in the letter dated 6 March 2015 would not be understood to carry a defamatory meaning. The ordinary meaning would simply be that there was some incident or event that gave rise to the suspension of the Defendant. What the incident or event was which gave rise to the suspension was not expanded upon in the letter, and the letter could not without more be given a meaning that would lower the esteem of the Defendant in the eyes of right-thinking members of the society. A suspension could for instance be simply on the basis that there was some dispute or disagreement or a parting of ways. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">136 The Defendant contended that the wording of the letter dated 6 March 2015 meant or were understood to mean that the Defendant had committed either a criminal or civil wrong. That was not to my mind a conclusion that would be drawn. An ordinary reasonable person would consider that suspension may arise from matters falling short of the actual commission of a criminal or civil wrong. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">137 In any event, in relation to the commission of civil wrong, a breach of contract itself would not, unless particularly egregious, be conduct that would lead to a lowering of reputation and therefore be defamatory. Contractual breaches may arise for many reasons including differing interpretations of obligations or possibly even the pursuit of better economic gains. In addition, even if the remarks were in its natural meaning defamatory, the defence of justification would be made out in the light of my conclusion that there was indeed breach of the Contract by the Defendant. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">138 Therefore, I found that the statements were not defamatory in nature as they did not, unlike argued by the Defendant, convey that criminal or civil wrongs had been committed by the Defendant and there was no lowering of the reputation of the Defendant in the esteem of right-thinking members of society.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">139 In conclusion, I found that the Contract was breached by the Defendant. The extent and consequence of such breach will be examined at a quantification hearing. I also dismissed the Defendant’s counterclaim for defamation as the letter dated 6 March 2015 were not defamatory in nature. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">140 For completeness, I note that in the Defendant’s closing submissions, claims were also made that the Plaintiff had defamed the Defendant not just to the 107 recipients of the letter dated 6 March 2015 but that Desmond Chong and/or the Plaintiff had also defamed the Defendant to the Plaintiff’s staff in an announcement made to the staff of the Plaintiff at a meeting.
