In reviewing a matter, a Judge exercises both<span class="font-italic"> </span>supervisory and appellate jurisdiction (<span class="font-italic">Law Society of Singapore v Yeo </span><span class="font-italic">Khirn Hai Alvin and another matter </span>[2020] 4 SLR 858 (“<span class="font-italic">Yeo Alvin</span>”) at [26]). In exercising the supervisory jurisdiction, the Judge may consider the “correctness, legality or propriety” of the determination, which is “directly referable to the traditional grounds of illegality, irrationality and procedural impropriety in judicial review” (<span class="font-italic">Iskandar bin Rahmat v Law Society of Singapore </span>[2021] 1 SLR 874 (“<span class="font-italic">Iskandar</span>”) at [32]). However, while the ambit of the Judge’s ability to consider and determine the correctness of the findings made by a Disciplinary Tribunal encompasses the traditional scope of judicial review, it is not so limited. Instead, in exercising the appellate jurisdiction, the Judge may also assess the substantive<span class="font-italic"> </span>merits of the findings and the determinations of the Disciplinary Tribunal (<span class="font-italic">Loh Der Ming Andrew </span>at [34] and [36]).  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">7 That said, while the Judge may determine any question necessary to be determined for the purpose of doing justice in the case, under s 97 of the LPA, the Judge is nonetheless limited in the orders that may be made. In particular, the Judge does not have the power “to order any penalty or even to make recommendations as to any penalty” (<span class="font-italic">Iskandar</span> at [33],<span class="font-italic"> </span><span class="font-italic">Loh Der Ming Andrew </span>at [33]). Upon a review, the Judge may (a) direct that an application be made to advance the matter to the C3J, or (b) set the matter aside and either remit it to the same Disciplinary Tribunal, or, as submitted by the AG in respect of this matter, direct that a new Disciplinary Tribunal “hear and investigate the complaint or matter”.

When Counsel for the Law Society appeared before the assistant registrar (the “first AR”), the first AR indicated that he was not inclined to make any order. He reasoned that Rule 11 of the DT Rules does not expressly refer to O 7 r 7 of the ROC. He also pointed out that Rule 26(1) of the DT Rules states that a Disciplinary Tribunal “shall have the power to regulate its own proceedings, and in doing so, the Disciplinary Tribunal shall have regard to the practice and procedure of the Courts.” He thus concluded that the DT might have the power to grant the substituted service orders, and that it would be preferable for the Law Society to apply to the DT instead.

In turn, by Rule 11 of the DT Rules, “a request for an order to attend court” under s 91(2) of the LPA “shall be made at the Registry of the Supreme Court” in accordance with O 15 r 4 of the ROC. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 Pursuant to O 15 r 4(1) of the ROC, a party may request the Registrar to issue an order to attend court. Specifically on the issue of service, O 15 r 4(3) of the ROC provides that an order to attend court must be personally served on the witness. O 7 r 7(1) of the ROC provides that where a document is required to be served personally but it is impractical to do so, a party may apply to serve it by substituted service, with O 7 r 7(2) stating that “the Court may order any method of substituted service that is effective in bringing the document to the notice of the person to be served”.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 Reading these provisions, the Registrar of the Supreme Court has the power to issue orders to attend court for disciplinary proceedings. As these orders shall be served on witnesses as if they relate to High Court actions (<span class="font-italic">ie</span><span class="font-italic">, </span>s 91(4) of the LPA), these orders shall be personally served (<span class="font-italic">ie</span><span class="font-italic">,</span> O 15 r 4(3) of the ROC). If it is impractical to personally serve any such order, it may then be served by way of substituted service pursuant to an order of court. As with an order to attend which relates to a High Court action, O 7 r 7 of the ROC would be applicable. Indeed, given that such orders are served as if they relate to High Court actions, by s 91(4) of the LPA, they may also be enforced by the machinery of the court to compel the attendance of witnesses.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 In any event, it seems to me that the first AR should have proceeded to deal with the applications based on his view of the legal provisions, rather than to direct Counsel for the Law Society to seek the DT’s views. Further, and with due respect to the second AR, I disagree with the decisions to dismiss the applications. With all that said, it was completely open to Counsel for the Law Society to appeal against the decisions. But this was not done.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 With the sub-issue dealt with, I turn to consider whether the DT erred by not providing its views earlier to Counsel for the Law Society, and by not directing the Law Society to re-apply to the court for substituted service orders. As pointed out by the AG, the touting charges were the more serious charges before the DT. A charge of touting “if found proved could attract the punishment of disbarment” (<span class="font-italic">Re Ong </span><span class="font-italic">Tiang Choon</span> [1977-1978] SLR(R) 291 at [21]). It is contended that because the DT failed to give timely directions to secure the attendance of key witnesses before the DT, it resulted in Mr Manohar having “no case to answer” in relation to the touting charges.

Under Rule 12(1) of the DT Rules, the DT “may give the parties directions for the conduct of the matter by way of a letter”. Further, under Rule 13 of the DT Rules, the DT “may, of its own motion …, direct the parties to attend a pre-hearing conference, in order that it may make such orders or give such directions as it thinks fit for the just, expeditious and economical disposal of the matter.” The DT could have sought clarifications at a pre-hearing conference and given the appropriate directions to Counsel for the Law Society.

</div>
</div> Having failed to do any of the above, the DT had allegedly erred. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 Upon consideration, I am unable to agree with the AG’s position. In my view, like the court, a Disciplinary Tribunal should not have to deal with hypothetical issues. The DT was under no duty to provide its views or advice to the Law Society. Indeed, the DT correctly took the view that what the Law Society sought from it was a view or advice without any subsisting application before it. There was no live issue before the DT, and yet, the DT was asked to give an answer, <span class="font-italic">in vacuo,</span> as to whether it would have the power to grant an order for substituted service. It seems to me that in such circumstances, the court would not have granted an answer to the legal question without an application before it, and equally, I do not see why the DT should have been expected to. Notwithstanding the case management powers and responsibilities of the DT, the DT did not err in refraining from answering the hypothetical question put to it. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 I go further to consider in more detail how the DT’s response featured in this saga. Despite taking the position that it was not required to state its view, the DT pointed out that it was the prerogative of the Law Society to re-submit its applications to the court, and on 28 February 2023, Counsel for the Law Society in fact took steps to do so. This was well ahead of the hearing dates beginning 23 March 2023. Unfortunately, as set out above, the applications were dismissed on 9 March 2023. In this light, even if, for the sake of argument, the DT erred in failing to give a definitive answer to the Law Society, I cannot see how the DT’s response led to there being no evidence before it on the alleged payments made by Mr Manohar to Mr Ng. Therefore, even if the DT had erred in its response, this did not, in my view, have a material impact on the course of the disciplinary proceedings and their eventual outcome. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 Moreover, it appears to me that two aspects of the Law Society’s conduct thereafter may well be considered unsatisfactory. First, as I mentioned earlier at [36] above, Counsel for the Law Society could have appealed against the second AR’s decisions, but did not. Counsel for the Law Society could also have applied for a postponement of the hearing before the DT, until any appeals were dealt with. Instead, on 10 March 2023, the Law Society made a formal application before the DT for substituted service orders. Secondly, having had the formal application turned down by the DT on 20 March 2023, by way of the issuance of the March Decision, again, Counsel for the Law Society could have sought a postponement of the hearing, or having dealt with the other five witnesses, could have applied for further time to re-consider its position in relation to the two witnesses, including any appeal against the second AR’s decisions. Of course, I would imagine that Mr Manohar would have objected to any such measures. However, the point to be made is that Counsel for the Law Society, presumably in consultation with the Law Society, did not take these steps. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 Before me, the Law Society did not fully explain the reasons for the approach taken by Counsel for the Law Society, save for its explanation that even if Mr Ng and/or Mr Krishna had attended the hearing, it did not seem that they would have been cooperative, or given useful evidence in support of the touting charges. According to the Law Society, when interviewed by Counsel for the Law Society, Mr Ng had shown himself unwilling to give any information on the matter. In fairness to the Law Society, I observe that although Mr Ng testified as a witness in the first set of disciplinary proceedings, <span class="font-italic">ie</span><span class="font-italic">, </span>DT/9/2019, pursuant to a subpoena, it seemed that the First DT had to rely mainly on the strength of the investigation statements which were eventually ruled as inadmissible, including two statements given by Mr Ng (<span class="font-italic">Shanmugam Manohar </span>at [18]-[19]). With all that said, I am not entirely satisfied with the explanation of the Law Society for its approach. By s 91(5) of the LPA, any person giving evidence before a Disciplinary Tribunal is legally bound to tell the truth. If Mr Ng had attended the hearing pursuant to a subpoena, this provision would have been applicable. Be that as it may, the AG does not seriously take issue with the Law Society’s conduct of the case. Rather, the AG’s arguments are focused on whether, in the face of the approach taken by the Law Society, the DT erred in managing the proceedings and in proceeding with the hearing. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 At the hearing, the AG suggested that the DT’s response (with an unclear position) left the Law Society with little time to react when the DT finally refused the application on 20 March 2023. The AG also faulted the DT for not exercising proper case management powers thereafter, submitting that the DT could have initiated a postponement of the DT hearing on its own motion, so as to secure the attendance of the witnesses. The AG pointed out that disciplinary proceedings are not purely criminal proceedings, and that the DT has a duty to investigate the matter by ensuring that the necessary evidence is put before it. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 I have great difficulty with these arguments. I agree that the DT has a duty to hear and investigate the Complaint. Section 93 of the LPA provides that after “hearing and investigating any matter referred to it”, a Disciplinary Tribunal shall make its determination. However, in my view, a Disciplinary Tribunal hears and investigates the matters based on what is “referred to it”, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the evidence put before it by the parties. Like the court, and any other tribunal, a Disciplinary Tribunal has to remain impartial, and it must be circumspect about its role in relation to the procurement and presentation of evidence. Ahead of the hearing, I do not think it was for the DT to speculate whether the Law Society had the necessary evidence to proceed with the charges, and to take steps on its own initiative to secure evidence to shore up one party’s case. Even though Mr Ng and Mr Krishna were clearly key witnesses, it is not the AG’s position that the DT <span class="font-italic">knew</span> that they were the only ones who were able to give evidence in relation to the alleged payments from Mr Manohar to Mr Ng. After all, the five clients were called as witnesses. If at all, it appears to me that if Counsel for the Law Society had known of the difficulties with its case, in consultation with the Law Society, it should have taken the necessary steps to address these issues. If the DT had entered into the fray, prematurely assessing the sufficiency of the evidence, and granting an adjournment on its own motion to facilitate potential evidence being placed before it (without being in the position to know in detail the evidential case of the Law Society), its actions might well have been susceptible to challenge by Mr Manohar on other grounds. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 Finally, the AG also argued at the hearing that while others might have been at fault, it remained the role of the DT to ensure that the Complaint was properly investigated. If no evidence at all was received on the touting charges, this would have been no different from the Law Society bringing forward charges which do not capture the gravamen of the Complaint. According to the AG, in both scenarios, the Disciplinary Tribunal would not be in a position to properly investigate the matter, and any determination would be liable to be set aside. I beg to differ. In the latter situation, where charges do not capture the gravamen of a complaint, a Disciplinary Tribunal is deprived of jurisdiction (see <span class="font-italic">Yeo Alvin</span> at [79]). Even if the evidence led goes towards the complaint, but the complaint falls outside the charges, the Disciplinary Tribunal would not be able to meaningfully consider such evidence. However, when a charge is properly framed to capture the gravamen of a complaint, the Disciplinary Tribunal is in the position to investigate the matter – but only based on the relevant evidence placed before it by the parties. I see nothing to suggest that a Disciplinary Tribunal has a duty to search and gather the necessary evidence on its own motion; this role remains that of the parties.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 Accordingly, I do not think that the first issue provides any basis to set aside the Determination of the DT. In providing the DT’s response, the DT did not err. Further, there was no irregularity in the proceedings arising from the DT’s response. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The second issue </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 I turn to the second issue. As AG points out, the DT reasoned that Rule 26 of the DT Rules provides that a Disciplinary Tribunal “shall have regard to the practice and procedure of the Courts”.

</div> Thus, broadly speaking, the Law Society does not take the position that its discretion is wholly unfettered.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 I agree with the AG that the Law Society does not enjoy the same breadth of discretion to frame, amend, or withdraw charges as the Public Prosecutor does in respect of criminal charges. As observed by the C3J in <span class="font-italic">Ravi </span><span class="font-italic">Madasamy</span> at [47], the source of the Law Society’s power to “prosecute”<br/>advocates and solicitors for disciplinary offences is a statutory power derived from the LPA, and the exercise of the disciplinary powers by the Law Society is susceptible to judicial review. In contrast, the Public Prosecutor has wide prosecutorial discretion to institute, conduct or discontinue any proceedings for any offence under Art 35(8) of the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore (1985 Rev Ed, 1999 Reprint), and as the AG highlights, there is a presumption of legality or regularity in relation to the exercise of prosecutorial discretion.

</div> Again, for similar reasons, this observation is not wholly correct. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 While a Disciplinary Tribunal has “no jurisdiction to hear and investigate anything else other than the complaint” (<span class="font-italic">Yeo Alvin</span> at [92]), it must also confine its findings to the charges brought before it and is not at liberty to consider allegations which are omitted therefrom (<span class="font-italic">Constance Margreat </span><span class="font-italic">Paglar</span> at [31]-[32]). Consequently, “[w]here the Law Society has framed a defective charge that fails to reflect the substance of the complaint, the [Disciplinary Tribunal] lacks jurisdiction in hearing and investigating the charge and making a determination thereon, and the [Disciplinary Tribunal’s] determination is liable to be set aside” (<span class="font-italic">Constance Margreat </span><span class="font-italic">Paglar</span> at [37]). Similarly, where charges which are essential to capturing the gravamen of the complaint are withdrawn by the Law Society, the final determination will also be liable to be set aside (<span class="font-italic">Yeo A</span><span class="font-italic">lvin </span>at [79(a)] and [83]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 The question, therefore, is whether the admitted charges which remained before the DT for its final determination, after the Law Society’s decision to withdraw was made and acted on, accurately reflected the gravamen of the Complaint, or whether they were different “in form and substance” (<span class="font-italic">Yeo </span><span class="font-italic">Alvin</span> at [92]). In this regard, <span class="font-italic">Yeo </span><span class="font-italic">Alvin</span> and <span class="font-italic">Constance Margreat </span><span class="font-italic">Paglar</span> are instructive. In <span class="font-italic">Yeo Alvin</span>, the complaint related to a client’s “capacity to instruct the respondent and [his firm] and to agree to the fees charged” (at [83]), whereas the charges which were brought before the Disciplinary Tribunal for final determination (after several others had been withdrawn) pertained only to overcharging and made no mention of the client’s mental capacity. The charges were therefore different from the complaint “in form and substance” and failed to reflect the gravamen of the complaint, which warranted setting aside the determination of the Disciplinary Tribunal (<span class="font-italic">Yeo Alvin </span>at [92]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 On the other hand, in <span class="font-italic">Constance Margreat </span><span class="font-italic">Paglar</span>, the gravamen of the complaint was the “respondent’s failure to obtain [the client’s] approval before negotiating further on his behalf and the fact that she had acted wholly contrary to his explicit instructions – in other words, [the client’s] complaint was really that the respondent had not been entitled to make the 21 June Offer in the first place” (at [38]). In contrast, the “tenor of the amended charge was that the respondent had merely failed to provide [the client] with an update on the progress of the matter” (<span class="font-italic">Constance Margreat </span><span class="font-italic">Paglar</span> at [38]). While the C3J found that the “amended charge did not capture the full extent of the respondent’s transgression, it was not so defective as to warrant setting aside the DT’s determination” (<span class="font-italic">Constance Margreat </span><span class="font-italic">Paglar</span> at [39]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 In my view, the present case is much more akin to the facts and circumstances of <span class="font-italic">C</span><span class="font-italic">onstance Margreat Paglar </span>than <span class="font-italic">Yeo </span><span class="font-italic">Alvin</span>. The AG suggests that the reference to “at least five cases” in the Complaint suggests that the gravamen of the Complaint must comprise some element of “frequency of Mr Manohar’s misconduct”.

</div> It is not clear to me that the frequency of misconduct could be said to be the gravamen of the Complaint. As stated at [8] above, setting aside the touting allegation, the nub of the Complaint was about the failure to attend to each client when the warrant to act was signed. In form and substance, the admitted charges capture the crux of the Complaint. However, even if the frequency of misconduct is an important aspect of the Complaint, I do not think that the withdrawal of two non-communication charges and two total non-communication charges materially detracted from that gravamen. By way of comparison, it was found in <span class="font-italic">Constance Margreat </span><span class="font-italic">Paglar</span> that the charge of “failing to update a client” did not fail to reflect the gravamen of the complaint of acting wholly contrary to client’s instructions to such a degree as to warrant setting aside the determination. In the present case, the admitted charges involved three clients, with the infractions taking place in different years, <span class="font-italic">ie</span><span class="font-italic">, </span>two in 2014 and one in 2016. The admitted charges reflected that such conduct was not one-off, and that the infractions happened over time. Accordingly, it cannot be said that the decision to permit withdrawal of the charges was wrong, or that the remaining charges were so defective that the DT lacked jurisdiction, such that its Determination ought to be set aside. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The third issue  </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 Turning to the third issue, the AG contends that the DT failed to appreciate the seriousness of the admitted charges, and thereby erred in finding that there was no cause of sufficient gravity for a referral under s 83 of the LPA.

Soon after the warrants to act were signed, Mr Manohar would meet up with the clients and take instructions. Mr Manohar relies on two cases concerning charges of failing to keep clients informed of matters. In <span class="font-italic">Constance Margreat </span><span class="font-italic">Paglar</span>, the matter was referred back to the Disciplinary Tribunal by the C3J for determination of an appropriate order to be made, and in <span class="font-italic">The Law Society of Singapore v Krishnamoorthi S/o </span><span class="font-italic">Kolanthaveloo </span>[2023] SGDT 2, the respondent was ordered to pay a penalty of $3,500. Mr Manohar argues that in comparison, the penalty of $3,000 imposed upon him is not inappropriate. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 The Law Society also referred to <span class="font-italic">Law Society of Singapore v Udeh Kumar s/o </span><span class="font-italic">Sethuraju </span>[2013] 3 SLR 875 (“<span class="font-italic">Udeh Kumar</span>”), which concerned a contravention of Rule 11A(2)(<span class="font-italic">f</span>) of the Legal Profession (Professional Conduct) Rules (Cap 161, R 1, 2000 Rev Ed) (which corresponds to Rule 11A(2)(<span class="font-italic">f</span>) of PCR 2011 and Rule 39(2)(<span class="font-italic">g</span>) of PCR 2015). There, the complaint arose out of a sale of a flat in divorce proceedings. Throughout the retainer, the respondent did not communicate directly with the complainant to obtain or confirm her instructions, and he was suspended from practice for three months. The Law Society argues that <span class="font-italic">Udeh Kumar </span>is readily distinguishable, as Mr Manohar met with the clients concerned soon after the warrants to act were executed.

I acknowledge that, as the AG points out, a legal practitioner has a duty to explain to a prospective client the terms of a retainer and their respective rights and obligations thereunder before a warrant to act is signed. The AG also highlights that the warrants to act contained onerous terms authorising the Firm to “defray all incidental cost and expenses on [the client’s] behalf/account”. The clients were also required to acknowledge that “[the Firm] may at all times discharge themselves without any given reason and then upon discharge they shall have a lien over all documents and money held on behalf of [the clients] until payment of [the Firm’s] professional costs”.
