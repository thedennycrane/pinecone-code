<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       This is an assessment of the amount of
                    “reliance loss” damages that a distributor is entitled to recover
                    as a result of a producer’s supply of defective drinks. It raises several
                    important and interesting issues that go to the very basis of an award of
                    “reliance loss” damages in contract. First, it raises the issue of
                    whether a distributor can recover, as wasted expenditure, the full money value
                    of advertising services it paid for not in cash but by way of redemption of
                    advertising credits and a prize, both of which were not assignable or
                    transferable and had a fast approaching expiry date. Second, it raises the issue
                    of whether <em>any quantum</em> of advertising expenses
                    should be considered to be in the reasonable contemplation of parties, such as
                    to preclude an argument that the loss is too remote, simply on the basis that
                    the parties must have known that this <em>type</em> of
                    expense would, in all likelihood, be incurred.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Background</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       In early 2007, Out of the Box Pte Ltd
                    (“the plaintiff”) designed and conceptualised a sports drink known
                    as “18”. The plaintiff had high hopes for “18”,
                    believing that it could one day go global. As such, the plaintiff was willing to
                    spend more than $700,000 to advertise and promote “18”.
                    Unfortunately, the manufacturer that the plaintiff engaged to produce
                    “18”, Wanin Industries Pte Ltd (“the defendant”),
                    supplied defective “18” that changed colour and contained foreign
                    particles or insects. Following consumer complaints, the Agri-Food and
                    Veterinary Authority of Singapore (“AVA”) put up an advisory
                    warning against the consumption of “18” and directed that the
                    plaintiff recall all stocks of “18” in the market. The
                    “18” brand having been irretrievably damaged, the plaintiff
                    decided to discontinue “18”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       The plaintiff sued for breach of contract and
                    obtained summary judgment against the defendant. At the assessment stage, the
                    plaintiff claimed for its “reliance loss”. In other words, the
                    plaintiff claimed for the expenses that it had incurred in reliance of the
                    manufacturing contract with the defendant (“the contract”) that
                    had been wasted as a result of the defendant’s breach. The total amount of
                    the plaintiff’s claim, after deducting the revenue earned from sales of
                    “18”, is $779,812.31, and the breakdown is as follows:</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       Unsurprisingly, the defendant argued that the
                    plaintiff is not entitled to this amount. In particular, the defendant
                    strenuously objected to the amount claimed as advertising and promotional
                    expenses (“advertising expenses”).</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       The defendant’s arguments with regard to
                    the advertising expenses are two-fold. First, there is a general objection to
                    the overall amount claimed on the basis that such a large amount was not within
                    the reasonable contemplation of the parties and should thus be irrecoverable for
                    being too remote. Second, the defendant specifically objects, for a variety of
                    reasons, to the full recovery of many of the individual items of expense
                    claimed. I will first consider each of the defendant’s specific objections
                    to determine the overall amount of advertising expenses <em>validly incurred</em>. I will then consider whether these validly
                    incurred expenses are so large as to be outside the reasonable contemplation of
                    the parties.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       In the context of this case, I use the term
                    validly incurred expenses to refer to expenses that have been <em>proven</em> and to which there are no well-founded objections apart
                    from the general objection that the loss is too remote. It is trite law that to
                    succeed in a claim for damages, a plaintiff must prove its loss. As held in
                        <em>Robertson Quay Investment Pte Ltd v Steen Consultants Pte
                        Ltd</em> [2008] 2 SLR(R) 623 (“<em>Robertson Quay</em>”) at [31]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">31    ... [A] plaintiff cannot simply make a claim for
                            damages without placing before the court sufficient evidence of the loss
                            it has suffered even if it is otherwise entitled in principle to recover
                            damages. On the other hand, where the plaintiff has attempted its level
                            best to prove its loss <em>and</em> the evidence is
                            cogent, the court should allow it to recover the damages claimed.
                            [emphasis in original]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">In the present case, the plaintiff has adduced evidence of all the
                    relevant invoices and has also furnished supporting documents. As held in
                        <em>Thode Gerd Walter v Mintwell Industry Pte Ltd</em>
                    [2010] SGHC 33 (“<em>Thode Gerd
                        Walter</em>”) at [39]–[40], there
                    is no requirement in law that the makers of invoices must invariably be called
                    to explain them as this would be “impractical”, although there may
                    be cases where this would be warranted. The court went on to outline two such
                    instances, the first being where there appears to be no factual link between the
                    damage claimed and the breach, and the second being where the figures in the
                    invoice appear to be inflated or where certain items appear to be unusual or
                    special.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       As was the case in <em>Thode Gerd
                        Walter</em>, the defendant does not dispute the admissibility or
                    authenticity of the invoices and supporting documents adduced by the plaintiff.
                    Furthermore, with regard to those expenses that the defendant contends are
                    “unusually high” (<em>ie</em>, the expenses
                    incurred in respect of Groovy and Catalyst), the plaintiff has called witnesses
                    to explain the invoices and to give evidence on the work done. In these
                    circumstances, I am satisfied that the plaintiff has adduced sufficient
                        <em>prima facie</em> evidence of its loss, and all that
                    remains to be determined is the validity of the defendant’s objections. It
                    is to these objections that I now turn.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Clear Channel</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     The plaintiff claimed $74,900 for expenses
                    incurred in relation to Clear Channel. These expenses were incurred for bus-stop
                    advertisements placed in the month of December 2008. $70,000 was paid through
                    the redemption of a prize that the plaintiff had won in a competition
                    (“the prize”) and the $4,900 incurred as GST was paid for in
                    cash.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     The defendant objects to these expenses on two
                    grounds. First, the defendant takes issue with the fact that the advertisements
                    had been paid for, not in cash, but by way of redemption of the prize. Second,
                    the defendant contends that the plaintiff did not suffer pecuniary loss because
                    it had enjoyed the benefit of marketing exposure for “18” from the
                    bus-stop advertisements during the period of December 2008 since the plaintiff
                    terminated the contract with the defendant only in February 2009.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     I will deal with the defendant’s second
                    objection first as it can be dealt with summarily. It suffices to say that any
                    direct benefit (<em>ie</em>, revenue from sales of
                    “18”) that the plaintiff had obtained has been accounted for in
                    the reduction in the overall expenses claimed by $22,071.91, this sum being the
                    sales revenue of “18”. As for any indirect benefit, perhaps in the
                    form of goodwill, that the defendant may have obtained, this would have been
                    wasted and rendered futile in light of the discontinuation of “18”
                    that was precipitated by the defendant’s breach.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     The defendant’s other objection is that
                    the plaintiff did not suffer pecuniary loss because it had placed the
                    advertisements by way of redemption of the prize. In this regard, the defendant
                    emphasised that the prize could not be assigned or transferred, and would have
                    expired if it was not used by 31 December 2008. In contrast, the plaintiff
                    took the position that the prize was clearly an asset with an equivalent
                    monetary value, and that it had been deprived of the use of the prize by the
                    defendant’s breach. Further, the plaintiff argued that if it had not used
                    the prize to advertise “18”, it would have had to pay for such
                    advertising in cash. Since the defendant would clearly be liable to compensate
                    the plaintiff in such a situation, it should not make any difference that the
                    plaintiff had chosen to use the prize to pay for the expenses
                instead.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(1)   Plaintiff’s loss – advertising services or the
                prize?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     The crux of this issue lies in the
                    characterisation of the plaintiff’s loss. There are two possibilities. The
                    first possibility is that the plaintiff lost $70,000 of <em>advertising services</em>. If this were the case, then the plaintiff
                    would be entitled to $70,000 in monetary damages as this would represent the
                    value of the advertising services it lost. Put another way, if it had not
                    redeemed the prize, the plaintiff would have had to pay $70,000 to obtain the
                    advertising services from Clear Channel.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     However, there is another possibility. The
                    second possibility is that the plaintiff has lost the use of <em>the prize</em>. If that were the case, then the measure of damages
                    should comport with the <em>objective value</em> of the
                    prize that the plaintiff lost. That is not to say that the objective value of
                    the prize is its market value. Although the prize in the present case had no
                    market value as it was not transferable or assignable, it clearly had value
                        <em>to the plaintiff</em>. The question to be
                    determined would thus be the objective value of the prize to the plaintiff
                        (<em>ie</em>, the value that a reasonable person in the
                    plaintiff’s shoes would have attributed to the prize). In such an inquiry,
                    the fact that the prize was not assignable or transferable, and would expire if
                    it was not used by 31 December 2008, could be relevant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     The thrust of the defendant’s argument
                    is that an award of $70,000 in damages would over-compensate the plaintiff. It
                    is axiomatic that a reasonable person would value $70,000 in damages more than
                    the prize. This is because cash can be used for a variety of purposes whereas
                    the prize could only have been used to redeem advertising services <em>from Clear Channel</em>. Furthermore, cash retains its
                    intrinsic value whereas the prize would be worth nothing if it was not redeemed
                    by 31 December 2008. The expiry date of the prize is a major factor since
                    this meant that the plaintiff had a fixed period within which it must advertise
                    whether or not it had a product ready for launch. To compound matters, the prize
                    could not be converted to cash even if the plaintiff was willing to sell the
                    prize at a discount since the prize could not be assigned or
                transferred.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     McGregor on Damages (Thomson Reuters (Legal)
                    Limited, 18th Ed, 2009) (“McGregor”) defines “reliance
                    loss”, at [2-020], as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Sometimes, however, the claimant may be compelled by circumstances to
                        frame his suit on a different basis as to damages, not on the basis of the
                        loss of his bargain but on the basis of his out-of-pocket loss. In other
                        words, he is claiming not to be put into the position he would have been in
                        had the contract been performed, but <em>to be put into the
                            position he would have been in had it never been made, which is a normal
                            measure of damages akin to that in tort</em>. [emphasis
                        added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">According to this statement by McGregor, the reference point is the
                    position that the plaintiff would have been in had the contract <em>never been made</em>. On the facts, the prize had not been
                    redeemed at the time the contract was made. As such, if the contract had not
                    been made, the plaintiff would have had an unredeemed prize, not $70,000 of
                    advertising services. On this understanding of “reliance loss”, an
                    award of $70,000 in damages would indeed result in the plaintiff being
                    over-compensated. Whereas the plaintiff would only have had a prize worth less
                    than $70,000 (see [16]) had the contract
                    not been made, the award of damages would result in the plaintiff being
                    compensated with $70,000 in cash. In the words of the defendant’s counsel,
                    “the plaintiff would in fact have monetized [the prize], which [it] would
                    not have been able to even if there was no breach.”</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     I do not agree that an award of $70,000 in
                    damages <em>necessarily</em> over-compensates the
                    plaintiff. In this regard, I am of the view that McGregor’s statement that
                    compensating for “reliance loss” aims to put the injured party in
                    the position as if the contract had not been made is simply a shorthand used to
                        <em>quantify</em> “reliance loss” damages
                    and, with the greatest of respect, may need reconsideration. As stated in the
                    seminal decision of <em>Livingstone v Rawyards Coal Co</em>
                    (1880) 5 App Cas 25 (“<em>Livingstone</em>”) at 39, the fundamental principle of
                    compensation is that damages should “put the party who has been injured,
                    or who has suffered, in the same position as he would have been if he had not
                    sustained the wrong for which he is now getting his compensation.” In the
                    case of breach of contract, putting the injured party in the position he would
                    have been in had he not sustained the wrong refers to putting him in the
                    position he would have been in had the contract not been broken. The focus is
                    therefore on the <em>promised performance</em>. Consistent
                    with this, <em>Chitty on Contracts</em> vol 1 (Sweet &amp;
                    Maxwell, 30th Ed, 2008) (“Chitty”) defines “reliance
                    loss”, at [26-006], as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[T]he reliance interest relates to the expense or which the claimant has
                        himself incurred <em>in reliance on the promised
                            performance</em> and which is wasted by the defendant’s
                        breach. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Although McGregor’s statement would result in the correct
                    measure of damages in the vast majority of cases, it would result in the wrong
                    measure in the present case. This is because it does not account for the fact
                    that the plaintiff had <em>converted</em> the prize into
                    advertising services <em>after</em> the contract had been
                    entered into and this conversion had been done <em>in
                        reliance</em> of the contract. Applying McGregor’s statement,
                    the plaintiff would be awarded the value of the prize which it would still have
                    had if the contract had not been made. However, the measure of “reliance
                    loss” damages that stays true to the principle underlying the award of
                    such damages would be an award of the objective value of the advertising
                    services that the plaintiff would still have had if the contract had <em>not been broken</em> (<em>ie</em>,
                    $70,000 in damages).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(2)   Characterisation of the plaintiff’s loss in light of
                the fact that the plaintiff no longer has any product to advertise</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     Unfortunately, a further complication arises
                    from the fact that the plaintiff no longer has any product to advertise. If
                    “18” was still a live product or if the plaintiff had some other
                    product for which it could use advertising services, I would not hesitate to
                    grant the plaintiff $70,000 in damages. Had the defendant not breached the
                    contract, the plaintiff would still have $70,000 of advertising services (which
                    it no longer has, conceptually speaking, as such advertising services have been
                    wasted). Theoretically, the ideal method of compensation would be for the
                    defendant to compensate the plaintiff with actual advertising services to the
                    value of $70,000. However, since the remedy for breach of contract is generally
                    damages, the court makes an award of $70,000 as a <em>monetary
                        substitute</em> to enable the plaintiff to obtain the advertising
                    services. Having made this award, the court would not concern itself with
                    whether the plaintiff actually uses the money to obtain the advertising
                    services. As stated in <em>Ruxley Electronics &amp; Construction
                        Ltd v Forsyth</em> [1996] AC 344 (“<em>Ruxley</em>”) at 359, “in the normal case the court has
                    no concern with the use to which a plaintiff puts an award of damages for a loss
                    which has been established.”</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     However, advertising services cannot exist in
                    a vacuum and must attach to or be <em>used for</em> a
                    product. If there is no product that advertising services can be used for, then
                    the plaintiff’s loss is, in reality, the loss of the <em>ability to obtain advertising services in the future</em>. That
                    would, in effect, be the loss of the prize since the prize had been the source
                    of the plaintiff’s ability to obtain future advertising services. Put
                    another way, because the plaintiff no longer has any product to advertise, it is
                    conceptually <em>impossible</em> to compensate the
                    plaintiff with actual advertising services for “18” or some other
                    product. In such a situation, it would be illogical and artificial for the court
                    to make an award of the monetary substitute for advertising services that cannot
                    conceptually be ordered. Therefore, since the plaintiff no longer has any
                    product for which advertising services <em>can</em> be
                    used, I am of the view that it does not make sense for the court to characterise
                    the plaintiff’s loss as a loss of advertising services. In truth, the
                    plaintiff’s real loss, in light of the circumstances now before the court,
                    is the loss of the prize.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     In coming to this conclusion, I am fortified
                    by two cases decided by the House of Lords. The first case is <em>Golden Strait Corpn v Nippon Yusen Kubishika Kaisha</em> [2007] 2 AC
                    353 (“<em>The Golden Victory</em>”).
                        <em>The Golden Victory</em> involved a charter party,
                    clause 33 of which provided that both parties had the right to cancel the
                    charter if war were to break out between certain countries. In December 2001,
                    the charterers repudiated the charter party and this was accepted on 17 December
                    2001. On 20 March 2003, war falling within clause 33 broke out. The question
                    before the House of Lords was whether damages ought to be limited to the period
                    from 17 December 2001 to 20 March 2003 (when war broke out) or for the full
                    period from 17 December 2001 to 6 December 2005 (the earliest date for
                    contractual redelivery of the vessel). A majority of the House of Lords held
                    that damages were to be so limited. As McGregor elucidates at [8-100], two
                    principles underlay and justified the majority’s decision. The first is
                    the <em>Bwllfa</em> principle, which Lord Bingham of
                    Cornhill described in the following terms at 371:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It is that where the court making an assessment of damages has knowledge
                        of what actually happened it need not speculate about what might have
                        happened but should base itself on the known facts. In non-judicial
                        discourse the point has been made that you need not gaze into the crystal
                        ball when you can read the book.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The second principle is the overriding compensatory principle that
                    damages awarded for breach of contract should represent no more than the value
                    of the contractual benefits of which a plaintiff has been deprived. In <em>The Golden Victory</em>, the fact that the charterers would
                    have cancelled on the outbreak of war had to be taken into account because war
                    had, in fact, broken out and if the cancellation were to be ignored, the
                    owner’s position would not have been restored but substantially improved.
                    Applying these principles to the present case, the <em>Bwllfa</em> principle dictates that the court should not close its
                    eyes to the fact that the plaintiff does not, at this point in time, have any
                    product that advertising services can attach to or be used for. Furthermore,
                    since the plaintiff’s real loss is the prize (see [20]), an award of $70,000 in damages would
                    also go against the compensatory principle since the prize is most certainly
                    worth less than $70,000 in cash (see [16]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     The second case is <em>Ruxley</em>. In <em>Ruxley</em>, the contract
                    was for a pool with a diving area 7 feet 6 inches deep. The completed pool was
                    suitable for diving but the diving area was only 6 feet deep. The cost of
                    rebuilding the pool to the specified depth was £21,560. The House of Lords
                    held that the plaintiff in that case was not entitled to £21,560 and
                    reinstated the trial judge’s award of £2,500 for loss of amenity.
                    Lord Jauncey of Tullichettle (“Lord Jauncey”) held, at 357,
                    that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Damages are designed to compensate for an established loss and not to
                        provide a gratuitous benefit to the aggrieved party from which it follows
                        that the <em>reasonableness of an award of damages is to be
                            linked directly to the loss sustained</em>. [emphasis
                        added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">
<em>Ruxley</em> was admittedly concerned with a
                    different issue, namely whether the measure of damages should be the difference
                    in value or the cost of cure. Nevertheless, Lord Jauncey’s statement that
                    the <em>reasonableness</em> of an award of damages should
                    be considered in determining what is the <em>loss
                        sustained</em> was a general observation and ought to be applicable
                    outside the confines of the specific issue in <em>Ruxley</em>. In the present case, I am of the view that it would be
                        <em>unreasonable</em> to award the monetary equivalent
                    of advertising services when there is no possibility of advertising services
                    being procured at this point in time. On the logic of Lord Jauncey’s
                    observation, this would weigh in favour of a finding that the <em>loss sustained</em> is the loss of the prize.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(3)   Objective value of the prize</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     The assessment of the objective value of the
                    prize, to the plaintiff, is a difficult task in light of the fact that no expert
                    evidence was called by either party on this issue. The plaintiff simply took the
                    position that the prize had a value of $70,000 whereas the defendant appears to
                    have taken the position that the prize was worth nothing.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     As discussed at <a href="#p1_15">[15]</a>–<a href="#p1_16">[16]</a>, I do not
                    agree that the prize was worth nothing but I also do not agree that the prize
                    had a value of $70,000. The prize was not worth nothing because it had value to
                    the plaintiff since it could be redeemed for $70,000 of advertising services,
                    and the plaintiff did have products for which such advertising services could be
                    used. At the same time, the value of the prize to the plaintiff would be reduced
                    by the fact that the prize had an expiry date. This is because whereas the
                    plaintiff could use cash to obtain advertising services at any point in time,
                    the prize <em>had</em> to be redeemed within a specific
                    time period and that time period may not have been the best time for the
                    plaintiff to advertise its product using this particular medium. The objective
                    value of the prize to the plaintiff would steadily reduce as the expiry date
                    drew closer. Indeed, if the prize had been assignable or transferable, potential
                    buyers would similarly have been willing to pay less and less for the prize as
                    the expiry date drew closer. The fact that the prize was not assignable or
                    transferable would further reduce its objective value to the plaintiff as the
                    prize could not be converted to cash, even if the plaintiff was willing to sell
                    at a discount, should the plaintiff had required cash for other purposes or if
                    it had determined that advertising during the redemption period was not
                    appropriate.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     As mentioned above at <a href="#p1_23">[23]</a>, it is difficult to attribute an objective value to the
                    prize without the assistance of expert evidence, although one might validly ask
                    how much expert evidence could really help in a case such as this. In any case,
                    the court cannot shy away from the task of quantifying damages just because
                    assessment is difficult. As Chitty states at [26-007]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The fact that damages are difficult to assess does not disentitle the
                        claimant to compensation for loss resulting from the defendant’s
                        breach of contract. Where it is clear that the claimant has suffered
                        substantial loss, but the evidence does not enable it to be precisely
                        quantified, the court will assess damages as best it can on the available
                        evidence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The redemption period for the prize was for slightly less than 7
                    months. It commenced on 1 June 2008 and ended on 31 December 2008.
                    According to the Statement of Claim, the breach of contract occurred from late
                    October 2008 to early January 2009. Taking late October 2008 as the reference
                    point, the prize had a “life” of approximately 2 more months (out
                    of the original 7 months redemption period) at the time of breach. In my view,
                    this fact would have substantially reduced the value of the prize to the
                    plaintiff at the material time (<em>ie</em>, the time of
                    breach). The value of the prize to the plaintiff would be furthered reduced by
                    the fact that it was not assignable or transferable. Considering these facts, I
                    am of the view that a discount factor of 30% should be applied, and I find that
                    the plaintiff’s loss with regard to the Clear Channel expenses amounts to
                    $49,000 (for the loss of the prize). I also find that the plaintiff should be
                    entitled to the $4,900 incurred as GST since this sum was also wasted due to the
                    defendant’s breach.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">ActMedia</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     ActMedia owns the rights to use advertising
                    space at various golf courses and driving ranges across Singapore (“golf
                    media rights”) and licenses these rights for a fee. These golf media
                    rights had actually been purchased by ActMedia, through its parent company Omni
                    Marketing Group Asia Pte Ltd (“Omni”), from the plaintiff in an
                    agreement dated 15 December 2006 (“the 15 December 2006
                    agreement”). Pursuant to this agreement, the plaintiff was entitled to
                    set off any fees incurred in the course of licensing golf media rights from
                    ActMedia up to an amount of $600,000. For convenience, I shall refer to this as
                    $600,000 of advertising credits. Clause 3.4 of the 15 December 2006
                    agreement goes on to state that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... The payment in the form of the aforesaid media space <em>shall be taken up by the end of the year 2008</em> in
                        such manner as shall be pre-agreed by the parties hereto before such
                        utilization accordingly. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The expenses incurred in relation to ActMedia amounted to $342,658.01.
                    The plaintiff incurred these expenses when they licensed golf media advertising
                    space from ActMedia in 2008. The expenses were paid using the balance of the
                    $600,000 of advertising credits obtained under the 15 December 2006
                    agreement.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     The Defendant’s primary objection in
                    relation to the ActMedia expenses is the same one mounted in relation to the
                    Clear Channel expenses. In essence, the Defendant contends that the plaintiff
                    has not suffered pecuniary loss and should not be allowed to recover the sum of
                    $342,658.01 because the expenses were paid for using advertising
                credits.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     In my view, the principles that I have set out
                    in relation to the Clear Channel expenses apply with equal force to the ActMedia
                    expenses and I need not reiterate them.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(1)   Plaintiff’s loss –licence for golf media
                advertising space or the advertising credits?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     The plaintiff’s loss in relation to the
                    ActMedia expenses can be characterised either as the loss of the licence for
                    golf media advertising space or as the loss of the advertising credits. Adopting
                    the same line of reasoning that I employed at <a href="#p1_18">[18]</a> in relation to the Clear Channel expenses, I find that the
                    plaintiff had converted the advertising credits into the licence for golf media
                    advertising space after the contract had been entered into and such conversion
                    had been done in reliance of the contract. Therefore, if “18” had
                    not been discontinued or if the plaintiff had some other product that the
                    licence for golf media advertising space could be used for, I would have awarded
                    the plaintiff damages measured by the objective value of the licence for golf
                    media advertising space (<em>ie</em>,
                $342,658.01).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(2)   Characterisation of the plaintiff’s loss in light of
                the fact that the plaintiff no longer has any product to advertise</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     However, the fact that the plaintiff no longer
                    has any product to advertise must again be taken into consideration. As with the
                    Clear Channel expenses, I find it illogical and artificial to award the monetary
                    substitute for the licence for golf media advertising space when the plaintiff
                    clearly does not have any product for which this advertising space can be used
                    for. Moreover, such an award would over-compensate the plaintiff. Therefore, for
                    similar reasons to those that are set out at <a href="#p1_19">[19]</a>–<a href="#p1_22">[22]</a>, I am of the
                    view that the plaintiff’s loss should be characterised as the loss of the
                    advertising credits.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(3)   Objective value of the advertising credits</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     The $600,000 of advertising credits formed
                    part of the purchase price paid by Omni. Therefore, the objective value of the
                    advertising credits, at the time that the 15 December 2006 agreement was
                    entered into, would correspond to the increased sum that Omni would have had to
                    pay if it had not granted the plaintiff $600,000 of advertising credits. In my
                    view, it is unlikely that a reasonable seller, dealing at arm’s length,
                    would accept $600,000 of advertising credits in place of $600,000 cash. This is
                    especially so given that the advertising credits could not be assigned or
                    transferred, and had to be used by the end of December 2008. If $600,000 of the
                    purchase price was to be paid in advertising credits, I would think that a
                    reasonable seller would demand a higher overall price. This would in turn mean
                    that the objective value of the $600,000 of advertising credits would be less
                    than $600,000.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     Furthermore, as with the prize, the objective
                    value of the advertising credits to the plaintiff would steadily reduce as the
                    “expiry date” drew closer. The advertising credits could be used
                    between 15 December 2006 and the end of December 2008, a period of slightly
                    more than 2 years. At the time of the breach of contract, the advertising
                    credits had a “life” of approximately 2 months (out of the
                    original 24 months utilization period). Nevertheless, this must be considered in
                    the context of clause 3.4, which states that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... In the event that the said media space is not fully utilized by the
                        end of year 2008, the Purchaser may at the request of the Vendor, extend the
                        utilization period beyond 2008 provided always that the Vendor is able to
                        show special circumstances for the non-full utilization at the end of year
                        2008.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">In my view, the possibility of an extension of the utilization period
                    (albeit on the showing of special circumstances) would ameliorate, to a certain
                    extent, the impact of the “expiry date” on the objective value of
                    the advertising credits. I also note that the defendant did not cross-examine
                    the plaintiff’s witnesses substantially on the objective value of the
                    advertising credits to the plaintiff. The defendant also did not lead any
                    evidence (expert or otherwise) on this matter, although this was due to the fact
                    that it took the position that the plaintiff was not entitled to recover
                    anything in respect of the ActMedia expenses. Taking into consideration all the
                    facts and circumstances outlined above, I am of the view that a discount factor
                    of 20% should be applied, and I find that the plaintiff’s loss with regard
                    to the ActMedia expenses is $274,126.40 (for the loss of the advertising
                    credits).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Groovy, Procolor and Big Bulb</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     The defendant’s primary objection to the
                    expenses claimed in relation to Groovy, Procolor and Big Bulb rests on an
                    alleged “nexus” between these companies and the plaintiff. To
                    substantiate its assertion on the alleged “nexus”, the defendant
                    relies on two pieces of evidence. First, the defendant relies on a newspaper
                    article published in the Business Times where the plaintiff’s Mr Tan
                    Muey Hwa (“Mr Tan”) acknowledged Groovy and Procolor to be
                    his businesses. Second, the defendant relies on a people profile search showing
                    that Big Bulb is “substantially owned by [Mr Tan’s] wife Madam
                    Chua Boon Tin”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     However, a perusal of the people profile
                    search of Mr Tan shows that while he used to be a director of Groovy and
                    Procolor, he had ceased to be a director of these companies since 2006.
                    Mr Tan explained that the Business Times article was outdated and that he
                    had clarified that he no longer owned Groovy and Procolor but this had not been
                    reflected in the article. With regard to Big Bulb, the people profile search of
                    Mr Tan shows that he has never held any shareholding or directorship in Big
                    Bulb. Mr Tan also gave evidence that he was already divorced from Madam
                    Chua Boon Tin.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     Furthermore, as the plaintiff’s counsel
                    pointed out, if there was indeed a “nexus” between Groovy,
                    Procolor, Big Bulb and the plaintiff, it would be logical that these companies
                    would give the plaintiff a discount rather than overcharge it. Therefore, the
                    defendant’s argument must be premised on some <em>conspiracy or fraud</em> by Groovy, Procolor, Big Bulb and the
                    plaintiff to overcharge the plaintiff so that the plaintiff could recover these
                    inflated expenses from the defendant. In my view, the “unusual
                    circumstances” raised by the defendant are not sufficient to sustain an
                    allegation of conspiracy or fraud. For example, the defendant points out that
                    Groovy, Procolor and Big Bulb had not been paid by the plaintiff, and that
                    despite not being paid, had not prosecuted their claims against the plaintiff in
                    court. It may well be that Groovy, Procolor and Big Bulb had decided not to
                    prosecute their claims at this point in time because of a good business
                    relationship with Mr Tan, but this does not necessarily lead to the
                    conclusion that there was a conspiracy or fraud. In any case, the
                    defendant’s counsel had indicated at the hearing that the defendant did
                    not intend to make such allegations.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">DC:    Given their nexus and close relationship, inquiry
                            as to damages. Dodgy thing is that Mr Quek has not been paid
                            anything yet. It’s in his affidavit. This should have been
                            exhibited.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">PC:    This goes back to the issues canvassed at the
                            [summary judgment], which are not relevant here. At the summary judgment
                            on the question of liability, Defendant raised defence that there was
                            some grand conspiracy by Plaintiff to defraud Defendant by entering into
                            inflated claims. That defence was found to be a sham. Now they are
                            raising these issues again without having pleaded any of
                        this.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">DC:    
              <em>You will notice that we have
                                not raised any issue of scam or fraud</em>. Inquiry as to
                            damages.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">In my view, it is not sufficient for the defendant to simply allege a
                    “nexus” between Groovy, Procolor, Big Bulb and the plaintiff or to
                    allege that the facts “give rise to suspicion”. It is incumbent on
                    the defendant to prove that the expenses claimed had been inflated pursuant to
                    some conspiracy or fraud. This had not been done. Therefore, I find no merit in
                    the alleged “nexus” argument put forth by the
                defendant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     I now turn to consider whether the expenses
                    incurred in relation to Groovy, Procolor and Big Bulb are inflated, unusual or
                    special such as to warrant further scrutiny pursuant to the decision in
                        <em>Robertson Quay</em>. The claims in relation to
                    Procolor and Big Bulb are for relatively small sums, $1,637.10 and $3,210
                    respectively. The defendant has also not adduced any evidence that these
                    expenses were inflated, unusual or special. Therefore, I award the plaintiff the
                    full sums that it claimed in relation to Procolor and Big Bulb, namely the sums
                    of $1,637.10 and $3,210 respectively.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     The $50,000 claimed by the plaintiff with
                    regard to the Groovy expenses was for photography services. Groovy charged the
                    plaintiff $15,000 for photographs of the “18” bottles, and $35,000
                    for photographs of models posing with “18”. The plaintiff has
                    produced invoices from Groovy which state the amounts charged. According to
                    Mr James Quek Boon Chuan (“Mr Quek”) of Groovy, these
                    fees are typical of projects similar in nature to the one undertaken by the
                    plaintiff. He added that the plaintiff had been given a slight discount on the
                    fees charged. To substantiate its allegation that Groovy’s fees are
                    unusually high, the defendant relies on a quotation by Photography By Eulee
                    (“Eulee”) and on invoices by Aziodes Studio
                    (“Aziodes”). According to the quotation by Eulee, Eulee would
                    charge $500 for the photography services, product photography for a maximum of
                    10 products, processing of a maximum 20 images and rights for unlimited usage.
                    The invoices by Aziodes showed that it had charged $3,000 for photography
                    services and unlimited usage of photographs of 12 infants, and had charged
                    $2,500 for photography services and unlimited usage of photographs involving 5
                    athletes.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     At the outset, I note that the quote by Eulee
                    and the invoices by Aziodes are hearsay as the maker of these documents had not
                    been called to give evidence in court. The hearsay nature of these documents is
                    especially critical in the present case because the quote and the invoices may
                    have been for photography services that are not comparable to the photography
                    services provided by Groovy. Since the makers of these documents had not been
                    called to give evidence in court, the plaintiff could not cross-examine them on
                    this point. In any case, I accept Mr Tan’s uncontradicted testimony
                    that the fees charged by photography companies can vary substantially. This is
                    because the fees charged for photography services would logically depend on a
                    multitude of factors, such as the clientele targeted as well as the fame, skill
                    and experience of the photographers. For example, as Mr Tan pointed out, if
                    a famous photographer like John Clang had taken the photographs, his fees would
                    likely have been far in excess of $50,000. Therefore, to prove that the fees
                    charged by Groovy were inflated, unusual or special, the defendant would need to
                    call expert evidence to this effect, preferably from a company that undertakes
                    projects similar to those undertaken by Groovy. This was not done. In these
                    circumstances, I find that the plaintiff’s loss with regard to the Groovy
                    expenses is the $50,000 claimed.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Raffles Digital</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     The defendant made no submissions as regards
                    the Raffles Digital expenses. As such, I find that the plaintiff’s loss
                    with regard to the Raffles Digital expenses is the $26,373.09
                claimed.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Catalyst</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     Catalyst is an advertising agency. The
                    plaintiff had engaged Catalyst to run the advertising and promotional campaign
                    for “18”. The expenses incurred in relation to Catalyst amounted
                    to a sum of $199,369.87. The work done by Catalyst included overseeing the
                    concept and strategy of the advertising and promotional campaign for
                    “18”, coming up with the slogan (<em>ie</em>,
                    “18 – Thirst for Life”), designing the logo for this slogan,
                    designing the bottle labels, designing the carton boxes, designing the stickers
                    for chiller fridges and vending machines, designing the posters and
                    advertisements, designing the product brochures and organizing the launch event
                    at Cineleisure.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     The defendant argued that the plaintiff has
                    not adduced sufficient proof of its loss because it did not adduce evidence of
                    the breakdown of man hours spent on the work or of the exact amount of time and
                    effort expended by Catalyst in carrying out the work done. The defendant’s
                    argument is based on the notion that the purpose of the assessment hearing is to
                    satisfy the court, amongst other issues, of “the true value of the work
                    done by Catalyst”. However, as held in <em>Robertson
                        Quay</em> at [31], a plaintiff
                    would generally discharge its burden of proving loss as long as it adduces
                    cogent evidence of the loss suffered. Since the reference is to <em>the loss suffered</em>, I am of the view that the plaintiff
                    would discharge its burden of proving loss if it adduces cogent evidence that
                    Catalyst had indeed charged the plaintiff for the expenses claimed. There is no
                    additional requirement that the plaintiff justify the amount charged by Catalyst
                    unless the fees charged appear to be inflated, unusual or special.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     The plaintiff has produced the relevant
                    invoices, the underlying correspondence, and the work product. In my view, these
                    documents show that work had actually been done, and that the plaintiff had been
                    charged for the sums claimed. Ms Lynette Ng Siu Lien (“Ms
                    Ng”) had also been called as a witness to confirm the expenses by the
                    plaintiff and to explain the type of work done. For example, Ms Ng
                    explained that the $40,000 charged for bottle label design was for 4 versions
                        (<em>ie</em>, $10,000 for each version) and went
                    towards “art direction, supervision, copy”. She also pointed out
                    that each label had included trivial surrounding the number 18 (<em>eg</em>, the game of basketball was created with 18 players
                    in 1891). Although the defendant did manage to point out several inconsistencies
                    in Ms Ng’s evidence, I am of the view that these inconsistencies
                    arose from a misunderstanding of the questions put to her, and were not, in any
                    case, consequential. The point is that the plaintiff has produced <em>prima facie</em> evidence of the loss it had suffered.
                    Therefore, the onus lay on the defendant to show that the fees charged were
                    inflated, unusual or special. To prove this, the defendant would need to call
                    expert evidence to this effect. This was not done. In these circumstances, I
                    find that the plaintiff’s loss with regard to the Catalyst expenses is the
                    $199,369.87 claimed.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Miscellaneous advertising expenses</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     The plaintiff also made several smaller claims
                    for advertising expenses that amounted to a sum of $4,638.95. The defendant made
                    no submissions as regards these expenses. As such, I find that the
                    plaintiff’s loss with regard to these miscellaneous expenses is the
                    $4,638.95 claimed.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The general objection</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(1)   The applicable law</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     The defendant’s general objection is
                    that the amount of advertising expenses claimed is so large that it could not
                    have been within the parties’ reasonable contemplation, and should thus be
                    irrecoverable for being too remote. In <em>MFM Restaurants Pte
                        Ltd v Fish &amp; Co Restaurants Pte Ltd</em> [2011] 1 SLR 150
                        (“<em>MFM Restaurants</em>”), the Court
                    of Appeal held that the two limbs set out in <em>Hadley v
                        Baxendale</em> (1854) 9 Exch 341 (“<em>Hadley</em>”) remain the governing principles in relation to
                    the doctrine of remoteness of damage in contract law. The modern statement of
                    the rule in <em>Hadley</em>, as stated in Chitty at
                    [26-054], reads:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The combined effect of these cases may be summarised as follows: A type or
                        kind of loss is not too remote a consequence of a breach of contract if, at
                        the time of contracting (and on the assumption that the parties actually
                        foresaw the breach in question), it was within their reasonable
                        contemplation as a not unlikely result of that breach.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     As explained in <em>Victoria
                        Laundry v Newman</em> [1949] 2 KB 528 (“<em>Victoria Laundry</em>”) at 539, what would be in the
                    reasonable contemplation of parties depends on the knowledge then possessed by
                    the parties. The court went to state that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... For this purpose, knowledge "possessed" is of two kinds; one imputed,
                        the other actual. Everyone, as a reasonable person, is taken to know the
                        "ordinary course of things" and consequently what loss is liable to result
                        from a breach of contract in that ordinary course. This is the subject
                        matter of the "first rule" in <em>Hadley v.
                            Baxendale</em>. But to this knowledge, which a contract-breaker is
                        assumed to possess whether he actually possesses it or not, there may have
                        to be added in a particular case knowledge which he actually possesses, of
                        special circumstances outside the "ordinary course of things," of such a
                        kind that a breach in those special circumstances would be liable to cause
                        more loss. Such a case attracts the operation of the "second rule" so as to
                        make additional loss also recoverable.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     As Chitty states at [26-058], the reference to
                    “the loss” in the formulations of the test for remoteness of
                    damages is to be interpreted as the type or kind of loss in question. In other
                    words, it is the <em>type</em> of loss that must be in the
                    reasonable contemplation of the parties, not the precise detail or <em>quantum</em> of the damage. In <em>Zicom Pte
                        Ltd v Antara Koh Pte Ltd</em> [1997] SGHC 215 at [97],
                    Judith Prakash J cited the case of <em>Christopher Hill Ltd
                        v Ashington Piggeries Ltd</em> [1969] 3 All ER 1496 which held, at
                    1524, that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In order to establish liability for the damage caused by a breach of
                        contract, the party who had suffered damage does not have to show that the
                        contract-breaker ought to have contemplated, as not being unlikely, the
                        precise detail of the damage or the precise manner of its happening.
                            <em>It is enough if he should have contemplated that
                            damage of that kind is not unlikely</em>. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The case of <em>Wroth v Tyler</em> [1974] 1 Ch 30
                    is also instructive. In that case, the plaintiff buyers of a house claimed
                    damages from the defendant seller for his failure to complete. The court held
                    that the plaintiffs were entitled to claim as damages the market price of a
                    similar house at the time of the judgment less the contract price, being the
                    “reliance loss” suffered by the plaintiffs as a result of the
                    breach, although the rise in property prices over the relevant period had been
                    of an unprecedented magnitude. The court reasoned, at 60–61, as
                    follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Here, the parties contemplated a rise in house prices, but not a rise of
                        an amount approaching that which in fact took place. A rise which nearly
                        doubled the market price of the property was, as the evidence showed,
                        outside the contemplation of the parties, and so it could not be recovered.
                        Thus ran the argument.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I do not think that this can be right. <em>On principle, it
                            seems to me to be quite wrong to limit damages flowing from a
                            contemplated state of affairs to the amount that the parties can be
                            shown to have had in contemplation</em>, for to do this would
                        require evidence of the calculation in advance of what is often incalculable
                        until after the event. The function of the so-called "second rule" in
                            <em>Hadley v. Baxendale</em>, 9 Exch. 341, seems to
                        me to be not so much to add to the damages recoverable as to exclude from
                        them any liability for any type or kind of loss which could not have been
                        foreseen when the contract was made. <em>No authority was put
                            before me which appeared to me to provide any support for the alleged
                            requirement that the quantum should have been in
                            contemplation</em>. So far as it went, the language used in the
                        authorities that were cited seems to me to have been directed to the heads
                        of damage rather than to quantum.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Similarly, in <em>Brown v KMR Service</em> [1995]
                    4 All ER 598, the defendants argued unsuccessfully that the
                    catastrophic losses suffered by the plaintiffs as a result of becoming members
                    of high risk syndicates were too remote on the basis that the scale and
                    magnitude of the financial disasters which struck were unprecedented and
                    therefore unforeseeable. Since it must always have been foreseeable, and a not
                    unlikely result, that the plaintiffs might suffer some financial loss from their
                    excessive exposure, it was immaterial to their liability that the degree of that
                    loss was unforeseeable.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     Nevertheless, as Chitty points out at
                    [26-058]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The application of the test for remoteness to a particular set of facts
                        therefore depends largely on the judicial discretion to categorise losses
                        into broad categories, without requiring any contemplation of the precise
                        manner in which the loss was caused, or of the precise details of the
                        loss.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">In other words, the concept of type of loss is a fluid one and the
                    appropriate characterisation of the type of loss suffered will depend heavily on
                    the particular set of facts before the court. For example, “loss of
                    profit” can obviously be characterised as a type of loss. However, in
                        <em>Victoria Laundry</em>, the court distinguished
                    between profits from different activities, namely between loss of laundry
                    profits and loss of profits from especially lucrative dyeing
                contracts.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(2)   The type of loss that was in the reasonable contemplation of
                the parties</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     Having set out the applicable law, I now turn
                    to consider the arguments advanced by the plaintiff and the defendant. The
                    plaintiff argued that since advertising expenses as a type of loss must have
                    been in the reasonable contemplation of the parties, such loss should be
                    recoverable regardless of the quantum of the loss.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     The defendant argued that it could not have
                    reasonably contemplated that such a large amount of advertising expenses would
                    be incurred because it viewed the contract as a simple supply contract for
                    modest quantities of “18” (the minimum order being just 1 trailer
                    load) for a minimum period of just 2 years. It was not aware that the plaintiff
                    would be embarking on a massive advertising campaign that was disproportionate
                    to the volume of sales or revenue, and in any case, had not assumed
                    responsibility for the financial consequences of the plaintiff’s failed
                    branding exercise because it had no obligation under the contract to help the
                    plaintiff build the “18” brand. The corollary to the plaintiff
                    being the sole bearer of the risk of the branding exercise was that the
                    plaintiff alone would enjoy a potential upside of the brand becoming
                    famous.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     If Lord Hoffmann’s approach in <em>Transfield Shipping Inc v Mercator Shipping Inc</em> [2009]
                    1 AC 61 (“<em>The Achilleas</em>”)
                    is adopted, it might perhaps be said that the defendant had not assumed
                    responsibility for the consequences of the plaintiff’s failed branding
                    exercise, and that the loss suffered is thus too remote. However, in <em>MFM Restaurants</em>, the Court of Appeal expressly declined
                    to follow Lord Hoffmann’s approach in <em>The
                        Achilleas</em>. The defendant’s argument on assumption of
                    responsibility is therefore a non-starter.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     The defendant’s argument that it could
                    not have reasonably contemplated the amount of advertising expenses incurred
                    similarly misses the point because it is the <em>type</em>
                    of loss that needs to be in the parties’ reasonable contemplation, not the
                    amount or <em>quantum</em> of the loss. However, as
                    discussed at <a href="#p1_47">[47]</a>, the concept of type of
                    loss is fluid. The type of loss can be defined broadly or narrowly. If the type
                    of loss is defined broadly as <em>advertising
                    expenses</em>, it would follow that this type of loss would have been in
                    the reasonable contemplation of the parties, and the advertising expenses
                    claimed would not be too remote. In the case of a contract for the supply of
                    drinks for sale to consumers, I think it must ordinarily be in the
                    parties’ reasonable contemplation that advertising expenses would be
                    incurred and that such expenses may be wasted should the supplier breach the
                    contract by supplying defective drinks. As such, there is no need to prove
                    actual knowledge since this knowledge would be imputed to the parties. In this
                    regard, the case authorities show that the courts have allowed plaintiffs to
                    recover advertising expenses which have been wasted as a result of the
                    defendants’ breaches without requiring that the plaintiffs prove that the
                    defendants had actual knowledge that advertising expenses would be incurred (see
                        <em>Walhane v Wendy’s Supa Sundaes</em> [2000]
                    SADC 39 at [72]; <em>G W
                        Sinclair &amp; Company v Cocks</em> [2001] VSCA 47 at [54]–[55]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     Having said that, I do not think that such a
                    broad characterisation of the type of loss is appropriate. In my view, there is
                    distinction in <em>substance</em> between expenses incurred
                    in <em>nationwide advertising</em> and expenses incurred in
                        <em>regional or worldwide advertising</em>. The
                    strategy and concept, the mediums used for advertising, the market research, the
                    type of launch events, and even the models used in a regional or worldwide
                    advertising campaign would all likely be different from that of a nationwide
                    advertising campaign. The question may then validly be asked whether a
                    distinction can similarly be drawn between normal advertising expenditure and
                    high-end advertising expenditure. I do not think that it is useful to draw a
                    distinction between normal advertising expenditure and high-end advertising
                    expenditure because the only thing that truly distinguishes normal advertising
                    expenditure from high-end advertising expenditure is the <em>quantum</em> of money spent and this translates to the quantum of the
                    loss in a claim for “reliance loss”. Therefore, if the court were
                    to distinguish between normal advertising expenditure and high-end advertising
                    expenditure, it would in effect be requiring parties to have reasonably
                    contemplated the <em>quantum</em> of the
                loss.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     Coming back to the case at hand, I am of the
                    view that under the first limb of <em>Hadley</em>, the type
                    of advertising in the reasonable contemplation of the parties was nationwide
                    advertising because there had been no reference anywhere in the contract to
                    delivery of “18” to locations overseas, and the prospect of
                    regional or worldwide advertising never came up in the parties’
                    discussions apart from a solitary mention of the possibility of Tiger Woods
                    endorsing “18” which never materialised. Therefore, I am of the
                    view that all advertising expenses incurred in nationwide advertising should be
                    recoverable, but all advertising expenses incurred in relation to regional or
                    worldwide advertising would be irrecoverable for being too remote unless the
                    defendant had actual knowledge that these expenses would be
                incurred.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     Most of the advertising expenses in the
                    present case were incurred as part of a nationwide advertising campaign, and
                    would thus not be regarded as too remote. For example, the photographs were not
                    used in any overseas advertising, the advertisements at bus-stops and on golf
                    dividers were all placed in Singapore, and the press release was for a launch
                    event in Singapore. The only exception pertains to certain expenses incurred in
                    relation to Catalyst. In cross-examination, Ms Ng admitted that a premium
                    was charged on certain expenses because “18” had the potential to
                    compete on the global stage. The relevant portions of the cross-examination are
                    as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Q:    Bearing in mind that there are 13 invoices, say
                            strategy and concept you say $20,000, this is based on man
                        hours?</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">A:    Explain how we charge for strategy and concept.
                            Typically it’s a rounded figure. Depending on the scope of work
                            the client requires, our agency starts from $5,000 to $40,000 based on
                            the scope of work. In part based on the number of hours we spend working
                            on it and depend[s] on the product and brand itself then we levy a
                            premium on it. “18” has the potential to compete on a
                            global stage, so for a brand like that, the fee we charge is higher as
                            compared to a product on a smaller basis, for example, the Singapore
                            market.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Q:    For strategy and concept, you say between $5,000
                            and $40,000?</p>

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Q:    Mr [Tan] said to you that he had this brand
                            that could be a huge global phenomenon, is that what he
                        said?</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">A:    He said he had this idea for a sports drink. But
                            based on his earlier success with “Anything” and
                            “Whatever”, we thought this had the potential to be a
                            product that would compete on the global stage.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Q:    From what he told you, surmised that it would [go]

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">A:    Primary discussion was to launch in Singapore
                            first, then take it outside Singapore.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Q:    Do the same considerations go into logo and
                            strapline? Apply same sort of premium?</p>

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Q:    If it’s just a local product for local
                            consumption, what is the range you have here?</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">A:    Within the advertising world, many different items
                            we charge for. In this particular case, it’s the brand. It’s
                            a critical thing for “18”. For plain advertisements
                            competing on the local stage, we charge from $5,000
                        onwards.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Ct:    For strapline and logo or strategy [and]
                            concept?</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">A:    Starting at $5,000 each.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     As discussed at <a href="#p1_52">[52]</a>, the type of advertising expenses that would have been in
                    the parties’ reasonable contemplation is nationwide advertising.
                    Therefore, insofar as a premium was charged because of the potential of
                    “18” to go global, this would be irrecoverable for being too
                    remote unless the defendant had actual knowledge of the real possibility of
                    “18” going global. On the facts before me, there is no evidence
                    that the defendant had such actual knowledge. According to Ms Ng, Catalyst
                    would charge $5,000 onwards for “strategy and concept” and
                    “logo and strapline” in the case of products competing on the
                    local stage. In the circumstances, I reduce the damages with regard to these
                    expenses from $20,000 and $25,000 to $5,000 each.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(3)   Whether the plaintiff would have recouped its
                expenditure</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     Where the claim is for “reliance
                    loss”, there is one further limitation to the full recovery of loss that
                    is both validly incurred and not too remote. As held in <em>CCC
                        Films (London) v Impact Quadrant Films</em> [1985] QB 16
                        (“<em>CCC Films</em>”) at 32, a plaintiff
                    should only be entitled to recover its wasted expenditure to the extent that
                    such expenses could have been recovered if the contract had been properly
                    performed. In this regard, Hutchison J went on to state, at 40, that where a
                    defendant’s breach prevents the plaintiff from exploiting the subject
                    matter of the contract, it would be fair to place the burden of proving that the
                    plaintiff would not recoup its expenditure on the defendant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     The present case is similar to <em>CCC Films</em>. By supplying the plaintiff with defective
                    “18”, the defendant had caused the plaintiff to discontinue
                    “18” after less than 4 months in the market, thereby making it
                    impossible for the plaintiff to prove the amount of profits it would have
                    earned. As such, the burden should be on the defendant to prove, on the balance
                    of probabilities, that the plaintiff would not have recouped the advertising
                    expenses even if the defendant had not breached the contract.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a>58     In support of its assertion that the plaintiff
                    would not have recouped its advertising expenses, the defendant relies on the
                    sales figures of “18” from October 2008 to January 2009, which the
                    defendant argued indicate that the plaintiff would not have recovered
                    advertising expenses in excess of $700,000 even if the defendant had not
                    breached its obligations. I am of the view that this is not sufficient evidence
                    to support a finding that the plaintiff would not have recouped its expenditure
                    even if the contract had been properly performed. As the plaintiff’s
                    counsel pointed out, the defendant’s analysis of the sales figures of
                    “18” simply took the sales revenue from October 2008 to January
                    2009 and multiplied it over a period of 2 years. This computation does not
                    factor in potential growth in sales over time. Furthermore, the contract was
                    stated to be for a <em>minimum</em> period of 2 years. As
                    such, parties clearly contemplated that “18” would be sold for at
                    least 2 years, and potentially for a longer period after that. As held in
                        <em>Commonwealth of Australia v Amann Aviation</em>
                    (1991) 66 ALJR 123, the prospect of securing a renewal of a contract can be
                    properly taken into account in a determination of whether the plaintiff would
                    have recouped its expenditure had the contract been properly performed. In these
                    circumstances, I am of the view that the defendant has failed to discharge its
                    burden of proving that the advertising expenses would not have been recouped if
                    the contract had been properly performed.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Drinks and bottle moulds</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a>59     A total of $39,648.90 was paid by the
                    plaintiff to the defendant for the “18” and the bottle moulds. The
                    plaintiff claimed this amount from the defendant on the basis that these
                    expenses were incurred in reliance of the contract and had been wasted as a
                    result of the defendant’s breach. Although the plaintiff enjoyed some
                    sales revenue from “18”, this benefit has been accounted for in
                    the reduction of the overall amount of expenses claimed by $22,071.91, this sum
                    being the sales revenue of “18”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a>60     I am satisfied that these expenses had
                    genuinely been incurred, and had been wasted as a result of the
                    defendant’s breach. I have considered the defendant’s various
                    objections to the plaintiff recovering this sum, but I find no merit in any of
                    these objections. Therefore, I award the plaintiff the full sum of $39,648.90
                    claimed.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Warehouse and forklift</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a>61     The defendant accepted that the parties knew
                    or ought to have reasonably contemplated that the plaintiff would incur expenses
                    in relation to the renting of the warehouse and the forklift. However, it
                    objected to the full recovery of these expenses on two grounds. First, it argued
                    that the rental of the warehouse and the forklift was not in reliance of the
                    contract because the rental agreement for the warehouse (“the rental
                    agreement”) was entered into before the contract had been entered into.
                    Second, it argued that it would be unjust to foist these expenses on the
                    defendant alone because the plaintiff had used the warehouse and the forklift
                    for “Anything” and “Whatever”. I will deal with
                    these arguments in turn.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_62"></a>62     In my view, the fact that the rental agreement
                    was entered into before the contract had been entered into would not preclude
                    the plaintiff from recovering such expenses. As held in <em>Anglia TV v Reed</em> [1972] QB 60 at 64:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">If the plaintiff claims the wasted expenditure, he is not limited to the
                        expenditure incurred <em>after</em> the contract was
                        concluded. He can claim also the expenditure incurred <em>before</em> the contract, provided that it was such as would
                        reasonably be in the contemplation of the parties as likely to be wasted if
                        the contract was broken. [emphasis in original]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The contract was for purchase of “18” in bulk from the
                    defendant for the purpose of distribution to potential customers. Therefore, the
                    defendant must have reasonably contemplated that a warehouse and forklift would
                    be rented, and that such expenses would be wasted if the contract was broken.
                    Further, the unchallenged evidence of the plaintiff’s Mr Tan and
                    Ms Yong Kai Fern (“Ms Yong”) was that the plaintiff had come
                    up with the idea for “18” in or around September 2007, before the
                    rental agreement was entered into on 12 March 2008. Mr Tan also testified
                    that he had rented the warehouse and the forklift <em>for</em> “18” and Ms Yong stated, in her
                    affidavit, that the warehouse was used almost entirely for the storage of
                    “18” from October 2008 onwards. In these circumstances, the
                    expenses in relation to the rental of the warehouse and the forklift should be
                    recoverable as they had been incurred in reliance of the contract, and had been
                    wasted because of the defendant’s breach.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_63"></a>63     The defendant’s Mr Raymond Ker Bock
                    Chuan (“Mr Ker”) testified that he had noticed, during his
                    various visits to the plaintiff’s warehouse, that the warehouse was used
                    to store “Anything” and “Whatever”. He also
                    testified that he had seen the forklift being used to transport
                    “Anything” and “Whatever” to clear up space for his
                    goods. Mr Tan also did not deny that “Anything” and
                    “Whatever” had been stored in the warehouse even after October
                    2008, although he qualified this by saying that “very little” had
                    still be stored.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_64"></a>64     In my view, even if the warehouse and the
                    forklift had been used for “Anything” and
                    “Whatever”, the plaintiff should still be entitled to recover the
                    expenses incurred in renting the warehouse and the forklift. This is because it
                    was within the reasonable contemplation of the parties that the plaintiff would
                    have to rent the warehouse and forklift to store and transport
                    “18”. It is also the unchallenged evidence of the
                    plaintiff’s Mr Tan that the sole reason why the plaintiff rented the
                    warehouse and the forklift was in order to store and transport
                    “18”, not “Anything” and “Whatever”.
                    This is because the plaintiff had engaged another company, P H Marketing, to
                    distribute “Anything” and “Whatever” and P H
                    Marketing had its own warehouse where the drinks could be stored. The fact that
                    free space in the warehouse was used to store “Anything” and
                    “Whatever” does not detract from the fact that the entire
                    warehouse and the forklift had been leased for the purpose of storing and
                    transporting “18”. In these circumstances, I award the plaintiff
                    the full sum of $36,241.82 claimed as expenses incurred in renting the warehouse
                    and the forklift.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Expenses incurred as a result of the recall of
                “18”</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_65"></a>65     As a result of the recall of
                    “18” that was precipitated by the defendant’s breach, the
                    plaintiff was forced to incur further expenses. First, the plaintiff had to
                    engage a transport company to assist with the retrieval of vending machines and
                    chillers fridges from its customers. Second, the plaintiff was under contractual
                    obligations to many of its customers to supply them with drinks. As such, the
                    plaintiff had to purchase sports drinks of another brand, Sportade, from a
                    competing distributor to replace the remainder of the “18”
                    recalled. Third, the plaintiff had to engage a disposal company to dispose of
                    the “18” in the presence of an AVA officer. These expenses
                    amounted to $7,549.29.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_66"></a>66     In my view, these expenses were clearly
                    consequential pecuniary losses that should be recoverable. Therefore, I award
                    the plaintiff the full sum of $7,549.29 claimed as expenses incurred as a result
                    of the recall of “18”.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Fridge and vending machine expenses</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_67"></a>67     The defendant accepted that the expenses
                    incurred by the plaintiff in purchasing fridges and vending machines are losses
                    which the plaintiff would be entitled to recover from the defendant, subject to
                    mitigation. However, the defendant argued that the plaintiff should not be
                    allowed to recover these expenses in full because it did not address the court
                    satisfactorily as to why they decided to discontinue “18” instead
                    of engaging an alternative manufacturer. In this regard, the defendant relied on
                    3 quotes from O-Dean Food Industry (“O-Dean”), Foshan Sanshui
                    (“Foshan”) and Universal NutriBeverage (“Universal”)
                    to show that there were alternative manufacturers that the plaintiff could have
                    engaged, and that these manufacturers would have charged less than the amount
                    charged by the defendant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_68"></a>68     At the outset, I note that the quotes by
                    O-Dean and Foshan indicate that they use a “hot fill” process
                    whereas the “18” bottle moulds could only be used for “cold
                    fill”. The “18” bottles also used a sports cap but the
                    quote from Universal applied to bottles which do not have a sports cap. In light
                    of these differences, it might not have been feasible for the plaintiff to
                    engage O-Dean, Foshan or Universal as an alternative manufacturer.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_69"></a>69     In any case, I am of the view that the
                    plaintiff had acted reasonably when it decided to discontinue
                    “18”. It had first afforded the defendant the opportunity to
                    remedy the defects. It then attempted to source for an alternative manufacturer.
                    In this regard, I accept Mr Tan’s evidence that he had contacted
                    O-Dean personally to ask them for a quote, but that there had been no reply.
                    Mr Tan also testified that he tried to find alternative suppliers on Ali
                    Baba, but his efforts were hampered by the defendant’s failure to provide
                    the plaintiff with a copy of the “18” formula or the
                    specifications for its bottles. The plaintiff only decided to discontinue the
                    “18” brand after the AVA directed the recall of all stocks of
                    “18” and put up an advisory warning against the consumption of
                    “18”. By this time, the “18” brand would have been
                    irretrievably damaged, and it would thus not have made sense for the plaintiff
                    to continue searching for an alternative manufacturer.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_70"></a>70     In these circumstances, I find that the
                    plaintiff had acted reasonably to mitigate its losses. The plaintiff’s
                    claim for losses incurred in purchasing the fridges and the vending machines for
                    “18” already excludes the amounts recovered by the plaintiff from
                    the sale of the fridges and the vending machines. Therefore, I award the
                    plaintiff the full sum of $15,657.19 that it claimed as fridge and vending
                    machine expenses.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
