        V K Rajah JA (delivering the judgment of the
                court):</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       Progen Holdings Ltd (“the
                    respondent”), a company listed on the Singapore Stock Exchange, is the
                    sole shareholder and holding company of Progen Engineering Pte Ltd
                    (“PEPL”). A winding-up application was filed against PEPL on
                    22 January 2007 by a creditor, Chua Aik Kia trading as Uni-Sanitary
                    Electrical Construction (“Uni-Sanitary”). As a result, an order to
                    wind up PEPL was made on 16 February 2007. Chee Yoh Chuang and Lim Lee Meng
                    were then appointed as liquidators of PEPL (“the
                    liquidators”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       On 6 November 2008, the liquidators made an
                    application to court to order the respondent to repay substantial amounts of
                    monies paid by PEPL to it. These monies were alleged to be unfair preferences
                    under s 99(2) of the Bankruptcy Act (Cap 20, 2000 Rev Ed)
                    (‘the Bankruptcy Act’) read with s 329(1) of the Companies Act
                    (Cap 50, 2006 Rev Ed) (‘the Companies Act’). A High Court
                    judge (“the Judge”) dismissed this application and the liquidators
                    now appeal against this decision.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       This appeal raises interesting issues about how
                    the law ought to balance the rights of creditors with the company
                    directors’ desire to keep a company afloat when the company has financial
                    difficulties. Difficulties often arise when an insolvent company seeks to make
                    payments to certain creditors at the expense of others. Ordinarily, commercially
                    sensible transactions made with the objective of creating or extending a
                    lifeline to a company suffering financial difficulty should not be questioned. A
                    court ought not to be too astute in taking directors to task when they appear to
                    have been attempting in good faith to facilitate the preservation or
                    rehabilitation of a company, and where they had reasonable commercial grounds
                    for believing that the transaction would benefit the company. With that said, we
                    must caution that where it appears that <b><em>related
                        parties</em></b> have benefitted from priority payments, the law would
                    usually view these transactions with a good measure of scepticism. This is
                    particularly so if the interests of unrelated creditors, with claims standing on
                    the same footing, are left in the cold. In respect of these kinds of
                    transactions, the burden of proof would be placed on the related party for it to
                    show that there had been no undue preference. Having sketched these broad
                    parameters bounding the law on undue preferences, we now set out the salient
                    facts before analysing the Judge’s grounds and giving our
                decision.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Factual Background</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       The Progen Group (“the Group”)
                    comprises the respondent and a stable of ten subsidiaries, including PEPL and
                    Progen Pte Ltd (“PPL”). The Group is in the business of supplying,
                    installing, trading, maintaining and servicing air-conditioning and ventilation
                    systems. Mr Lee Ee @ Lee Eng (“Lee Ee”) is the chairman and
                    founder of the Group<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span>, and is the managing director of the
                    respondent. In addition, Lee Ee and his wife, Koh Moi Huang,
                    (“Koh”) together owned the largest block of shares in the
                        respondent<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span> amounting to
                    29.24% of the issued shares during the material period<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span>. Lee Ee and
                        Koh<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span> were, it ought to be noted,
                    directors of PEPL at the material time. It also bears mention that there were
                    three common directors of PEPL and the respondent at the relevant time, namely,
                    Lee Ee, Tan Eng Liang and Ch’ng Jit Koon. Undoubtedly, Lee Ee is the key
                    figure in the Group. Besides his family’s substantial shareholdings in the
                    respondent, it is noteworthy that he was the only director of either company to
                    affirm affidavits in these proceedings and in an earlier application for court
                    sanction for the capital reduction of the respondent see below at <a href="#p1_16">[16]</a>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       In all, after the liquidators completed their
                    investigations into PEPL’s affairs, it was alleged that ten transactions
                    between PEPL and the respondent were unfair preferences. These transactions can
                    be summarised (in chronological order) as follows:</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       The 3rd transaction involved the largest sum and
                    obviously requires the greatest scrutiny. This particular transaction also gives
                    an acute insight as to how the common directors typically handled inter-company
                    transactions. We will therefore examine the 3rd transaction before the other
                    transactions (“the other transactions”). In addition to the ten
                    transactions above, PEPL made several payments amounting to $3,528,040 to other
                        <em>related</em> companies within the Group between
                    23 February 2005 and 22 January 2007.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_5" id="Ftn_5_1"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span> These, however, are not being

<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The 3rd transaction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       The 3rd transaction involved the transfer of
                    $10,987,960.85 from PEPL to the respondent on 4 February 2005. The
                    respondent maintains in this appeal that the 3rd transaction involved the
                    repayment of an ordinary loan given by the respondent to PEPL. It asserts that
                    these monies came from the sale of a property at 12 Woodlands Loop
                    (”Progen Building”) on 29 July 2004 for a sum of
                        $24.9m.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_6" id="Ftn_6_1"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span> Progen Building, however,
                    was consistently reported as a fixed asset in PPL’s audited financial

                    documentary evidence of Progen Building ever being declared as an asset of the
                    respondent. Despite this dearth of evidence, the respondent adamantly maintained
                    during the trial proceedings that Progen Building was always held on trust by
                    PPL for it, and the subsequent sale proceeds were trust monies belonging to it.
                    This untenable contention, however, was not canvassed on appeal.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       The sale proceeds of the Progen Building were
                    eventually placed in PPL’s fixed deposit account with United Overseas Bank
                    Limited (“UOB”) on a monthly basis until 4 December 2004.
                    Before each renewal, PPL withdrew a small part of the funds. The aggregate sum
                    in the account on final maturity was $23,342,695.12.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_8" id="Ftn_8_1"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span> Immediately after
                    maturity, a sum of $19m was transferred from PPL’s UOB fixed deposit
                    account to PEPL’s fixed deposit account with Malayan Banking Berhad
                    (”MBB”) for two months.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_9" id="Ftn_9_1"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span> Initially, to persuade the
                    Judge that the respondent had no intention of making a loan to PEPL, the
                    respondent claimed that this transfer was merely an interim commercial decision
                    to secure higher interest returns. However, we note that no satisfactory
                    evidence to substantiate this was ever adduced.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       The Group had at this point of time two
                    available internal sources of funds:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_9-p2_a"></a>(a)     a sum of $19m from the sale proceeds
                        of Progen Building kept in PPL’s UOB fixed deposit account;
                    and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_9-p2_b"></a>(b)     a sum of
                        $300,000 from the sale of the respondent’s shares in Wee Poh
                            Holdings.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_10" id="Ftn_10_1"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     From this, $19.3m was <em>transferred to PEPL</em> by way of two cheques on 4 December
                    2004:</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(a)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">a cheque drawn by PPL from its UOB account for

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     The purported reasons for the transfer of this
                    sum of $19.3m (captured in two contemporaneous debit notes dated
                    31 December 2004 and issued by PEPL) were briefly recorded as
                    follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_11-p2_a"></a>(a)     a sum of $300,000 recorded as a
                        “transfer of funds to PEPL MBB fixed deposit account” and a
                        sum of $15,750,000 recorded as an “<em><b><font style="text-transform: uppercase;">advance</font></b></em><font style="text-transform: uppercase;"> from [the respondent] to
                            PEPL</font>”, both were recorded on the same Debit Note:
                        PHL/DN/167 <span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_11" id="Ftn_11_1"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span> [emphasis in bold italics
                        added]; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_11-p2_b"></a>(b)     a
                        sum of $3.25m that was recorded as an advance by PPL to PEPL in Debit Note
                            PPL/DN/863.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_12" id="Ftn_12_1"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span> (This sum was in fact a
                        repayment by PPL to PEPL of monies previously advanced to PPL. This is not
                        the subject of the present appeal.)</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     Having briefly set out the genesis of the
                    “loan” given by the respondent to PEPL, we now examine the reasons
                    given by the respondent to justify the 3rd transaction, that is, the repayment
                    of the “loan”.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Alleged commercial reasons for the 3rd transaction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     The respondent claims that the transaction was
                    motivated by proper commercial considerations. Specifically, the transfer of
                    $10,987,960.85 from PEPL to the respondent on 4 February 2005 was meant to
                    pay for the respondent’s Capital Distribution and Special Dividend payout.
                    In support of this, the respondent referred to an earlier SGX MASNET
                    announcement dated 26 August 2004 where it had stated that there would be a
                    special dividend payment of $4m and capital distribution of $11m to the
                    respondent’s shareholders.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_13" id="Ftn_13_1"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span>
                    Shareholders’ approval for this was obtained on 24 November 2004 at
                    an Extraordinary General Meeting and Court approval was obtained on
                    10 January 2005.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     However, in justifying the payment of the
                    Capital Distribution and Special Dividend, the respondent has inadvertently
                    drawn attention to several discrepancies in the processes it employed to secure
                    sanction from the court. It appears from the relevant court minutes and
                    affidavits on record that the respondent did not inform the Court about
                    PEPL’s dire financial position (PEPL’s Balance sheet as at
                    31 December 2004 showed that it was insolvent). On the contrary, the
                    respondent apparently misstated the position to the Court by not fully
                    disclosing the material facts below.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     On 26 November 2004, Winter Engineering
                    (S) Pte Ltd (“Winter Engineering”) obtained an award against PEPL
                    in the sum of $3.6m inclusive of costs (“the arbitration award”).
                    This award adversely affected PEPL’s financial position by adding to its
                    ever increasing pile of unsatisfied debts. In addition to Winter
                    Engineering’s arbitration award, PEPL then already had a significant
                    pre-existing inter-company debt owing to the respondent; PEPL’s General
                    Transactions Listing dated 30 November 2004 stated that PEPL owed a sum of
                    $2,787,999.95 to the respondent.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_14" id="Ftn_14_1"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span> As
                    mentioned above, on 4 December 2004, $19m was transferred from PPL’s
                    fixed deposit account to PEPL’s MBB bank account. However, none of these
                    monies were used to settle the debt due to Winter Engineering. Instead, it
                    appears that PEPL ignored this debt and subsequently attempted to reopen the
                    arbitration award in an attempt to delay payment. On 6 April 2005, PEPL
                    unsuccessfully applied for leave to appeal against this arbitration award. A
                    High Court Judge, in dismissing PEPL’s application for leave to appeal
                    against the arbitration award, observed that PEPL was improperly attempting to
                    evade its legal obligations (<em>see Progen Engineering Pte Ltd v
                        Winter Engineering (S) Pte Ltd</em> [2006] SGHC 224 at
                    [17]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It is evident that the plaintiff was quite content not to prosecute this
                        matter diligently as it had incurred a liability to pay a substantial sum to
                        the defendant pursuant to the First Award. <em>In its attempt
                            to challenge the First Award it sought to raise several unmeritorious
                            issues</em>, <em>ie</em>, the remaining
                        issues. I can only infer from the plaintiff’s conduct that it has,
                        since the issuance of the Second Award, <em>employed every
                            legal strategy available either by omission and/or commission to deprive
                            the defendant of the fruits of litigation. This should no longer be
                            tolerated or permitted</em>. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     On 30 November 2004, merely four days
                    after the arbitration award had been made against PEPL, Lee Ee applied on behalf
                    of the respondent for court approval of the Capital Distribution and Special
                    Dividend payment. Regrettably, the existence of the arbitration award was not
                    drawn to the Court’s attention in Lee Ee’s supporting affidavit.
                    Instead, Lee Ee made several unqualified assertions about the Group’s
                    strong financial position, For instance, in para 24 of his
                        affidavit<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_15" id="Ftn_15_1"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span>:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">These aforesaid audited accounts show that the [respondent] and the Group
                        are in sound financial health.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     It cannot be disputed by the respondent that
                    this reference to the Group embraced PEPL since it was expressly referred to as
                    one of Progen Holdings’ subsidiaries in the affidavit. This representation
                    was clearly not correct. As will be shown below, PEPL’s balance sheet as
                    at 31 December 2004 clearly showed that it not just financially
                    anaemic–it was insolvent and had substantial unsatisfied
                debts.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     Lee Ee also unequivocally represented to the
                    Court that even after the Capital Distribution exercise had been implemented,
                    the companies in the Group would have more than sufficient assets to meet their
                    then outstanding liabilities. At para 27 of his affidavit he boldly
                    asserted:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">After the proposed capital reduction and capital distribution of the
                        [respondent], it is intended for the [respondent] and the Group to retain
                        substantial cash and cash equivalents, <em>which will be more
                            than sufficient to meet the existing liabilities in the accounts and to
                            continue its operations</em>. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     Strikingly, the following assertions were also
                    made at paras 11 and 12 of the same affidavit:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<em>... taking into account the reserves available
                                to the Group in the form of the Available Funds, the working and
                                other capital requirements of the Group, the Group's present credit
                                facilities as well as funds required for any business and expansion
                                opportunities, the current available working capital of the Group is
                                more than its present requirements.</em>..    </p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The level of cash distribution pursuant to the capital reduction and
                        capital distribution exercise has been determined to allow the Group to
                        maintain sufficient Available Funds and capital and revenue reserves to
                        support and focus on the Group's businesses as well as to take advantage of
                        appropriate new business opportunities that may arise from time to time in
                        the future ...</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     We can safely assume that it was only because
                    of all these unqualified statements about the Group’s robust financial
                    position that the Court approved the Capital Distribution and Special Dividend
                    payment on 10 January 2005. Unfortunately, this pattern of misstatement did
                    not stop here. It will be seen below that the respondent continued to give
                    further questionable assurances (of a different kind) even after the 3rd
                    transaction was effected on 4 February 2005.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">
<b>Material misstatements in PEPL’s Financial
                    Statements and Director’s Statement</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     Before dealing with the further misstatements,
                    it would be appropriate to review the financial situation of PEPL at the
                    material time. In PEPL’s balance sheet as of 31 December 2004, a sum
                    of $18,514,288 was recorded as an “<b><em>Amount due to [the
                        respondent]</em></b>”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_16" id="Ftn_16_1"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span> (emphasis in bold
                    italics added). This sum comprises of (a) $16.05m transferred by the
                    respondent to PEPL, and (b) the pre-existing debt of $2,787,999.95 owed by
                    PEPL to the respondent. Plainly, the balance sheet as at 31 December 2004
                    indicated that PEPL was already insolvent at that time with unsatisfied debts of
                    $2,246,584.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     PEPL’s balance sheet and Financial
                    Statements dated 31 December 2004 were jointly issued by Lee Ee, Koh, Tan
                    Eng Liang, and Ch’ng Jit Koon on 23 February 2005. The first alleged
                    misstatement is in Note 13 of PEPL’s Financial Statements dated
                    31 December 2004<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_17" id="Ftn_17_1"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a></span> (“Note 13”), where it was
                    stated that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The amount [due to the respondent which is the sum of $18,514,288 recorded
                        in PEPL’s balance sheet] is non-trade related, unsecured,
                        interest-free and is <em>not expected to be repaid within the
                            next twelve months</em>. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     This assurance, as we have pointed out above,
                    was not observed as the respondent and the directors of PEPL allowed this amount
                    to be utilised, even before it was given, on 4 February 2005 to
                    “repay” the amount for the purpose of making the dividend
                    payments.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     The second alleged misstatement was contained
                    in the Statement made by two of PEPL’s Directors (“Director’s
                    Statement”), namely Lee Ee and Tan Eng Liang.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_18" id="Ftn_18_1"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a></span> The
                    Director’s Statement was dated 23 February 2005 and was issued

                    PEPL’s Financial Statements dated 31 December 2004.
                    Paragraph (b) of the Director’s Statement represented that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... at the date of this statement there are reasonable grounds to believe
                        that [PEPL] <em>will be able to pay its debts as and when
                            they fall due as its holding company has agreed to provide adequate
                            funds for [PEPL] to meet its liabilities</em> as and when they
                        fall due and to <em>subordinate the amount owing to it and

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     This statement was referred to by the Judge as
                    a “Subordination Statement” (see the Judge’s Grounds of
                    Decision, <em>Liquidators of Progen Engineering Pte Ltd v Progen

                    [22]) and we will adopt the same terminology here. Contrary to the
                    representations made in the Subordination Statement and Note 13, PEPL in
                    fact had already paid the sum of $10,987,960.85, out of the sum of S$19.3m kept
                    in the MBB fixed deposit account, to the respondent on 4 February 2005. We
                    consider it significant that even after this payment was made on 4 February
                    2005, the directors of PEPL had more than ample opportunity to amend its
                    Director’s Statement (inclusive of the Subordination Statement) and its
                    Financial Statements (inclusive of Note 13), as these documents were all

                    manager, testified that PEPL had operated as a “payment centre”
                    since 2001.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_19" id="Ftn_19_1"><sup>[note: 19]</sup></a></span> PEPL would
                    make payments for and on behalf of the respondent and other subsidiaries. The
                    payments include salaries, CPF payments and petty cash reimbursements for the
                    employees in the Group.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_20" id="Ftn_20_1"><sup>[note: 20]</sup></a></span> This arrangement does not
                    seem, however, to have been properly captured in the Group’s financial
                    statements.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     During the material period, PEPL made payment
                    to the respondent on six separate occasions, allegedly as payment for the
                    salaries and expenses of the respondent’s employees. These payments came
                    to $347,144.16 in all. The six occasions were: 31 January 2005,
                    28 February 2005, 31 March 2005, 30 April 2005, 31 May 2005
                    and 30 June 2005 (see above at <a href="#p1_5">[5]</a>).
                    These were all alleged to be unfair preferences. The respondent maintains that
                    these payments were made in accordance with PEPL’s settled
                        practices.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_21" id="Ftn_21_1"><sup>[note: 21]</sup></a></span></p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     PEPL also made payment to the respondent on
                    two other occasions, allegedly as reimbursement for iron ore purchases. These
                    payments amounted to $105,000.00. The two occasions were 21 February 2005
                    and 4 March 2005. These were alleged to be unfair preferences. The
                    respondent again claims that these payments followed PEPL’s settled
                        practices.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_22" id="Ftn_22_1"><sup>[note: 22]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Set-off on 30 June 2005</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     On 30 June 2005, a debt of $7,538,243.15
                    owed by PEPL to the respondent was discharged by setting it off against the sum
                    of $9,027,964.19 owed by PPL to PEPL. The discharge of the debt owed to the
                    respondent is also alleged to be an unfair preference. The respondent contends
                    that this transaction was an ‘inter-company adjustment’, and that
                    such adjustments were a “normal practice” of the Group. Companies
                    within the Group would make payments on behalf of each other and
                    inter–company balances then adjusted periodically.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_23" id="Ftn_23_1"><sup>[note: 23]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The Judge’s decision</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     The Judge found that the evidence did not
                    support the respondent’s contention that the sum of $16.05m was held on
                    trust for the respondent. The Judge nevertheless held that that the statutory
                    presumption under s 99(5) of the Bankruptcy Act had been rebutted in all
                    ten transactions: see GD at [71]–[82]. The Judge accepted that the sum of
                    $10,987,960.85 was meant all along to be used for the respondent’s Capital
                    Distribution; the money had only been temporarily placed in PEPL’s MBB
                    fixed deposit account to take advantage of higher interest rates pending court
                    approval. The Judge also determined that even though the undertaking given in
                    Note 13 and the Subordination Statement had been disregarded, this did not
                    necessarily mean that there had been an unfair preference (see GD at [68]).
                        <em>Nonetheless, the Judge acknowledged that even if there
                        was no fraud involved, there had been negligence and recklessness on the
                        part of Lee Ee and PEPL’s directors</em>. In addition, the Judge
                    noted that there was no hint that steps would be taken by the respondent to
                    “put its house in order” (GD at [86]). Noting that the respondent
                    is a listed company, he intimated that the liquidators ought to draw the
                    breaches of the various undertakings to the attention of PEPL’s auditors
                    and the Singapore Stock Exchange. His observations at [85]–[88] of the GD
                    merit repetition here:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">85    There is, however,
                            one other observation I wish to make. <em>It seemed to me
                                that the directors of [PEPL], or at least Mr Lee Ee, did not
                                bother to ensure that the Subordination Statement and Note 13 were
                                accurate. There seemed to be some negligence or recklessness even if
                                there was no fraud</em>. Furthermore, although Mr Lee Ee
                            said he would take full responsibility for the Subordination Statement,
                            and presumably for Note 13 as well, there seemed to be an absence
                            of genuine remorse. These two statements were not the only
                            “errors” which had occurred. To recapitulate some other
                            examples:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(a)    the effective dates of transactions were at
                                times incorrectly entered in accounting documents of [PEPL];
                                and</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(b)    the payment of $3,250,000 by PPL to [PEPL] was
                                actually a re-payment of an amount to [PEPL] but not recorded
                                correctly.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">86    There was no hint that steps would be taken by [the

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">87    
              <em>I am concerned about the [the

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">88

                                [the respondent] if not to the Singapore Stock Exchange as

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     With regard to the other transactions, the
                    Judge was satisfied that they were “part of the Company’s
                    practice” to treat PEPL as a “payment centre” to pay the
                    salaries and cash expenses of companies in the Group. Similarly, regarding the
                    10th transaction (the set-off involving the sum of 7,538,243.15), the Judge
                    found that it was not the first time that set-offs had been carried out by PEPL
                    (although the Judge did acknowledge that “it was <em>not
                        normal</em> for a set-off of this <em>extent</em>
                    to be done” (GD at [77])).</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     It is common ground that the ten transactions
                    questioned by the liquidators were entered into while PEPL was insolvent. In
                    addition, they were made within a period of two years preceding the date of the
                    commencement of winding up of PEPL, that is to say, when the winding up
                    application was filed on 22 January 2007.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     It is also undisputed that PEPL was
                    “connected” with the respondent, through the common directors, for
                    the purposes of triggering the statutory presumption under s 99(5) of the
                    Bankruptcy Act read with s 329 of the Companies Act (we shall refer to this
                    presumption hereafter as the “statutory presumption”). On this
                    point, it has been unequivocally decided by this court in <em>Show Theatres Pte Ltd (in liquidation) v Shaw Theatres Pte Ltd &amp;
                        another</em> [2002] 2 SLR(R) 1143 (“<em>Show Theatres</em>”) that where two companies have a
                    common director or common directors, they will be considered to be
                    “connected with” each other. A payment to a connected party within
                    the two years prior to liquidation is presumed to be an unfair preference and it
                    is for the “connected” company to rebut that presumption, see
                        <em>Show Theatres</em> at [21]. <em>Prima facie</em>, the ten transactions being questioned are presumed
                    to have been influenced by PEPL’s desire to place the respondent in a
                    better position in the event of PEPL’s insolvent liquidation than if the
                    transactions had not been entered into (see ss 99(4) and (3)(<em>b</em>) of the Bankruptcy Act).</p>

                    this appeal is whether the statutory presumption has been rebutted. To rebut the
                    statutory presumption, the burden is on the respondent to show, on a balance of
                    probabilities, that the transactions had not been influenced by PEPL’s
                    desire to place the respondent in a better position in the event of PEPL’s
                    insolvent liquidation. Simply put, the respondent must show that the
                    transactions were <em>not influenced at all</em> by any
                    desire on PEPL’s part to place the respondent in a preferential position.
                    It is never sufficient, where there is objective evidence of a preferential
                    payment to benefit a related party in the event of an insolvent liquidation, for
                    the directors to simply deny the existence of such a desire. The facts have to
                    be explained in detail. We deal with the 3rd transaction in Part 1 below.
                    The other transactions will be dealt with in Part 2 (at <a href="#p1_56">[56]</a>–<a href="#p1_68">[68]</a>) below.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Part 1 – Analysis of the 3rd transaction</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Preliminary considerations</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     As mentioned above, the Judge had decided that
                    the sum of $16.05m transferred to PEPL was an ordinary advance. He, quite
                    rightly, emphatically rejected the contention that the subject monies advanced
                    by the respondent to PEPL were trust monies that had belonged, all along, to it.
                    As mentioned above, as there is no cross-appeal by the respondent against this
                    finding we will not revisit this issue. It suffices for us to say that the
                    objective facts clearly show the following. First, PEPL’s audited
                    Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2004 confirm that the
                    sum of $18,514,288 (which includes the sum of $16.05m transferred from the
                    respondent to PEPL) was recorded as a “<b>[n]on-current
                        liability</b>” [emphasis in bold in original] and as
                    “Amounts due” to the respondent.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_24" id="Ftn_24_1"><sup>[note: 24]</sup></a></span> In addition,
                    Note 13 of the Financial Statements emphatically stated that the amount due
                    to the respondent (the sum of $18,514,288) as “unsecured” and
                    “interest free” that is “not expected to be repaid within
                    the next 12 months”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_25" id="Ftn_25_1"><sup>[note: 25]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     Second, the debit note dated 31 December
                    2004 recorded the transfer of the sum of $15,750,000.00 on 4 December 2004
                    as an “ADVANCE” from the Respondent to PEPL even though the monies
                    came from the sale proceeds of an asset owned by PPL.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_26" id="Ftn_26_1"><sup>[note: 26]</sup></a></span> The
                    balance sum of $300,000 (the sum that the respondent obtained from having
                    realised its shares in Wee Poh Holdings) had been recorded as a
                        “<font style="text-transform: uppercase;">transfer of funds to</font> PEPL MBB
                        <font style="text-transform: uppercase;">fixed deposit”</font>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     Third, Lee Ee and Tan Eng Liang, in their
                    capacity as directors of PEPL, unequivocally represented in the Subordination
                    Statement that PEPL would be able to pay its debts when due <em>as the Respondent had agreed to provide adequate funds for PEPL to meet its
                        liabilities as and when they fell due</em> and crucially, to
                    subordinate the amount owing to it and its related companies to ensure the prior
                    payment of other liabilities.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_27" id="Ftn_27_1"><sup>[note: 27]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Presumption for 3rd transaction is not rebutted</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     The existence of a subjective desire to prefer
                    a creditor in the event of an insolvent liquidation may be inferred from all the
                    circumstances of the transaction. The statutory presumption can therefore be
                    reinforced or rebutted on the basis of direct evidence and/or on inferences
                    drawn from the circumstances. If it can be established by the related party that
                    the transaction was underpinned by proper commercial considerations and not by a
                    positive desire to prefer it in the event of an insolvent liquidation, the
                    transaction will not be impugned. On the established facts, in so far as the 3rd
                    transaction is concerned, we determine that the statutory presumption for the
                    3rd transaction has not been rebutted for the following reasons:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_40-p2_a"></a>(a)     The failure to adhere to the above
                        series of <em>assurances</em> given by the directors of
                        the respondent and PEPL was highly <em>irregular</em>- indeed, they were made for an improper reason. Quite
                        clearly, they were made to allow PEPL to continue operating as a going
                        concern despite its parlous financial situation. Given the proximity with
                        which they were made to the date of the adverse arbitration award against
                        PEPL and the emphatic assurance not to pay related companies in preference
                        to unrelated creditors in the Subordination Statement and in Note 13,
                        we think that there was more than compelling evidence of a desire by PEPL to
                        prefer the respondent.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_40-p2_b"></a>(b)     In situations where there is clear evidence of the
                        directors’ failure to appropriately consider the interests of the
                        company’s creditors, the Court should carefully sift through the
                        evidence to determine if there were any transactions that undermine the
                        collective procedure of insolvent liquidation. Here, the interests of
                        PEPL’s unrelated creditors were <em>obviously
                            disregarded</em>. The 3rd transaction was undoubtedly orchestrated
                        by PEPL’s principal director to benefit the respondent’s
                        principal shareholder, who was essentially one and the same person: Lee Ee
                        (and his wife, Koh). As such, the established facts in the present case
                        fortify the statutory presumption.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_40-p2_c"></a>(c)     The purported commercial reason for making the advance
                        (even if present), in and of itself, is insufficient to rebut the statutory
                        presumption.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     We now elaborate on each of these
                    reasons.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">False assurances given by the directors of PEPL</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     It is plain to us that assurances given in the
                    Subordination Statement and Note 13 have been shown to be false. We should
                    point out at the outset, that since PEPL is statutorily required<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_28" id="Ftn_28_1"><sup>[note: 28]</sup></a></span> to lodge an annual return
                    attached with the company’s balance sheet, Directors’ report and
                    Financial Statements; any assurances found in these statements would be made to
                    the auditors, the public at large, as well its shareholders and, of particular
                    concern in the present case, PEPL’s creditors. For its <em>unrelated</em> creditors, these publicly filed statements were likely
                    to be their main source of financial information on PEPL and could have
                    influenced their decisions on when and how to recover their outstandings.
                    Note 13 represented that the amounts due to the respondent (referenced as
                    the sum of $18,514,288 in the Financial Statements) were not intended to be
                    repaid <em>within the next twelve months</em>. Note 13
                    was part of PEPL’s Financial Statements dated 31 December 2004 and it
                    was issued together with the Directors’ Report for the year ended
                    31 December 2004, signed on 23 February 2005. <em>This
                        assurance was given to ensure that PEPL could continue operating as a going
                        concern as it was then technically insolvent. In fact, the sum of
                        $10,987,960.85 from the sum of $18,514,288 had already been repaid to the
                        respondent on 4 February 2005 – well before this assurance was
                        even given</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     The assurances given by PEPL’s directors
                    in the Subordination Statement that PEPL would subordinate the amounts owed to
                    the respondent and its related companies “for the prior payment of other
                    liabilities” (see <a href="#p1_24">[24]</a> above) were
                    also disregarded. Counsel for the respondent argued that the Subordination
                    Statement correctly represented PEPL’s financial situation as of
                    31 December 2004 as the payment out was only made subsequently. We cannot
                    agree with this. The Director’s Statement (inclusive of the Subordination
                    Statement) dated 23 February 2005, was released as an integral part of
                    PEPL’s Directors’ Report for the year ended 31 December 2004
                    and annexed to PEPL’s audited balance sheet and Financial Statements
                    ending 31 December 2004. This assurance that other liabilities would be
                    paid in priority to related debts given <em>inter alia</em>
                    to the auditors of the Group did not end on 31 December 2004. It was meant
                    to unambiguously create an expectation that all debts owed to unrelated
                    creditors would be paid in priority to related debts. Despite this solemn
                    assurance, the sum of $10,987,960.85 was paid to the respondent on
                    4 February 2005.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     The Judge appeared to have vaguely hinted that
                    the misrepresentations might have been fraudulent but was ultimately content to
                    find that there was negligence and recklessness on the part of Lee Ee and
                    PEPL’s directors. It appears to us clear that when the Subordination
                    Statement and Note 13 were issued on 23 February 2005, the relevant
                    directors ought to have been aware that $10,987,960.85 had already been paid to
                    the respondent on 4 February 2005; they were after all directors of both
                    PEPL and the respondent (with the exception of Koh who was the director of PEPL
                    only). Lee Ee has now begrudgingly acknowledged that he might have known that
                    PEPL was “technically insolvent” by the end of the financial year
                    2004, a few months before the amount was paid on 4 February
                        2005.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_29" id="Ftn_29_1"><sup>[note: 29]</sup></a></span> This is not the whole truth.
                    It is surprising that even after these payments were made on 4 February
                    2005, the directors of PEPL (despite the ample time available to them to amend
                    its Financial Statements (inclusive of Note 13) and the Director’s
                    Statement (inclusive of the Subordination Statement) before these were issued on
                    23 February 2005), took no steps to correct them. In its written
                    submissions, the respondent claims that Note 13 “was intended as a
                    standard form statement and not meant to be legally binding”
                    <span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_30" id="Ftn_30_1"><sup>[note: 30]</sup></a></span> though it is conceded that “[t]hese
                    statements were made in order to confirm PEPL as a going concern at the end of
                    the financial year”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_31" id="Ftn_31_1"><sup>[note: 31]</sup></a></span> These
                    are astonishing submissions as they suggest that the directors were guilty of
                    reckless conduct, at the very least. As these statements were made to secure
                    PELP’s status as a going concern all the directors must take collective
                    responsibility for their contents and the glaring failure to adhere to the
                    commitments given therein. This limp attempt to minimise responsibility for a
                    public commitment in a statutory document must be strongly deprecated. Directors
                    have to understand that they must take full responsibility for the accuracy and
                    implementation of all such statements. There is no point in saying that these
                    were pro forma statements. A failure to appreciate the consequences of not
                    adhering to such statements can be perilous.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     In our view, the legal significance of the
                    assurances made in the Subordination Statement and Note 13 were not fully
                    appreciated by the Judge. We find that the patent breaches of these assurances
                    fortify the statutory presumption and are, in the final analysis, compelling
                    evidence of the <em>desire of the common directors to prefer a
                        related entity</em>. When these assurances were given, Winter
                    Engineering had already secured an arbitration award (awarded on
                    26 November 2006) of $3.6m against PEPL. When this liability of $3.6m was
                    factored in, PEPL was insolvent with a deficit of more than $2m as shown in its
                    Balance Sheet as at 31 December 2004. As Winter Engineering was immediately
                    entitled to enforce its award the risk of PEPL being placed in liquidation was
                    very real. <em>It was only because of those assurances that PEPL
                        could continue trading as a going concern</em>. Subsequent events made
                    it plain that the directors of PEPL and the respondent never had any intention
                    of settling the outstanding due to its unrelated creditors. The evidence is
                    telling. Between the time PEPL’s Financial Statements and Director’s
                    Statement were released on 23 February 2005, and when insolvency
                    proceedings commenced on 22 January 2007, a total sum of $18,978,348.16 was
                    transferred from PEPL <em>to the respondent</em>, and a
                    total sum of $3,528,040 was transferred from PEPL <em>to related
                        companies in the Group.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_32" id="Ftn_32_1"><sup>[note: 32]</sup></a></span></em> Yet
                    PEPL’s two largest external creditors, Winter Engineering and Uni-Sanitary
                    were not paid even a cent. In addition, PEPL owed a total sum of $527,336.28 to
                    other <em>unrelated</em> creditors (apart from Winter
                    Engineering and Uni-Sanitary) as at 16 February 2007, the date of the
                    winding up order.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_33" id="Ftn_33_1"><sup>[note: 33]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     The irresistible conclusion is that these
                    false assurances were given to buy more time for the respondent to transfer
                    PEPL’s monies to itself and to related creditors, including the respondent
                        -<em>away from the reach of PEPL’s unrelated
                        creditors</em>. These facts also suggest the directors of PEPL had
                    been carrying on PEPL’s business when it was technically insolvent to the
                    detriment of PEPL’s unrelated creditors. This can perhaps be best
                    characterised as a case of transparent subterfuge. It raises problematic issues
                    under s 340(1) of the Companies Act in relation to the directors’
                    collective responsibility for this sorry state of affairs. As this particular
                    point is not an issue immediately before us, we will say no more.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Breach of director’s duties</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     In addition to the false assurances made by
                    PEPL’s directors, there are additional facts to fortify the statutory
                    presumption. As will be seen below at <a href="#p1_53">[53]</a>,
                    the evidence here presents an obvious situation where the directors (Lee Ee and
                    Koh in particular) have breached their directors’ duties to consider the
                    interests of PEPL’s creditors. Indeed, we think that whenever it is
                    plainly established that the directors have disregarded their duties the Court
                    should view with even greater scepticism transactions that appear to undermine
                    the collective procedure of insolvent liquidation, such as unfair preferences or
                    undervalue transactions. This is because the avoidance rules serve the same
                    broad policy objectives as the directors’ duties to consider the interests
                    of creditors when a company’s financial position severely deteriorates.
                    Both are aimed at protecting the general body of creditors against a diminution
                    of the assets available for distribution to creditors in the collective
                    insolvency regime. In certain instances, the breach of the director’s duty
                    goes hand in hand with an unfair preference transaction and may even be a basis
                    for independent recovery from the directors if the preferred creditor is unable
                    to repay the amount adjudged to be an undue preference. To appreciate this, a
                    proper understanding of the duty is required.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     It is trite that directors have a duty to act
                    in the best interest of the company as a whole. When a company is solvent, the
                    company’s directors owe no duty to creditors. (See <em>Federal Express Pacific Inc. v Meglis Airfreight Pte Ltd (formerly known as
                        Thong Soon Airfreight Pte Ltd) and Others</em>

                    consider creditors’ interests only arises during insolvency or in a state
                    of near insolvency; and <em>Multinational Gas and Petrochemical

                    However, it is now also settled law that when a company is insolvent, or even in
                    a parlous financial position, directors have a fiduciary duty to take into
                    account the interests of the company’s creditors when making decisions for
                    the company. This fiduciary duty requires directors to ensure that the
                    company’s assets are not dissipated or exploited for their own benefit to
                    the prejudice of creditors’ interests. In this regard, the purpose of this
                    duty mirrors that of the avoidance provisions in seeking to preserve the
                    company’s assets for distribution to the company’s creditors through
                    the mechanism of insolvency. The House of Lords in <em>Winkworth

                        risk, but the <em>company owes a duty to its creditors to
                            keep its property inviolate and available for the repayment of its

                        creditors far exceeded that sum. These breaches of duty would not have
                        mattered if Mr and Mrs Wing had been able to maintain the solvency
                        of the company and to see that all its creditors were paid in full.

                        another</em> [1988] BCLC 250 (“<em>West Mercia</em>”) is particularly instructive for present
                    purposes. In that case the plaintiff company owed its parent company more than
                    £30,000. Mr Dodd was a director of both companies, which were both
                    insolvent. The parent company had debts which were guaranteed by Mr Dodd.
                    At the time when, to Mr Dodd’s knowledge, the plaintiff company was
                    already insolvent, Mr Dodd authorised the transfer of £4,000 from the
                    plaintiff company to the parent company so as to reduce his own personal
                    liability under his guarantees for the parent company. The Court of Appeal found
                    (at [33]) that by doing so, Mr Dodd had been “<em>in
                        fraud</em> of the creditors of the company”; he had disregarded
                    the interests of the creditors of the plaintiff company and had made the
                    transfer for his sole and personal benefit. Dillon LJ cited with approval

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In a solvent company the proprietary interests of the shareholders entitle

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     In Australia, the decision of <em>Walker v Wimborne and others</em> [1975–1976]
                    137 CLR 1 (“<em>Walker</em>”)
                    underscores how such breaches of fiduciary duties can occur where there are
                    common directors in companies that belong to the same group. <em>Walker</em> was a case that involved several companies with common
                    directors. The directors of the plaintiff company (“Asiatic”)
                    formulated a general policy for moving funds between the companies in the group
                    to meet exigencies as they arose. The directors transferred $10,000 from Asiatic
                    to Australian Sound, a company in the group, as the latter was in financial
                    difficulties (“the transaction”). However, Asiatic did not receive
                    any advantage or benefit from this so-called loan, since there was no security
                    nor any promise to pay interest obtained from Australian Sound. Furthermore,
                    Asiatic was itself insolvent when the common directors directed the sum of
                    $10,000 to be transferred to Australian Sound. As such, to finance the
                    transaction, Asiatic had to borrow $10,000 from another company in the group,
                    Estoril. This loan was fully secured by an equitable charge granted by Asiatic
                    to Estoril. This meant that Asiatic’s unsecured creditors had been
                    deprived of $10,000 which would have been available for distribution but for the
                    transaction. The Court emphasised that each company in a group is a separate
                    legal entity, and that the directors of each company had to discharge their
                    duties with regard to the interests of the creditors of that company, without
                    allowing such interests to be prejudiced by movement of monies between companies
                    in a group (at 6–7):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… each of the companies [in a group of companies] was a separate
                        and independent legal entity, and that it was the duty of the directors of
                        Asiatic [the plaintiff company] to consult its interests and its interests
                        alone in deciding whether payments should be made to other companies. In
                        this respect it should be emphasized that the directors of a company in
                        discharging their duty to the company must take account of the interest of
                        its shareholders and its creditors. Any failure by the directors to take
                        into account the interests of creditors will have adverse consequences for
                        the company as well as for them. The creditor of a company, whether it be a
                        member of a "group" of companies in the accepted sense of that term or not,
                        must look to that company for payment. His interests may be prejudiced by
                        the movement of funds between companies in the event that the companies
                        become insolvent.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     The English and Australian approach to these
                    issues has also been adopted by the Singapore courts. In the decision of
                        <em>Chip Thye Enterprises Pte Ltd (in liquidation) v Phay Gi
                        Mo and others</em> [2004] 1 SLR(R) 434, the High Court
                    correctly endorsed the basic proposition that “[w]hen a company is
                    insolvent, the interests of creditors become the dominant factor in what
                    constitutes ‘the benefit of the company as a whole’” (at
                    [13]; also see <em>Federal Express</em> at
                [17]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     It can be seen (at <a href="#p1_49">[49]</a> above) from the observations by Street CJ in <em>Kinsela</em> (cited with approval in <em>West
                        Mercia</em>) that the rationale for such a duty is that, when a
                    company is insolvent, the creditors’ interests come to the fore as the
                    company is effectively trading and running the company’s business with the
                    creditors’ money. Because of the limited liability principle, the risks
                    (of trading when the company is insolvent) on shareholders would be minimal as
                    they would at worst lose only what they have already invested in the company in
                    their capacity as shareholders. Unsecured or partially secured creditors on the
                    other hand may never recover any monies due to them. Unlike shareholders who
                    have the most to gain from risky ventures, unsecured creditors, in particular,
                    have everything to lose when illegitimate risks are taken. As such, it is only
                    right that directors ought to be accountable to creditors for the decisions they
                    make when the company is, or perilously close to being, insolvent. We add,
                    parenthetically, that this fiduciary duty is strictly speaking owed <em>to the company</em>; there is <em>no duty owed
                        directly to creditors</em>. In other words, individual creditors
                    cannot, without the assistance of liquidators, directly recover from the
                    directors for such breaches of duty (see <em>Yukong Line Ltd. of
                        Korea v Rendsburg Investments Corporation of Liberia and Others
                        (No. 2)</em> [1998] 1 WLR 294; and more recently,
                        <em>Re Pantone 485 Ltd, Miller v Bain and others</em>
                    [2002] 1 BCLC 266 ). If creditors were allowed to recover directly, it
                    would contravene the collective procedure of insolvency and open a back door for
                    some of them to work around the <em>pari passu</em> rule.
                    Allowing creditors <em>and</em> the company to directly
                    recover from directors might also lead to double recovery; see <em>D D Prentice</em>, “<em>Creditor’s Interests and Director’s Duties</em>”

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     In the present case, we find that the
                    statutory presumption, far from being rebutted, had in fact been reinforced by
                    PEPL’s directors’ manifest breaches of their personal
                    directors’ duties. The transfer of $10,987,960.85 on 4 February 2005,
                    made in direct contravention of the representations found in the Subordination
                    Statement and Note 13, had been for the purposes of the Capital
                    Distribution and Special Dividend payout to the respondent’s
                        shareholders.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_34" id="Ftn_34_1"><sup>[note: 34]</sup></a></span> It is not an unimportant consideration
                    that Lee Ee and his wife, Koh together own 29.24% of the shareholding in the
                        respondent.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_35" id="Ftn_35_1"><sup>[note: 35]</sup></a></span> As such, the
                    3rd transaction had the effect of conferring a direct benefit to Lee Ee and Koh
                        <em>personally</em> in their capacity as substantial
                    shareholders of the respondent. In light of the fact that they were:
                    (a) the ultimate beneficiaries of a substantial portion of $10,987,960.85;
                    (b) directors of PEPL and (c) one of them (Lee Ee) was also a director
                    of the respondent, there are grounds for a compelling inference that Lee Ee and
                    Koh were the <em>directing minds</em> behind the payment of
                    $10,987,960.85 on 4 February 2005 to the respondent. This is irrefutable
                    evidence of the requisite desire to prefer, even without having to rely upon the
                    statutory presumption of the desire to prefer. In essence, the directors of
                    PEPL, especially Lee Ee and Koh, had brazenly disregarded their very own
                    assurances (<em>qua</em> directors) not to prefer (as
                    manifested in the Subordination Statement and Note 13) or benefit
                    themselves to the prejudice of the interests of PEPL’s unrelated
                    creditors.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Commercial reason for making the advance is in and of itself
                insufficient to rebut the statutory presumption</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     We have emphasised that the directors’
                    breaches of their own assurances constitute compelling evidence of the desire of
                    PEPL to prefer the respondent. In this regard, the 3rd transaction ought to be
                    set aside as an unfair preference with or without the aid of the statutory
                    presumption. Even if we did not take into consideration the broken assurances
                    and the breaches of director’s duties on Lee Ee’s part, the
                    respondent has, in our view, failed to discharge its burden of proof to rebut
                    the statutory presumption.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     The respondent stated that the advance of
                    $16.05m to PEPL was made to take advantage of higher interest rates in
                    PEPL’s MBB fixed deposit accounts. The respondent’s commercial
                    reasons given to justify the advance of the loan are not apparent to us (see
                    above at <a href="#p1_8">[8]</a>). The fact that $16.05m had been
                    advanced by the respondent to PEPL on 4 December 2004 purportedly to take
                    advantage of higher interest rates in PEPL’s MBB fixed deposit account
                    does not explain why the repayment of $10,987,960.85 by PEPL to the respondent
                        <em>would not be</em> an unfair preference. This is
                    because there is nothing exceptional in a creditor lending money to take
                    advantage of the possibility of higher returns upon repayment of the money lent.
                    In other words, the commercial reason for making the advance (to take advantage
                    of higher interest rates), without more, does not explain away the presumption
                    that the <em>repayment</em> of the advance was influenced
                    by a desire to prefer the creditor. More importantly, the monies loaned were
                    unsecured loans which could not thereafter be repaid in priority relative to
                    other outstanding liabilities of PEPL <em>when the company itself
                        was insolvent</em>. In any case, we are satisfied that the crucial
                    consideration in the decision by the respondent to loan the money to PEPL was to
                    enable PEPL’s accounts to be finalised on a going concern basis. In our
                    view, sanction for the capital reduction of the respondent and the payment of
                    the dividends would not have been given if the court had been apprised of the
                    true facts.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Part 2 - The presumption in relation to PEPL’s other payments
                to the respondent and the set-off effected on 30 June 2005 has not been
                rebutted</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     The other payments made by PEPL to the
                    respondent alleged to be unfair preferences were:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_56-p2_a"></a>(a)     Payments allegedly made for the
                        salaries and expenses of the respondent’s employees on six occasions:
                        31 January 2005, 28 February 2005, 31 March 2005,
                        30 April 2005, 31 May 2005 and 30 June 2005. These payments
                        amounted to $347,144.16 (see above at <a href="#p1_27">[27]</a>);</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_56-p2_b"></a>(b)     Payments allegedly made as reimbursement to the
                        respondent for iron ore purchases on 21 February 2005 and 4 March
                        2005. These payments amounted to $105,000.00, (see above at <a href="#p1_28">[28]</a>).</p>
<p class="Judg-1">In addition, there
                    was a set-off transaction which was alleged to be an unfair preference:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_56-p2_c"></a>(c)     The set-off was effected on
                        30 June 2005; as a consequence a debt of $7,538,243.15 owed by PEPL to
                        the respondent has been discharged, as this sum was set off against the sum
                        of $9,027,964.19 owed by PPL to PEPL (see above at <a href="#p1_29">[29]</a>).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     The respondent’s position is that
                    transactions <a href="#p1_56">[56]</a>(a)–(c) are not
                    unfair preferences as there was evidence that they were part of PEPL’s
                    settled practice. PEPL had been acting as the “payment centre” to
                    make payments to other related companies within the Group. This, in our view, is
                    not a valid legal reason for the payments. Just because a transaction has been
                    earlier carried out while a company is solvent, it does not necessarily follow
                    that the presumption that such transactions have been influenced by the
                    requisite desire to prefer will be rebutted. There is no formulaic magic to a
                    transaction being part of a past practice; a creditor cannot simply evade the
                    statutory presumption by merely labelling a transaction as “past
                    practice”. The key issue in rebutting the statutory presumption is to
                    show that the particular transactions have not been influenced by the requisite
                    desire to prefer the respondent. The existence of an established course of
                    dealings, or “past practice” so to speak, is only <em>relevant</em> if those past practices show that the creditor
                    has been <em>providing new value</em> by granting new
                    credit to the company to purchase supplies and items (for example) to keep its
                    business going. Where that is the case, payment is made not with the desire to
                    prefer the creditor, but with the motivation to obtain fresh financing to
                    sustain the company’s business in earnest. As observed by
                    Professor Roy Goode in <em>Principles of Corporate
                        Insolvency Law</em>, (Thomson Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 3rd Ed, 2005)
                    at p 465:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[The] fact that there is a series of mutual dealings, with debits and
                        credits on both sides, will usually suffice to negate an intention to
                        prefer, for it suggests either that a payment into the account was made in
                        the expectation that further drawings would be allowed or that the bank
                        allowed a further drawing on the understanding that it would be covered by a
                        further payment into the account. In either case there is no intention to
                        prefer, or indeed, a true preference at all. Indeed, it has been said that
                        the real question is … the intention that payments into the account
                        will generate future supplies of goods, services or credit. <em>Accordingly … even payments made to discharge specific
                            debit items will qualify for the application of the principle if the
                            intention is that they should form part of a continuing relationship
                            involving the extension of further credit</em>. [emphasis

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a>58     Here, we note that the Judge mistakenly
                    assumed that the presumption for these transactions was
                    “automatically” rebutted as they were part of a “past
                    practice”, see GD at [76]–[78]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">76    ... I noted that [PEPL] did in the past apply some
                            inter-company set-offs …</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">77    While it is not normal for a set-off of this extent
                            to be done, the liquidators did not dispute that there were times when

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">78    As for the payments to CPF and for bonuses and

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a>59     The Judge, <em>without
                        elaboration</em>, had earlier approvingly referred to the decision of
                        <em>Re Libra Industries Pte Ltd</em> [1999]
                    3 SLR(R) 205 at [49] (‘<em>Re
                    Libra</em>’) at [70] of the GD:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I accept that there was an <em>established</em>
                        practice for Libra Industries to make payments into the account with Libra
                        Holding without reference to specific invoices, and that the payments listed
                        in the table were made in accordance with that practice. [emphasis
                        added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a>60     We note that the Court in <em>ERC Land Pte Ltd (in liquidation) v Ho Wing On Christopher and
                        others</em> [2004] 1 SLR(R) 105 at [48] has similarly
                    referred to the decision of <em>Re Libra, without
                        elaboration</em> for the same proposition that “an established
                    past practice of payments would indicate that there was no desire” to
                    prefer the creditor. As mentioned earlier (in <a href="#p1_57">[57]</a>), the existence of an established past practice of a
                    particular type of transaction does not mean that the statutory presumption will
                        <em>ipso facto</em> be rebutted. Indeed, there was
                    something more than a <em>mere</em> established past
                    practice in <em>Re Libra</em>: the court in <em>Re Libra</em> found an established course of dealing where
                    Libra Holdings (the creditor) extended credit to Libra Industries (the company)
                    by paying first the salaries of the employees of Libra Industries and by
                    financing Libra Industries’ purchase of raw materials from third party
                    suppliers. Libra Industries would in turn <em>repay sums
                        owed</em> to Libra Holdings so that the latter could <em>provide new value</em>, by extending further credit to Libra
                    Industries. The practice of repayment of loans had <em>continued
                        with the extension of new credit</em>; see the succinct summary of
                    facts by Kan Tin Chiu J in <em>Re Libra</em> at
                    [46]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[T]hey were payments for moneys owing by Libra Industries to Libra
                        Holdings for, inter alia, sale of the raw materials by Libra Holdings to
                        Libra Industries which raw materials were purchased from third party
                        suppliers pursuant to Libra Industries’ request for salaries paid by
                        Libra Holdings to Libra Industries’ staff. In short, Libra Holdings
                        and Libra Industries maintained a running account whereby payments or
                        purchases on behalf of Libra Industries would be recorded as a debit entry
                        against Libra Industries whilst payments received from or goods purchased
                        from Libra Industries would be credited to Libra Industries …</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Since 1995, Libra Holdings had been providing Libra Industries with
                        financial support or assistance in that it would provide Libra Industries
                        credit or make various payments of Libra Industries’ staff salaries
                        and CPF contributions and purchased the raw materials required by Libra
                        Industries.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a>61     The reasoning in <em>Re
                        Libra</em> is entirely consistent with Goode’s view in <a href="#p1_57">[57]</a> that where the company made repayments of
                    loans with the <em>intention</em> of obtaining new credit
                    to supply its own business operations, these repayments would not be considered
                    as preferential payments.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_62"></a>62     The present case is very different from the
                    scenarios described above. This is not a case where PEPL repaid loans to the
                    respondent, in the expectation that the respondent would provide new credit to
                    PEPL to finance the running of PEPL’s business. If that were the case, it
                    could be argued that PEPL made the payments to the respondent not with the
                    desire to prefer the respondent, but with the genuine intention to obtain new
                    credit required for the running of its business. Here, the respondent’s
                    employees’ salaries were paid by PEPL. This payment of monies was made
                    after technical insolvency had set in. The payments constituted “one way
                    traffic”, in some senses: the respondent did not provide new value nor
                    did they extend new credit throughout the history of PEPL’s payments. As
                    for the respondent’s claim that PEPL’s payments to the respondent on
                    21 February 2005 and 4 March 2005 were based on the past practice of
                        <em>reimbursements</em> to the respondent for iron ore
                    purchases paid by the respondent for and on behalf of PEPL, the
                    respondent’s best case would be that PEPL made the payments not with the
                    desire to prefer, but with the intention to obtain fresh financing for iron ore
                    purchases. However, the respondent did not substantiate this claim with
                    documentary evidence. It could have easily adduced invoices of iron ore
                    purchases that it claimed to have paid for on behalf of PEPL, but failed to do
                    so.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_63"></a>63     As regards the set-off transaction
                    (transaction (c) at <a href="#p1_56">[56]</a> above), it clearly
                    constitutes an unfair preference even without the aid of the statutory
                    presumption. The set-off placed the respondent in a better position in the event
                    of the company’s insolvent liquidation than if the transaction had not
                    been done; the debts that had been set off on 30 June 2005 could not have
                    been set off in PEPL’s insolvent liquidation because of the lack of
                    mutuality. The set-off transaction employed an asset (PEPL’s <em>chose in action</em> against PPL) that could have been
                    distributed to PEPL’s unsecured creditors (PEPL’s claim against PPL
                    for the debt owed) to discharge PEPL’s debt owed to the respondent, thus
                    giving PPL an advantage over the other creditors and at the same time depriving
                    those same creditors of an asset that could have been used for distribution in
                    PEPL’s insolvent liquidation. The only inference to be drawn from the
                    discharge of the debt owed to the respondent, <em>without any
                        extension of new credit to PEPL</em>, would be that PEPL intended to
                    prefer the respondent and PPL.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_64"></a>64     Furthermore, there is no evidence that the
                    respondent had extended new credit to PEPL subsequent to this discharge of
                    PEPL’s indebtedness. It would have been different if <em>the respondent had granted new credit to PEPL subsequent</em> to the
                    discharge of PEPL’s indebtedness so that PEPL could use the new credit to
                    finance its business operations. If that was the position, it could be argued
                    that the discharge was made with the intention to sustain PEPL’s business.
                    In the absence of any evidence to the contrary, the presumption remains
                    unrebutted.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_65"></a>65     In any case, there is no satisfactory
                    objective evidence of an established past practice of similar payments. Although
                    the respondent adduced several debits notes which shows the recorded
                    transactions of payments made by PEPL to the respondent<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_36" id="Ftn_36_1"><sup>[note: 36]</sup></a></span>, these were simple internal documents that
                    could be prepared by simply making repetitive adjustments on a standard template
                    on a computer. The respondent ought to have adduced records of invoices from the
                        <em>respondent</em> itself - this it failed to do. With
                    regard to the set-off transaction effected on 30 June 2005, the respondent
                    adduced the “Schedule of Inter-Company Contra Involving 3
                        Companies”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_37" id="Ftn_37_1"><sup>[note: 37]</sup></a></span> which showed tripartite set-off
                    arrangements made between related companies of the Group for December 2002;
                    June, September and December 2003; and June and December 2004. However, no
                    documents adduced were for the transaction that really mattered, that is, for
                    June 2005. In any event, we have examined the Schedules of those adduced (from
                    2002 to 2004) and it is pertinent to note that there is no evidence of any
                    tripartite set-offs between PEPL, PPL, and the respondent evidenced in these
                    Schedules.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_66"></a>66     We should also point out that as at
                    25 May 2005, when Uni-Sanitary obtained its arbitration award of
                    $628,791.75, PEPL’S directors, despite having two substantial unsatisfied
                    arbitration awards, had no reservations about discharging the remaining
                    “debt” of more than $7.5m to the respondent soon after (see above
                    at <a href="#p1_3">[3]</a>). The debt of $18,514,288 due to the
                    respondent as at 31 December 2004 (see above at <a href="#p1_21">[21]</a>) was completely discharged by the end of June 2005. PEPL,
                    however, did not pay its debts to its largest unrelated creditors. When it was
                    eventually wound up its total debts amounted to $5,861,218.91. Of this, slightly
                    over $1m was due to the respondent. The remaining amount was due to seven
                    unrelated creditors (including Winter Engineering and
                Uni-Sanitary).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_67"></a>67     There is one final argument that we should
                    deal with. The respondent, relying on an observation by the Judge (made without
                    the benefit of hearing arguments), maintained that the set-off effected on
                    30 June 2005 should not be set aside because PPL was not a party to the
                    action. In our view, there is <em>no requirement</em> for
                    PPL to be made a party to these proceedings. As stated clearly in
                        s 99(3)(<em>a</em>) of the Bankruptcy Act, the
                    claim for unfair preferences applies only against <em>creditors</em>:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">For the purposes of this section and sections 100 and
                        102, an individual gives an unfair preference to a person if —</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(<em>a</em>)    that person is
                                one of the individual’s creditors or a surety or guarantor for
                                any of his debts or other liabilities ...</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_68"></a>68     PPL was in the position of a <em>debtor</em> who owed PEPL the sum of $9,027,964.19. There is
                    no claim of unfair preference against PPL. It was for the respondents to make
                    PPL a party if they desired to be indemnified by it.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_69"></a>69     For the reasons given above, we allow the
                    appeal. The payment of $10,987,960.85 made on 4 February 2005 is set aside.
                    In addition, transactions <a href="#p1_56">[56]</a>(a) and
                    (b) above which involved the sums of $347,144.16 and $105,000.00 respectively
                    are set aside. Transaction <a href="#p1_56">[56]</a>(c) is
                    declared void such that the debt of $7,538,243.15 owed by PEPL to the respondent
                    continues to subsist. The full amount involved for the 3rd transaction and the
                    other transactions is $18,987,348.16. However, since the amount of debt owed by
                    PEPL to respondent is the sum of $18,514,287.97, the liquidator’s claim
                    for undue preference of a debt is necessarily limited to that amount
                        only<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_38" id="Ftn_38_1"><sup>[note: 38]</sup></a></span> (this was also reflected in the
                    claim stipulated in Originating Summons No 1433 of 2008<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_39" id="Ftn_39_1"><sup>[note: 39]</sup></a></span>).
                    Accordingly, the respondent is ordered to repay to the liquidators all monies
                    required to settle debts to unrelated creditors (as well as professional fees)
                    up to the sum of $18,514,287.97.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_70"></a>70     The liquidators are entitled to the costs of
                    this appeal and the hearing below on an indemnity basis. In view of the
                    egregious misrepresentations made by Lee Ee to the court to obtain its approval
                    for the capital reduction of the respondent, and the flagrant breaches of the
                    assurances given in the Financial Statements and the Director’s Statement
                    (for which he must take primary responsibility), we order him to personally bear
                    the costs of the proceedings here and below. While we have not made any costs
                    orders against the other directors of the respondent and PEPL, we are
                    constrained to observe that they have clearly not properly discharged their
                    obligations of care and oversight as directors in relying on the actions and
                    decisions of Lee Ee. The troubling sequence of improper fund transfers to
                    related entities and the payment of the dividends (procured through false
                    assurances of solvency) at the expense of legitimate external creditors
                    reflected the lack of proper corporate governance within the Progen
                    Group.</p>
