</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">6 Ms Marisol then filed this originating summons seeking an order under LPA s 120 for taxation of four of the earlier six invoices, namely:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Invoice No. 146421 - $6,730.04</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Invoice No. 148672 - $23,451.86</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Invoice No. 149817 - $12,676.88</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) Invoice No. 151764 - $8,596.38</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">7 In her supporting affidavit she set out the facts from which she sought to prove to the court special circumstances within LPA s 122.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Procedural history</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">8 After hearing counsel, I invited them to file additional written submissions in relation to whether there had been compliance with HEP’s obligation under Legal Profession (Professional Conduct) Rules 2015 r 17(5), and if not whether that amounted to a special circumstance under LPA s 122. Both parties availed themselves of this opportunity.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The parties’ cases  </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">9 Counsel for Ms Marisol made four points in oral argument. First, he contended that she was an unsophisticated client who was also easily confused. She had an anxiety condition which HEP was aware of. Secondly, the fees eventually charged far exceeded the initial estimates which were never properly revised and notified to her. Thirdly, there was great pressure on her to pay the bills, and she genuinely feared that HEP would discharge themselves from acting for her if she did not pay within the 14 days stipulated. He illustrated her fragile state of mind by reference to how she had even sent a screen shot of her “Safe entry” check-in at her bank to show HEP she was making payment of their bill. Fourthly, all the invoices lacked details and particulars.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">10 Counsel for HEP is himself a partner of the law firm. He is mentioned in HEP’s engagement letter as part of the team representing Ms Marisol. He contended that she was not unsophisticated, given that she had a university degree and three decades before had held a managerial position in a hotel in the Philippines, where she had grown up. He also argued that her anxiety was no more than one would expect for anyone going through divorce proceedings. As for the fees charged exceeding the original estimates, he accepted that this was the case and that it would have been better practice to have informed her of revised estimates as the matter progressed. However, he argued that this did not amount to a special circumstance. In relation to itemisation of bills, he accepted that a lump sum bill was presented to Ms Marisol but relied on the established practice that bills may be issued on a lump sum basis without itemisation, unless a request for particulars is made. The cover letters to the invoices did refer to the time costs incurred, and in fact the amounts invoiced were always less than those time costs. As for pressure placed on her to pay, he averred from the Bar that HEP would not have discharged themselves if she had been late in payment. He also asserted that had queries been raised, HEP would have answered them. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">11 In Ms Marisol’s supporting affidavit and in her written submissions, she had also asserted that she did not know what taxation was, and that it was never explained to her by HEP. Consequently she did not know she had a right to have the bills taxed.

</div>
</div>
</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">12 It was because the question of Ms Marisol’s knowledge of her right to tax the bills was not fully addressed by HEP whether in written or oral submissions that I invited parties to address it further.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Issues to be determined </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">13 To determine whether Ms Marisol has proved special circumstances within LPA s 122, I will consider the following:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) whether Ms Marisol knew or ought to have known of her right to tax HEP’s bills;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) if not, whether that amounts to a special circumstance explaining and excusing her paying those bills without invoking or at least reserving her right to taxation.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">14 Before addressing these issues, I will consider and make some observations concerning the professional rules and principles governing the relationship of lawyer and client in relation to fees. I will also consider the engagement letter signed by Ms Marisol.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Relevant professional rules and principles  </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">15   Professional rules governing conduct in relation to fees were enacted in 1998, namely the Legal Profession (Professional Conduct) Rules 1998. They were substantially revised in 2015 (S 706/2015). I shall refer to the 2015 edition as the PCR. As the PCR uses the phrase “legal practitioner” I will adopt this phrase in this section, even though generally in this judgment I use the plain word “lawyer”. The LPA adopts the names “advocate and solicitor”, “advocate” and “solicitor”, the last of which is also used in some judgments concerning the legal profession. I use the name “solicitor” at some points of this judgment as well.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">16       PCR r 4 sets out principles that guide the interpretation of the rules. These include two principles relevant to this matter. By PCR r 4(<span class="font-italic">b</span>), a legal practitioner must fulfil their duty to the client “in a manner that upholds the standing and integrity of the Singapore legal system and the legal profession in Singapore”. By PCR r 4(<span class="font-italic">e</span>) a “legal practitioner must facilitate the access of members of the public to justice”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">17 The establishment of principles to guide the interpretation of rules governing professional conduct was a conscious and judicious step that signalled both the importance of the spirit and intent of professional rules and the necessity that a legal practitioner always keep in mind the higher ideals of their profession. When practitioners focus only on the letter of professional rules they run the risk of developing ethical myopia.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">18 PCR r 17, which governs professional fees and costs, itself starts with the expression of another principle, namely that a “legal practitioner must act in the best interests of his or her client, and must charge the client fairly for work done”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">19 PCR r 17(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) requires that a legal practitioner “must not undertake work in a manner that unnecessarily or improperly increases the costs that are payable to the legal practitioner”. It is common for lawyers to agree hourly rates with their clients; this rule makes clear that time must not be unnecessarily or improperly incurred if charged to the client.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">20 PCR r 17(3) sets out specific duties on the legal practitioner to provide information to the client on a continuing basis. It reads:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(3)  A legal practitioner must —</div><div class="txt-body text-justify">(<span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">a</span>) inform his or her client of the basis on which fees for professional services will be charged, and of the manner in which those fees and disbursements (if any) are to be paid by the client;</div><div class="txt-body text-justify">(<span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">b</span>) inform the client of any other reasonably foreseeable payments that the client may have to make, either to the legal practitioner or to any other party, and of the stages at which those payments are likely to be required;</div><div class="txt-body text-justify">(<span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">c</span>) to the extent reasonably practicable and if requested by the client, provide the client with estimates of the fees and other payments referred to in sub-paragraphs (<span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">a</span>) and (<span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">b</span>), respectively; and</div><div class="txt-body text-justify">(<span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">d</span>) ensure that the actual amounts of the fees and other payments referred to in sub-paragraphs (<span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">a</span>) and (<span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">b</span>), respectively, do not vary substantially from the estimates referred to in sub-paragraph (<span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">c</span>), unless the client has been informed in writing of any changed circumstances.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">21 The wording of PCR r 17(3)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) is a little infelicitous, as it could be read to require a request from the client for an estimate before it can be said that the lawyer must give one. Such a restrictive reading does not fit with the principles that a lawyer must facilitate access to justice and must charge fairly. At a practical level, there can be few if any consumers of services who would not want to know in advance their estimated expense, and the absence of such information undermines consumer choice of service provider. As I do not have to decide whether this rule should be interpreted more broadly for the purpose of this application, I do not reach a final view. What I would observe is that if a lawyer provides an estimate this must be done in a way that is meaningful, and if an estimate is provided it must be matched unless circumstances change and the client is duly notified of the revised estimate under PCR r 17(3)(<span class="font-italic">d</span>).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">22 PCR r 17(5) is important. It obliges the legal practitioner to inform the client of their right to have the bill taxed as follows: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">If a client of a legal practitioner disputes or raises a query about a bill of the legal practitioner in a matter (whether or not contentious), the legal practitioner must inform the client in writing of the client’s right to apply to the court to have the bill taxed or to review any fee agreement, unless the legal practitioner believes that the client knows, or reasonably ought to know, of that right.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">23 </span>Finally, I refer to the provisions in PCR r 26 concerning withdrawal from representing a client. Lawyers are entitled to withdraw from representing a client if their bills are not paid, but this is subject to the obligation contained in PCR r 26(6) that the legal practitioner must nonetheless:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) take reasonable care to avoid foreseeable harm to the client, including, where the circumstances permit —</div><div class="txt-body text-justify">(i) by giving reasonable notice of the withdrawal to the client;</div><div class="txt-body text-justify">(ii) by giving the client a reasonable amount of time to engage another legal practitioner to take over the case or matter; and</div><div class="txt-body text-justify">(iii) by cooperating with the client’s new legal practitioner; …</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 Both the letter and the spirit of the PCR are supported by the mechanism of taxation. This is an arcane word, that few lay clients understand. It refers to the procedure by which the court reviews the bills of lawyers to determine if they are fair and reasonable. Clients have the right to invoke this procedure except in three situations. One situation, not relevant to this matter, is where they have entered into an agreement respecting remuneration within either LPA s 109 (non-contentious business) or s 111 (contentious business). Nonetheless, any such agreement may be cancelled by the court if found to be unfair or unreasonable. Another is where a year has passed since the delivery of an invoice, and the third is where the invoice has been paid. In both such situations however, taxation may be ordered if special circumstances are proved. It is the third situation, and the question of special circumstances, with which this matter is concerned. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 Importantly, the right to have a bill taxed has been held to have statutorily qualified the common law right to defend an action brought by a solicitor on a bill: per the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Koh Kim Teck v Shook Lin &amp; Bok LLP</span> [2021] 1 SLR 596 at [68] and [69]. The Court of Appeal was considering the taxation regime in the context of an appeal by a client who had failed to pay a solicitor’s bills and been served with a statutory demand. In the course of holding that taxation is the exclusive recourse for a client, the court noted that “special circumstances” should not be construed narrowly, making the following comments on LPA s 122:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">66 We also note that the 12-month time limit provided for in s 122 of the LPA is not cast in stone. An order may be made for taxation outside of the specified period if the court finds that there are “special circumstances” to so order. From the client’s perspective, this provides an additional safeguard. As Coomaraswamy J held in <span class="font-italic">Kosui</span> at [61], there is no rigid rule as to what kind of circumstances are sufficiently special to justify taxation of a solicitor’s bill. Where it is apparent that there has been overcharging, this would be a factor militating in favour of granting an order for taxation, even if the s 122 of the LPA time limit has elapsed (see <span class="font-italic">Ho Cheng Lay</span> at [28(b)]). Similarly, if the bills delivered are so lacking in particulars that the client is unable to make an informed decision as to whether to apply for taxation, or if the solicitor did not inform the client of the right to have the bill taxed, the court may lean in favour of ordering taxation, if this is appropriate in all the circumstances.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">67 We add that for the purpose of s 122 of the LPA, the interest of the client is adequately protected if “special circumstances” is not construed narrowly against the client. After all, the provision is not intended to allow or encourage solicitors to take advantage of ignorant or unsuspecting clients.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">HEP’s engagement letter</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26       An engagement letter provides the lawyer with the opportunity to fulfil their duties concerning information about costs. Naturally, when a lawyer takes this opportunity, this serves the subsidiary purpose of protecting them should the client subsequently complain about the lawyer’s fees. However, the tail of protecting the lawyer from unfair complaints must not wag the dog of treating the client fairly. This reversal of priorities, unfortunately, seems to have animated the drafting of HEP’s engagement letter.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27   HEP’s engagement letter appears to be drawn from a standard template used by the law firm. It includes several paragraphs relating to fees. I now make some observations about the more relevant parts of the engagement letter.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 The engagement letter includes a general statement that “legal fees will be based on hourly rates, based on the actual time spent in connection with this matter.”

This is language that seems designed to deter clients from questioning bills before paying them. It also overlooks the obligation under PCR r 26(6) to take reasonable care to avoid foreseeable harm to the client when withdrawing from representing them, including where bills have not been paid. In fact, it could be said to be misleading of what the client’s rights are.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 This is compounded by the language used on the one occasion when taxation is referred to. HEP’s engagement letter said “[n]otwithstanding that you may be able to apply to tax our bill pursuant to the provisions of the Legal Profession Act, you agree that any disputes on our bills shall be resolved by referring such disputes to the Law Society of Singapore for mediation/arbitration under Cost Dispute Resolve.”

</div> about the engagement letter. One would expect the use of the word to be followed immediately with an explanation in plain English, along the lines that taxation is a procedure available to the client by which the court would review the bill to determine whether it is fair and reasonable.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 Secondly, while mediation under the Law Society’s Cost Dispute Resolve scheme should rightly be mentioned and offered to the client, this should be presented only as an option. The Cost Dispute Resolve scheme, while commendable and useful, should be an option mutually decided upon when a dispute about fees arises. A law firm should not ordinarily seek at the time of engagement to replace the client’s right to taxation of bills with an alternative process for dispute resolution. To the extent an engagement letter seeks to replace the right to taxation, this would be subject to the court’s scrutiny for fairness and reasonableness, given the fundamental principles that lawyers must act in the best interests of their clients and charge fairly for work done. HEP did not in these proceedings seek to rely on this clause as an exclusive choice of the Law Society’s Cost Dispute Resolve scheme.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 Thirdly, an important point is missing. The client should be clearly informed that it is possible to pay a bill and reserve the right to have it taxed.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 The short point is this. A client is not expected to engage another law firm to review the engagement letter of the chosen law firm. The client, especially a lay client seeing a lawyer for the first time, is entitled to rely on the lawyer’s duty to act in their best interests. It is a relationship of trust and confidence, and that extends to how fees are estimated and how the client’s rights are explained in the process of entry into the engagement. An engagement letter that fulfils the spirit of the PCR should include a meaningful estimate of fees, the basis on which fees will be charged and a clear explanation of a client’s right to tax bills. </div><div class="mb-3"><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify"> </div></div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Issue 1: Did Ms Marisol know or ought she to have known of her right to taxation?</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39  Ms Marisol said in her supporting affidavit that she did not know of her right to taxation.

</div>
</div> A request for a breakdown is a query about a bill.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 As they had only made a passing reference to taxation in their engagement letter and had never explained this right to her, there was no reason for the lawyers in HEP to believe that Ms Marisol knew or ought to have known of her right to tax the bills. Moreover, HEP’s reply affidavit contains no statement of any such belief. I conclude that HEP did not comply with PCR <br/>r 17(5). I hold that Ms Marisol neither knew nor ought to have known of her right to tax the bills.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Issue 2: Has a special circumstance been proved? </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 The special circumstance must explain and excuse the fact that Ms Marisol paid the bills without reserving her right to tax them (see <span class="font-italic">Kosui Singapore Pte Ltd v Thangavelu</span> [2015] 5 SLR 722 at [63]). That she did not know of her right to tax them is a sufficient excuse. If one does not know of a right, one can hardly be faulted for not exercising it. That the taxation regime is the only way a client may challenge a bill makes it all the more important that a solicitor must clearly and in plain English inform the client of the right of taxation.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45  I therefore accept and hold that Ms Marisol has proved a special circumstance such that, notwithstanding her payment of the bills, she may obtain an order for taxation of those bills.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 I also add that the evidence supports three other special circumstances:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) HEP did not comply with PCR r 17(5);</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Ms Marisol was in an anxious state of mind, and, being concerned about being left in the lurch by HEP should she not pay the bills within the stipulated period of 14 days, paid them in haste; </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) The bills, taken together with their accompanying cover letters, were lacking in particulars, both in terms of the work done to date and in how each bill related to the anticipated overall bill, whether by reference to an original estimate or a revised estimate.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 The last point highlights an important principle. The client upon receipt of a bill should be able to understand clearly whether the original estimate holds. This may require additional explanation in the cover letter. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 Much of HEP’s reply affidavit defends the reasonableness of their fees. That is not a matter for this application. It is a matter to be considered at taxation.    But I do make one observation. Under LPA s 120(3) it is always open to a lawyer to consent to taxation, even when the bill has been paid. With the lawyer’s consent, the registrar may tax the bill without any order for taxation being made. Lawyers facing questions from clients over their bills should not only inform them of the right to taxation, but as a matter of fairness and prudence also offer to have them taxed. Lawyers should take to heart the wise words of Chief Justice Chan Sek Keong in <span class="font-italic">Law Society of Singapore v Andre Ravindran Saravanapavan Arul</span> [2011] 4 SLR 1184 at [33]: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">All solicitors should act on the basis that they can have their bills of costs taxed under the law, and they must remember that many clients do not know this. Accordingly, they have an obligation to inform their clients of this option, and they fail or omit to do so at their peril. A solicitor who offers to have his bill of costs taxed is, in our view, unlikely to have the frame of mind or intention to overcharge his client.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 I make an order for taxation under LPA s 120.
