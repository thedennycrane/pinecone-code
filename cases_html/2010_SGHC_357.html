<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       In this action the plaintiff seeks to set aside
                    and recover payments of US$529,720.31 and US$2,245,429.06 (“the
                    Payment”) made by the plaintiff to the defendant on 22 December 2008
                    on the ground that the Payment constituted an undue preference under s 227T
                    of the Companies Act (Cap 50, 2006 Rev Ed) (“Companies
                    Act”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The plaintiff is an investment holding company
                    with a wholly-owned principal operating subsidiary, Jurong Hi-Tech Industries
                    Pte Ltd (“JHTI”). Most business operations were conducted in the
                    name of JHTI. The defendant granted banking facilities to both JHTI and the
                    plaintiff (collectively referred to as “the Companies”) jointly
                    and severally. The Companies were placed under judicial management by orders of
                    court dated 20 February 2009. Tam Chee Chong (“Tam”) was
                    one of the two persons appointed the joint and several judicial managers of the
                    Companies (“the Judicial Managers”).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Factual background</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       The facts that form the background to this
                    action were largely undisputed and can be briefly stated. The plaintiff procured
                    banking facilities from several banks, including ABN AMRO NV, Bank of
                    Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ (“BTMU”), DBS Bank Ltd (“DBS”),
                    Malayan Banking Berhad (“Maybank”), Oversea-Chinese Banking
                    Corporation Ltd (“OCBC”), RHB Bank Berhad
                    (“RHB”) and United Overseas Bank Ltd (“UOB”). The
                    plaintiff’s facilities with these banks were unsecured, but each bank was
                    given a negative pledge and a <em>pari passu</em>
                    undertaking. As most of the business operations of the Companies were conducted
                    in the name of JHTI, other than BTMU, Maybank and RHB which had granted
                    facilities solely to the plaintiff, all the other banks granted facilities to
                    the Companies jointly and severally.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       Sometime in September 2004, the defendant
                    approached the plaintiff with an offer of credit facilities. Yeo Peck Heng
                    (“Yeo”), a director of the Companies, told the defendant about the
                    plaintiff’s unsecured facilities with other banks as well as the negative
                    pledge and <em>pari passu</em> undertaking that each of the
                    banks had been given. By a letter dated 20 September 2004, the defendant
                    offered credit facilities to the plaintiff on a similar basis, incorporating a
                    negative pledge and a <em>pari passu</em> clause. These
                    original credit facilities were subject to several addenda and revisions issued
                    by the defendant over the years, with the last revision letter issued jointly to
                    the Companies on 22 January 2008.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       Sometime in early 2007, the defendant offered to
                    provide account receivables financing (“AR Financing”) to JHTI.
                    The defendant and JHTI entered into a Master Receivables Purchase Agreement
                    dated 15 February 2007, which was followed by an addendum dated
                    12 November 2007.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       In March 2008, Ms Lin Li Fang
                    (“Ms Lin”) took over as chairperson of the plaintiff’s
                    group of companies (“the Group”). She was concerned about the high
                    debt level of the Group and sought to monetise the assets of the Group to pay
                    down the outstanding bank loans. The directors of the plaintiff, including
                    Ms Lin and Yeo, gave similar presentations to the defendant and each of the
                    other banks separately. During the presentations, they stated that some of the
                    Companies’ assets would be sold to pay down the bank loans. These assets
                    included the Electronic Manufacturing Services (“EMS”) business,
                    shares in MAP Technology Holdings Ltd (“MAP Shares”) and shares in
                    Min Aik Technology Co Ltd (“Min Aik Shares”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       In July 2008, the plaintiff’s general
                    manager, Ang Ah Bah (“Ang”) told Ms Lin that Richard Lee Seow
                    Hong (“Lee”), the relationship manager for the Companies’
                    accounts with the defendant, had told him that the defendant no longer wished to
                    continue the AR Financing arrangement with JHTI. Although Ms Lin was
                    concerned that the defendant might terminate the AR Financing facility and
                    demand immediate repayment, in fact, no action was taken by the defendant. A
                    month later, in August 2008, Ang informed Ms Lin that Lee had told him that
                    the defendant wanted to concentrate on the agricultural sector and cease
                    financing the telecommunications and electronic sectors (which the Companies
                    were involved in). Again, the defendant did not take immediate action and
                    continued to provide financing, including against invoices presented by the
                    Companies.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       Subsequently, at a dinner meeting on
                    22 September 2008, Lee informed Ms Lin that the defendant wished to
                    exit from the non-core markets (<em>ie</em>, the
                    telecommunications and electronics sectors) and that it intended to end its
                    relationship with the Companies in an orderly fashion. Ms Lin then
                    requested that the defendant reduce or cancel the banking facilities gradually
                    and allow the Companies to pay according to the maturity dates of those
                    facilities.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       It bears noting that Ms Lin and Lee have
                    had a long business relationship, having known each other personally since the
                    early 1980s when Lee was working in Overseas Union Bank. After he moved to OCBC,
                    he was tasked to handle the plaintiff’s accounts as OCBC was aware of his
                    good relationship with Ms Lin. When he subsequently joined the defendant,
                    he continued to act as the relationship manager for the Companies’
                    accounts with the defendant. According to Lee, during his tenure with OCBC, he
                    would visit the plaintiff’s office once a week. He intensified the
                    frequency of visits to twice a week when he joined the defendant in order to
                    deepen the relationship, as the defendant was a relatively new banker. He often
                    spoke to Ms Lin during those visits and Ms Lin felt obligated towards
                    the defendant and him as she believed that they were very
                    “supportive” of the Companies.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     Between September and November 2008, the
                    plaintiff faced increasing difficulties paying overdue loans and other
                    facilities and these were left largely unpaid. On 11 September 2008, the
                    defendant requested that the Companies reduce the amount of invoices sent for
                    discounting to avoid exceeding the AR Financing facility’s limit of
                    US$20m. After the limit was reached by the end of September 2008, no
                    further invoices were sent to the defendant for discounting. Besides the
                    defendant, other banks such as ABN AMRO, DBS, KBC, Maybank and UOB were pressing
                    the Companies to repay their overdue loans and other facilities, but the
                    Companies were unable to make payment in full, only making payments in the
                    ordinary course of business from trade receivables or by drawing on credit
                    lines. The Companies then told their bank creditors, including the defendant,
                    that they would pay down their loans and facilities using the proceeds from the
                    sale of the MAP Shares, the Min Aik Shares and the EMS business to the Global
                    Emerging Markets Group (“GEM”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     At around the same time, the Companies’
                    trade creditors were also demanding payment of invoices from the
                    Companies.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     The Companies first defaulted on their
                    facilities with the defendant on 7 October 2008 when they failed to pay
                    over receivables that would have been paid by Motorola Electronics to JHTI on
                    that date. Besides this, JHTI failed to make payment on other amounts, including
                    invoices under the AR Financing facility and trade bills, which had fallen due
                    for payment in early October 2008. When the Companies failed to settle trust
                    receipts which were due on 16 October 2008, the defendant forced-debited
                    JHTI’s current account, causing it to be overdrawn.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     Between October and December 2008, Lee sent
                    e-mail chasers and made telephone calls to the Companies’ directors
                    requesting for payment. He also met with the plaintiff’s representatives
                    at the plaintiff’s premises to discuss repayment of the amounts due to the
                    defendant. According to the defendant, Lee and Ms Lin had reached a verbal
                    agreement on a schedule of repayment that was recorded in a letter dated 13
                    November 2008 from the defendant to the Companies (“the First
                    Letter”). The defendant took the position that the First Letter had
                    purported to cancel the facilities extended to the Companies and had included a
                    formal demand for all amounts due and owing under the various facilities
                    extended to the Companies. Ms Lin’s evidence, however, was that she
                    was not aware of any verbal agreement with Lee. She also did not recall having
                    seen the First Letter, which the Judicial Managers could not find among the
                    books and records of the Companies.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     During one of his telephone calls sometime in
                    November 2008, Lee asked Ms Lin whether the MAP Shares could be placed in
                    an escrow account with the defendant, but Ms Lin told him that this could
                    not be done and that the loans due to the defendant could be repaid instead from
                    the sale proceeds of the Min Aik Shares. Later that month, Lee told Ms Lin
                    that the defendant wanted the Min Aik Shares to be placed in an escrow account
                    with the defendant to ensure that the sale proceeds of those shares would be
                    paid to the defendant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     On 17 November 2008, the defendant issued
                    a letter to JHTI demanding payment of the unpaid receivables under the AR
                    Financing facility.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     On 23 November 2008, Ms Lin signed
                    and issued a letter under which the plaintiff undertook to set up an escrow
                    account with the defendant to hold the Min Aik Shares and credit the sale
                    proceeds of the Min Aik Shares directly to the escrow account. Despite the
                    contents of that letter, no escrow account was opened with the defendant and the
                    Min Aik Shares were not placed in any such escrow account.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     According to the defendant, on
                    25 November 2008, a meeting took place between the Companies’
                    principal representatives (including Ms Lin), Lee, the defendant’s
                    general manager Goh Chong Theng (“Goh”) and the defendant’s
                    chief credit analyst Tan Wah Yam (“Tan”). At that meeting, Goh
                    demanded that the Companies take immediate action to prepare the appropriate
                    documentation to ensure that the proceeds from the sale of the Min Aik Shares be
                    paid to the defendant. While Ms Lin’s evidence in this regard was
                    that she did not recall this meeting on 25 November 2008, the plaintiff is
                    prepared to accept that the meeting did take place as nothing turns on
                    this.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     Around 25 November 2008, the plaintiff
                    instructed Min Aik to source for a buyer for the Min Aik Shares. On
                    27 November 2008, Min Aik informed Ms Lin that the proceeds of sale
                    would be paid to the defendant. In November and December 2008, Lee sent numerous
                    e-mails and made various telephone calls to the Companies’ officers,
                    asking them to sell the Min Aik Shares and remit the proceeds to the
                    defendant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     On 1 December 2008, the Companies
                    appointed KordaMentha Pte Ltd (“KordaMentha”) as financial
                    advisors, primarily to assist the plaintiff with the proposed sale transaction
                    with Global Emerging Markets Group by managing the key stakeholders during the
                    sale period. Additionally, Tam’s evidence was that the appointment of
                    KordaMentha was meant to aid the plaintiff which was in dire financial
                    straits.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     On 9 December 2008, KordaMentha called
                    for a meeting of all the bank creditors of the Companies, at which KordaMentha
                    presented the total amounts owing by the Companies to all their bank creditors.
                    Subsequently, several letters of demand were received. By the end of December
                    2008, the Companies had received letters of demand from the following
                    creditors:</p>

<p class="Judg-1">Apart from these bank creditors,
                    the Companies also received letters of demand from their trade creditors, some
                    of which even commenced legal proceedings for unpaid debts as early as
                    12 December 2008.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     On 18 December 2008 and 7 January
                    2009, the plaintiff sold the Min Aik Shares for a total of US$2,819,093.03,
                    part of which, <em>ie</em>, the Payment, was remitted to
                    the defendant on 22 December 2008 in two tranches. By way of a letter dated
                    26 December 2008, the defendant informed the plaintiff that the Payment had
                    been set off against the moneys due and owing by the plaintiff.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The issues</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     Against that backdrop, the plaintiff seeks to
                    recover the sale proceeds of the Min Aik Shares from the defendant on the ground
                    that the Payment constituted an undue preference under s 227T of the
                    Companies Act. Under that section, a payment made by a company shall be void as
                    against the judicial manager if, being made by a natural person, it would have
                    been void as against the Official Assignee under s 99 (read with
                    ss 100 – 102) of the Bankruptcy Act (Cap 20, 2000 Rev Ed)
                    (“Bankruptcy Act”) as an unfair preference in the event that that
                    natural person became bankrupt.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     Under s 99(3) of the Bankruptcy Act, an
                    unfair preference is given by an individual to a person if:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(<em>a</em>)    that person is one
                            of the individual’s creditors or a surety or guarantor for any of
                            his debts or other liabilities; and</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(<em>b</em>)    the individual does
                            anything or suffers anything to be done which (in either case) has the
                            effect of putting that person into a position which, in the event of the
                            individual’s bankruptcy, will be better than the position he would
                            have been in if that thing had not been done.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Crucially, s 99(4) provides that an order shall not be made
                    under s 99 of the Bankruptcy Act unless the individual who gave the
                    preference was “influenced in deciding to give it by a desire to produce
                    in relation to that person the effect mentioned” in
                        s 99(3)(<em>b</em>).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     The transaction that is being impugned as an
                    unfair preference should have occurred within the period of six months ending on
                    the day of the making of the bankruptcy application (or, in this case, the
                    application for the judicial management order) (see s 100(1)(c)(ii) of the
                    Bankruptcy Act, read with s 227T(2) of the Companies Act). Under
                    s 100(2) of the Bankruptcy Act, the six-month period prior to the day of
                    the application for the judicial management order is not relevant for the
                    purposes of avoiding the transaction as an unfair preference under s 99
                    unless the company:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(<em>a</em>)    is insolvent at that
                            time; or</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(<em>b</em>)    becomes insolvent in
                            consequence of the transaction or preference.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     For the purposes of determining if a company
                    was “insolvent” at the relevant time, the following two tests are
                    provided in s 100(4) of the Bankruptcy Act:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(<em>a</em>)    [it] is unable to
                            pay [its] debts as they fall due [the ‘liquidity test’];
                            or</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(<em>b</em>)    the value of [its]
                            assets is less than the amount of [its] liabilities, taking into account
                            [its] contingent and prospective liabilities [the ‘balance sheet
                            test’].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     In summary, the requirements to be satisfied
                    before the Payment could be avoided as against the Judicial Managers on the
                    ground of unfair preference can be gleaned from the provisions above to be the
                    following:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_26-p2_a"></a>(a)     The Payment was made to the
                        defendant within six months of the date of the application for a judicial
                        management order;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_26-p2_b"></a>(b)     The defendant is a creditor of the plaintiff;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_26-p2_c"></a>(c)     The Payment has the effect of putting
                        the defendant in a position which in the event of the plaintiff’s
                        being placed under judicial management will be better than the position the
                        defendant would have been in if the payment was not made;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_26-p2_d"></a>(d)     In deciding to make the Payment, the
                        plaintiff was influenced by a desire to produce in relation to the defendant
                        the effect mentioned in (c) above; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_26-p2_e"></a>(e)     The plaintiff was either insolvent at the time the
                        Payment was made or became insolvent as a result of making the
                        Payment.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     As it was common ground that the first three
                    requirements were satisfied on the facts, the issues that arise for my
                    consideration are:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_27-p2_a"></a>(a)     Whether in deciding to make the
                        Payment the plaintiff was influenced by a desire to place the defendant in a
                        better position in the event of the former’s placement under judicial
                        management than the latter would have been in if the Payment had not been
                        made; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_27-p2_b"></a>(b)     Whether the plaintiff was insolvent at the time the Payment was made, or
                        had become insolvent as a result of the Payment.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Whether the plaintiff was influenced by a desire to prefer the
                defendant</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     The plaintiff’s case is that it was
                    influenced in deciding to pay the proceeds from the sale of the Min Aik Shares
                    to the defendant by a desire to produce the effect of putting the defendant into
                    a position which in the event of the plaintiff’s insolvency would be
                    better than the position the defendant would have been in if the Payment had not
                    been made.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     The defendant took the position that:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_29-p2_a"></a>(a)     the plaintiff did not possess the
                        requisite state of mind envisaged under the unfair preference regime as the
                        plaintiff did not know that it was actually or imminently insolvent at the
                        material time; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_29-p2_b"></a>(b)     the plaintiff had not proven that it had the requisite desire to
                        improve the defendant’s position in the event of its insolvency.
                        Furthermore, even if the plaintiff did possess the requisite state of mind
                        as to its imminent or actual insolvency, the defendant averred that the
                        desire to prefer was not operative on the plaintiff’s mind in making
                        the decision to make the Payment; rather, the Payment was made in response
                        to the commercial pressure exerted by the defendant on the plaintiff’s
                        management for repayment of its facilities.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     In the English decision of <em>Re MC Bacon Ltd</em> [1990] BCLC 324 (“<em>Re Bacon</em>”), Millett J discussed in
                    detail the changes brought afoot by the enactment of the UK Insolvency Act 1986.
                    In relation to the UK equivalent of our s 99(4) of the Bankruptcy Act,
                    Millett J observed (at 335) that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It is no longer necessary to establish a <em>dominant</em> intention to prefer. It is sufficient that the
                        decision was <em>influenced</em> by the requisite
                        desire. That is the first change. The second is that it is no longer
                        sufficient to establish an <em>intention</em> to
                        prefer. There must be a <em>desire</em> to produce the
                        effect mentioned in the subsection. [emphasis in original]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Since “desire” has been substituted as the relevant
                    test, it is the subjective desire of the company, <em>ie</em>, it positively wished, to improve the creditor’s
                    position in the event of its imminent insolvency that is decisive (see <em>Re Bacon</em> at 335–336).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     There is no need for direct evidence of the
                    requisite desire as such desire can be inferred from the circumstances of the
                    case (see <em>Re Bacon</em> at 336; see also <em>Chee Yoh Chuang and another (as Liquidators of Progen Engineering
                        Pte Ltd (in liquidation) v Progen Holdings Ltd</em>
                    [2010] SGCA 31 at [40]). As the test of “dominant
                    intention to prefer” has been abolished, so long as the desire to prefer
                    was one of the factors which operated on the minds of those who made the
                    decision, the test under s 99(4) would be satisfied (see <em>Re Bacon</em> at 336).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The plaintiff’s knowledge of its actual or imminent
                insolvency</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     The defendant submitted that in order for
                    unfair preference to be made out, it must be shown that the plaintiff must have
                    known of its insolvency or imminent insolvency when deciding to make the
                    Payment. The defendant relied on judicial support for this proposition in
                    Singapore and in England. In <em>Amrae Benchuan Trading Pte
                        Ltd (in liquidation) v Tan Te Teck Gregory</em> [2006]
                    4 SLR(R) 969 (“<em>Amrae
                    Benchuan</em>”), Sundaresh Menon JC held that there was no
                    unfair preference in that case because, <em>inter
                    alia</em>, he did not see (at [56]) “how [he] can find that [the
                    shareholders and directors of the plaintiff] (and the defendant for that matter)
                    knew or expected that the company would inevitably be wound up
                    imminently”. Menon JC was there dealing with an alleged unfair
                    preference given to an associate. Under s 99(5) of the Bankruptcy Act, any
                    unfair preference given to an associate is <em>presumed</em> to have been influenced by the requisite desire, unless
                    the contrary is shown on a balance of probabilities. In <em>Amrae
                        Benchuan</em>, Menon JC was of the view (at [56]) that the lack
                    of knowledge or expectation on the part of the company’s controllers that
                    it would be wound up imminently, coupled with the fact that the impugned
                    transaction had occurred “a little less than two years before a petition
                    for the winding up of the plaintiff was in fact presented”, <em>pointed away from the probability</em> that those making the
                    payment were doing so with the relevant desire. In other words, lack of
                    knowledge of the company’s imminent winding up could be one factor to be
                    considered in deciding whether the statutory presumption has been rebutted. I
                    find nothing in his judgment that makes knowledge of the company’s
                    imminent winding up a <em>requirement</em> to be satisfied
                    in order for an unfair preference to be made out. If, however, that was the
                    intended effect of Menon JC’s judgment, I respectfully
                differ.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     In an English case where the “burden of
                    proof [had] shifted” as a result of the statutory presumption, <em>Re Beacon Leisure Ltd</em> [1992] BCLC 565
                        (“<em>Re Beacon Leisure</em>”),
                    Mr R A K Wright QC (sitting as a deputy judge of the High Court) found (at
                    568) that the necessary desire did not exist or ought not to be inferred,
                    primarily because he accepted the company directors’ denials that they had
                    such a desire. Andrew Chan Chee Yin, <em>Law and Practice of
                        Corporate Insolvency</em> (LexisNexis, 2005) at para
                    [1555]–[1600] cited <em>Re Beacon Leisure</em>
                    as authority for the proposition that “it is possible” to read
                    s 99 of the Bankruptcy Act as requiring the debtor to have some knowledge
                    of its own winding up because in that case, where the director concerned did not
                    know that liquidation was imminent, it was held that there was no desire to
                    prefer on the part of the insolvent company. To my mind, Wright QC in <em>Re Beacon Leisure</em> merely found that the statutory
                    presumption had been rebutted by the directors’ denials, backed by their
                    lack of knowledge of the debtor company’s imminent winding up, that they
                    had the relevant desire. There was no necessity for the learned deputy judge to
                    make a positive finding that the directors knew of their company’s
                    imminent winding up because the requisite desire had been presumed against them.
                    To my mind, both <em>Re Beacon Leisure</em> and
                        <em>Amrae Benchuan</em> (<a href="#p1_32">[32]</a> <em>supra</em>) are examples of how the lack of knowledge
                    of the debtor company’s insolvent state of affairs is one of the factors
                    that should be considered in deciding whether the statutory presumption under
                    s 99(5) has been rebutted, but the converse proposition, that knowledge of
                    the company’s winding up is required before unfair preference is made out,
                    has <em>not</em> been laid down as a rule by the
                    courts.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     Lee Eng Beng, “The Avoidance Provisions
                    of the Bankruptcy Act 1995 and their Application to Companies”
                    [1995] SJLS 597, expressed the view (at p 616) that a literal
                    interpretation of s 99(4) of the Bankruptcy Act would suggest that the
                    deputy judge’s approach in <em>Re Beacon Leisure</em>
                    in assuming that there was no desire to prefer on the part of an insolvent
                    company if the director concerned did not know that liquidation was imminent
                    “is not entirely correct, since the desire to prefer relates to the
                    producing of the effect of a preference and has nothing to do with knowledge of
                    one’s own insolvency”. The article further considered that (at
                    p 616):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Admittedly, it is improbable that one would have a desire to prefer if he
                        is ignorant of his own impoverished condition. On the other hand, it is very
                        possible that a person will have a desire to prefer even if he is not
                        absolutely sure that he is insolvent; it is totally plausible that he may
                        entertain such a desire where he suspects or has reason to believe that his
                        own insolvency is a real possibility. To this extent, therefore, it would
                        appear that the approach in [<em>Re Beacon
                        Leisure</em>] is too lenient.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">I agree with these views.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     It must also be borne in mind that under
                    s 99(1), a transaction will only be considered an unfair preference if it
                    occurred “at the relevant time”. In relation to a company, such
                    relevant time could be as early as two years before the making of the
                    application for a judicial management order (where the creditor is an associate
                    of the debtor company) (see s 100(1)(<em>c</em>) of
                    the Bankruptcy Act read with s 227T of the Companies Act). To my mind, it
                    would not be realistic or practicable, and therefore unlikely to have been the
                    legislature’s intention, to require the judicial manager to show that the
                    controllers of the insolvent company knew at the relevant time (which could even
                    be two years before the application for a judicial management order is even
                    made) that the company was facing imminent liquidation.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     Furthermore, in order for a transaction to be
                    impugned as an unfair preference, not only must it have occurred within the
                    period of two years or six months (under s 100(1)(<em>b</em>) and (<em>c</em>) of the Bankruptcy Act
                    respectively) ending on the day of the making of the application for a judicial
                    management order, but under s 100(2) of the Bankruptcy Act the company must
                    also have been insolvent at the time of the transaction, or became insolvent in
                    consequence of the transaction. Since, for the purposes of unfair preference,
                    a company’s insolvency is judged objectively under the liquidity test
                    or the balance sheet test (see s 100(4) of the Bankruptcy Act), at the time
                    of the impugned transaction, the controllers of the company may not know that
                    its winding up is an inevitable result. However, they may think that its winding
                    up is on the horizon, or a possible result, and decide to give a preference to a
                    creditor. In my judgment, to require the judicial manager to prove that the
                    company’s controllers must have known that the company was insolvent or
                    imminently insolvent at the material time before a transaction can be avoided as
                    an unfair preference would place too onerous a burden on the judicial
                    manager.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     Indeed, the English Court of Appeal in
                        <em>Katz &amp; Ors v McNally &amp; Ors</em>
                    [1999] BCC 291 made it clear (at 296) that it is “not necessary
                    to establish that the directors of the company knew or believed that it was
                    insolvent” in order to prove unfair preference. It is sufficient that the
                    directors were influenced by the desire to put the creditor into a position
                    “which in the event of the company going into insolvent
                    liquidation” would be a better position than if no payment was made. In
                    another English case, <em>Wills and another v Corfe Joinery Ltd
                        (in liq)</em> [1998] 2 BCLC 75, Lloyd J held (at 79)
                    that it is not necessary, in order to show such desire, to demonstrate that the
                    directors knew that the company would go into insolvent liquidation, or when it
                    would do so. Lloyd J’s judgment was cited with approval by Kan Ting
                    Chiu J in <em>Re Libra Industries Pte Ltd (in compulsory
                        liquidation)</em> [1999] 3 SLR(R) 205 at [43].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     This is not to say that the knowledge of the
                    company’s imminent liquidation on the part of its controllers is never
                    relevant in making out unfair preference. Indeed, such knowledge will often be
                    instrumental in proving the relevant desire. In <em>Re Living
                        Images Ltd</em> [1996] BCC 112, Laddie J held
                    (at 128) that the “most likely explanation” for the repayment
                    of moneys to a particular creditor (a personal friend of the company’s
                    chairman) was that the directors “knew that there was a great risk that
                    the company was on the point of going into liquidation and, if it did so, [that
                    creditor] would not be paid”. In <em>Re Agriplant
                        Services Ltd</em> [1997] BCC 842, Jonathan Parker J,
                    having found (at 851) that the director (who had personally guaranteed the
                    company’s indebtedness to a creditor) “knew that an insolvent
                    liquidation was imminent, and he was looking for ways of limiting his
                    liabilities in that event”, held that the requirements for making out
                    unfair preference were satisfied.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     Thus, whereas none of the cases have stated
                    explicitly that the company’s management must have known that it was
                    actually or imminently insolvent at the material time, there are clear judicial
                    pronouncements to the contrary, <em>ie</em>, that there is
                    no necessity to establish that the management knew or believed that the company
                    was insolvent, or even imminently so. It is one thing to say that such knowledge
                    or belief is relevant to proving the requisite desire; it is quite another to
                    say that the judicial manager <em>cannot</em> prove a case
                    of unfair preference without establishing such knowledge or
                belief.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     In any event, it is clear that on the present
                    facts, the directors of the plaintiff must have known that it was facing
                    imminent liquidation by 22 December 2008, the date on which the Payment was
                    made. By that time, it had received letters of demand from KBC, Maybank and
                    ABN AMRO, as well as numerous trade creditors. In fact, some of those demands
                    were made after the 9 December 2008 meeting that KordaMentha had convened
                    with the plaintiff’s creditors to disclose the total amounts owed to those
                    creditors. Those demands were never fully met by the plaintiff. Thus, it could
                    not have escaped the directors’ attention that the plaintiff owed debts to
                    several bank and trade creditors that it could not repay, particularly since,
                    even on the defendant’s evidence, numerous email chasers were being sent
                    and telephone calls were being made by all the various creditors in a bid to
                    procure repayment of their debts.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The plaintiff’s evidence as to its desire to prefer the
                defendant</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     It was Ms Lin’s clear evidence
                    given on behalf of the plaintiff that she had agreed to pay the proceeds of the
                    sale of the Min Aik Shares to the defendant as she had felt that the defendant
                    had been supportive of the Companies. Despite her initial concern that the
                    defendant would terminate the banking facilities extended to the plaintiff and
                    demand immediate repayment, the defendant had continued to finance the Companies
                    and allowed for gradual reduction of the facilities.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     Ms Lin’s subjective view that the
                    defendant had been supportive of the Companies is also objectively borne out by
                    the surrounding circumstances. Despite the Companies’ defaults, the
                    defendant continued to invite the Companies to roll over the term loans and
                    refrained from withdrawing the facilities, even assuring the plaintiff that it
                    would exit the relationship gradually in an orderly and responsible fashion.
                    According to Lee’s evidence on cross-examination, the First Letter was
                    either a “friendly” letter of demand, or even “not a letter
                    of demand”. Even if the defendant had indeed intended it to be a letter
                    of demand, doubts were raised as to whether the plaintiff ever received it.
                    Furthermore, when asked on cross-examination whether the defendant’s
                    conduct could reasonably be viewed as supportive, Lee agreed that it could be so
                    construed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     Not only was it clear that the
                    defendant’s treatment of the plaintiff in the midst of its financial
                    difficulties was less threatening than the treatment by most of its other bank
                    creditors, it was also clear that the plaintiff had treated the defendant more
                    favourably. Even though the Companies had informed all their creditors in
                    various presentations that they would be raising funds to repay or reduce their
                    outstanding loans through the sale of the EMS business, the MAP Shares and the
                    Min Aik Shares, the plaintiff chose to pay the proceeds from the sale of the Min
                    Aik Shares to the defendant alone. This is despite the fact that the other bank
                    creditors were also pressing for repayment from the Companies. In fact, the
                    other bank creditors had served formal letters of demand on the plaintiff,
                    threatening to cancel the facilities forthwith. Moreover, the knowledge that the
                    payment of the sale proceeds of the Min Aik Shares to the defendant would have
                    caused the plaintiff to be in breach of its obligations under the negative
                    pledge and <em>pari passu</em> clauses in the facilities
                    with the other bank creditors did not deter the plaintiff from making the
                    Payment.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     All these indicate that the decision to make
                    the Payment was influenced by the plaintiff’s subjective desire to prefer
                    the defendant in the event of the former’s insolvency by putting the
                    latter in a better position than it would be in if the Payment was not made. The
                    defendant maintained, however, that whatever desire the plaintiff had to prefer
                    the defendant was vitiated by the pressure that it had placed on the plaintiff
                    to repay.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The defendant’s pressure on the plaintiff</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     The defendant relied on the local case of
                        <em>Leun Wah Electric Co (Pte) Ltd (in liquidation) v Sigma
                        Cable Co (Pte) Ltd</em> [2006] 3 SLR(R) 227
                        (“<em>Leun Wah</em>”) as an example
                    of a commentary by a local court on the value of legitimate commercial <em>pressure</em> in the context of unfair preference. <em>Leun Wah</em> was cited in <em>Walter Woon on
                        Company Law</em> (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, Rev 3rd Ed, 2009)
                        (“<em>Walter Woon</em>”) at
                    para 17.172 for the proposition that a transaction is not
                    “likely” to be an unfair preference “in situations where a
                    company makes a payment in response to commercial pressure”. I note,
                    however, that in <em>Leun Wah</em>, Choo Han
                    Teck J held (at [11]) that there was insufficient evidence to form the
                    conclusion that the plaintiff there had any desire to give an unfair preference
                    to the defendant when it agreed to assign a debt to the latter; the plaintiff
                    had seemed to believe that the assignment would “forestall drastic action
                    by the defendant, and thereby gain time for the plaintiff to collect its own
                    debts”. The primary reason for the insufficiency of evidence in that case
                    was that the principal person from the plaintiff in respect of the impugned
                    decision to assign the debt was not called to testify by either party.
                    Thus, Choo J found (at [12]) that without evidence from that principal
                    person, “the element of the plaintiff’s desire, the burden of which
                    lay with the plaintiff, was not proved”. With respect, <em>Leun Wah</em> was not a case where the desire to prefer a creditor
                    was vitiated by commercial pressure exerted by that creditor; there was simply
                    no evidence to support a finding of any such desire.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     That is not to say that commercial pressure
                    will never provide a good defence to a claim of unfair preference. Since Lord
                    Mansfield’s judgment in <em>Thompson and Others, Assignees
                        of Jane Wiseman v Freeman</em> (1786) 99 ER 1026 where his
                    Lordship held (at 1028) that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">A bankrupt when in contemplation of his bankruptcy cannot by his voluntary
                        act favour any one creditor; but if under fear of legal process he gives a
                        preference, it is evidence that he does not it voluntarily</p>
<p class="Judg-1">it has been a principle of English law that preferential transactions
                    entered into because of pressure will not be set aside. In <em>Re
                        Bacon</em>, Millett J found (at 337) that the debtor
                    company’s decision to grant a debenture to its bank creditor had been made
                    as part of the directors’ decision to “continue trading in a
                    genuine belief that the company could be pulled round” and they had
                    “no choice but to accede to the bank’s request for a
                    debenture”. In <em>Re Ledingham-Smith (a bankrupt), ex
                        parte the trustee of the bankrupt v Pannell Kerr Forster (a firm)</em>
                    [1993] BCLC 635, Morritt J held (at 642) that “[i]t may be
                    that pressure does not displace desire in the way that it formerly displaced a
                    dominant intention to prefer but it can certainly affect the question of
                    desire”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     In Andrew R Keay, <em>McPherson’s Law of Company Liquidation</em> (Sweet &amp;
                    Maxwell, 2nd Ed, 2009) (“<em>McPherson’s</em>”), it is explained (at para 11.035)
                    that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The reason why pressure prevents a transfer from being a voidable
                        preference is that a preference predicates an act of free will and pressure
                        negatives free will. It has been held that as long as pressure is genuine
                        and not fraudulent then no transfer can be regarded as a preference. It
                        could be said that if there is pressure then the debtor company, in granting
                        a preference, could not have been influenced by a desire to benefit the
                        creditor.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">This makes it “advantageous for creditors to exert pressure on
                    any of their debtors whose financial state appears to be parlous” (see
                        <em>McPherson’s</em> at para 11.035).
                        <em>McPherson’s</em> further cautioned that (at
                    para 11.035):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">This invites creditors to implement a ‘first in first served’
                        approach and to exert as much pressure so that they are able to grab what
                        they can before liquidation eventuates, and if any payment is challenged
                        they can point to such pressure to justify the payment. ... <em>To permit individual creditors to secure advantages by coercing
                            the insolvent is totally antithetical to the purposes behind the
                            enactment of laws preventing preferences, namely to ensure that there is
                            a collective process involving a pari passu distribution of the
                            company’s assets</em>. [emphasis in original]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">I agree with these observations in <em>McPherson’s</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     Therefore, in my view, there must be a limit
                    to the defence of pressure exerted by creditors. In <em>Insolvency</em> vol 2 (Peter Totty and Gabriel Moss QC ed) (Sweet
                    &amp; Maxwell, Looseleaf Ed, 1986, August 2008 release) at
                    para H4–08, it was suggested that the limit is provided by a
                    reference to commercial purpose. Thus, in circumstances where the directors of a
                    debtor company bow to creditor pressure in order to act in the commercial
                    interests of the company as a viable going concern, <em>ie</em>, for “proper commercial considerations” (see
                        <em>Re Bacon</em> (<a href="#p1_30">[30]</a> <em>supra</em>) at 336 and <em>Re Fairway
                        Magazines Ltd</em>, <em>Fairbairn v Hartigan</em>
                    [1993] BCLC 643 at 649), the requisite desire will not be established.
                    Conversely, if there is no commercial benefit to the company at all in paying
                    any creditor, then the court should be extremely slow to find that pressure from
                    the creditor is a defence to the claim of unfair preference.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     The defendant pointed to the Singapore Court
                    of Appeal decision in <em>Lin Securities Pte v Royal Trust Bank
                        (Asia) Ltd</em> [1994] 3 SLR(R) 899 (“<em>Lin Securities</em>”) as an illustration of the
                    type of commercial pressure exerted by a bank creditor that would negative any
                    desire to prefer on the part of the debtor. It bears noting that <em>Lin Securities</em> was decided under the previous regime of
                    unfair preference where a dominant intention to prefer must be shown. The
                    alleged unfair preference there was in the form of an arrangement between a bank
                    creditor and the debtor company under which shares charged to the bank as
                    security for credit facilities were handed to the bank to be kept in its custody
                    overnight after trading hours. The Court of Appeal took the view (at
                    [27]–[28]) that there was a threat conveyed to the debtor that if it did
                    not agree to the bank’s “request” for the arrangement, the
                    bank would terminate the credit facilities immediately and call for repayment of
                    the amounts owing. Crucially, the Court of Appeal found (at [29]) that the
                    debtor company did what it could “in the circumstances to avoid the knell
                    of their imminent collapse”; as such, the arrangement with the bank
                    allowed the debtor to carry on trading and “at the same time enabled [the
                    debtor] to have the benefit of the facility” from the bank. In the
                    result, it was held that there was no intention on the debtor’s part to
                    prefer the bank creditor. In other words, even though the bank in <em>Lin Securities</em> had exerted pressure on the debtor, the
                    arrangement was entered into so that the company could continue as a going
                    concern, <em>ie</em>, for proper commercial considerations;
                    such an arrangement did not constitute an unfair preference.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     The approach taken by the Hong Kong Court of
                    First Instance in <em>Re Sweetmart Garment Works
                        Ltd</em> [2008] 2 HKLRD 92 (“<em>Re
                        Sweetmart</em>”) is instructive in this regard. In that case,
                    Barma J examined the contemporaneous correspondence between the bank
                    creditor and the debtor company in the months leading up to the grant of the
                    mortgage (<em>ie</em>, the impugned transaction) as well as
                    the evidence of the steps taken by the other creditors of the company around the
                    time when the mortgage was granted. At [18], the learned judge explained
                    that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The former will throw some light on the <b><em>nature of the
                            relationship</em></b> between the Bank and the Company, <b><em>the degree of pressure</em></b> that may have been exerted
                        by the Bank on the Company to improve its position, and the <b><em>advantages</em></b>, if any, to the Company in granting the
                        mortgage. The latter will provide material against which the conduct of the
                        Bank and the Company can be compared, and will also throw light on the
                        financial position of the Company at the relevant time, a matter which, as I
                        explain below, bears on <b><em>whether or not there was good
                            reason for the Company to enter into the mortgage in favour of the
                            Bank</em></b>. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">After comparing the conduct towards the debtor company on the part of
                    the other creditors and that of the bank to which the mortgage was granted,
                    Barma J concluded (at [29]) that the steps taken by the former creditors
                    “were, it is evident, more concrete, more serious, and instituted much
                    more promptly, than those threatened by the Bank”. Moreover, the loan
                    granted by the bank creditor against the security of the mortgage “did
                    not involve fresh credit being given” to the debtor company and it could
                    not be said that the company “benefited in any tangible way from the
                    granting of the security, so as to provide a good reason for the grant of the
                    mortgage” (see [31]). As a result, Barma J held that the debtor
                    company had acted with the requisite desire to prefer that particular bank
                    creditor.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     Reverting to the evidence in the present case,
                    despite the defendant’s attempts to show that it was exerting more
                    pressure on the plaintiff as compared to the other bank creditors, I am
                    satisfied that the pressure purportedly exerted by the defendant was not
                    exceptional, particularly when compared to the pressure exerted by the other
                    bank creditors. As mentioned above at <a href="#p1_43">[43]</a>,
                    Lee testified that the First Letter was merely a “friendly letter of
                    demand”. Moreover, in his personal opinion, the First Letter was not even
                    a letter of demand. The defendant sent another letter dated 17 December
                    2008 (“the Second Letter”) to the plaintiff, stating that unless
                    the plaintiff made payment of sums due and owing to the defendant within five
                    business days, the defendant would not hesitate to pursue all its legal rights
                    against the plaintiff. The Second Letter should be considered in the light of
                    the fact that by 27 November 2008, the plaintiff had given instructions
                    that proceeds from the sale of the Min Aik Shares should be credited to the
                    defendant. Moreover, even though the Second Letter suggested that the defendant
                    would not rollover any of the term loans once they became due and revoked the
                    “alternative payment arrangements” stated in the First Letter, Lee
                    testified that the defendant did in fact allow rollover of the outstanding
                    amounts under the term loan even after the Second Letter.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     Other than requests made in writing, the
                    defendant also made phone calls and visits to the plaintiff’s premises.
                    According to Lee’s evidence on cross-examination, he had always been a
                    regular visitor to the plaintiff’s office, even before he began his
                    employment with the defendant. Indeed, at the beginning of the relationship
                    between the plaintiff and the defendant, prior to the plaintiff’s defaults
                    on the facilities granted by the defendant, Lee visited the plaintiff’s
                    premises twice a week.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     The conduct of the defendant towards the
                    plaintiff stood in stark contrast with that of the other bank creditors:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_53-p2_a"></a>(a)     KBC issued a plain and unambiguous
                        letter of demand to the plaintiff on 7 November 2008, demanding
                        repayment of some $13m in three days, which demand was acknowledged by Lee
                        to constitute “more pressure” than the defendant’s
                        “friendly letter of demand”.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_53-p2_b"></a>(b)     RHB issued a letter on 4 November 2008 to
                        the plaintiff, reducing the facilities extended to the latter and
                        stipulating that repayment should be made in instalments by 28 November
                        2008 and 31 December 2008.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_53-p2_c"></a>(c)     Maybank served a letter of demand on the plaintiff on
                        2 December 2008 calling an event of default and demanding repayment of
                        all outstanding monies by 16 December 2008.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_53-p2_d"></a>(d)     ABN AMRO sent a letter dated
                        18 December 2008 to the Companies notifying them of the occurrence of
                        events of default and requiring them to pay the outstanding monies within
                        two business days.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">In addition, the e-mails from the
                    other bank creditors such as OCBC, Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation and UOB
                    to the Companies as well as the call reports of KBC and RHB indicate these
                    creditors had made telephone calls to and held meetings with the Companies.
                    There is, however, no evidence that representatives of these creditors had made
                    visits to the Companies prior to the latter’s defaults on the banking
                    facilities granted by the creditors.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     The objective evidence, coupled with
                    Ms Lin’s unequivocal evidence that the demands made by the defendant
                    were not any more critical or pressing than those made by the other bank
                    creditors at that time, shows that the pressure exerted by the defendant on the
                    plaintiff was not significantly more considerable than that exerted by the other
                    bank creditors. Indeed, the letters of demand served on the plaintiff before
                    22 December 2008 pressed for more immediate repayment of outstanding
                    moneys. Yet, those other creditors were not paid. Instead, the proceeds from the
                    sale of the Min Aik Shares were paid to the defendant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     It is also clear that the Payment did not
                    confer any commercial benefit on the plaintiff. As the defendant did not grant
                    or disburse any new facilities to the Companies after 25 November 2008, the
                    Payment was not made in exchange for any continuing funding from the defendant
                    so as to keep the plaintiff operating as a going concern. Viewed in the light of
                    the authorities discussed above, the defendant’s stance that the fact that
                    the defendant did not terminate its facilities with the Companies was a good
                    commercial reason for the plaintiff to make the Payment seems distinctly
                    disingenuous, all the more so since the defendant had recognised internally in a
                    credit memorandum dated 26 November 2008 that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It should be noted that the taking of Min Aik shares (and subsequent cash
                        proceeds) even if not pledged may be deemed to be preferred payment if [the
                        plaintiff] enters into liquidation within 6 months. However, this would not
                        have compromised our position vis-à-vis now. As such, since [the plaintiff]
                        is willing to give us the Min Aik shares pending sale, it is proposed that
                            <b><em>we take it for now and deal with the preferential
                            payment issue if needed subsequently</em></b>. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     In my view, the defendant’s position
                    that the Payment was a response to the defendant’s demands and sustained
                    pressure for payment, a way to placate one of its biggest creditors and pre-empt
                    it from taking legal action against the plaintiff so as to prevent an escalation
                    of the matter, is precisely the result that the unfair preference regime should
                    be aimed at avoiding. When a company is facing imminent insolvency, all the
                    creditors that have extended banking facilities on a <em>pari
                        passu</em> basis should be held to that undertaking and not compete to
                    exert the greatest amount of pressure on the debtor company to procure repayment
                    in a bid to circumvent the statutory process of distribution of the
                    company’s assets. In my judgment, therefore, the pressure exerted by the
                    defendant on the plaintiff did not vitiate the plaintiff’s desire to
                    prefer the defendant, which desire had influenced the decision to make the
                    Payment.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Whether the plaintiff was insolvent</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     Section 100(4) of the Bankruptcy Act states
                    that a person shall be “insolvent” for the purposes of
                    s 100(2) if:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(<em>a</em>)    he is unable to pay
                            his debts as they fall due; or</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(<em>b</em>)    the value of his
                            assets is less than the amount of his liabilities, taking into account
                            his contingent and prospective liabilities.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The two limbs of s 100(4) are to be read disjunctively:
                        <em>Velstra Pte Ltd (in compulsory winding up) v Azero
                        Investments SA</em> [2004] SGHC 251 at [89]. So long as one
                    of the tests is satisfied on the facts, the plaintiff can be considered to be
                    insolvent for the purposes of avoiding the Payment as an unfair preference under
                    s 99.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The liquidity test</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a>58     In <em>Leun Wah</em>,
                    Choo J found (at [8]) that the company was insolvent as it was
                    “pressed for payments at the material time from many quarters and had not
                    been able to pay”. There is sufficient evidence on the present facts that
                    from around September 2008 the plaintiff was unable to pay its debts as they
                    fell due. The demands made by the bank creditors in respect of bills,
                    trust receipts, long and short term loans were largely unmet by the
                    plaintiff. No new financing or loans were made available to the plaintiff in the
                    meantime. The fact that the plaintiff was unable to make payment of its debts
                    and overdue loans despite repeated demands from its various creditors indicates
                    clearly that it was cash-flow insolvent.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a>59     Apart from the correspondence between the
                    plaintiff and its bank creditors, another indication of the plaintiff’s
                    cash-flow insolvency was the cash balances of its bank accounts in November and
                    December 2008. The bank statements show that as at 25 November 2008, one of
                    its 15 bank accounts was in overdraft of S$1,499,870.64 while the remaining 14
                    had relatively low balances of S$43,274.28 and US$32,976.58. As at
                    22 December 2008, three of the accounts were in overdraft of S$1,519,949.68
                    and US$18,960.55 while the remaining accounts had relatively low balances of
                    S$53,539.55 and US$5,308.99. These paltry cash balances could hardly have been
                    sufficient to meet the bank creditors’ demands for repayment of millions
                    of dollars outstanding.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a>60     With regard to cash-flow insolvency, the
                    defendant contended, <em>inter alia</em>, that as
                    there were no statutory demands made as at 25 November 2008 (when it was
                    agreed that the Payment would be made) and 22 December 2008 (the date of
                    the Payment), the plaintiff was not cash-flow insolvent at the material time.
                    This contention reveals the defendant’s mistaken conflation between the
                    winding up process and the judicial management process. Under s 254(1) of
                    the Companies Act, the court may order the winding up of a company if, <em>inter alia</em>, the company is “unable to pay its
                    debts”. Under s 254(2), a company shall be deemed to be unable to
                    pay its debts if, <em>inter alia</em>,</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(<em>a</em>)    a creditor by
                            assignment or otherwise to whom the company is indebted in a sum
                            exceeding $10,000 then due has served on the company by leaving at the
                            registered office a demand under his hand or under the hand of his agent
                            thereunto lawfully authorised requiring the company to pay the sum so
                            due, and the company has for 3 weeks thereafter neglected to pay the sum
                            or to secure or compound for it to the reasonable satisfaction of the
                            creditor; ...</p>
<p class="Judg-1">However, s 227C(<em>a</em>) of the
                    Companies Act makes it clear that during the period beginning with the making of
                    an application for a judicial management order and ending with the making of
                    such an order, <em>no order shall be made for the winding up of
                        the company</em>. Indeed, s 227D(1)(<em>b</em>) of the Companies Act states that on the making of a judicial
                    management order, any application for the winding up of the company shall be
                    dismissed. Thus, the winding up of a company is separate and distinct from the
                    making of a judicial management order in respect of the same. In any case,
                    unlike s 254 of the Companies Act, for the purposes of unfair preference
                    the liquidity test under s 100(4)(<em>a</em>) of the
                    Bankruptcy Act measures the company’s insolvency in terms of its inability
                    to pay its debts <em>as they fall due</em>. In <em>Re Cheyne Finance plc</em> [2008] 2 All ER 987
                        (“<em>Re Cheyne</em>”), Briggs J
                    held (at [56]) that the effect of the addition of the words “as they fall
                    due” in s 123(1)(<em>e</em>) of the UK
                    Insolvency Act 1986 (<em>in pari materia</em> with
                        s 100(4)(<em>a</em>) of the Bankruptcy Act) was
                    to:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... replace in the commercial solvency test now in s 123(1)(e), one
                        futurity requirement, namely to include contingent and prospective
                        liabilities, with another more flexible and fact sensitive requirement
                        encapsulated in the new phrase ‘as they fall due’.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">On this view, I am entitled to consider the letters of demand served
                    on the plaintiff <em>after</em> 22 December 2008 as
                    evidence that the plaintiff was unable to pay its debts as they fell due. These
                    include the letters of demand from OCBC and BTMU served on the plaintiff on 26
                    and 29 December 2008 respectively.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a>61     Looking at the evidence in its totality, I am
                    firmly of the view that the plaintiff was cash-flow insolvent when it made the
                    Payment to the defendant.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The balance sheet test</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_62"></a>62     In view of the fact that the test in
                    s 100(4) of the Bankruptcy Act is disjunctive rather than conjunctive and
                    that the plaintiff has failed the liquidity test, it is strictly not necessary
                    for me to look into the balance sheet test. For the sake of completeness I shall
                    nevertheless do so.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_63"></a>63     On the face of the plaintiff’s balance
                    sheets as at 30 September 2008 and 31 December 2008, the plaintiff
                    appeared to be balance-sheet solvent. However, the Judicial Managers were of the
                    view that substantial write-downs should be made to the plaintiff’s
                    investments in subsidiaries and receivables from related companies. This
                    followed their investigation into the financial affairs of the plaintiff where
                    they came across dubious entries in the accounts of the plaintiff. Adjustments
                    to the balance sheet were accordingly made with the approval of the
                    plaintiff’s directors. With these adjustments, it became evident that the
                    plaintiff was balance-sheet <em>insolvent</em> at the time
                    of the Payment.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_64"></a>64     The defendant contended that a retrospective
                    view of the situation should not be adopted to reach the conclusion that the
                    plaintiff was balance-sheet insolvent as that would allow <em>ex
                        post facto</em> analysis to substitute that which the directors of the
                    Companies honestly believed at the time and represented to its creditors. The
                    defendant took the position that the Judicial Managers and the directors of the
                    plaintiff should not have taken into account events that transpired after
                    31 December 2008 in restating the accounts of the plaintiff as at that
                    date. This position is misconceived. In the first place, the balance sheet test,
                    applying s 100(4) of the Bankruptcy Act, is simply whether the value of the
                    plaintiff’s assets as at the balance sheet date was less than the amount
                    of its liabilities, taking into account its contingent and prospective
                    liabilities. The test is an objective one and not subject to the vagaries of the
                    directors’ subjective views at that time, much less their erroneous views
                    as demonstrated by their acceptance of the adjustments recommended by the
                    Judicial Managers.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_65"></a>65     The defendant relied on the Australian case of
                        <em>Lewis (as liquidator of Doran Constructions Pty Ltd (in
                        liq) and Another v Doran and Others</em> [2005] 54 ACSR 410
                        (“<em>Doran</em>”) for the proposition
                    that any solvency assessment must take into account what was known or ought to
                    have been known at the relevant time. The New South Wales Court of Appeal held
                    that the company was not insolvent at the time the impugned transaction was
                    entered into. In his discussion on s 95A of the New South Wales
                    Corporations Law, Giles JA (with whom Hodgson and McColl JJA agreed), held
                    that (at [103]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... Section 95A speaks of objective ability to pay debts as and when they
                        become due and payable, but ability must be determined in the circumstances
                        as they were known or ought to have been known at the relevant time, without
                        intrusion of hindsight. There must of course be ‘consideration ...
                        given to the immediate future’ (<em>Bank of Australasia
                            v Hall</em> (1907) 4 CLR 1514 at 1528; 14 ALR 51 at 54–5 per
                        Griffith CJ), and how far into the future will depend on the
                        circumstances including the nature of the company’s business and, if
                        it is known, of the future liabilities. ...</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_66"></a>66     There are obvious barriers to the application
                    of this passage quoted above from Giles JA’s judgment in <em>Doran</em> to the present facts. First, as adroitly pointed
                    out by Briggs J in <em>Re Cheyne</em> (<a href="#p1_60">[60]</a> <em>supra</em>) at [41], “neither the Australian
                    courts nor legislature have developed a balance sheet test of the type found in
                    s 123(2)” of the UK Insolvency Act 1986 (equivalent to
                        s 100(4)(<em>b</em>) of the Bankruptcy Act). The
                    decision in <em>Doran</em> thus has nothing to do with the
                    balance sheet test for insolvency; Giles JA was construing a provision
                    regarding “ability to pay debts <em>as and when they
                        become due and payable</em>” [emphasis added], <em>ie</em>, the liquidity test for insolvency.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_67"></a>67     Second, the defendant had omitted
                    Giles JA’s qualification immediately following the passage quoted at
                        <a href="#p1_66">[66]</a> above, which I reproduce as
                    follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b><em>Unexpected later</em></b> discovery of a liability,
                        or later quantification of a liability at an unexpected level, may be
                        excluded from consideration <b><em>if the liability was
                            properly unknown or seen in lesser amount at the relevant
                            time</em></b>. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">In other words, later discovery of a liability or later quantification
                    of a liability at an unexpected level <em>may</em> be taken
                    into account if it was <em>not</em> unexpected or if it was
                        <em>not</em> properly unknown or seen in lesser amount
                    at the relevant time. In <em>The Bell Group Ltd (in liq) v
                        Westpac Banking Corporation (No 9)</em> [2008] WASC 239
                        (“<em>The Bell Group</em>”), Owen J
                    adopted Giles JA’s reference to an assessment made “without
                    the intrusion of hindsight”, but elaborated that (at [1115]) “when
                    determining the company’s ability to pay, it must be done according to the
                    circumstances or state of affairs which were known or ‘<em>knowable</em>’ at the time” [emphasis added].
                    Furthermore, Owen J also held (at [1116]) that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... a court can take into account facts available in hindsight (that is,
                        after the determinative date of solvency) if the facts help determine which
                        version of conflicting accounts as to the state of affairs is the more
                        likely. ...</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_68"></a>68     Notwithstanding that the views expressed in
                    the Australian authorities on insolvency were <em>apropos</em> the liquidity test rather than the balance sheet test,
                    even transposing the logic to the balance-sheet test, they do not assist the
                    defendant in showing that the plaintiff was not balance-sheet insolvent. Many of
                    the adjustments to the accounts proposed by the Judicial Managers were based on
                    facts which were “knowable” and thus should not be considered to
                    be “unexpected” so as to be omitted from the factual matrix
                    considered in the assessment of the plaintiff’s balance-sheet solvency.
                    Indeed, based on the post-event facts uncovered by the Judicial Managers, it is
                    clear that the “proffered expectations of the parties ... were not
                    realistic” (<em>per</em> Owen J in <em>The Bell Group</em> at [1117]), as evidenced by the
                    directors’ agreement to the adjustments without any demurrer. The Judicial
                    Managers’ adjustments to the accounts can hardly be described as an
                    instance where hindsight was allowed to intrude.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_69"></a>69     Therefore, I am of the view that the plaintiff
                    was also insolvent on the balance sheet test.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_70"></a>70     For the reasons above, I come to the
                    conclusion that the Payment to the defendant was an undue preference within the
                    meaning of s 227T of the Companies Act and is void as against the Judicial
                    Managers. The defendant shall pay the plaintiff the US$529,720.31 and
                    US$2,245,429.06 that it received under the Payment together with interest
                    thereon (at the applicable fixed deposit rate the defendant was paying its prime
                    customers on or about 22 December 2009) for the period commencing from that date
                    to the date of judgment herein and thereafter at the rate of 5.33% per annum
                    until payment.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_71"></a>71     Costs to the plaintiff shall be taxed unless
                    agreed.</p>
