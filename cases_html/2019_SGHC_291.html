</div>
</div> A judgment was granted on 13 April 2018 (“the Singapore Judgment”), which is the basis of the EJD proceedings at issue in the present appeal before me.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">6 Separately, in July 2017, the respondent made a separate application in Originating Summons No 845 of 2017 (“OS 845”) for injunctive and declaratory relief. A limited anti-suit injunction was granted, preventing the appellant from relying on the Maldivian Judgment. Declarations were also granted that: (a) the Awards are final, valid and binding on the parties; and (b) the appellant’s claim against the respondent in respect of disputes that have arisen out of or in connection with the Management Contract and any consequential proceedings (including appeals) would be in breach of the arbitration agreement contained in the Management Contract. The appellant appealed to the Court of Appeal, which set aside the anti-suit injunction, but upheld the declarations awarded: see <span class="font-italic">Hilton International Manage (Maldives) Pvt Ltd v Sun Travels &amp; Tours Pvt Ltd </span>[2019] 1 SLR 732 (“<span class="font-italic">Sun Travels (CA)</span>”).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">7 In respect of the EJD proceedings, a number of questions in the form of a questionnaire were directed to one Mr Ahmed Siyam Mohamed (“Mr Siyam”), an officer of the appellant, in preparation of the oral examination of Mr Siyam. Objections were taken in respect of some of the questions which can be summarised into two categories: (a) questions relating to assets of corporate entities related to the appellant or Mr Siyam; and (b) questions relating to assets of the appellant located in the Maldives. At a hearing held on 19 February 2019, Assistant Registrar Jacqueline Lee (“AR Lee”) decided that questions falling in category (a) would not be allowed in so far as they did not pertain to assets owned by the appellant available to satisfy the Singapore Judgment. As for category (b), AR Lee found that the respondent was entitled to ask questions concerning the assets of the appellant located in the Maldives. This was notwithstanding the fact that the Awards could not have been enforced in the Maldives at the time. The appellant appealed against this aspect of AR Lee’s decision.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">8 AR Lee found that there was no inconsistency with comity. The result of the EJD proceedings is only that Mr Siyam provides information which might or might not result in the actual execution of the Singapore Judgment. Whether the respondent would ultimately be able to enforce the Awards in the Maldives was a matter to be considered at a later date in light of the fact that the appeal against the Maldivian Judgment was still pending. AR Lee also relied on the Court of Appeal’s decision in <span class="font-italic">PT Bakrie Investindo v Global Distressed Alpha Fund I Ltd Partnership </span>[2013] 4 SLR 1116 (“<span class="font-italic">PT Bakrie</span>”) for the proposition that an EJD order can be obtained even where enforcement of the judgment has been stayed. This was analogous to the present situation as the Maldivian Judgment only indicated that the enforcement of the Awards could not be entertained “for the time being”.

</div> The appellant’s position would allow judgment debtors to frustrate judgments through intentional non-compliance, and lead to additional proceedings whenever a judgment creditor learns about assets of the judgment debtor which might become accessible for execution. The effectiveness of EJD proceedings in Singapore would also be seriously undermined by allowing judgment debtors to hinder or drag out enforcement proceedings by asserting that foreign assets are untouchable. In this particular case, the Singapore courts would have to await the outcome of the appellate process in the Maldives to determine whether the Awards are in fact enforceable.

The words are only enabling: the use of the terms “enforce” and “satisfying” should be taken generally, and questions in EJD proceedings are not limited in any way to assets in jurisdictions where the Singapore judgment in question is enforceable.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 As mentioned above at [22], the phrase in Form 99 relied upon by the appellant was that the application is “[i]n order to enable the plaintiff to decide upon the methods to employ to enforce the said judgment”.  I was of the view that the phrase, far from implying that ultimate enforceability is a requirement, simply relates to the objective of the EJD process: a judgment creditor is of course ultimately concerned about satisfaction of the award given by the court. What is important to note is that Form 99 makes it clear that information obtained in EJD proceedings is meant to assist in enforcement; the purpose of Form 99 is to allow the plaintiff to decide how to obtain satisfaction, and to consider how to enforce the judgment by whatever means possible. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 It followed from the above that the EJD process under O 48 r 1 of the ROC is not constrained by the question whether the Singapore judgment sought to be enforced is in fact recognised in the overseas jurisdiction where the assets or judgment debtor are located. That is, once a Singapore judgment or order for payment is made, the court may order an oral examination be made on any property wheresoever located. The clear objective is thus to allow information to be obtained, with the aim of allowing the plaintiff to determine how to enforce the judgment or order made in her favour. Thus, nothing in O 48 r 1(1) of the ROC or Form 99 leads to the conclusion that recognition or enforceability of the judgment in a foreign jurisdiction should control or limit the extent of the examination.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The purpose of the examination of judgment debtor process</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 I was satisfied that my conclusions on the interpretation of O 48 r 1(1) of the ROC were consonant with the purpose of the EJD process and the Court of Appeal’s decision in <span class="font-italic">PT Bakrie</span>.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 <span class="font-italic">PT Bakrie </span>stands for the proposition that the EJD proceedings do not involve execution, but rather are about information gathering (<span class="font-italic">PT Bakrie</span> at [16]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">It is clear, in our view, that an EJD order is <span class="font-italic">not</span> – <span class="font-italic">in and of itself</span> – a <span class="font-italic">mode of execution</span> of a judgment.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 In <span class="font-italic">IOB</span>, the plaintiff sought to examine the defendant judgment debtor on certain assets located in Japan, a jurisdiction where Singapore judgments were not enforceable. In disallowing the plaintiff judgment creditor from asking questions on the defendant judgment debtor’s Japanese assets, the court reasoned that questions could only be asked in respect of property if that property could be used to satisfy the judgment. Where a judgment would not be enforceable in a particular jurisdiction, questions concerning such property should not be allowed, as was made clear in the following passage from <span class="font-italic">IOB</span>:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… all questions pertaining to assets or property in a country where Singapore has a formal reciprocal enforcement agreement or where a common law action of recognition and enforcement of foreign judgment could be instituted is permissible in an examination under [O 48 of the ROC]. In the case before me, Japan is a country in which Singapore has no reciprocal enforcement agreement with nor does Japan apply the common law.  Unless learned counsel can show that the civil law applied in Japan has a corresponding development for the recognition and enforcement of a foreign judgment as in a common law country, the objection would accordingly be upheld.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span class="font-italic">IOB </span>is authority in support of the appellant’s position that enforceability in the jurisdiction where the assets are located would be a requirement for questioning to be allowed in EJD proceedings. However, that<span style="color: rgba(255,0,0,1)"> </span>case, being the decision of an Assistant Registrar, was not binding on me, though it remained long standing authority referred to in <span class="font-italic">Singapore Civil Procedure 2019: Vol 1 </span>(Chua Lee Ming gen ed) (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 9th Ed, 2019) at para 48/3/6<span class="font-italic">.</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 The respondent argued that the predecessor version of O 48 r 1(1) of the ROC considered in <span class="font-italic">IOB </span>was different. The crucial phrase “[w]hether the judgment debtor has any and, if so, what other property or means of satisfying the judgment or order” has been removed and replaced with the present wording of O 48 r 1(1) of the ROC (see [18] above).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 That was certainly one differentiating factor, which would justify a different result being reached here.  But I was of the view that even if the same words were present in the current version of O 48 r 1(1) of the ROC, the questions should still be permitted. The version of O 48 r 1 of the ROC considered in <span class="font-italic">IOB </span>points to the satisfaction of the judgment or order.<span style="color: rgba(255,0,0,1)"> </span>But I did not think that imposed a requirement that the judgment creditor has to prove that a Singapore judgment was enforceable in every jurisdiction where questions were sought to be asked about a judgment debtor’s assets.<span style="color: rgba(255,0,0,1)"> </span>All that the version of O 48 r 1 considered in <span class="font-italic">IOB</span> would require is that the assets should have some possibility of satisfying the judgment. To my mind, that possibility would still have been made out if information gleaned from the questions sought to be asked in EJD proceedings would point<span style="color: rgba(255,0,0,1)"> </span>the judgment creditor to any property or means of the judgment debtor, including any alternatives available. In other words, the previous iteration of O 48 r 1 of the ROC in <span class="font-italic">IOB</span> did not in any way modify the nature of EJD proceedings as an information gathering exercise. In so far as<span class="font-italic"> IOB </span>decided otherwise, I did not think it was, with respect, correct.<span style="color: rgba(255,0,0,1)"> </span>This conclusion was reinforced by the fact that <span class="font-italic">IOB </span>did not consider the purpose of the EJD process, and was decided before <span class="font-italic">PT </span><span class="font-italic">Bakrie</span>. It did not give sufficient weight therefore to the possibility of the information obtained pointing to other means of enforcement. At the very least, it did not seem to me that <span class="font-italic">IOB </span>would be decided the same way today, even if the wording of O 48 r 1 of the ROC had remained unchanged.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 As for the appellant’s argument that questions about its Maldivian assets would not produce information which may result in the actual enforcement of the Singapore Judgment, this elided the information gathering process with the actual enforcement process; nothing in <span class="font-italic">PT </span><span class="font-italic">Bakrie </span>supports this approach. The EJD process is only about gathering information so that the judgment creditor may determine how enforcement should be pursued. Questions irrelevant to this should certainly be excluded, but it is not irrelevant to determine where assets may be situated, even if the judgment is not enforceable in one jurisdiction. In this day and age, assets can certainly be almost anywhere in the world, and enforcement may be pursued in different <span class="font-italic">fori</span>. Limiting the EJD process as the appellant contended would be far too restrictive. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 The appellant’s approach would also conflate the information gathering process that is the EJD with the actual application for recognition and enforcement abroad, about which the rules here are by necessity largely silent, since the latter is a matter for the foreign court’s laws and rules of procedure.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 It may be argued that the even if the focus of the examination process is information gathering, only information that is pertinent to possible execution should be obtained.  This can perhaps be built upon <span class="font-italic">Pacific Harbor </span>where AR Tan had declined to allow questions on the historical assets (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, those which are not presently available). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 I accepted that the information gathering process could not be so broad as to capture past assets, though there may be some possible connection to the availability of present assets. The respondent here did not make such an argument. It is necessary that the information obtained should not be too remote or divorced from eventual enforcement; the possibility of movement and identification of other assets or funds that may be available, is sufficiently closely connected.<span style="color: rgba(255,0,0,1)"> </span>I did not think that there was anything to be gained by attempting to formulate a precise rule on the limits of questions which can be asked in EJD proceedings in relation to foreign assets: the observations of Reyes J in <span class="font-italic">Bloomsbury International L</span><span class="font-italic">td v Nouvelle Foods (Hong Kong) Ltd </span>[2005] 1 HKC 337 at [75], and cited in <span class="font-italic">Pacific Harbor</span><span class="font-italic">, </span>commend themselves:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">There must be some line beyond which a creditor examining under O 48 may not tread. That line cannot be drawn with precision. It is undesirable fully to articulate its boundaries. That would needlessly constrain the flexibility inherent in O 48.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Comity </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 The appellant argued that it would be against comity if the questions were required to be answered, given the existence of the Maldivian Judgment refusing enforcement of the Awards in the Maldives. The proceedings there were far advanced owing to the respondent’s failure to enforce the Awards in Singapore and pursue the questions in EJD proceedings promptly.

The appellant seemed to rely on the Court of Appeal’s endorsement of the remarks in <span class="font-italic">Eco</span><span class="font-italic">bank </span>to argue that comity was threatened as a result of the pursuit of the EJD proceedings to belatedly enforce a Singapore judgment based on the Awards, the enforcement of which had been refused by the Maldivian courts.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 But these arguments on comity failed simply because comity was not threatened: the EJD proceedings only concerned the gathering of information, and did not by themselves constitute enforcement of the Singapore Judgment. It was hard to see how any impact could be felt in the Maldivian Action that would amount to interference or a disregard for the orders of the Maldivian court within its territory, whether or not any delay has been caused. The present proceedings and orders, did not clash at all with the Maldivian refusal to enforce the Awards.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Miscellaneous matters</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 There was some argument about whether there was a possibility that the Singapore Judgment could be enforced in the Maldives.
