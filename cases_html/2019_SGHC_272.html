How do such principles apply when a court is faced with the task of sentencing an accused person who was ailing under a previously undiagnosed mental condition, which significantly affected his ability to appreciate the serious harm that his rash act would cause? Where do the scales of justice lie in such a case?</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 In this judgment, I set out my reasons for sentencing the accused person to an imprisonment term of one year for having driven against the flow of traffic while afflicted by acute psychosis, which caused the tragic death of an innocent road-user and serious injury to four others.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Facts</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">3 The facts of this case are perplexing and troubling. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The accused person far exceeded his intended destination, driving into the motorcycle lane of Tuas Checkpoint</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">4 The accused person is 56 years old and the sole proprietor of a small business in the colour printing industry. On a fateful Monday in December 2016 at about 7.25am, the accused person and his son left their residence at Hougang and boarded the accused person’s car. It was his son’s first day of work, and the accused person intended to send him to his workplace at the Central Manpower Base, Depot Road.

After he had passed Exit 10 (Braddell Road), his son asked him why he did not exit the CTE, as he could avoid having to incur the Electronic Road Pricing (“ERP”) charges. He replied, “[d]o not be afraid, I know the way.” He thus continued driving on the CTE at a speed of approximately 80 to 90 km/h, and abided by the road traffic rules.

However, he did not do so. Instead, he continued onto the AYE, where he started to increase his driving speed to approximately 100 km/h, making lane changes in the process so as to maintain his speed amidst moderate traffic. He deliberately slowed his car as he approached and passed a fixed speed camera located somewhere after Exit 8 (North Buona Vista Road) of the AYE.

While on the Viaduct, he depressed his brakes once in response to oncoming traffic, and continued driving against the flow of traffic on lane 2.

In summary, the Prosecution has argued for an approach where the court first considers the accused person’s culpability detached from the reality of his mental condition. On the other hand, the Defence submits that his mental condition was intricately interwoven with his culpability, such that it has to be considered in tandem with the culpability-increasing factors. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 In my judgment, the <span class="font-italic">Ganesan </span>framework is the inappropriate starting point when dealing with an offender operating under a mental condition who causes a fatal accident by a rash act. Indeed, in <span class="font-italic">Ganesan </span>at [57], See Kee Oon J made clear that the presumptive sentencing ranges are “<span class="font-italic">merely starting points which seek to guide the exercise of sentencing discretion. They are not rigid and immutable anchors</span>” [emphasis added]. See J clearly envisaged that exceptional cases, such as the present, would require a consideration of other factors that were not raised previously. Hence, in the same paragraph, it was observed that “[t]he highly fact-specific nature of traffic offences (including fatal accident cases under s 304A(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the PC) means that sentencing, being ultimately a matter of discretion, must be approached judiciously with the highest level of attention to the facts and circumstances of each case”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 Instead, the starting inquiry in sentencing an offender with a mental disorder ought to be whether the deterrent, retributive and protective principles of sentencing prevail over the principle of rehabilitation. In the Court of Appeal’s decision in <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v Kong Peng Yee</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>[2018] 2 SLR 295 (“<span class="font-italic">Kong Peng Yee</span>”), the court recognised that the following principles are relevant in sentencing an offender with a mental disorder falling short of unsoundness of mind (<span class="font-italic">Kong Peng Yee </span>at [59], citing <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v Chong Hou En </span>[2015] 3 SLR 222 at [24] with approval):</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The existence of a mental disorder on the part of the offender is always a relevant factor in the sentencing process.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The manner and extent of its relevance depend on the circumstances of each case, in particular, the nature and severity of the mental disorder.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) The element of general deterrence may still be accorded full weight in some circumstances, such as where the mental disorder is not serious or is not causally related to the commission of the offence, and the offence is a serious one.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) In spite of the existence of a mental disorder on the part of the accused person, specific deterrence may remain relevant in instances where the offence is premeditated or where there is a conscious choice to commit the offence.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) If the serious psychiatric condition or mental disorder renders deterrence less effective, where for instance the offender has a significantly impaired ability to appreciate the nature and quality of his actions, then rehabilitation may take precedence.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(f) Even though rehabilitation may be a relevant consideration, it does not necessarily dictate a light sentence. The accused person could also be rehabilitated in prison. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(g) Finally, in cases involving particularly heinous or serious offences, even when the accused person is labouring under a serious mental disorder, there is no reason why the retributive and protective principles of sentencing should not prevail over the principle of rehabilitation.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 The four sentencing principles have been recognised as underlying the exercise of sentencing: <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v Law Aik Meng </span>[2007] 2 SLR(R) 814 at [17] and <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v Hue An Li </span>[2014] 4 SLR 661 (“<span class="font-italic">Hue An </span><span class="font-italic">Li</span>”) at [73].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 I will therefore consider the applicability of each of the respective sentencing principles. The appropriate balance to be struck between these sentencing considerations will then be helpful in determining the sentence in this case. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 This approach, in my judgment, is preferable to applying the <span class="font-italic">Ganesan </span>framework, and calibrating a sentencing discount (as the Prosecution submits) or applying a broad-based but unascertained measure of discount to each culpability-increasing factor (as the Defence submits). There are three intertwined reasons for this:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) First, the <span class="font-italic">Ganesan </span>framework does not appear to envisage a situation of an offender who causes a victim’s death by his rash act while afflicted by a mental condition which significantly impairs his ability to appreciate the risk of his actions. As the Defence has submitted, the first stage of the <span class="font-italic">Ganesan </span>framework seems to focus solely on culpability-<span class="font-italic">increasing </span>factors.

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> Hence, at [58] of <span class="font-italic">Ganesan</span>, it is observed that “Category 1 would cover cases where … <span class="font-italic">[c]ulpability</span><span class="font-italic"> increasing factors</span> would either be absent altogether or present only to a very limited extent” [emphasis added]. Similarly, “Category 2 would cover cases where an accused’s culpability is moderate. Cases falling within this category would usually involve <span class="font-italic">culpability</span><span class="font-italic"> increasing factors</span>” [emphasis added] (<span class="font-italic">Ganesan </span>at [61]). This being the case, it may be that the accused person’s mental condition ought to be considered only at the second stage, as a mitigating factor personal to him.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Second, and flowing from the first point, if the accused person’s mental condition can only be considered at the second stage, the court is left with the unenviable task of applying a broad-brush approach to reach a sentencing discount. Such a discount, in cases of mentally disordered offenders, may be significant in comparison with the starting imprisonment sentence recommended by the <span class="font-italic">Ganesan</span> categories. This is in substance the Prosecution’s approach in this case; they submit that a two-year sentencing discount ought to be given, in effect halving the recommended starting sentence of 4.5 years that the Prosecution itself sought. But there is little to justify why a <span class="font-italic">two</span>-year discount, in particular, is appropriate. Indeed, it may equally be argued that given the significant impairment to the accused person’s judgment, a three-year sentencing discount is more appropriate. The result of such a “bulk-discount” approach is to promote an arbitrary and unprincipled approach towards the sentencing of offenders afflicted by a mental condition.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Third, the culpability-centric methodology adopted in <span class="font-italic">Ganesan </span>does not lend itself easily to application in cases of traffic offences that differ significantly from the ordinary cases analysed in <span class="font-italic">Ganesan </span>itself. As expressed in <span class="font-italic">Kong Peng Yee </span>at [59], when faced with a mentally disordered offender, the court must be alive to the appropriate balance to be struck between the four sentencing principles. However, the overt focus on the <span class="font-italic">culpability </span>of the offender under the <span class="font-italic">Ganesan </span>framework does not allow the court to conduct such a balancing exercise. As expressed in <span class="font-italic">Hue An Li </span>at [73], while the blameworthiness (or culpability) of an offender is a relevant factor, </div><div class="txt-body text-justify">… [t]he law does take into account considerations that go beyond moral assessment. … In particular, general deterrence, prevention and rehabilitation do not quite equate with a moral assessment of the offender. General deterrence has less to do with the moral condemnation of individual offenders, and more to do with advancing the public interest of reducing crime by deterring the general public from similarly offending. Prevention is concerned with incapacitating offenders who pose a danger to society at large. Rehabilitation, where it is a dominant consideration, is aimed at turning offenders away from a life of crime by altering their values.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Sentencing principles</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Deterrence is of limited weight </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 Turning to the sentencing principles, I first consider the applicability of both general and specific deterrence in this case.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">General deterrence</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 As summarised by See J in <span class="font-italic">GCX v Public Prosecutor </span>[2019] 3 SLR 1325 (“<span class="font-italic">GCX</span>”) at [53]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">General deterrence may have a lesser role to play where the offender has a mental illness before and during the commission of an offence, and this is particularly so if a causal relationship exists between the mental disorder and the commission of the offence: <span class="font-italic">Kong Peng Yee</span> … at [69]; see also <span class="font-italic">Ng So Kuen Connie v PP </span>[2003] 3 SLR(R) 178 (“<span class="font-italic">Connie Ng</span>”) at [58] and <span class="font-italic">Lim Ghim Peow</span> [[2014] 4 SLR 1287 (“<span class="font-italic">Lim Ghim Peow</span>”)] at [28]. As Chao Hick Tin JA explained in <span class="font-italic">Soh Meiyun v PP</span> [2014] 3 SLR 299 (“<span class="font-italic">Soh </span><span class="font-italic">Meiyun</span>”) at [43], this is because general deterrence assumes persons of ordinary emotions, motivations, and impulses who are able to appreciate the nature and consequences of their actions, and who behave with ordinary rationality and for whom the threat of punishment would be a disincentive to engage in criminal conduct.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 The case of <span class="font-italic">Connie Ng</span>, cited by See J in the above passage, demonstrates<span class="font-italic"> </span>the decreased significance of general deterrence as a sentencing consideration for offenders suffering from mental illness during the commission of an offence. There, the appellant claimed trial to a charge of throwing 25 items, including one dumbbell weighing 3lb from her apartment on the seventh floor of a condominium block. It transpired that the appellant was suffering from hypomania at the time of the incident. The trial judge sentenced the appellant to two months’ imprisonment. On appeal, Yong Pung How CJ held that “considerably less weight” should be given to the element of general deterrence where there is a causal link between the offender’s mental state and the acts that culminated in the offence (<span class="font-italic">Connie Ng </span>at [58]). Furthermore, the psychiatrist for the Prosecution had opined that the appellant was “unlikely to commit the same acts again if she continues treatment and follow-up” and that the appellant’s mental condition could worsen if she were imprisoned. In the unique circumstances, Yong CJ considered that the imprisonment sentence was manifestly excessive. He thus imposed the maximum fine of $250 in lieu of the usual custodial tariff of imprisonment.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 In this case, Dr Goh’s uncontroverted and reasoned opinion is that the accused person’s acute psychosis at the time of the offence had significantly impaired his judgment, causing him to discount the risks associated with his actions.

</div> Hence, even if his acute psychosis was not the “but for” cause of the commission of the offence, a causal relationship is plainly borne out on the facts. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 Furthermore, “general deterrence is directed at educating and deterring other like-minded members of the general public by making an example of the particular offender” (<span class="font-italic">Lim Ghim </span><span class="font-italic">Peow</span> at [36]). Given the very low incidence of road traffic accidents that are linked to a mental condition, little public interest is advanced by adopting excessive measures to restrain this very limited class of persons from offending: see <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v </span><span class="font-italic">Goh Lee Yin and another appeal </span>[2008] 1 SLR(R) 824 (“<span class="font-italic">Goh Lee Yin</span>”)<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [93]. Such persons may not even be deterred from re-offending if, like the accused person in this case, the onset of the mental condition was unforeseeable. The circumstances would of course differ if the offender in question had skipped his medical treatment plan persistently, such that the onset of the mental condition was self-induced (see <span class="font-italic">Goh Lee Yin </span>at [95]). This is not the case here. The accused person had not consulted a psychiatrist, nor did he know of his susceptibility to psychosis, prior to the offence.

The Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Lim Ghim Peow </span>held at [36] that “the sentencing principle of <span class="font-italic">specific </span>deterrence <span class="font-italic">may </span>be of limited application in cases involving mentally disordered offenders” as the principle </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">is premised on the assumption that the offender can balance and weigh consequences before committing an offence … The aim of specific deterrence is to deter the particular offender concerned from committing any further offence.

There is no evidence to suggest that his rash act was premeditated or formulated out of conscious choice, in response to his feelings of jealousy, envy, hatred or anger (see <span class="font-italic">Kong Peng Yee </span>at [67]). Instead, like the offender in <span class="font-italic">Kong Peng Yee</span>, who stabbed and killed his own wife in a psychotic episode (<span class="font-italic">Kong Peng Yee </span>at [66]), the accused person’s acute psychosis in this case severely impaired his ability to make reasoned decisions.

As explained in <span class="font-italic">Kong Peng Yee </span>at [72], “[s]pecific deterrence is premised on the assumption that the offender can weigh consequences before committing an offence”. The accused person here plainly could not do so.

Where an offender commits a particularly heinous or serious offence, “it would surely not be correct to say that such an offender ought to be rehabilitated to the exclusion of other public interests”: <span class="font-italic">Goh Lee Yin </span>at [107]. In such cases, the retributive principle may feature prominently; in particular, “if the offender’s mental disorder did not seriously impair his capacity to appreciate the nature and gravity of his actions”: <span class="font-italic">Lim Ghim Peow </span>at [39]. The protection of the public from such “dangerous” offenders may also be relevant, notwithstanding the fact that the offender was mentally disordered during the commission of the offence: <span class="font-italic">Goh Lee Yin </span>at [108]; <span class="font-italic">Lim Ghim Peow </span>at [39].

Underlying the principle is that the punishment must be proportionate to the degree of harm occasioned by the offender’s conduct, and his culpability in committing the offence: <span class="font-italic">Kong Peng Yee </span>at [73]. However, even when the harm caused is very severe, the accused person’s culpability may be attenuated if the offence in question was the work of a disordered mind: <span class="font-italic">Kong Peng Yee </span>at [75] and <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v ASR </span>[2019] 1 SLR 941 (“<span class="font-italic">ASR</span>”) at [72] and [107].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 In <span class="font-italic">Ng Hai Chong Brandon v Public Prosecutor </span>[2019] SGHC 107 (“<span class="font-italic">Brandon Ng</span>”), the offender pleaded guilty to a charge under s 64(1) of the Road Traffic Act (Cap 276, 2004 Rev Ed), for driving against the flow of traffic along the AYE from 1.26am to 1.28am, traversing about 2km at an average speed of 50km/h. Although traffic flow at the time was moderate, no one was hurt. However, the drivers of at least four other vehicles had to take evasive action. The offender had driven under the influence of alcohol at the material time, and the psychiatrist assessed him to have suffered from major depressive disorder (“MDD”) at the time of offence. He further opined that the MDD was a contributory link to the offender’s behaviour. Moreover, as the offender’s psychiatric condition was treatable, he recommended a 24-month Mandatory Treatment Order (“MTO”). Aedit Abdullah J considered that a 24-month MTO was appropriate on the facts of the case, where rehabilitation was the dominant sentencing principle. However, the learned judge noted at [22] that, had the offender caused injury or damage, “deterrence and retribution would have overridden the principle of rehabilitation as to render an MTO inappropriate”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 <span class="font-italic">Brandon Ng </span>thus demonstrates that, in offences relating to road traffic incidents committed by an offender with a mental condition, the <span class="font-italic">harm </span>caused by the offender’s conduct is relevant in determining the weight to be given to the principle of retribution. Hence, while the culpability of the offender in <span class="font-italic">Brandon Ng</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>was reduced because of his MDD, it did not necessarily make the retributive principle insignificant, since retribution entails the consideration of the twin conceptions of harm <span class="font-italic">and </span>culpability (see <span class="font-italic">Kong Peng Yee </span>at [73]). It was only because no harm was caused, together with the offender’s reduced culpability due to MDD, that the learned Judge held that the principles of deterrence and retribution did not outweigh the principle of rehabilitation and that an MTO was appropriate (<span class="font-italic">Brandon Ng </span>at [39]–[42]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 As Sundaresh Menon CJ observed in <span class="font-italic">Stansilas Fabian Kester v Public Prosecutor </span>[2017] 5 SLR 755 (“<span class="font-italic">Stansilas</span>”) at [97], albeit in the context of a drunk driving offence, where hurt and injury result, the court must attribute necessary weight to the retributive principle. In so doing, the court may have regard to the degree of <span class="font-italic">actual</span> and <span class="font-italic">potential</span> harm caused. The extent of the harm caused, or the outcome of the offender’s conduct, is relevant because there is an “intuitive moral sense that outcomes do matter” (<span class="font-italic">Hue An Li </span>at [70]). As such, even in the context of causing death by a negligent act, the court must factor in the extent of harm caused, although such a factor is not determinative of the sentence meted out (<span class="font-italic">Hue An Li </span>at [76]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 In this case, while the accused person’s culpability is reduced, because his judgment was impaired by his acute psychosis, I have to give sufficient weight to the principle of retribution because of the extensive harm caused by him. In <span class="font-italic">Ganesan</span>, See J considered that while the harm caused by a s 304A(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) PC offence is, by definition, the death of a victim, there will be cases where the harm caused by the offence is exceptional, such as where more than one death is caused (<span class="font-italic">Ganesan </span>at [54] and [56]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">71 In my view, the harm caused in this case was plainly exceptional.

While the insurers may be obliged to cover the costs flowing from the collisions, it remains that property damage was caused, and this must be a relevant consideration in considering the extent of harm caused by the accused person. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">73 It was also observed in <span class="font-italic">Stansilas </span>at [97] that <span class="font-italic">potential harm </span>may be considered in determining the appropriate weight to be given to the retributive principle. If not for the evasive actions of other road-users on that fateful morning, they could have suffered serious injuries. Prior to entering the AYE, the accused person had driven against the traffic on the motorcycle lane of the Tuas Checkpoint. It was largely fortuitous that the motorcycles were able to take evasive action against the accused person’s oncoming car, such that more severe and extensive harm was not caused. It was also fortunate that V3 and V4, who were flung off V3’s scooter upon being hit by the accused person’s car, did not suffer more severe injuries or meet with a further accident with oncoming vehicles on the AYE while they were lying on the ground following the collision. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">74 In totality, I am therefore satisfied that the extensive and severe harm caused as well as the potential harm caused by the accused person’s rash act were sufficiently exceptional such that, notwithstanding that his culpability was reduced by his mental condition, the principle of retribution is of significant weight and importance.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Prevention</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">75 The principle of prevention, which entails the protection and safety of the public through the incapacitation of dangerous or persistent offenders, may also be a relevant consideration (<span class="font-italic">Stansilas </span>at [98]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">76 However, I note that in this case, the danger posed by the accused person would likely only materialise if his acute psychosis were to relapse. In this regard, Dr Goh has noted that the accused person has complied with his psychiatric treatment, and has consulted a psychiatrist in private practice. In his opinion, the accused person appears to have the requisite insight into his mental condition and his need for treatment. His symptoms of acute psychosis appeared to have resolved within a short period. Thus, while continued psychiatric treatment was recommended, Dr Goh reported that he did not anticipate any risk factor(s) that pointed towards the need for a significant period of rehabilitation.

</div>
</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">77 Given the accused person’s acknowledgment of his mental condition, as well as his compliance with treatment, I find that the danger posed by the accused person is minimal, such that the principle of prevention has limited relevance in the context of sentencing him. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">78 In this regard, I note that in <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v </span><span class="font-italic">Chee Cheong Hin Constance </span>[2006] 2 SLR(R) 707 (“<span class="font-italic">Constance Chee</span>”)<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [16], it was observed that an indeterminate prison term ought to be avoided “when addressing offenders with an unstable medical or mental condition <span class="font-italic">if </span>there is a reasonable basis for concluding that the offender’s medical condition could stabilise and/or that the propensity for violence would sufficiently and satisfactorily recede after medical treatment and continuing supervision” [emphasis in original]. This is precisely the case here, as made clearer by the fact that the Prosecution has not submitted that prolonged incarceration is necessary to prevent the accused person from posing a threat to the general public. It thus appears to be accepted that the accused person’s mental condition will remain stable, according to Dr Goh’s professional opinion, so long as he remains compliant with his psychiatric treatment.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Balancing the sentencing principles</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">79 From the above, the key sentencing principle is that of retribution, given the exceptional harm caused by the accused person. The other sentencing principles of deterrence and prevention are less relevant. The issue is thus whether, notwithstanding the weight to be given to the retributive principle of sentencing, rehabilitation ought to be the dominant sentencing principle.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">80 In determining whether rehabilitation ought to take precedence, the court must balance the sentencing principles at play. In so doing, the court should not focus solely on the offender’s prospects for rehabilitation. The assessment of an offender’s rehabilitative potential is a relative and comparative exercise: <span class="font-italic">GCX </span>at [33].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">81 The authorities show that the balance to be struck in a case where severe harm is caused is a difficult one which varies depending on the facts of the case. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(1)  <span class="font-italic">ASR</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">82 To determine the right balance to be struck, I consider first the Court of Appeal’s recent decision in <span class="font-italic">ASR</span>. In that case, a 14 year-old male offender with an IQ of 61 and a mental age of between eight and ten raped a 16 year-old female victim. He also inserted his finger and a blunt object into her vagina. When he turned 16, he pleaded guilty to one count of aggravated rape and two counts of sexual assault by penetration, and consented to six other charges taken into consideration for sentencing purposes. The High Court sentenced him to reformative training. The Prosecution appealed, arguing that the appropriate sentence ought to be between 15 and 18 years’ imprisonment, with at least 15 strokes of the cane.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">83 In dismissing the Prosecution’s appeal, the Court of Appeal applied the two-step approach laid down in <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v Mohammad Al-Ansari bin Basri </span>[2008] 1 SLR(R) 449 (“<span class="font-italic">Al-</span><span class="font-italic">Ansari</span>”). Under the <span class="font-italic">Al</span><span class="font-italic">-Ansari </span>approach, rehabilitation is the dominant sentencing consideration for young offenders. However, rehabilitation may be displaced by other sentencing objectives in an appropriate case. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">84 Considering first the objectives of deterrence, the court considered that the offender’s state of mind, where he had difficulty in managing his impulses and controlling his actions due to his intellectual disability, meant that he was unsuitable to be used as a medium to deter others from offending. His inability to appreciate the full significance of his acts also made it difficult to ascribe any weight to specific deterrence (<span class="font-italic">ASR </span>at [119]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">85 Turning to the sentencing objective of prevention through incapacitation, the Prosecution submitted that given the offender’s slowness to reform due to his intellectual disability, a long period of incarceration was required for the protection of the public (<span class="font-italic">ASR </span>at [120]). The court rejected this, as rehabilitation is, as a matter of principle, the dominant sentencing consideration for a young offender like the offender in <span class="font-italic">ASR</span>. By framing the issue as it did, the Prosecution had failed to explain how the existence of the “risk” posed by the offender justified incapacitation over rehabilitation as the appropriate crime prevention objective (<span class="font-italic">ASR </span>at [121]). Furthermore, the proposed imprisonment sentence by the Prosecution was disproportionate, as it was based on sentencing frameworks that were not promulgated with offenders like the offender in mind (<span class="font-italic">ASR </span>at [149]). The Prosecution’s position had also failed to consider the offender’s intellectual disability, which substantially reduced his culpability (<span class="font-italic">ASR </span>at [148]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">86 As for retribution, while it was relevant as “an abiding consideration in sentencing that the sentence imposed must be proportionate to the gravity of the offence”, the gravity of the offender’s offences was significantly attenuated by his reduced culpability, given the causal link between his intellectual disability and his offending acts (<span class="font-italic">ASR </span>at [103] and [107]). Furthermore, the principle of retribution may be displaced, for example, by the principles of rehabilitation and prevention, and it does not easily lend itself to being treated as a dominant sentencing objective (<span class="font-italic">ASR </span>at [131]–[132]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">87 In the circumstances, rehabilitation was not displaced as the dominant sentencing principle by the other sentencing principles, although in concluding, the court noted that the rehabilitation sentence of reformative training was “the less imperfect” of two “sub-optimal options”, with the other being the long period of incarceration submitted for by the Prosecution (<span class="font-italic">ASR </span>at [159]).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(2) <span class="font-italic">Kong Peng Yee</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">88 I turn next to the case of <span class="font-italic">Kong Peng Yee</span>. There, a 68 year-old offender killed his 63 year-old wife in their home by attacking her with a knife and a chopper while he was experiencing a brief psychotic episode, which substantially impaired his mental responsibility for his actions. The offender pleaded guilty to a charge of culpable homicide not amounting to murder, and was sentenced to two years’ imprisonment by the High Court. Upon his release from prison, he voluntarily resided as a patient at the IMH. The Prosecution appealed against his sentence, arguing that it was manifestly inadequate.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">89 The Court of Appeal allowed the appeal, and increased the offender’s sentence to six years’ imprisonment. In the court’s view, given that the offender’s psychosis was causally linked to the offence and as it warped his understanding of reality, both general and specific deterrence were inapplicable (<span class="font-italic">Kong Peng Yee </span>at [69], [70] and [72]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">90 As for the principle of retribution, while the court recognised that the harm was “very great and indeed fatal”, it held that the offender’s culpability was very low, as “the brutality of the attack … was quite evidently the work of a disordered mind rather than a cold and cruel one” (<span class="font-italic">Kong Peng Yee </span>at [75]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">91 However, given that the principle of deterrence was rendered less effective by virtue of the offender’s psychiatric condition, rehabilitation was to take precedence, since rehabilitation seeks to advance the greater public interest by reducing the risk of recidivism (<span class="font-italic">Kong Peng Yee </span>at [78]). Further, in the context of the case, rehabilitation was complementary with the principle of prevention, since rehabilitating the offender while in the confines of the prison would in turn also result in better protection of the offender’s family and the public (<span class="font-italic">Kong Peng Yee </span>at [79]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">92 In the circumstances, the court considered that a sentence of six years’ imprisonment was appropriate to ensure continued compliance by the offender with his medication regime. This also took into account his positive prognosis, his insight into his condition, strong family support, and advanced age, while also assuaging to a reasonable degree any public concerns that a dangerous man was living in its midst (<span class="font-italic">Kong Peng Yee </span>at [99] and [100]).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(3) <span class="font-italic">Constance Chee</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">93 Finally, in <span class="font-italic">Constance Chee, </span>the offender, a schizophrenic, kidnapped one Sindee and caused her death by causing her to fall from a block of flats. The psychiatrist reported that the most important protective factor for persons suffering from simple schizophrenia was maintenance therapy with antipsychotic drugs. He also opined that he was totally unconvinced that the offender would remain compliant with her medication regime if she were to be left to her own devices in future. The offender was still “remote from normality”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">94 The Judge considered that for the offence of culpable homicide under s 304(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 1985 Rev Ed), the <span class="font-italic">only </span>sentencing options were ten years’ imprisonment or life imprisonment. No other options were permitted (<span class="font-italic">Constance Chee </span>at [4]). As with the cases cited above involving offenders afflicted by a serious mental condition, the Judge found that the principle of general deterrence was not a “real consideration” in the case given the “very real and palpable causal link between the illness and the two offences” (<span class="font-italic">Constance Chee </span>at [13]). Instead, the principal sentencing considerations were rehabilitation of the offender and protection of the public (<span class="font-italic">Constance Chee </span>at [13]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">95 In determining the appropriate sentence amidst the two applicable sentencing principles, the Judge considered that a prison-appointed psychiatrist had confirmed that the offender’s symptoms would abate with regular medication and adequate supervision of the symptoms. The offender had a good support system outside of the prison, which meant that her rehabilitation could continue to be secured such that “the risk of the [offender’s] illness once again conflagrating into violence is fairly remote” (<span class="font-italic">Constance Chee </span>at [19]). As such, a term of ten years’ imprisonment was preferred to a life imprisonment sentence.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(4) The appropriate balance in this case</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">96 The above cases show that the appropriate balance to be struck in cases which present a unique confluence of a severe mental condition and a serious offence is largely a fact-centric exercise. In such cases, the court has to consider the applicable sentencing principles at play. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">97 As already explained above, retribution is an operative sentencing principle in this case. In my view, the rehabilitation principle is not of significant weight here. While the accused person was afflicted by his acute psychosis at the time of the offence, his symptoms have resolved within a short period. He continues to be compliant with his treatment and has insight into his mental health condition. Dr Goh also explained that a significant period of rehabilitation is unlikely to be required.

</div>
</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">98 The accused person is 56 years old. He is not young (<span class="font-italic">cf </span><span class="font-italic">ASR</span>), such that rehabilitation is the presumptive dominant sentencing principle. Neither is he in need of mentorship or guidance that requires him to be placed in an environment where he is compelled to take his medication (<span class="font-italic">cf </span><span class="font-italic">Constance Chee</span>), given his own awareness of the need for continued treatment. Unlike the case of <span class="font-italic">Kong Peng </span><span class="font-italic">Yee</span>, where further incarceration was required to ensure the offender’s compliance with his medication regime, the accused person in this case has aptly shown that he is able to comply with his medication regime outside of prison.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">99 Therefore, I find that the rehabilitation principle does not feature strongly in this case. As was held in <span class="font-italic">Kong Peng Yee </span>at [78], “[t]he underlying aim of rehabilitation is to advance the greater public interest by reducing the risk of recidivism”. Where such risk of recidivism can be reduced by self-help measures that exist beyond the criminal justice system, the law need not step in and take on the mantle of rehabilitating the offender.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">100 In all, I find that retribution ought to be the dominant sentencing principle in this case. The significant harm (both actual and potential) caused in this case is a key consideration. In <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v Koh Wen Jie Boaz </span>[2016] 1 SLR 334, the High Court observed at [30] that “rehabilitation is neither singular nor unyielding”, and that it may be eclipsed by the principle of retribution if, for example, “the harm caused is severe”. This is precisely the case here. However, I am also cognisant that the Court of Appeal has cautioned in <span class="font-italic">ASR </span>at [131] that “[r]etribution does not easily lend itself to being treated as a dominant sentencing objective”, and that it is generally but a metric to ensure that the sentence imposed is commensurate with the offender’s culpability and the harm that he has caused.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">101 I also note that it is not uncommon to focus primarily on retribution. In <span class="font-italic">ASR </span>itself, the court recognised that judge-made sentencing frameworks that take the form of a harm-culpability matrix “embeds in a fundamental way retributive thinking in the sentencing exercise” (<span class="font-italic">ASR </span>at [131]). Similarly, in <span class="font-italic">Stansilas </span>at [97], Menon CJ observed that “when hurt and injury has resulted from the offender’s conduct (such as his drunk driving), the retributive principle will not be easily overridden and the court must attribute necessary weight to it, having regard to the degree of <span class="font-italic">actual and potential harm </span>caused” [emphasis added]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">102 As highlighted above, the actual and potential harm caused in this case were manifest. If not for the evasive actions of the other motorists who encountered the accused person head on, the death toll and extent of injuries could have been far more severe and extensive. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The appropriate sentence</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">103 I therefore proceed to consider the appropriate sentence, with a focus on the twin conceptions of retribution, namely, the harm caused (both actual and potential) and the reduced culpability of the accused person in causing such harm. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">104 I begin with the accused person’s culpability. I am of the view that a consideration of the culpability-increasing factors listed in <span class="font-italic">Ganesan</span>, namely his violation of multiple road traffic regulations and the high degree of rashness, is inappropriate. As explained above, the <span class="font-italic">Ganesan </span>framework did not envisage an offender such as the accused person, whose mental condition reduced his culpability. For the same reason, the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">ASR</span> declined to adopt established sentencing frameworks for rape and sexual assault by penetration (<span class="font-italic">ASR </span>at [149]), as the culpability of the offender in that case was “substantially reduced” because of the extent of his intellectual disability (<span class="font-italic">ASR </span>at [148]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">105 The query is thus, how substantially is the accused person’s culpability reduced? I recognise that the Prosecution has focused on the fact that he was able to make conscious decisions, such as braking intermittently, staying within his lane, making lane changes, and executing a three-point turn when he could not proceed further on the motorcycle lane at Tuas Checkpoint.

</div>
</div> However, it is undisputed that the accused person’s judgment was significantly impaired by his psychotic condition. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">106 In <span class="font-italic">Kong Peng Yee</span>, the Prosecution similarly maintained that the offender who stabbed his wife to death in a brief psychotic episode “retained full control of his actions”. In rejecting the Prosecution’s submission and finding that the psychotic episode was so overriding as to significantly reduce the offender’s culpability, the Court of Appeal made the following observations (<span class="font-italic">Kong Peng Yee </span>at [64]–[66])</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">64 … The essence of a brief psychotic episode is that it warps the individual’s sense of reality. Although the Respondent might have known how or even when to kill the Deceased, his mind was truly in an unreal world in which he had to kill or be killed. <span class="font-italic">The underlying factual basis for him to think or to feel the way he felt before and during the offence was totally irrational and was not just the working of an overly suspicious or jealous mind</span>. It is the equivalent of seeing a person seeking to embrace him as one trying to engulf and suffocate him or a delusional architect planning a beautiful mansion on imaginary rocks. The Respondent’s delusion altered his appreciation of his actions significantly.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">65 The psychosis which plagued the Respondent also served to distinguish this case from many of the precedents cited to us. The moral culpability of mentally disordered offenders lies on a spectrum. On the one hand there are offenders who have temporary and situational mental disorders who retain their understanding of their actions and can reason and weigh the consequences. … The mental disorder in such cases can only ameliorate to a limited extent the criminal conduct because the offender’s mind is still rational. In such cases, deterrence and retribution should still feature because depression, even if severe, cannot be a licence to kill or to harm others.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">66 On the other hand, <span class="font-italic">there are offenders whose mental disorders impair severely their ability to understand the nature and consequences of their acts, to make reasoned decisions or to control their impulses.</span> The Respondent’s brief psychotic episode was in this category. He exhibited incoherent and irrational behaviour before, during and after the offence. He muttered incoherently to people he did not know. He stabbed and slashed unrelentingly at an elderly, defenceless woman with two dangerous weapons. Whatever seemingly rational decisions that he made were premised on totally unreal facts and completely irrational thoughts. His actions were not merely a maladaptive response to a difficult or depressive true situation, such as a temporary loss of self-control. Instead, they emanated from an impaired mind.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">107 The present case has similarities with <span class="font-italic">Kong Peng Yee</span>. Here, it bears reminding that the undisputed purpose of the accused person embarking on the trip on that fateful morning was to send his son to work. Instead, he exceeded his intended destination by about 23 km, and drove irrationally onto the motorcycle lane at Tuas Checkpoint. When he could not proceed any further, he then sped against the flow of traffic, until his progress was halted by the collision that killed an innocent motorist. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">108 I accept that the accused person appeared to be fully in control of his vehicle, as seen by his ability to manoeuvre in tight spaces, and to execute a three-point turn when seeking to exit the checkpoint. However, his actions were irrational when viewed alongside the underlying factual basis in that he felt compelled by “[G]od” to drive as he did.

</div> His acts “emanated from an impaired mind”, much like the offender in <span class="font-italic">Kong Peng Yee</span>. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">109 Thus, I find that the culpability of the accused person is reduced, because of his mental condition at the time of the offence. However, I consider that, unlike the offender in <span class="font-italic">Kong Peng Yee</span>, the accused person’s judgment in this case was not so substantially impaired such that the entirety of his actions may be pinned on the psychotic event. In <span class="font-italic">Kong Peng Yee</span>, the offender displayed deeply irrational behaviour before, during and after<span class="font-italic"> </span>he committed the offence of killing his wife. As the court observed, the offender had a normal and long marital relationship with his wife, and he did not suspect that she was being unfaithful. Yet, spurred by his psychosis, he attacked his wife while she was folding clothes and posed no threat to him. There was no catalyst for the attack. After he killed his wife, he reported that he felt “happy”, and appeared dazed and was quiet. In totality, the entirety of his conduct “clearly showed a disturbed mind which was detached from reality” (<span class="font-italic">Kong Peng Yee </span>at [63]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">110 I accept that the accused person’s motivations for his actions were spurred by his disturbed mind. However, his degree of impairment did not appear to be as severe as the offender in <span class="font-italic">Kong Peng Yee</span>. In this regard, he reported to Dr Goh that he had actively applied brakes in response to traffic and steered his car to stay within the lanes. He even reported that his son had cautioned him to stop when he could not proceed any further on the motorcycle lane at Tuas Checkpoint. While driving against the traffic, he was aware that a collision was imminent. Significantly, after the collision with the deceased, the accused person maintained awareness of the situation and knew that he could not open his car door, and he sensibly asked his son to call his wife.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">111 It is difficult to pinpoint with precision the exact culpability of an offender’s conduct when the offender is acting under the influence of a severe mental illness. Nonetheless, this court is tasked with assessing his culpability for the purposes of arriving at a just and fair sentence in the overall circumstances of the case. In totality, I find that, while the accused person’s mental condition reduced his culpability for the offence, it is not so substantial as to vindicate him of much of the blame for his harmful actions. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">112 Turning to the aspect of harm, I consider that the actual and potential harm of the accused person’s actions was a significant aggravating factor. The harm caused in this case was extremely severe. Apart from the death of a motorist, it also resulted in serious injuries to four other road users. There was also significant property damage. Furthermore, had other motorists not succeeded in taking evasive action from the accused person’s oncoming and speeding vehicle, the potential harm could have been far greater, especially if one were to consider that the accused person had driven against traffic on the motorcycle lane at Tuas Checkpoint. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">113 Nonetheless, I recognise that the accused person has pleaded guilty, and appears to have been cooperative with the investigations. The Prosecution submits that little weight ought to be given to his plea of guilt given the overwhelming evidence against him.

</div> In this regard, I accept the Defence’s submission that the video-evidence against the accused person only goes towards the <span class="font-italic">actus reus </span>of the offence. The plea of guilt thus has value in that it negated the need for a protracted trial to investigate the <span class="font-italic">mens rea </span>of the accused person. This was also made easier by the fact that he was cooperative with the appointed psychiatrist, Dr Goh, such that an undisputed diagnosis was arrived at. In the circumstances, the plea of guilt saved much valuable time and resources. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">114 Furthermore, I note that the accused person had sought psychiatric treatment after the offence and has been compliant with his psychiatric treatment. Such conduct signals remorse of his actions, and a desire to prevent future recurrence of the grave consequences that could result.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">115 I therefore find that mitigating weight ought to be given to the accused person’s cooperativeness, plea of guilt, and his remorse. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">116 Having considered all the above factors, a sentence of one year imprisonment strikes a proper balance between the significant harm (both actual and potential) caused by the accused person and his reduced culpability given his medical condition. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">117 For completeness, I should also mention that in <span class="font-italic">G</span><span class="font-italic">anesan</span>, the offender, in the course of trying to execute a U-turn, cut across two lanes of the opposite side of the road and collided into the motorcycle ridden by the victim, with his wife as the pillion rider.  He was similarly charged with an offence under s 304A(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the PC and was convicted after a trial and sentenced to 12 weeks’ imprisonment for causing the death of the pillion rider who was then five months pregnant. Her unborn child also did not survive the accident. On appeal, See J enhanced the imprisonment term to five months. In arriving at the sentence, See J applied the sentencing framework that he had laid down for such cases as set out at [39] above and found that no culpability-increasing factors were present in that the offender did not violate any traffic regulations and his conduct did not involve a high degree of rashness. The offender’s culpability was “more akin to that normally associated with gross negligence” (<span class="font-italic">Ganesan </span>at [29]). Nonetheless, See J also considered than since more than one death was caused (to the pillion rider and her unborn baby), extraordinary harm was caused, and that this had to be reflected by placing the case at the higher end of Category 1.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">118  I recognise that the eventual sentence arrived at may appear harsh at first blush given that unlike the offender in <span class="font-italic">Ganesan</span>, the accused person was afflicted with a mental condition. However, my evaluation of the applicable principles has led me to conclude that it is the most appropriate sentence having regard to the overall circumstances of this difficult and most unfortunate case. Amidst the multitude of serious injuries caused, a human life has also been lost. Compared to the offender in <span class="font-italic">Ganesan</span>, the potential for far more severe harm was also greater here given that the accused person had driven against the flow of traffic at a high speed and on the fastest lane for a prolonged period. As mentioned, it was also perhaps fortunate that V1 to V4 did not suffer more severe injuries. In totality, retributive justice mandates that the accused person be adequately punished for his actions, which, while spurred by an impaired mind, were not the acts of an automaton; the accused person’s conduct also suggest that his mental state was not as severely impaired as the offender in <span class="font-italic">Kong Peng Yee. </span>In the entirety of the circumstances, I therefore find a sentence of one year imprisonment to be appropriate. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">119 As for the disqualification order, given the potentially dangerous consequences that may result from the accused person’s act of driving, and in light of the exceptional harm caused, I find that banning the accused person from driving all classes of vehicles for a period of 12 years is prudent, and I order accordingly.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">120 Before closing, a point may be made about the lack of breadth in sentencing options that are available to the courts in a case such as the present. In <span class="font-italic">Constance Chee</span>, V K Rajah J (as he then was) observed at [29]:</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 The current position, where the courts are neither empowered nor endowed with any discretion whatsoever to customise or tailor their sentences in a manner that would be consistent with either the possible recovery or decline of the medical condition of an offender who is unwell, is far from satisfactory. Judges often have to choose between a rock and a hard place when resolving their colliding instincts in determining the appropriate sentence. Should the offender’s medical condition stabilise without any real risk of a relapse it would be quite unjust for him or her to continue to be incarcerated after rehabilitation through medical attention when he or she no longer poses any further risk to the public upon a return to the community. It is apodictic that in such an instance the underlying rationale for the second of the <span class="font-italic">Hodgson</span> criteria (see [5] above) no longer prevails. … In order to properly and fairly sentence offenders whose medical condition might potentially be reversed through medical attention and/or with the passage of time, the courts should be conferred the <span class="font-italic">discretion to</span><span class="font-italic"> impose a sentence band with appropriate minimum and maximum sentences tied to periodical medical assessments and reviews</span>. This will minimise the rather unscientific and imprecise conjecture that is now inevitably prevalent when determining appropriate sentences for such offenders. The proposed approach, while fairer to offenders, will also concomitantly serve to address and assuage public interest concerns on adequate sentencing as well as protection from mentally ill offenders with a propensity for violence. … [emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">121 The learned judge’s observations remain relevant today. While a term of imprisonment may achieve the retributive principle, which underpins the present case, it may be argued that the greater public interest could be secured by ensuring that the accused person remains compliant with his medical treatment. This could prevent future recurrence of his acute psychosis, thus protecting him and those around him from the harm that could result.  The law does not empower me to make an order mandating periodic medical assessments and reviews of the accused person’s mental health condition in future. Nevertheless, I hope that the accused person will continue, in his good sense, to be compliant with his psychiatric treatment.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"></div><div class="txt-body text-left">Vincent Hoong  <br/>Judicial Commissioner</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Kumaresan Gohulabalan and Andre Chong (Attorney-General’s Chambers) for the Prosecution;<br/>Yusfiyanto bin Yatiman and Chee Fei Josephine (Rajah &amp; Tann Singapore LLP) for the accused person.</div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div><div class="Judg-Quote-List text-justify"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
