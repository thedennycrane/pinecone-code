<p class="Judg-Heading-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">Introduction</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">1       This case involved a bitter family dispute. The two plaintiffs, Terence Yeo Guan Chye (“the first plaintiff”)</font><a href="#_ftn1" id="_ftnref1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">[note: 1]</font></span></span></span></a> <font face1="Times New Roman, Times">and Theodore Yeo Guan Huat @ Yeo Guan Huat (“the second plaintiff”)</font><a href="#_ftn2" id="_ftnref2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">[note: 2]</font></span></span></span></a> <font face1="Times New Roman, Times">(collectively referred to as “the plaintiffs”), sued Lau Siew Kim (“the defendant”),</font><a href="#_ftn3" id="_ftnref3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">[note: 3]</font></span></span></span></a> <font face1="Times New Roman, Times">who was their stepmother and the third wife/widow of their late father, Tommy Yeo Hock Seng (“the deceased”), claiming that certain properties she held jointly with the deceased, were held on trust for the deceased’s estate on the basis that the deceased provided the purchase monies.</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">2       The plaintiffs were the sons of the deceased from his first marriage to one Iris Chong Yen Ying (“Iris Chong”), whom the deceased divorced in 1987. The first plaintiff is the younger of the two siblings. The divorce was acrimonious and Iris Chong obtained custody of the plaintiffs who were then aged 13 and 17 years respectively. It was the defendant’s case that the deceased was estranged from the plaintiffs after the first marriage ended in divorce and therefore, he could not have intended to have his properties held on trust for them. In the alternative, even if there was a resulting trust, the defendant contended that the presumption of advancement in her favour displaced any presumption of a resulting trust.</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">Facts</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">3       The deceased died on 23 November 2004. He had made a will dated 28 January 1992 (“the first will”) in which he named the first plaintiff as his sole beneficiary. Subsequently, the deceased made another will dated 20 May 1996 (“the second will”) to replace the first will. In the second will, he appointed the defendant as the sole executor and named her the sole beneficiary. On 5 July 2005, pursuant to an application by the plaintiffs in Suit No 32 of 2005, the second will was invalidated by the High Court, by reason of the subsequent marriage between the deceased and the defendant on 18 December 2000. Accordingly, the deceased died intestate. The defendant has not to-date applied for Letters of Administration to the estate of the deceased.</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">4       At the time of his demise, the deceased held the following four properties:</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">(a)    35 Fowlie Road, Singapore (“the Fowlie Road property”), which was registered solely in the deceased’s name;</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">(b)    149  Hougang Street 11 #10-136, Minton Rise, Singapore (“Minton Rise”), which was registered in the joint names of the deceased and the defendant on 11 October 2000;</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">(c)    18 Jalan Tari Payong, Singapore (“18 Jalan Tari Payong”), which was registered in the joint names of the deceased and the defendant; and</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">(d)    18A Jalan Tari Payong, Singapore (“18A Jalan Tari Payong”), which was registered in the joint names of the deceased and the defendant.</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">5       As the Fowlie Road property was solely in the deceased’s name and 18A Jalan Tari Payong has been sold and its sale proceeds used to discharge bank loans, the two properties are a non-issue. Hence the properties in contention are Minton Rise and 18 Jalan Tari Payong (collectively referred to hereinafter as “the properties”).</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">6       Before I deal with the issues proper, it would be helpful to set out the financial sources used to acquire the properties. Minton Rise was bought for $495,000, using a loan of $396,000 from Standard Chartered Bank (“Standard Chartered”) [see 2AB-69] and withdrawals from the defendant’s Central Provident Fund (“CPF”) savings. The Minton Rise property was the couple’s matrimonial home until the demise of the deceased. The defendant still resides there. According to the defendant, she is servicing the monthly mortgage instalments of $2,100 on the Standard Chartered loan, partly through her CPF contributions and partly by cash; she also pays the monthly conservancy charges.</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">7       As regards 18 Jalan Tari Payong, the deceased purchased it in March 2004 as joint tenants with the defendant for $1.1m. The deceased and the defendant took a loan of $770,000 from United Overseas Bank (“UOB”) repayable over 17 years, to part-finance the purchase.</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">The Issues</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">8       The question I had to determine was whether the defendant or the deceased’s estate was entitled to Minton Rise and 18 Jalan Tari Payong. Before delving into the issues in substance, it would be apposite at this juncture to refer to two interlocutory appeals that arose in the main action.</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">9       On the first day of trial (20 September 2006), in Summons No 4284 of 2006 (“SUM 4284/2006”), the plaintiffs applied to amend the Statement of Claim (“SOC”) to identify the correct locations of the properties in dispute. The defendant did not have any objections and I granted leave to the plaintiffs to so amend the SOC.</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">10     On the last day of trial (25 September 2006), in Summons No 4407 of 2006 (“SUM 4407/2006”), after all the evidence had been adduced and the defendant was about to close her case (save that I ordered her to produce bank documents to support her claim on 22 September 2006 that she had her own lines of credit from banks), the plaintiffs applied to further amend the SOC, essentially to make a concession on one property, <i>viz.</i> that half of Minton Rise belonged to the defendant. I allowed the plaintiffs’ second application in part against which decision the defendant appealed in Civil Appeal No. 113 of 2006 and for which I have delivered my grounds of decision (see <i>Terence Yeo Guan Chye &amp; anor v Lau Siew Kim</i> <nobr>[2006] SGHC 227</nobr>).</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">11     As a result of my decision in SUM 4407/2006, the plaintiffs re-filed an Amended (No 2) Statement of Claim on 27 September 2006 (“Amended (No 2) SOC”). Consequently, para 28 of the SOC dated 25 September 2006 filed with SUM 4407/2006 was deleted and paragraphs 30(1) and (2) were added and re-numbered para 29(1) and (2); the paragraphs state:</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">29.</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">…</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">And the plaintiffs claim:-</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">(1)    A declaration that the property (now registered in the sole name of the defendant) and known as 149 Hougang Street 11, #10-136, Minton Rise, Singapore (“Minton Rise property”) is held by the defendant in trust for the estate of Yeo Hock Seng, deceased;</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">(2)    In the alternative, a declaration that the property (now registered in the sole name of the defendant) and known as No 18 Jalan Tari Payong, Singapore (“the Tari Payong property”) is held in trust by the defendant as to half share thereof for the estate of Yeo Hock Seng, deceased.</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">12     With regard to the additional prayers prayed for in the Amended (No 2) SOC (relating to the application for Letters of Administration as well as the appointment of administrators for the deceased’s estate), I was of the view that they were premature as they were dependent on the outcome of this suit. Those prayers should be dealt with after judgment by way of a fresh application, if necessary. Hence, they were not granted.</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">13     I shall now refer to the submissions presented by the parties before I make my findings.</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">The Plaintiffs’ Submissions</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><strong><em><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">Minton Rise</font></em></strong></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">14     The plaintiffs proceeded by way of a resulting trust on the basis that it was the deceased who had provided the purchase monies for the properties – hence, the properties should result back to the deceased’s estate. The 10% down payment of Minton Rise (which was equivalent to about $90,000) was paid by the deceased. The remaining $390,000 came from the housing loan of Standard Chartered.</font><a href="#_ftn4" id="_ftnref4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">[note: 4]</font></span></span></span></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times"><span lang="EN-GB">15     The</span> <span class="judg-1Char"><span lang="EN-GB">plaintiffs</span></span> <span lang="EN-GB">argued that the presumed intention of the parties to set up a resulting trust over the properties was substantiated by the fact that the properties were owned in joint names. When cross-examined on why the deceased did not buy Minton Rise in her name only, the defendant replied that “[h]usband and wife always share everything together. Why buy in my name?”<a href="#_ftn5" id="_ftnref5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span lang="EN-GB">[note: 5]</span></span></span></a> Further, the defendant accepted that the deceased put Minton Rise “in joint names because both of you are co-owners” and “if there is a divorce, he could claim half of it”.<a href="#_ftn6" id="_ftnref6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span lang="EN-GB">[note: 6]</span></span></span></a></span></font></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">16     Next, the plaintiffs argued that there was no presumption of advancement in the defendant’s favour such that the properties were intended as gifts by the deceased to the defendant. The plaintiffs claimed that the deceased was not generous to the defendant and therefore, he could not have given Minton Rise to her. In the course of cross-examination, however, the defendant <u>disagreed</u> that the fact the deceased “never paid out any of his own money to give [her] whilst [she was] in England” was “a sign of a very mean person, not generous at all” because the deceased was “living on OD [overdraft]” and the defendant believed that she was “the only person in this world [the deceased] should have been generous to”.</font><a href="#_ftn7" id="_ftnref7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">[note: 7]</font></span></span></span></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">17     To further rebut any presumption of advancement, the plaintiffs argued that the properties and bank loans were registered in joint names because the deceased used the defendant’s name for the purpose of extending the length of the loan and not because he wanted to transfer the entire interest of the properties to her eventually.</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">18     In cross-examination, the second plaintiff asserted that the deceased made use of the defendant so that he could borrow money for a longer period of time because the defendant was younger than him (by 14 years) and had a regular job. However, the second plaintiff conceded he did not “speak to the bank officer of Standard Chartered”.</font><a href="#_ftn8" id="_ftnref8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">[note: 8]</font></span></span></span></a> <font face1="Times New Roman, Times">The assertion was therefore pure conjecture on the part of the second plaintiff.</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">19     The second plaintiff agreed that “[the deceased] and the defendant have committed themselves to service the UOB housing loan” and “upon the death of [his] father, the defendant would have been responsible for the repayment of all these loans taken out in their joint names”. He maintained that “the defendant was merely a nominee borrower of [his] father” and “used by [his] father”.</font><a href="#_ftn9" id="_ftnref9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">[note: 9]</font></span></span></span></a> <font face1="Times New Roman, Times">In re-examination, the second plaintiff was of the view that if the defendant was unable to pay as a co-borrower, the banks would sell the property. The sale proceeds would be enough to cover all the loans and there would still be a balance left after paying all the loans.</font><a href="#_ftn10" id="_ftnref10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">[note: 10]</font></span></span></span></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">20     The defendant agreed that it was normal bank practice that “[i]f a man has a regular job, he applies for a bank loan at the age of 55, the bank would give him only 10 years’ loan”. Although the defendant could not comment on whether the deceased would not be able to obtain a housing loan “[i]f he bought Minton Rise by himself without any income tax return”, she accepted that “with [her] joining the deceased, both of [them] got a housing loan for 25 years”.</font><a href="#_ftn11" id="_ftnref11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">[note: 11]</font></span></span></span></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">21     In addition, if the deceased “did not die and he decided to divorce his third wife for whatever reason”, Donald Yeo Hock Chwee (“Donald”),</font><a href="#_ftn12" id="_ftnref12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">[note: 12]</font></span></span></span></a> <font face1="Times New Roman, Times">the deceased’s older brother (who is a retired lawyer), said that the deceased would “have claimed back his share of Minton Rise and Tari Payong” and not have given them away. Donald stated that the deceased “confided in [him] that he intended to leave his sons some of his properties even as late as 1999.”</font><a href="#_ftn13" id="_ftnref13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">[note: 13]</font></span></span></span></a> <font face1="Times New Roman, Times">In this regard, Donald agreed that the deceased “loved Guan Chye (the first plaintiff) and he made a will in his favour in 1992.”</font><a href="#_ftn14" id="_ftnref14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">[note: 14]</font></span></span></span></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">22     Further, Donald’s affidavit dated 7 August 2006 at [25] reads:</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">Tommy was very shrewd always only thinking of himself at the expense of others. If he were a generous person, he would have simply bought Minton Rise property in the defendant’s name as he was so many years older than her. Tommy had always the intention of retaining Fowlie Road as he had said Fowlie Road was derived from Thrift Drive, which he claimed was a gift of love to him by our late mother.</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">23     In his affidavit at [23], Donald averred that “Tommy was using the defendant to obtain financial assistance from her and to obtain a higher mortgage for his property at Fowlie Road to further his avaricious intention to gain profit for himself”. Donald added at [26] that “Tommy was using the defendant to obtain a higher mortgage for his ventures as he was unemployed and of middle age”. In the course of cross-examination, Donald denied that he was making “false allegations to help [his] nephews to grab a share of the properties which they are not entitled to”.</font><a href="#_ftn15" id="_ftnref15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">[note: 15]</font></span></span></span></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><strong><em><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">18 Jalan Tari Payong</font></em></strong></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">24     For this property, the plaintiffs argued that similarly, the deceased paid for the purchase monies. The defendant stated that the property at Jalan Tari Payong “was purchased for $1.1 million and the housing loan was $770,000. The down payment would have been about $330,000”. This down payment came from “the Fowlie Road mortgage” which “belongs to Tommy Yeo solely at that time”. It was significant that the defendant conceded that “[i]f Fowlie Road never existed, [she] would not have got an OD” because Fowlie Road acted “as security” for the credit facility.</font><a href="#_ftn16" id="_ftnref16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">[note: 16]</font></span></span></span></a></span></p>

<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">26     First, the defendant submitted that the deceased was estranged from the plaintiffs after the first marriage ended in divorce and therefore, could not have intended to hold properties on trust for them.</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">27     In her closing submissions dated 10 November 2006 at [15], the defendant contended that “there is clear evidence [referring to the second will] that the deceased intended the defendant to have everything should he die before her.

<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">31     Second, the defendant’s position was that the presumption of advancement displaced any presumption of a resulting trust. The defendant claimed that the only property disputed in this case was Minton Rise and “in Tari Payong registered in [her] name now belong to [her] absolutely.” It was the defendant’s contention that as the deceased bought [Minton Rise and Fowlie Road] in joint tenancies, there and then, on the date of the purchase, he intended to give it to [her] as a gift already when he was still alive” and “it’s also due to [her] husband’s love for [her]”.</font><a href="#_ftn27" id="_ftnref27" name="_ftnref27" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">[note: 27]</font></span></span></span></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">32     Third, the defendant argued that the right of survivorship in a joint tenancy entitled her to claim the entire legal interest of the properties.</font></span></p>

<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">33     The defendant claimed that she was currently paying Minton Rise’s monthly mortgage instalments of $2,100 to Standard Chartered, partly through her CPF contributions and partly by cash.

<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">34     It was not disputed that Minton Rise was the matrimonial home. The deceased and the defendant were its joint tenants.

<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">35     With regard to Minton Rise, the defendant stated that the lawyers explained to her and Tommy about holding the property in joint names.

<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">36     The defendant argued that as the Standard Chartered facility letter was issued before December 2000 (when the defendant found a job as an accountant after her marriage to the deceased), it could not be the case that the deceased “had to use the defendant as a co-borrower to obtain loans of 20 years or more because she was considerably younger and had a regular job”.</font><a href="#_ftn29" id="_ftnref29" name="_ftnref29" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">[note: 29]</font></span></span></span></a></span></p>

The UOB term loan dated 12 June 2002 had a 21 year repayment period, which term was shorter than the Standard Chartered loan dated 6 June 2000 for 25 years.

The appellants claim that the mother was the owner of the flat and upon her death it forms part of her estate to which they are each entitled in equal shares together with the respondent pursuant to the rules of distribution under the Intestate Succession Act (Cap 146). The respondent, however, claims that he is the beneficial owner of the flat by operation of a resulting trust, because he had paid the purchase price for the flat as well as its outgoings. When he transferred his entire interest in the flat to the mother in 1986, no consideration was paid to him by the mother, and he did not intend to make a gift of that flat to her. Thus, the beneficial ownership of the flat remained with him by operation of a</font> <a id="hit11" name="hit11"></a><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">resulting trust.</font></span></p>

If he had that intention, the property would have been purchased only in the name of the defendant”.</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">64     The defendant submitted on the other hand that “the presumption of advancement applied to Minton Rise”: see the defendant’s submissions at [12]. The defendant’s Opening Statement (at [10]) stated:</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">(a)    Furthermore, the evidence negates any presumption of resulting trust in favour of the estate of the deceased.</font></span></p>

<p class="Judg-2" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">(e)    The properties were held in their joint names.</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">65     I reject the defendant’s argument – I find that the presumption of a resulting trust was not displaced in this case by the presumption of advancement. I would add that Singapore courts have moved away from the presumption of advancement, on the basis that the presumption of advancement is no longer applicable in modern times unless there is evidence to support the same.</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">66     “Thus the current judicial approach towards the presumption of advancement is to treat it as an evidential instrument of last resort where there is no direct evidence as to the intention of the parties rather than as an oft-applied rule of thumb”: <i>Teo Siew Har v Lee Kuan Yew</i> <nobr>[1999] 4 SLR 560</nobr> at [29].</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">67     I had opined in <i>Lai Min Tet v Lai Min Kin</i> <nobr>[2004] 1 SLR 499</nobr> at [46]:</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">… It should also be borne in mind that <i>Tinker v Tinker</i> is a 1970 case. Since then, the presumption of advancement has increasingly been applied as a principle of last resort. <i>Tinker v Tinker</i> was decided by the Court of Appeal in December 1969. It was preceded by the House of Lords decision in <i>Pettitt v Pettitt</i> [1970] AC 777 where their Lordships (Lord Reid, Lord Hodson and Lord Diplock) opined that there is no longer any reasonable basis for the presumption of advancement and the considerations which gave rise to it, to apply in modern times.</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times"><span lang="EN-GB">68     Further, the Court of Appeal in <i>Lee Hiok Tng (in her personal capacity) v Lee Hiok Tng and another (executors and trustees for the estate of Lee Wee Nam, deceased) and Others</i> <nobr>[2001] 3 SLR 41</nobr> observed thatthe presumption of advancement in the context of husband and wife was readily rebutted by comparatively slight evidence. It was stated at [36]:</span></font></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times"><span lang="EN-GB">… This presumption is essentially an evidential rule, based on relationship (<i>eg</i> husband and wife, father and son), to rebut the opposing presumption of a resulting trust where a transfer of property is made by one person to another without consideration. In <i>Teo Siew Har v Lee Kuan Yew</i> <nobr>[1999] 4 SLR 560</nobr>, this court, after considering <i>Pettitt v Pettitt</i> [1970] AC 777; [1969] 2 All ER 385, observed that, in the context of husband and wife, the application of this presumption has diminished in recent years in line with changing social norms. It also noted that the current approach is to treat the presumption “as an evidential instrument of last resort where there is no direct evidence as to the intention of the parties rather than as an oft-applied rule of the thumb”.</span></font></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span class="title1"><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">69     As encapsulated succinctly in the headnote of <i>Neo Tai Kim v Foo Stie Wah</i> <nobr>[1980-1981] SLR 215</nobr>:</font></span></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times"><span lang="EN-GB">If the parties were husband and wife and the husband was the provider of the funds for the purchase of the property and put it in the name of his wife, a resulting trust in favour of the husband did not arise as the doctrine of the presumption of advancement came into play on behalf of the wife to negative to resulting trust in favour of the husband. The doctrine of presumption of advancement was a rebuttable presumption and could be rebutted if the husband could show that, at the time of the transaction there was, as between them, a common intention that it was to be otherwise. Common intention might be proved by the acts and declarations of the parties before or at or immediately after the time of purchase, constituting part of the same transaction but subsequent declarations were admissible as evidence only against the party who made them and not in his favour.</span></font></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">70     I note that in <i>Low Gim Siah &amp; others v Low Geok Khim &amp; Another</i> <nobr>[2006] SGCA 45</nobr> (<i>Low Gim Siah’s</i> case), Chan Sek Keong CJ reaffirmed the applicability and relevance in Singapore of the presumption of advancement for <i>in loco parentis</i> relationships. This recent pronouncement from the Court of Appeal has no impact on my findings for several reasons. First, even in <i>Low Gim Siah’s</i> case, Chan CJ cautioned (at [33]) that <i>the presumption is not absolute and may be rebutted by evidence</i>. Second, he noted that recent court decisions in England and Singapore have held that because of changed social conditions, the presumption of advancement may be rebutted by very little evidence.</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">71     The presumption of advancement between husband and wife would not apply to our facts as it was a reverse situation here – the deceased husband did not work and it was the defendant who worked and who was apparently the bread winner. Consequently, our case is unlike that of the appellant wife in <i>Teo Siew Har v Lee Kuan Yew</i> (supra [66]) who was a full-time home-maker and had no financial means of her own.</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">72     I am therefore of the view that there was no evidence indicating any intention on the part of the deceased to present Minton Rise or 18 Jalan Tari Payong as outright gifts to the defendant. The presumption of a</font><a id="hit33" name="hit33"></a> <font face1="Times New Roman, Times">resulting trust was not rebutted by the presumption of advancement. Accordingly, the defendant’s argument on a presumption of advancement fails.</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><strong><em><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">The right of survivorship</font></em></strong></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">73     It is well established that in a joint tenancy, there is a right of survivorship when one of the co-tenants die. In the present case, it was axiomatic that the right of survivorship dictated that the entire property in a joint tenancy belongs to the defendant. However, this will result in the deceased’s estate being left with nothing. This seems to be unfair and unjust. Case law states that equity intervenes to ensure that although the deceased and the defendant remain joint tenants <i>at law</i>, they are actually tenants in common <i>in equity</i>, according to the proportion of their respective financial contributions. Accordingly, I hold that the existence of a resulting trust overrides the right of survivorship in the joint tenancies of both Minton Rise and 18 Jalan Tari Payong.</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">74     Judith Prakash J rightly opined in <i>Neo Boh Tan vs Ng Kim Whatt</i> (Originating Summons No 74 of 2000, unreported <nobr>[2000] SGHC 31</nobr>) (at [11]):</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times"><span lang="EN-GB">As joint tenants of the flat, the plaintiff and defendant have at law an identical interest in the whole of the flat. The position is, however, different in equity because of the way in which they paid for the flat. The governing principle is that where two or more persons buy a property together but <u>pay for it in unequal shares</u>, then <u>even if they register themselves as joint owners</u> of the property, the <u>law will presume</u> that the <u>express joint tenancy has been severed in equity into an implied tenancy in common in unequal shares proportioned to the amount of the purchase price contributed by each co-owner</u>. As Professor Tan Sook Yee puts it in <i>Principles of Singapore Land Law</i> (at pp 91 to 92):</span></font></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">‘Equity leans in favour of tenancies in common in given situations because of the inherent unfairness of the right of survivorship that obtains where there is a joint tenancy. For example, where A and B have contributed to the purchase price of property in unequal shares or have lent money on mortgage, or are business partners but the conveyance contains no words of severance, at law there would be a joint tenancy. If they are also <u>joint tenants in equity</u>, on the <u>death of one of the joint tenants</u>, the surviving joint tenant will succeed to the ‘share’ of the deceased joint tenant by the</font> <a id="hit4" name="hit4"></a><font face1="Times New Roman, Times"><u>right of survivorship</u>, so that <u>the estate of the deceased joint tenant will get nothing</u>. In the circumstances, this result is <u>manifestly unfair</u> and <u>equity will recognise that while A and B are joint tenants at law, they are also tenants in common in equity and each should be entitled to a share proportionate to his contribution</u>. <u>The net result is that A and B are joint tenants in law, holding in trust for themselves as tenants in common in shares proportionate to their contributions</u>.’</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">Professor Tan goes on to state in a footnote that <u>this is a resulting trust</u> and can be rebutted by evidence to the contrary.</font></span></p>
