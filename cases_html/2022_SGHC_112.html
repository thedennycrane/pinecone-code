They may be summarised as follows:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) On 16 March 2018, at about 7pm, the respondent threw files and boxes on the floor in the general direction of one Ms Kang Pei Shan Rachel (“Ms Kang”), an employee of Beam Artistes, and screamed at Ms Kang (the subject of the “First Charge”).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) On 26 March 2018, sometime in the afternoon, the respondent threw a metal stapler on the floor in the general direction of Ms Kang (the subject of the “Second Charge”).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) On 28 March 2018, at about 3pm, the respondent threw a metal stapler on the floor in the general direction of Ms Kang (the subject of the “Third Charge”).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) On 28 March 2018, at about 9pm, the respondent shouted at Ms Kang, and advanced towards Ms Kang in an aggressive and/or threatening manner such that Ms Kang stumbled and fell to the floor (the subject of the “Fourth Charge”).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) On 3 April 2018, at about 8pm, the respondent repeatedly threw his wallet in the general direction of Ms Kang, and threatened to take a knife to kill Ms Kang (the subject of the “Fifth Charge”).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(f) On 17 April 2018, at about 5.47pm, the respondent jabbed Ms Kang’s forehead with his finger and pushed the files that Ms Kang was holding against her chest (the subject of the “Sixth Charge”).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(g) On 17 April 2018, at about 5.54pm, the respondent voluntarily caused hurt to one Ms Kong Shin Ying Brenda (“Ms Kong”), his niece and an associate of SSLC at the material time, by grabbing her arms, pushing her against a table, repeatedly slapping her, jabbing his finger at Ms Kong’s forehead and pushing Ms Kong with his shoulder such that she lost balance and fell backwards, and aggressively berated and screamed at Ms Kong (the subject of the “Seventh Charge”).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(h) On 17 April 2018, at about 5.58pm, the respondent pushed one Ms Tan Tzuu Yen Serene (“Ms Tan”), a secretary and conveyancing executive employed by SSLC, with such force that she fell to the floor, and aggressively berated and screamed at Ms Tan (the subject of the “Eighth Charge”).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">5 </span>In respect of each instance of misconduct, the Law Society brought: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) A principal charge under s 83(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>)(i) of the LPA (relating to breaches of any usage or rule of conduct made by the Professional Conduct Council under s 71 of the LPA; the rule of conduct said to be breached was r 8(3)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the Legal Profession (Professional Conduct) Rules 2015 (2010 Rev Ed), namely that a legal practitioner must not act towards any person in a way which is fraudulent, deceitful or otherwise contrary to the legal practitioner’s position as a member of an honourable profession); and </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) An alternative charge under s 83(2)(<span class="font-italic">h</span>) of the LPA (relating to misconduct unbefitting an advocate and solicitor as an officer of the Supreme Court or as a member of an honourable profession).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">6 </span>A disciplinary tribunal heard the matter from 14 to 16 August 2019 and on 26 September 2019 and 19 November 2019. On the first day of the hearing, the respondent pleaded guilty to the Sixth to Eighth Charges, as well as the part of the Fifth Charge relating to his threat to take a knife to kill Ms Kang, while contesting the remaining charges. Subsequently, on 19 November 2019, the respondent pleaded guilty to the remaining charges.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">7 </span>On 10 March 2020, the disciplinary tribunal issued its report, in which it found that there was cause of sufficient gravity for disciplinary action under s 93(1)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the LPA.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">8 </span>The Law Society then filed OS 4 for an order pursuant to s 94(1) read with s 98(1) of the LPA that the respondent be sanctioned under s 83(1) of the LPA.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">9 </span>On 27 July 2020, the respondent pleaded guilty to criminal charges arising out of the events reflected in the Fifth to Eighth Charges. This led to a Newton hearing regarding the evidence he led in relation to his psychiatric state at the material time. In C3J/SUM 2/2021, the respondent sought an order that the hearing of OS 4 be held in abeyance, pending the completion of the Newton hearing. In <span class="font-italic">Seow</span><span class="font-italic"> Theng Beng Samuel v Law Society of Singapore </span>[2021] SGHC 258, we dismissed the respondent’s application, holding that he had failed to establish any real risk of serious prejudice to the conduct of OS 4 or the Newton hearing to warrant OS 4 being held in abeyance.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">10 </span>We heard the parties on 28 February 2022.

In this case, the primary charge is for ‘grossly improper conduct’ in relation to his profession, while the second alternative charge is for ‘improper conduct’ due to the serious breach of professional rules, specifically r 61(a) of the PCR. Conduct may be grossly improper notwithstanding that there is no dishonesty, fraud or deceit (<span class="font-italic">Re Han </span><span class="font-italic">Ngiap Juan </span>at [27]).</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">24     Section 83(2)(<span class="font-italic">h</span>) of the LPA is broader than s 83(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>). It is a ‘catch-all provision’ operating when a solicitor’s conduct does not fall within any of the other subsections of s 83(2) but is nonetheless considered unacceptable (<span class="font-italic">Law Society of Singapore v Ng Chee Sing</span> [2000] 1 SLR(R) 466 (‘<span class="font-italic">Ng Chee Sing</span>’) at [40]). The standard of ‘unbefitting conduct’ is less strict, and a solicitor only needs to be shown to have been guilty of <span class="font-italic">such conduct as would render him unfit to remain as a member of an honourable profession</span>. As a practical guide, it may be asked <span class="font-italic">whether reasonable people, on hearing what the solicitor had done, would have said without hesitation that as a solicitor he should not have done it</span> (<span class="font-italic">Ng Chee Sing</span> at [41], citing <span class="font-italic">Wong </span><span class="font-italic">Kok Chin v Singapore Society of Accountants</span> [1989] 2 SLR(R) 633 at [17]). <span class="font-italic">It is sufficient if his conduct brings him discredit as a lawyer or brings discredit to the legal profession as a whole.</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The factors indicating due cause for disciplinary action</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">15 </span>The Law Society submits that the respondent’s conduct is in and of itself sufficiently serious as to provide due cause for disciplinary action. It further argues that the seriousness of the respondent’s conduct is exacerbated by (a) his position of authority over Ms Kang, Ms Kong and Ms Tan; (b) the fact that the eight instances of misconduct appear to be part of a broader pattern of intemperate and boorish conduct; and (c) the respondent’s lack of genuine remorse.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">16 </span>We agree that the foregoing factors suffice to establish that there is due cause for disciplinary action. As was noted in <span class="font-italic">Law Society of Singapore v Ravi s/o </span><span class="font-italic">Madasamy </span>[2015] 3 SLR 1187, “[i]t is well established that the use of abusive language and unruly behaviour may constitute misconduct unbefitting an advocate and solicitor” (at [30]). The video footage of the 17 April 2018 incidents to which we were directed was more than sufficient to indicate that both abusive language and extremely unruly behaviour were involved. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">17 </span>The aggravating factors pointed out by the Law Society also weigh in favour of sanctioning the respondent. His position of authority would have necessitated a greater degree of decorum and professionalism, which he plainly failed to meet. Notwithstanding that Ms Kang and Ms Kong filed statements before the disciplinary tribunal stating that they had accepted the respondent’s apologies and chosen to forgive him, the respondent’s misconduct should rightly be considered as worse for having been perpetrated on his employees. It is also noteworthy that one of his victims, Ms Tan, did not file any such statement.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">18 </span>Further, it is plain, as the Law Society points out, that the <span class="font-italic">eight</span> instances of misconduct could not on any basis be regarded as isolated and aberrant incidents, but were instead part of a pattern of intemperate and boorish behaviour. Other employees of the respondent testified at the disciplinary tribunal hearing as to the respondent’s general disposition. One employee testified that the respondent “was a temperamental man who was prone to bouts of extreme emotion”. Moreover, aside from the overall tenor of the respondent’s interactions with Ms Kang, various witnesses testified that shouting and screaming were fairly regular occurrences.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">19 </span>Finally, we agree with the Law Society that limited weight should be given to the respondent’s claims of remorse. As the disciplinary tribunal noted (at [48]–[52] of its report), the respondent initially downplayed his misconduct and misstated the position both to the Law Society’s Inquiry Committee and to the media. It was only after April 2019, when video footage of the 17 April 2018 incidents became public, that he changed his stance. In other words, the contemporaneous evidence did not indicate <span class="font-italic">any</span> remorse on the respondent’s part. While there have been more recent expressions of remorse – in that the respondent has apologised to Ms Kang and Ms Kong, and has sought counselling for stress and anger management – it is difficult to accept these recent indicators as genuine in the wake of the respondent’s earlier attempts to misrepresent or mischaracterise his actions. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">20 </span>We digress to note in this connection that shortly after the hearing before us, the respondent appointed new solicitors who requested permission to make further submissions to the court. The central contention was that the Law Society had not specifically stated prior to the hearing that it was seeking an order for striking off. The respondent sought leave to elaborate on his supposed remorse and on the supposed exaggeration of the nature, gravity and motive of his conduct by one of his victims.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">21 </span>We did not grant the respondent’s request. Whether the Law Society specifically stated its intention to seek an order for striking off is beside the point. It is the court that determines sanctions, and if the respondent came to the hearing not having even contemplated the possibility of being struck off, that is a matter for him and his solicitors to reflect on. More to the point, nothing has been said to suggest that striking off should not even be considered in this case. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">22 </span>It also appeared to us that the request and its focus on attempting to suggest that one of the victims may have overstated the complaint further manifests the respondent’s lack of sincere remorse.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The mitigating factors raised by the respondent</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">23 </span>We turn to the mitigating factors raised by the respondent, on the basis of which he argues that due cause has not been made out for disciplinary action. Apart from his supposed remorse (which we have already addressed), he submits that (a) there has been minimal harm to the victims; (b) there is little harm to the integrity of the profession; and (c) at the time of the misconduct, he was suffering from Adjustment Disorder, which contributed to his actions. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">24 </span>The first two arguments are plainly untenable. While it is true that none of the victims sustained serious injury, it is not necessary for that to be the case for due cause to be made out. Indeed, it is not a factor in the respondent’s favour to say that the consequences were not worse. It is also no defence to argue, as he does, that “there is no evidence before this Honourable Court of a systemic problem of intemperate lawyers in our profession”. Even if the respondent were, in fact, the only intemperate lawyer in Singapore, it is plain that his actions reflect very poorly upon the profession, and would be likely to undermine public confidence in the profession.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">25 </span>As for his argument founded on Adjustment Disorder, a similar submission was made to the disciplinary tribunal, based on two medical reports of Dr Tan Chue Tin (“Dr Tan”). The two reports, dated 21 August 2019 and 13 September 2019 respectively, opined that the respondent suffered from Adjustment Disorder at the time of the 17 April 2018 incidents, and that the disorder contributed to his conduct. However, as the disciplinary tribunal noted (at [47] of the report), Dr Tan only saw the respondent for the first time in May 2019 more than a year after the incidents; no explanation was offered as to how Dr Tan was able to conclude that the respondent was suffering from Adjustment Disorder <span class="font-italic">at the material time</span>. Dr Tan also failed to explain what Adjustment Disorder was and how it might have contributed to the respondent’s conduct. The disciplinary tribunal therefore found the two medical reports to be of little assistance.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">26 </span>The respondent now seeks to rely on the same two medical reports, as well as four others: two further reports by Dr Tan dated 18 March 2020 and 26 June 2020 respectively, and two reports of Dr Kenneth Koh (“Dr Koh”) dated 23 January 2020 and 19 February 2020 respectively.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">27 </span>We agree with the disciplinary tribunal that the two earlier medical reports do not assist the respondent.

We note that guidance has been provided as to the circumstances in which striking off would be an appropriate penalty in respect of misconduct involving dishonesty (<span class="font-italic">Law Society of Singapore v </span><span class="font-italic">Udeh Kumar s/o Sethuraju and another matter </span>[2017] 4 SLR 1369 (“<span class="font-italic">Udeh</span><span class="font-italic"> Kumar</span>”)<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [105]–[109]; <span class="font-italic">Law Society of Singapore v Chia Choon Yang </span>[2018] 5 SLR 1068 (“<span class="font-italic">Chia Choon Yang</span>”) at [39]–[41]; <span class="font-italic">Loh Der Ming Andrew v Koh Tien Hua</span> [2022] SGHC 84 (“<span class="font-italic">Andrew Loh</span>”) at [69]–[73] and [110]) and for conflicts of interest (<span class="font-italic">Law Society of Singapore v Ezekiel Peter Latimer</span> [2019] 4 SLR 1427 (“<span class="font-italic">Ezekiel Peter Latimer</span>”) at [58]–[60], [67] and [69]–[74]). However, this court has yet to consider in similar detail the appropriateness of striking off a solicitor for cases of misconduct falling <span class="font-italic">outside</span> these categories. Most recently, this court observed in <span class="font-italic">Law Society of Singapore v Ismail bin Atan </span>[2017] 5 SLR 746<span class="font-italic"> </span>(“<span class="font-italic">Ismail bin Atan</span>”) (at [21]) that “even in cases that do not involve dishonesty, where a solicitor conducts himself in a way that falls below the required standards of integrity, probity and trustworthiness, and <span class="font-italic">brings grave dishonour to the profession</span>, he will be liable to be struck off” [emphasis in original in italics].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">37 </span>We take this opportunity to consider in greater detail the principle expressed in <span class="font-italic">Ismail bin Atan </span>at [21], and the two distinct elements therein, namely “fall[ing] below the required standards of integrity, probity and trustworthiness” and “bring[ing] grave dishonour to the profession” [emphasis in original omitted].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">38 </span>Turning to the first element of “fall[ing] below the required standards of integrity, probity and trustworthiness”, the core concern of that inquiry is one of character: does the solicitor in question have a defect of character that renders him unfit to remain an advocate and solicitor, with all the duties and responsibilities that this entails? This is in line with prior formulations of this element, such as in <span class="font-italic">Law Society of Singapore v Ravindra Samuel </span>[1999] 1 SLR(R) 266 (“<span class="font-italic">Ravindra Samuel</span>”) at [15], where the court noted that a solicitor who falls below the required standards of integrity, probity and trustworthiness would be struck off the roll of solicitors if “his lapse is such as to indicate that he lacks the qualities of character and trustworthiness which are the necessary attributes of a person entrusted with the responsibilities of a legal practitioner” (which we referred to in <span class="font-italic">Ismail bin Atan </span>at [21]). This concern as to whether the solicitor has a character defect rendering him unfit to remain an advocate and solicitor is also in line with the cases on dishonesty (<span class="font-italic">Chia Choon Yang</span> at [39]; <span class="font-italic">Andrew Loh</span> at [75], [84] and [106]; <span class="font-italic">Law Society of Singapore v </span><span class="font-italic">Thirumurthy Ayernaar Pambayan </span>[2022] SGHC 79 (“<span class="font-italic">Thirumurthy</span>”) at [4(c)]) and conflicts of interest (<span class="font-italic">Ezekiel Peter Latimer </span>at [74]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">39 </span>The second element of “bring[ing] grave dishonour to the profession” [emphasis in original omitted] speaks to a somewhat different concern. To be a member of the legal profession is to be accredited as worthy of confidence from other solicitors, from the courts, and from the public (see <span class="font-italic">Ravindra Samuel </span>at [12]–[13]). The nature of this accreditation means that each legal practitioner is a <span class="font-italic">representative </span>of the legal profession. To allow a legal practitioner who has brought grave dishonour to the profession to remain on the roll perpetuates that dishonour and undermines the value of that accreditation which is afforded to all other legal practitioners. In such circumstances, the errant legal practitioner cannot be suffered to remain on the roll, and to continue bearing the implicit imprimatur of the profession and the courts.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">40 </span>It follows that the elements of the principle stated in <span class="font-italic">Ismail bin Atan</span> provide <span class="font-italic">distinct</span> justifications for the striking off of a legal practitioner. In other words, if the misconduct in question suggests <span class="font-italic">either </span>that the practitioner cannot be trusted with the responsibilities of his profession, <span class="font-italic">or </span>that given the gravity of the misconduct, he should no longer bear the approval of the profession and of the courts, the practitioner should be struck off. To that extent, the use of the conjunctive “and” to join the two elements in <span class="font-italic">Ismail bin Atan </span>at [21]<span class="font-italic"> </span>should not be understood to mean that <span class="font-italic">both </span>requirements must be made out before the presumptive penalty of striking off applies.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">41 </span>The approach to considering whether a striking off order is warranted in cases of misconduct not involving dishonesty or conflicts of interest should therefore be as follows:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The first question the court should consider is whether the misconduct in question attests to any character defects rendering the solicitor unfit to be a member of the legal profession (this is similar to the first step of the sentencing framework for dishonesty; see <span class="font-italic">Chia Choon Yang </span>at [20]). </div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(i) The list of character defects may include a fundamental lack of respect for the law (such as a lawyer who racks up multiple convictions even for relatively more minor offences), volatility or lack of self-control detracting from the ability to discharge one’s professional functions (such as in <span class="font-italic">Law Society of Singapore v Wong Sin Yee</span> [2003] 3 SLR(R) 209<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [19]), and other predatory instincts (such as in <span class="font-italic">Ismail bin Atan</span> at [18]). This is not a closed list, and may be expanded upon, bearing in mind in particular the duties that a solicitor owes to the court, to his clients, to other practitioners and to the general public. </div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(ii) The assessment of whether misconduct demonstrates a character defect rendering a solicitor unfit to be a member of the legal profession depends on the particulars of the misconduct, and the court should consider, taking into account all the circumstances of the misconduct, whether the misconduct stemmed from a lapse of judgment rather than a character defect (<span class="font-italic">Chia Choon Yang </span>at [31]; <span class="font-italic">Andrew Loh</span> at [75], [84] and [106]; <span class="font-italic">Thirumurthy</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [4(c)]).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The second separate question the court should consider is whether the solicitor, through his misconduct, has caused grave dishonour to the standing of the legal profession (<span class="font-italic">Ismail bin Atan </span>at [21]). One example would be where the lawyer is convicted of molesting a victim. In our judgment, the outcome would be unaffected even if the offence were compounded, as happened in <span class="font-italic">Ismail bin Atan</span> (at [11]).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) If the answer to either of these two questions is “yes”, striking off will be the presumptive penalty. While we do not foreclose the possibility that this presumption may be rebutted, we foresee that this would only occur in exceptional cases. Indeed, where mitigating factors are raised to rebut the presumptive penalty of striking off, the solicitor would essentially be arguing that despite being <span class="font-italic">unfit </span>to remain an advocate and solicitor and/or having brought <span class="font-italic">grave dishonour</span> to the legal profession, he should nonetheless be allowed to remain on the rolls. In any event, we reiterate that personal mitigating circumstances that diminish the culpability of the solicitor carry less weight in disciplinary proceedings than they would in criminal proceedings (<span class="font-italic">Ravi </span>at [40]–[41]).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) If the answer to both these questions is “no”, the court should proceed to examine the facts of the case closely to determine whether there are circumstances that nonetheless render a striking off order appropriate (<span class="font-italic">Chia Choon Yang </span>at [38]). The court should compare the case with precedents to determine the appropriate sentence, taking into account any aggravating and mitigating factors (as was done in <span class="font-italic">Law Society of Singapore v </span><span class="font-italic">Dhanwant Singh </span>[2020] 4 SLR 736 at [137]–[138]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">42 </span>The approach set out above does not displace the sentencing principles set out in <span class="font-italic">Ravi</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [31]; rather, those principles should inform the application of the approach set out above at each stage. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The appropriate sanction in the present case</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">43 </span>We turn to apply this approach to the present matter.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">44 </span>In respect of the first question, we are satisfied that the respondent’s conduct evinced such volatility and lack of self-control that it detracts from his ability to discharge his professional functions. His behaviour was egregious, involving both protracted instances of physical and verbal abuse (as was the case on 17 April 2018) and extreme threats (in particular, his threat on 3 April 2018 to take a knife to kill Ms Kang). It is not difficult to imagine that this behaviour could have been turned upon a client, for instance. Further, as noted at [18] above, this quick succession of eight instances of misconduct in just over a month was not simply a lapse of judgment, but instead reflected a sustained pattern of offensive conduct on the part of the respondent. We are therefore satisfied that the respondent’s conduct demonstrates a character defect rendering the solicitor unfit to be a member of the legal profession.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">45 </span>In respect of the second question, we are equally satisfied that the respondent’s conduct has caused grave dishonour to the standing of the legal profession. For completeness, we state that we would have come to this view even if the video of the 17 April 2018 incidents had not been published. Hence, even if the respondent’s behaviour had been known only to the members of his office who were direct witnesses, it would remain a disgrace for a member of the legal profession to have acted as he did.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">46 </span>In the circumstances, the presumptive penalty is striking off. The mitigating factors raised by the respondent (see [21]–[27] above) do not, in our judgment, overcome this presumption.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">47 </span>The respondent has also relied on the cases of <span class="font-italic">Law Society of Singapore v Jasmine </span><span class="font-italic">Gowrimani d/o Daniel</span> [2010] 3 SLR 390 (“<span class="font-italic">Jasmine </span><span class="font-italic">Gowrimani</span>”), <span class="font-italic">The Law Society of Singapore v </span><span class="font-italic">Looi Wan Hui</span> [2014] SGDT 3 (“<span class="font-italic">Looi</span><span class="font-italic"> Wan Hui</span>”) and <span class="font-italic">The Law Society of Singapore v Leonard Anthony </span><span class="font-italic">Netto</span> [2005] SGDSC 14 (“<span class="font-italic">Leonard Anthony </span><span class="font-italic">Netto</span>”) to argue that he should be punished with only a fine of $40,000 and censure. However, we do not see any relevance in these cases. The decision in <span class="font-italic">Jasmine </span><span class="font-italic">Gowrimani</span> was concerned not with the imposition of a sanction on an errant solicitor, but with how a disciplinary tribunal should decide whether to refer a matter to the Court of Three Judges. Meanwhile, the misconduct in <span class="font-italic">Looi</span><span class="font-italic"> Wan Hui </span>and <span class="font-italic">Leonard Anthony </span><span class="font-italic">Netto</span> was entirely dissimilar to that which is before us in this matter. <span class="font-italic">Looi</span><span class="font-italic"> Wan Hui</span> involved a solicitor casting aspersions on the ability of an opposing litigant and her brother to honour a cheque within earshot of the brother; <span class="font-italic">Leonard Anthony </span><span class="font-italic">Netto</span> involved a solicitor convicted of consumption of cannabis. There is little guidance that can be drawn from these cases, and even less which would militate against the presumptive penalty of striking off.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">48 </span>For these reasons, we find that there is due cause for disciplinary action and order that the respondent be struck off the roll.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">49 </span>The parties are to write to the court with submissions (limited to 8 pages each) on the issue of costs within 14 days of this judgment, if no agreement is reached.</div><table class="table table-sm table-borderless"><tbody><tr><td><div class="txt-body text-left">Sundaresh Menon<br/>Chief Justice </div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-left">Andrew Phang Boon Leong<br/>Justice of the Court of Appeal</div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="txt-body text-left">Steven Chong<br/>Justice of the Court of Appeal </div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-left"></div></td></tr></tbody></table><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Dhillon Dinesh Singh, Loong Tse Chuan and Alisa Toh Qian Wen (Dai Qianwen) (Allen &amp; Gledhill LLP) for the applicant;</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Pereira Edmond Avethas and Cheung Shu Jia Jessica (Edmond Pereira Law Corporation) for the respondent.</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right"></div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>

Further, the respondent’s misconduct should be considered as worse for having been perpetrated on his employees. It was also plain that the eight instances of misconduct were part of a pattern of intemperate and boorish behaviour, and not isolated incidents. Limited weight was given to the respondent’s claims of remorse, given that he had initially downplayed his misconduct and misstated the position both to the Law Society’s Inquiry Committee and to the Media, and his attempt following the hearing of the application to suggest that one of his victims may have overstated their complaint: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[</span><span class="font-weight-bold">16]</span> to <span class="font-weight-bold">[</span><span class="font-weight-bold">19] </span>and<span class="font-weight-bold"> [22]</span>.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">7 The arguments raised by the respondent to mitigate the seriousness of his misconduct were not borne out.

His conduct had also caused grave dishonour to the standing of the legal profession. The presumptive penalty was therefore striking off. The mitigating factors raised by the respondent did not overcome this presumption: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[</span><span class="font-weight-bold">44] </span>to<span class="font-weight-bold"> [46]</span>.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">10 The respondent was therefore ordered to be struck off the roll: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[48]</span>.</div><div class="txt-body text-left"><div class="font-italic"><br/><br/></div></div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center"><span class="font-italic">This summary is provided to assist in the understanding of the Court’s grounds of decision.
