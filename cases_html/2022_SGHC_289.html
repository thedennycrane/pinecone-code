</div> Final judgment has not been granted. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">4 The present suit arose out of a dispute between the plaintiff and the first defendant in the course of the ancillary hearings in the Matrimonial Proceedings, namely, whether the Shares and the Patents (collectively, the “Assets”) formed part of the pool of matrimonial assets to be divided. The plaintiff contended that the first defendant was the beneficial owner of the Assets, and thus should be part of the pool of matrimonial assets. The first defendant disagreed and took the position that his relatives were the true beneficial owners of the Assets. These relatives include the seventh defendant, Tan Siew Hui, who is the sister of the first defendant; the eighth defendant, Teo Eng Wah @ Teo Eng Huah, who is the sister-in-law of the first defendant, having married the first defendant’s late brother, Tan Hong Kee (the “Late Brother”); and the ninth defendant, Philip Tan Pei Yeanz, who is the eighth defendant’s son and the nephew of the first defendant. The sixth defendant, Koh Choon Heong, is also named as a party to the suit, but he is not consanguine with the first, seventh, eighth, and ninth defendants. While the eighth defendant was initially named as a party the suit, the plaintiff subsequently filed a Notice of Discontinuance on 7 September 2021 to discontinue the action against her.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">5 For completeness, alongside the seventh to ninth defendants, there were also other members in the first defendant’s family who were allegedly involved in the Companies. They are Tan Ching Siang, the late father of the first defendant (the “Father”); Tan Hong Chai; Tan Cheng Pow @ Tan Chin Pow; Susan Lim and Tan Ee Lean. Collectively, they are referred to as the “Relatives”. Apart from the first, seventh, eighth, and ninth defendants, Tan Hong Chai and Tan Cheng Pow @ Tan Chin Pow also gave evidence.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">6 The Companies are in the business of the manufacturing and selling and/or leasing of metal crates and pallets, for the packing and transportation of natural rubber.

The first defendant had not provided any viable reasons for the transfers. Hence, the present exercise must occur with reference to the state of shareholdings before the transfer of shares. The plaintiff’s claims are thus particularised as follows. In relation to Friendlypack Malaysia and Duramin, the first defendant is the registered holder of 41.3% of the shares in the former and 99.9% of the shares in the latter. The seventh and ninth defendants’ shares in Friendlypack Malaysia are held on trust for the first defendant.

It also forms the basis of the Relatives’ beneficial interests in the remaining companies, and thus sits at the heart of the dispute. In this connection, she raised four points regarding Friendlypack Malaysia. First, the financial contributions by the Relatives to Friendlypack Malaysia were not capital contributions; instead, they were loans or seed funding. The contributions were disparate, widespread, and not coterminous with the capital issuances of Friendlypack Malaysia.

The defendants referred to their investment into the business of Friendlypack Malaysia or their channelling of such investment through the first defendant, and there did not appear to be any credible assertion of any other beneficial interests beyond that. There was little evidence before me to show that these other interests could be made out: it was incumbent on the defendants in asserting the insufficiency of the parties joined to at least show some basis that there were other interests that could potentially be affected. What the defendants could say was only that these other relatives had contributed to the “seed capital” of Friendlypack Malaysia in a manner similar to the seventh defendant and the Father, and further that their identities and the quanta of their contributions were specified at an early stage.

As pointed out by the plaintiff, what was stated in the seventh defendant’s defence and her affidavit of evidence in chief was in line with the position of the first to fourth and ninth defendant.

</div> This was unpersuasive. It was unclear how the plaintiff erred in treating her defence as being materially similar to that of the first and ninth defendants’, given the state of their pleadings. The seventh defendant’s argument, in any event, misses the mark. The plaintiff’s complaint did not concern the seventh defendant’s narrative that the Father, the Late Brother and herself received shares for their financial contributions in Friendlypack Malaysia. Instead, it concerned her disavowal that Relatives without any allotted shares would not have a beneficial interest in Friendlypack Malaysia. This inconsistency, which remained unresolved, undermined her evidence in a substantial way. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 The seventh defendant’s position stood in stark contrast to the submissions and evidence of the other defendants, who maintained that the Relatives are the beneficial owners of the shares in Friendlypack Malaysia in proportion to their respective financial contributions regardless of whether they were allotted shares. In the first defendant’s submissions and testimony, his position remained unchanged from his defence, save for his claim during his in-court testimony that the respective contributors would have to sit down to discuss their entitlement to shares in Friendlypack Malaysia.

</div> Put in other words, the seventh defendant's case stood in opposition to the first and ninth defendants’ narrative of events. Such a discrepancy undercuts the case theory that they pleaded in unison. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 Various inconsistencies among the defendants, in particular between the first and seventh defendants (who gave most substantial evidence in the course of the hearing), followed accordingly. On the seventh defendant’s case, there were only three beneficial owners of Friendlypack Malaysia, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, herself, the first defendant and the ninth defendant; on the first defendant’s case, it is shared among the Relatives. In fact, according to the first defendant, the exact beneficial holding of each Relative is unknown and is to be worked out among the Relatives. On the other hand, on the seventh defendant’s case, each of the trios’ beneficial holding is clearly delineated. Inconsistencies between the cases of the first and seventh defendants do not, in themselves, mean that both cases must be rejected. It is possible that either case is true, based on the facts and evidence. But in the present matter, the first and seventh defendants had pleaded the same position concerning the equitable ownership of Friendlypack Malaysia, a company which both of them had extensive involvement with and on at least the first defendant’s case, a matter which he had personal knowledge of.

</div> Given this contradiction between the two main witnesses on the side of the defence, which could not be explained away, the strength and veracity of the claims of the first and seventh defendants were significantly undermined. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Whether the Shares are owned by the first defendant</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 The ultimate issue was whether the Shares as claimed by the plaintiff are beneficially owned by the first defendant. Legal title that is subject to beneficial interests of others would not serve the purposes of the plaintiff, who ultimately seeks to include the Shares as matrimonial property to be divided between the first defendant and her in the Matrimonial Proceedings. The existence of any beneficial ownership turns, in terms of the pleadings and facts here, on whether the other defendants contributed to the acquisition of the properties claimed, rather than merely lending money to the first defendant. The controlling case giving guidance on this area is <span class="font-italic">Chan Yuen Lan</span>. Briefly, <span class="font-italic">Chan Yuen Lan </span>sets out a framework for the determination of beneficial interests where no declaration of trust has been executed: at [160]. Of particular relevance is the guidance provided on when and in what manner a presumption of resulting trust arises (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, when there is sufficient evidence of parties’ respective financial contributions to the purchase price of a property) and the circumstances under which such a presumption may be defeated, such as where there is sufficient evidence of an express or an inferred common intention as to the holding of the beneficial interest in a property. Also of relevance was the observation in <span class="font-italic">Chan Yuen Lan </span>that the beneficial interest of a property may be held in a manner different from that in which it was held at the time of acquisition of the property if there is sufficient and compelling evidence of such an intention subsequently. The law was not in issue in the present case; rather the dispute between the parties centred largely on the facts.

There were however purported transfers of various shares in Friendlypack Malaysia and Duramin to the seventh defendant that substantially altered the shareholdings in these two companies, but these took place after the suit was filed and on the eve of the trial. <span class="font-italic">Mareva</span> injunctions were obtained by the plaintiff against, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, the first and seventh defendants in the course of the Matrimonial Proceedings. In my view, the transfers were clearly designed to pre-empt the Court’s determination of the ownership rights of these shares in this suit. The timings of the transfers were suspect, and the fact of the transfers was initially concealed from the plaintiff in the Matrimonial Proceedings.

</div> There was also no justification for the parties to have executed the transfers, given that they were aware the beneficial ownership of these shares was in dispute. In this connection, the seventh defendant’s explanation that she was trying to protect her interests in her shares was untenable as those shares were the very subject matter of the present suit.

</div> Apart from a contribution of RM2,000 on 30 December 2003, which was made one day before Friendlypack Malaysia’s first share issuance on 31 December 2003, the remaining 12 instances were made on disparate occasions that were unrelated to the share issuances of Friendlypack Malaysia. Despite the numerous contributions which spanned the two share issuances by Friendlypack Malaysia, no shares were issued to any of the family members of Tan Cheng Pow @ Tan Chin Pow. This was quite a telling failure, which substantially undermined the defendants’ case. One would have expected given these infusions of money that there would have been some shares issued had there really been any such expectation or agreement. On the stand, Tan Cheng Pow @ Tan Chin Pow sought to explain this on the basis that Friendlypack Malaysia is a family business.

</div> What he appears to suggest is that there is some degree of laxity in the manner in which these things were dealt with, and that it is unsurprising that these matters were not discussed. This, however, is inadequate. The fact that he treated Friendlypack Malaysia as a family business is wholly consistent with the contributions being loans, as opposed to investments, with these loans being dealt with on an informal basis. Nothing on his narrative of events weighs heavily in favour of the inference that these payments were investments. Taking the evidence in the round, it appears that these payments were in the nature of loans or working capital, as opposed to investments.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 While contributions that are not coterminous with the issuance of the shares may still be considered as financial contributions for the purpose of a presumed resulting trust in favour of the Relatives, this would only be possible pursuant to an agreement at the time of the acquisition of the property.

</div> However, there was similarly no reference to such a process in any of the defendants’ affidavits of evidence in chief. It therefore appeared that the said agreement was an afterthought. Furthermore, a tacit agreement needs to be substantiated by evidence; where behaviour is relied upon, as here, such behaviour must be sufficiently linked to the tacit agreement, rather than be explained by other causes. Here it was at least just as plausible, if not more so, that the contributions were made not on the basis of any intention or agreement to have a proprietary interest, but only in the hope of receiving some benefit determined by the first defendant. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 Finally, the first defendant was unable to specify the beneficial interest of each Relative.

</div> There was therefore a lack of clarity as to how and in what proportion the Relatives had beneficial ownership of Friendlypack Malaysia. The Relatives relied on the first defendant. Yet, the first defendant depended on the Relatives working it out among themselves. It was quite clear that the defendants’ different interests had to be worked out even on their own version: this put paid to the existence of any agreement, tacit or otherwise.

As was argued by the plaintiff, several of the contributions relied upon by the seventh defendant were recorded as loans by the seventh defendant herself. She also admitted in cross-examination that the whole of her contribution was meant as a loan at the time, and that her affidavit position, which indicated that her contribution was payment for equity in Friendlypack Malaysia, was in error.

The amount of the loans capitalised was far less than her purported shareholding of Friendlypack Malaysia. For her to hold 92.33% of the shares, at least RM 277,017 (the value of 92.33% of the total paid-up capital of Friendlypack Malaysia) would have had to be capitalised. However, only RM199,000 of the loans were capitalised. Her evidence concerning when the loans were capitalised was also equivocal. Sparse details were provided in her affidavit of evidence in chief.

</div> It was thus disbelieved that the loans were capitalised as she claimed. In any event, the capitalisation of the loans would not have supported the creation of beneficial interest, not being linked to any acquisition of such an interest.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 What was relied on by the defendants to make out their contributions to the acquisition of property fell far short. As made clear in <span class="font-italic">Chan Yuen Lan</span>, a presumption of a resulting trust may arise in so far as the evidence shows that the financial contributions went towards the acquisition of the property. As observed earlier, some of the supposed contributions, such as those by Tan Hong Chai which were made after the second share issuance on 3 December 2004 as outlined at [46] above, were after the fact of acquisition. Absent an agreement concerning how these contributions were to be treated, they could not be relied on.

</div> This suggested that the first defendant exerted control over the dividends of Friendlypack Malaysia, and correspondingly, was the beneficial owner of the shares in Friendlypack Malaysia.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 Additionally, majority of the dividends declared appeared to overwhelmingly benefit the first defendant. Dividends were declared by Friendlypack Malaysia from 2011 to 2016. Across these years, it was undisputed that at least RM702,000 was assigned to the first defendant by the other registered shareholders.

</div> Beyond these sums, the other dividends declared by Friendlypack Malaysia also seemed to substantially benefit the first defendant. By way of example, dividends totalling RM3,000,000 were declared and paid to the first, seventh and eighth defendants in 2016. The full sum of RM3,000,000 was then fully assigned to the first defendant by the seventh and eighth defendants. After a portion was used to offset director’s loans, the first defendant received an aggregate of RM1,047,042.51, of which he distributed RM38,781.62, leaving him to receive a net amount of RM1,008,260.89. The overarching impression, therefore, was that the first defendant benefitted considerably from the dividends.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56  In a bid to account for the movement of the dividends, the defendants contended that there was a loose and informal family arrangement in place. The dividends were to be used for various purposes, one of which was to supplement the first defendant’s income by way of dividends as compared to increasing his salary directly to reduce his tax liability.

</div> Where property rights are concerned, which are to be asserted against third parties, it is insufficient for the defendants to point vaguely as they have done here. To defeat the plaintiff’s claim, the defendants would have had to adduce stronger evidence of some arrangement that was clearly meant to modify the legal and presumptive beneficial ownership of the registered shareholder at the material time, especially given that the evidence suggested that the first defendant had not only control of the movement of the dividends but also benefitted substantially from the dividends declared.

On her account, these funds originated from Friendlypack Malaysia, and because of her beneficial ownership of the shares in Friendlypack Malaysia, this entitles her to the beneficial ownership of Duramin.

It did not mean that the beneficial owners of Friendlypack Malaysia had any legal or equitable right to the assets of Duramin. In any event, the seventh defendant’s position is also factually strained. The funds may be described to have originated from Friendlypack Malaysia in so far as they were initially assigned as dividends to the first defendant, who then used them to acquire Duramin.
