This chopper was described by witnesses as a big knife, and is referred to in the same manner in these grounds of decision. On the Prosecution’s case, on 24 September 2016, members of the syndicate met at the Canteen, discussing the action to be taken at a meeting with the rival syndicate later that evening. Choppers were distributed. Manik received one, which he then brought along to the anticipated meeting with the rival syndicate at Avenue 1. During the incident, Manik used that chopper to intentionally inflict the Fatal Injury on Rahim. Knowing that Rahim was a member of the rival syndicate, Manik wanted to send a message to the rival syndicate not to interfere with their business. Manik then brought the chopper he used back to the taxi. Various statements were attributed to Manik which the Prosecution argued were “indicative of the fact in issue - whether the accused had chopped an individual on the leg”.

</div> There was no dispute on the cause of death, or that the Fatal Injury was in the ordinary course of nature sufficient to cause death. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">18 </span>Manik’s defence joined issue with the first element, which required his action to have caused the Fatal Injury and, thereby, death, and the second element, which required an intention to cause that injury. He claimed that he was armed with a wooden stick only, and therefore it was not possible for him to have inflicted the Fatal Injury. The issues relevant to the Primary Case, therefore, were (i) whether Manik had been armed with a chopper; (ii) whether he inflicted the Fatal Injury; and (iii) whether he did so with the requisite intention. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">19 </span>In the event that the Prosecution was unable to show that Manik inflicted the Fatal Injury, on the Alternative Case, the Prosecution sought to show that the Fatal Injury was inflicted by Aziz, Mitho or Manik, in furtherance of their common intention, such that Manik was liable under s 300(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) read with s 34 of the Penal Code. The necessary elements for the use of s 34 of the Penal Code are (see <span class="font-italic">Daniel Vijay s/o Katherasan and others v Public Prosecutor</span> [2010] 4 SLR 1119 (“<span class="font-italic">Daniel Vijay</span>”) at [91]): (a) the criminal act element, (b) the common intention element, and (c) the participation element. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">20 </span>The first and third elements required by s 34 of the Penal Code were not in dispute. The Fatal Injury was inflicted by one of the assailants during the incident and Manik clearly participated in the criminal act in chasing Rahim and attacking him together with the other two men. The dispute centred on the second element, whether the three men shared the requisite common intention to cause s 300(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) injury. In this judgment, I adopt the same definition as that used in <span class="font-italic">Daniel Vijay</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [49]: a reference to common intention to cause s 300(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) injury is to common intention to inflict bodily injury sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">21 </span>The main factual issues were therefore the following: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Was Manik armed with a chopper?</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) If so, did Manik inflict the Fatal Injury? If so, then if the injury was intentionally inflicted, the Primary Case would be made out.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) If the Primary Case was not made out, did Mitho, Aziz and Manik share a common intention to inflict s 300(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) injury? If so, the Alternative Case would be made out. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) If neither (b) nor (c) were made out, could any inference be made concerning the common intention of the three men sufficient to ground an alternative charge? </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">22 </span>I found that Manik was armed with a chopper, as was Aziz and Mitho. While the person who inflicted the Fatal Injury did so intentionally, it was not clear that Manik was the one who inflicted the Fatal Injury. Neither did the facts lead to the inference that the three men shared a common intention to inflict s 300(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) injury. I amended the charge against Manik to one under s 326 read with s 34 of the Penal Code, and convicted and sentenced him accordingly. I explain each of these decisions in turn.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Was Manik armed with a chopper?</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">23 </span>I considered the following in deciding whether Manik was armed with a chopper: the injuries inflicted on Rahim; camera footage which showed Manik wielding a reflective object; Goni’s evidence that Manik was given a chopper prior to the incident; Goni and Mamun’s evidence that Manik was seen entering the taxi after the attack with a chopper; Manik’s evidence in his statement and on the stand; and testimony that Manik used the word “<span class="font-italic">kop</span>” in relation to his participation. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Injuries sustained by Rahim</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">24 </span>I deal first with the injuries sustained by Rahim.

Rahim fell and, while he was on the ground, that he was kicked by Mitho and was struggling vigorously against the three assailants.

</div> Rahim is first seen entering the frame and falling to the ground at “21:47:06”. The person identified as Mitho first enters the scene at “21:47:06”, and he proceeds to kick Rahim. Manik then enters the scene at “21:47:08”. The person identified as Aziz enters the scene at “21:47:10”. Each is seen holding objects with reflective surfaces at various times. Manik then leaves followed by the others, while Rahim runs off in a different direction, at “21:47:14”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">28 </span>The Prosecution argued for two reasons that Manik was holding a chopper in the Bus Camera Footage. First, the object that Manik was seen holding shared the same profile as the object seen in Mitho’s hand. As it was not disputed that Mitho had a chopper, this meant that Manik also had a chopper. However, I was not satisfied that the inference could be drawn. Even if the profile of the objects shared a superficial similarity, it was not clear on the evidence that a wooden stick would <span class="font-italic">not</span> have the same profile. The Bus Camera Footage at 21:47:14 (see P192) was not clear given that only one thin rectangular strip of light could be seen. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">29 </span>Second, the Prosecution submitted that the object seen could not be a wooden stick as it would not reflect light in that manner. There was some logical force to this argument. However, the rectangular strip relied on at “21:47:14” was not as bright as the other flashes of white at other parts of the Bus Camera Footage, where the weapons held by Aziz and Mitho were more clearly seen. When the object was seen at “21:47:07” (see P192), the object was not reflecting as much light, but shared the same dimensions. The Defence made the valid point that it was not explained why the object in Manik’s hand reflected light far fewer times than the objects in Aziz’s and Mitho’s hands. In the absence, therefore, of any reconstruction or other evidence about how different materials would look in those lighting conditions, specifically how wood might look in the same light, and without any expert explanation for the variance in the brightness of the object at different times, it was impossible to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that Manik held a chopper from the Bus Camera Footage alone. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">30 </span>I turn then to the reasons why I held that Manik was armed with a chopper. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Witness sightings of Manik with a chopper </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">31 </span>There were two principal witness sightings of Manik holding a chopper.

It was also important to note that this was a situation of five grown men squeezing into the backseat of a taxi which would normally only fit three. As such, given the degree of confusion expected, the exact order could be difficult to piece together. Despite these qualifications, however, the evidence was consistent that Manik was on the right side of the taxi, in particular, to the right of Mamun – Fahad, Mamun, and Goni maintained this, and Toton did not give evidence on the overall order of seating. This lent further credence to Mamun’s evidence that it was Manik who had the chopper when he entered, since it was the person on his right that had the chopper.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">41 </span>Manik sought to rely on the taxi’s camera footage to show that he had been seated in the middle.

</div> The Defence argued that this was proof that Manik had been sitting in the middle, to Mamun’s left and to the right of Toton and Fahad, such that when Toton and Fahad alighted, he was seated next to the left door and was the first to alight, presumably by the left door. The Prosecution noted, however, that Goni and Mamun were not captured in the footage, and that just because Manik was seen first did not mean that he was the first to alight from the left.

</div> I agreed with the Prosecution that the footage did not go so far as to prove that Manik was seated in the middle to Toton’s and Fahad’s right. In the absence of evidence of where Goni and Mamun were relative to the taxi, it could not be ruled out that Manik was seated on the right and was the first to alight from the right door, then went behind the taxi and to the left before walking in front of the taxi, or that Goni and Mamun had exited from the left first and were standing out of the view of the camera. I did not find that this aspect of the evidence cast doubt on Goni’s and Mamun’s testimonies concerning what Manik was holding when he entered the taxi.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">42 </span>Manik criticised Goni’s testimony as to what he did with his own chopper. In particular, Manik pointed to Goni’s testimony that he had rolled down a taxi window and threw his chopper out of the taxi. In cross-examination, Goni first claimed that he had wound down the right window, but then recanted and stated that it was the left window. This was when he claimed that as Manik entered the taxi, he was pushed to Mamun’s left.

There was no suggestion that Goni was involved in Rahim’s attack. Goni admitted from the beginning that he too had received a chopper during the distribution at Avenue 4 prior to the incident. If he had wished to contrive an account of how he threw away his chopper, easier circumventions were available. Third, in any case, the Defence’s suggestion assumed that there was only one chopper in the taxi. Their suggestion was that Goni had lied about disposing of his chopper through the window, and that the only chopper seen in the taxi – Goni’s chopper – was placed on Manik’s lap. This, however, ignored the history that both Goni and Manik were given choppers together with Mitho and Aziz at Avenue 4. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">45 </span>Mamun’s evidence was the most credible.

First, as noted above, I have found that Manik had entered the taxi from the right, and Mamun was clear that the person to his right had the chopper. His account of where Goni was relative to him was also consistent with Goni’s eventual testimony in cross-examination.

More fundamentally, if the object was on the ground, it would have been there throughout the footage. While I had found above that the Bus Camera Footage did not prove that he was holding a chopper, I also found that the present lie was motivated by a fear of the truth that he was, in fact, holding a chopper. The denial that he was holding the object that reflected some light – whether a wooden stick, chopper or otherwise – was a blatant attempt to diminish his role in the incident.

</div> Manik, when giving his EIC, tendered an extract from a Bengali-English dictionary to show the meaning of the word “<span class="font-italic">kop</span>” (to which the Prosecution did not raise any objections). It appears that the court interpreter accepted that “<span class="font-italic">kopa</span>” or “<span class="font-italic">kop</span>” were similar in meaning “depending on which part of Bangladesh” the words were used in, and, with reference to the dictionary, stated that the word “<span class="font-italic">kop</span>” or “<span class="font-italic">kopa</span>” was referring to the word “<span class="font-italic">kopano</span>”,

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">54 </span>In my view, the use of the word “kop” was not conclusive either way. This was because if the object had been a stick, “<span class="font-italic">kop</span>” would appear to have meant hit, and if it had been a chopper, it would have meant cut or slash. There was no definitive evidence that the word could not be used and was never used in the context of a stick. Because of this, the use of the term could not be taken as proof of or support that Manik used a chopper on the night in question. Hence, these various statements were not definitive of the issue of what Manik was carrying. In the context of my prior finding that he had a chopper, however, it would mean that a chopper was used to cut or slash. I return to the statements in the context of later issues to which they were relevant.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Did Manik inflict the Fatal Injury?</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">55 </span>I turn to the crucial question of whether Manik had inflicted the Fatal Injury. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Bus Camera Footage</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">56 </span>The Prosecution relied heavily on the Bus Camera Footage in its submissions.

The Prosecution submitted that, as between Manik and Aziz, the relative positions of each accused person and the direction of their strikes meant that it was an irresistible inference that it was Manik who inflicted the Fatal Injury. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">59 </span>In response, the Defence argued that the Bus Camera Footage did not show that Manik inflicted the Fatal Injury. They pointed out that Rahim’s legs were not in fact visible in the parts of the footage when Manik allegedly inflicted that injury (from “21:49:09” to “21:47:11”). The Bus Camera Footage, they argued, was recording in such low light and was of such a quality that the silhouette of Rahim was completely indiscernible for a period, until around “21:47:12”, which was just before he stood up and ran away at around “21:47:13”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">60 </span>In my judgment, it was not possible to discern from the Bus Camera Footage that Manik was the one who had inflicted the Fatal Injury. First, as the Defence rightly pointed out, the Bus Camera Footage was not of a very high quality, which problem was compounded by the darkness of many of the scenes, rendering it difficult to discern the positions of the various limbs. Further, at some points, the view of Rahim’s legs was obstructed by the bodies of the assailants. It was not clear from the Bus Camera Footage which particular slash caused the Fatal Injury.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">61 </span>In final written submissions, the Prosecution further provided a number of graphics which superimposed outlines of each person’s body onto screenshots from the Bus Camera Footage. These figures were not, however, simple observations but a series of extrapolations that made assumptions about how the limbs were positioned and moved, and sought to present clear lines where the Bus Camera Footage lacked definition. For example, the Prosecution’s diagram for the scene at “21:47:11” showed a detailed outline of Rahim’s legs when Aziz struck him. However, on a viewing of the Bus Camera Footage, Rahim’s legs were not entirely discernible at that point. The Prosecution’s diagrams were a plausible interpretation of the Bus Camera Footage, but as such, they were a possibility and not a certainty.  That being the case, the process for making these extrapolations and the drawing of these diagrams should have been tested as evidence in court, together with their various assumptions. These diagrams were moreover not put to Manik during trial. While Manik was cross-examined on certain scenes from the Bus Camera Footage, the graphics added interpretations to those scenes and should have been put to Manik during cross-examination. By leaving the diagrams to their final submissions, the Prosecution had deprived Manik of the opportunity of giving a specific response to the Prosecution’s interpretation of and assumptions made concerning the footage. In my view, the rule in <span class="font-italic">Browne v Dunn</span> (1893) 6 R 67 applied to this issue, as reaffirmed by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Sudha Natrajan v The Bank of East Asia Ltd</span> [2017] 1 SLR 141 at [48] (approved in the criminal context in <span class="font-italic">Harven a/l Segar v Public Prosecutor</span> [2017] 1 SLR 771 at [66]):  </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[W]here a submission is going to be made about a witness or the evidence given by the witness which is of such a nature and of such importance that it ought fairly to have been put to the witness to give him the opportunity to meet that submission, to counter it or to explain himself, then if it has not been so put, the party concerned will not be allowed to make that submission.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">62 </span>Second, the Prosecution’s submissions on the directions of the strikes made by each of the accused persons were also based on the Bus Camera Footage and, therefore, suffered similar limitations. The Bus Camera Footage allowed the court to observe some of the movements of the various assailants’ bodies and their arms, but it was unclear how this would affect the orientations of the wounds inflicted. Apart from broad movements of the bodies, the Bus Camera Footage did not show the details of each body part, especially the full range of movement of the arms and the weapons held in the accused persons’ hands. Further, elements such as the strength of the strike, the length of the swing, the angle at which the blade of the weapon contacted Rahim’s flesh, and the relative orientation of Rahim’s body to the strike, especially how each of these might affect the orientation of the wound inflicted, were not canvassed in evidence. The only thing offered by the Prosecution was its opinion that Manik’s strikes must have inflicted the Fatal Injury and that Aziz’ strikes did not. Once again, the Prosecution relied on the diagrams to show how the wounds were oriented. For the same reasons as above, I did not find it appropriate to rely on this evidence. The various submissions on the angles of the strikes and the wounds inflicted would have benefitted from expert evidence and a reconstruction of the Prosecution’s hypothesis. In the absence of such evidence, there was a risk of introducing speculation based on low-quality footage.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">63 </span>Third, on a viewing of the Bus Camera Footage, I did not find it sufficiently clear to conclude that it was <span class="font-italic">only</span> Manik who could have inflicted the Fatal Injury. Aziz made two key strikes against Rahim.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) In relation to Aziz’s strike at “21:47:11”, that analysis was based on an assumption of where Rahim’s legs were, the orientation of his legs, and the length of the strike. The Prosecution’s submission was that Aziz’s swing clearly went past Rahim’s legs. In my view, it was not so clear. There appeared on the face of the Bus Camera Footage to be the possibility that Rahim had in fact moved his body and legs in such a way that Aziz’s weapon would have caused the Fatal Injury. Rahim’s knees could be seen moving up to his body just before Aziz made his strike, and the subsequent frames lacked definition and his legs could not be clearly seen. Further, the Prosecution’s diagram sought to show Aziz’s weapon striking Rahim’s abdomen on the left side, but no injuries on the left side of Rahim’s torso was observed by Dr Chan in the autopsy. The only injury in that region was a small abrasion measuring 0.4cm x 0.4cm on the right iliac fossa, that is, near the <span class="font-italic">right</span> hip.

</div> This lent further credence to the possibility that Aziz had struck Rahim’s legs instead. In my view, there was a reasonable doubt raised by the possibility, on the Bus Camera Footage, that Aziz had struck Rahim’s legs and inflicted the Fatal Injury.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) In relation to Aziz’s strike at “21:47:12”, the real possibility that Aziz’s weapon had managed to strike Rahim’s left leg at an angle could not be ruled out, since it was not clear that Rahim had managed to shield his left leg completely by that point. Indeed, the Prosecution’s submissions were most plausible only if one were considering a stationery target. Where, as here, Rahim was struggling and moving, the inference sought by the Prosecution was not so easy to draw and gaps were left in the Prosecution’s case.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">64 </span>It was certainly possible, on the Bus Camera Footage, that Manik was the person responsible for the Fatal Injury; equally, Aziz could have been the person responsible. Neither could be proved beyond reasonable doubt, although it was clear that one of these two assailants must have inflicted the Fatal Injury. In the absence of sufficient evidence, or where the only evidence available required speculation and conjecture on the court’s part to support the inferences sought by the Prosecution, a reasonable doubt could arise: <span class="font-italic">Jagatheesan s/o Krishnasamy v Public Prosecutor</span> [2006] 4 SLR(R) 45 at [59].

Oral statements made by Manik to other persons could conceivably be proved against Manik if they amounted to admissions: see ss 17(1), 18(1) and 21 of the Evidence Act (Cap 97, 1997 Rev Ed). But in the present case it was not clear if it could be reliably determined what statements were actually made. First, in relation to a statement allegedly made in the getaway taxi after the incident, Mamun claimed that Manik told Toton that someone was chopped (“<span class="font-italic">kop</span>”). Toton, however, was unable to remember if there was a discussion in the taxi. According to Goni, Manik said that Aziz and Mitho had chopped (“<span class="font-italic">kop</span>”) somebody. Manik’s evidence was that he said nothing in the taxi.

Ripon was the only one to testify that Manik made reference to hitting Rahim’s leg, but even then, it was not clear if that was the Fatal Injury itself. In my judgment, it would be unsafe to rely on this evidence to find that Manik had inflicted the Fatal Injury. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Conclusion on attribution for the Fatal Injury</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">68 </span>As such, I concluded that the Prosecution had not proved its case beyond reasonable doubt that Manik was the one who inflicted the Fatal Injury on Rahim. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">69 </span>I deal briefly with the Defence’s contention that even if Manik did inflict the Fatal Injury, it was not intentionally inflicted. The Court of Appeal explained this requirement in <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v Lim Poh Lye</span><span class="font-italic"> and another</span> [2005] 4 SLR(R) 582 at [22] as follows: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">As stated in <span class="font-italic">Virsa Singh</span>, for an injury to fall within s 300(<span class="font-italic">c</span>), it must be one which, in the normal course of nature, would cause death and <span class="font-italic">must not be an injury that was accidental or </span><span class="font-italic">unintended, or that some other kind of injury was intended</span>. Whether a particular injury was accidental or unintended is a question of fact which has to be determined by the court in the light of the evidence adduced and taking into account all the surrounding circumstances of the case. [emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">70 </span>This contention is also important for my findings on the Prosecution’s Alternative Case. In my view, the person who inflicted the Fatal Injury would have done so intentionally, for the following reasons:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Even if Rahim was moving his legs, the wound was a long and deep one that must have been inflicted with sufficient force to cause fractures of the surrounding bone. It was clear that it could not have been an unintentional wound. The fact that Rahim was moving his legs does not give rise to a reasonable doubt that the injury was not intentionally inflicted. The weapon must have been swung at Rahim with force.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The injury was inflicted in the context of an attack when Rahim was on the floor and the assailants standing over him. There was nothing accidental about the Fatal Injury.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) While Dr Chan’s evidence was that save for the Fatal Injury and a wound to the back, all the other incised wounds were relatively superficial, there is no objective evidence to even raise a doubt that whoever struck the Fatal Injury in particular did not do so with intention.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The Alternative Case</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">71 </span>Having found that the Prosecution had not proved that Manik inflicted the Fatal Injury, I turn to the Alternative Case.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Necessity for common intention</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">72 </span>As the Prosecution was unable to establish that Manik inflicted the Fatal Injury, they required the mechanism of s 34 of the Penal Code to establish Manik’s liability for the offence. To rely on s 34, the Prosecution had to prove that the criminal act was done in furtherance of the common intention shared by Aziz, Mitho and Manik and that Manik had participated in the criminal act. In the present case, the requirements of criminal act and participation were not disputed. The issue was whether the infliction of the Fatal Injury was in furtherance of their common intention to cause s 300(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) injury. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">73 </span> I deal first with the Defence contention that because Manik was, on the Alternative Case, assumed to be a secondary offender, common intention could not be established in the absence of establishing the intention of the primary offender. The argument was that the Prosecution was required to first prove that all three elements in <span class="font-italic">Wang Wen</span><span class="font-italic">feng</span> ([16] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) were satisfied in respect of the primary offender, before considering the issue whether constructive liability could be imposed on secondary offenders, and in this case Mitho and Aziz were not arrested and tried.

</div>
</div> This argument assumed that s 34 could only operate if a “primary offender” who was individually liable was identified and the elements of the offence first proved against that “primary offender”. This was not so. Section 34 serves to impose liability on offenders in accordance with their common intention once they have participated in a particular criminal act, where the criminal act is commonly intended. This mechanism may be used where the “criminal act” has actors who assist in various parts of the act, or actors all performing the same act. The present case involved multiple actors, each of whom<span class="font-italic"> </span>could have potentially been responsible for the criminal act. All are liable so long as the common intention is proved.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">74 </span>The point is well illustrated by <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v Chia Kee Chen</span> <span class="font-italic">and another appeal</span> [2018] 2 SLR 249 (“<span class="font-italic">Chia Kee Chen</span>”). There, the victim had died from the accumulation of blows inflicted by the two accused, Chia and Febri, but it was “not <span class="font-italic">possible</span> to identify the mortal blow, let alone attribute it to either Chia or Febri” [emphasis in original]: <span class="font-italic">Chia Kee Chen</span> at [87]. In other words, it would not strictly have been possible to prove that either Chia or Febri was guilty of the primary offence, since it could not be proved which one had inflicted the s 300(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) injury. However, the Court of Appeal held that this was not relevant in <span class="font-italic">Chia Kee Chen</span> at [89]: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">It was thus clear that questions such as whether it was Chia or Febri who struck the mortal blow, or whether Febri had struck more blows than Chia, were ultimately irrelevant, <span class="font-italic">if</span> we were satisfied that Chia and Febri shared a common intention to inflict the particular s 300(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) injuries on the Deceased (these being the craniofacial injuries which were sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death) …</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">The Court of Appeal held that it was not necessary to identify who exactly had caused the victim’s death, which meant that it was not necessary to find that <span class="font-italic">one</span> of them was liable under s 300(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the Penal Code, since s 300(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the Penal Code requires that the act of the accused caused death. Instead, given the nature of s 34 of the Penal Code, exactly who satisfied the <span class="font-italic">actus reus</span> requirements under s 300(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the Penal Code was not a necessary question to resolve, as long as the criminal act was done in furtherance of the requisite common intention. Similarly in the present case, it is the common intention to inflict the particular s 300(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) injury that is crucial. It was not necessary to ascertain who struck the Fatal Injury, so long as I was able to infer, beyond reasonable doubt, that the requisite common intention was shared by the participants. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Content of common intention required</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">75 </span>I turn then to consider the content of the common intention required by the charge. While s 34 of the Penal Code may play different roles depending on the factual circumstance, there is no difference in the legal standard to be applied to common intention across these different situations. In the context of s 300(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) read with s 34 of the Penal Code, the requisite intention is the common intention to inflict s 300(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) injury. The Prosecution argued that the common intention only needed to be to inflict the injury, and the question of whether it was sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death was to be determined objectively, similar to individual liability under the same section. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">76 </span>Several reasons militate against such a reading. First, when the Court of Appeal held that the common intention for s 300(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) read with s 34 of the Penal Code was the common intention to inflict “s 300(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) injury”, it defined the phrase as the entire concept of “bodily injury which was sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death”: <span class="font-italic">Daniel Vijay</span> ([19] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) at [49]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">77 </span>Second, the Court of Appeal clearly distinguished between the elements of s 300(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the Penal Code as set out in <span class="font-italic">Virsa Singh</span> ([16] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) and the requirements for constructive liability under s 34 of the Penal Code, holding that the former was inappropriate for constructive liability and requiring a higher degree of intention for the latter: <span class="font-italic">Daniel Vijay</span> at [145]. Its object in so doing was explained at [167]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">It must be remembered that a charge of murder founded on s 300(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the Penal Code <span class="font-italic">read with s 34</span> (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, a charge against a <span class="font-italic">secondary offender</span>) is not the same as a charge against the actual doer (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the <span class="font-italic">primary </span>offender), which would be <span class="font-italic">based on s 300(c) alone</span>. In the latter case, it is not necessary to consider whether the actual doer intended to cause the victim s 300(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) injury; instead, it is only necessary to consider whether the actual doer subjectively intended to inflict the injury which was in fact inflicted on the victim and, if so, whether that injury which was in fact inflicted on the victim and, if so, whether that injury was, on an objective assessment, sufficiently serious to amount to s 300(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) injury. In contrast, in the former case (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, where a secondary offender is charged with murder under s 300(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) read with s 34), because of the express words “in furtherance of the common intention of all” in s 34, it is necessary to consider whether there was a common intention among all the offenders <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">to inflict s 300(c) injury on the victim (the inflicting of such injury being the criminal act which gives rise to the offence of s 300(c) murder)</span>. [emphasis in original in italics; emphasis added in bold italics]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">The Prosecution’s position contradicted this specific holding by the Court of Appeal, since their submissions effectively applied <span class="font-italic">Virsa Singh</span> again to s 300(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) read with s 34 of the Penal Code. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">78 </span>Third, the Court of Appeal also stated expressly that, in substance, the common intention to cause s 300(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) injury is “the same as a common intention <span class="font-italic">to cause death</span> by the infliction of the specific injury which was in fact caused to the victim” [emphasis added]: <span class="font-italic">Daniel Vijay</span> at [146]. Hence, the fatal nature of the injury had also to be commonly intended. In the same vein, in <span class="font-italic">Kho Jabing</span><span class="font-italic"> and another v Public Prosecutor </span>[2011] 3 SLR 634 (“<span class="font-italic">Kho Jabing</span>”)<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [32]–[35], V K Rajah JA referred to the “common intention to murder”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">79 </span>The Prosecution argued in their oral response that the approach of the Court of Appeal had shifted in <span class="font-italic">Chia Kee Chen</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>([74] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>)<span class="font-italic">. </span>I did not think so. At [46], the Court of Appeal reiterated that <span class="font-italic">Daniel Vijay</span> required common intention “specifically, a type of injury sufficient in the ordinary cause of nature to cause death and not any other type of injury”. At [88], the Court of Appeal referred to <span class="font-italic">Daniel Vijay</span> once more, identifying the common intention as the intention to inflict “the particular s 300(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) injury or injuries”. Having thus delineated “the particular s 300(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) injuries” the Court of Appeal then used the frame at [89], adding for good measure “(these being the craniofacial injuries which were sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death)”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">80 </span>Therefore, the Prosecution’s approach did not have support from the authorities. The necessary common intention under s 300(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) read with s 34 of the Penal Code is the common intention to inflict s 300(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) injury, not just a common intention to inflict injury, such injury then objectively being determined to be sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death. I turn, then, to the facts.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">What happened at Avenue 1?</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">81 </span>The Prosecution and Defence had significantly different versions of events that took place after Manik shook Rahim’s hand.

</div> this meant walking away from “G”, where the incident occurred. At this point, the two unknown assailants allegedly attacked Rahim from the back and then ran in the direction of “G”. Rahim then gave chase, and fell down at around “G” or “H”. Two problems arise on this account. First, the Bus Camera Footage did not capture anybody running ahead of Rahim. The Bus Camera Footage had a full field of vision covering the space between bus PA2494A and the row of buses on the other side of the carpark. From as far before the incident as the Bus Camera Footage went, starting at around “21:45:08”, just under two minutes before the incident, no one was captured running ahead in the same direction as Rahim. Secondly, the distance between where Rahim was allegedly first attacked and where he fell down was a short distance, around 15m according to Manik.

</div> Again, these allegations were not put to those who might have been able to respond. The rule in <span class="font-italic">Browne v Dunn</span> applied here as these were allegations that the witnesses should have, as a matter of fairness, been allowed to explain or counter (see [61] above). The allegations that the statement recorder and/or the interpreter either added a sentence or failed to take note of key words like “probably” or “likely” were serious and of such a nature that they should have been allowed to respond. In the absence of that cross-examination, therefore, I found that Manik could not now suggest that the statement was incorrectly recorded. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">86 </span>In fact, on Manik’s own evidence, he was acquainted with Aziz and Mitho and saw them at the Canteen in Avenue 4 that night in question, although his evidence was that he did not speak to them as he claimed that he did not know them well. On his own account, they also happened to be in the group going towards Avenue 1, and went up to talk to Toton when Toton exited the taxi. I found Manik’s attempts to distance himself by claiming that he did not recognise the other two persons to be incredible. It contradicted his unqualified identification of the two other assailants in his statement. On his evidence, he would have been attacking Rahim with two strangers, which was incredible and inconsistent with the Bus Camera Footage. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">87 </span>As to his claim at trial that he did not know that the other two assailants were using knives until Aziz started to attack Rahim, Manik could not be believed. First, this claim was inconsistent with the previous account given in his statement P186 at para 5.6, where he claimed that he had seen the assailant carrying a <span class="font-italic">knife</span> when Rahim fell down. This followed his claim at para 5.2 of his statement that Aziz and Mitho had “chopped Rahim when Rahim was running away”, resulting in Rahim falling down.

</div> he knew that they were intending to resolve the conflict over the sale of contraband cigarettes at Avenue 1. At Avenue 1, Aziz and Mitho spoke with Toton when he exited the taxi. Toton engaged with Rahim, and at around this time, Manik went to shake Rahim’s hand. Toton suggested to Rahim to go to Avenue 6 to talk, but in a subsequent confusion, Rahim fled, and was chased down by Mitho, Manik, and Aziz, in that order. Manik knew that it was Rahim that he was attacking. They attacked Rahim, each with a chopper, and after a few seconds, Rahim managed to get up and run away, while the three assailants left. The Fatal Injury was caused by one of the three. The crucial question was whether the court could draw the inference that Manik shared the common intention to cause s 300(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) injury to Rahim. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Was there the requisite common intention?</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">89 </span>It was a matter of evidence whether the requisite common intention could be inferred.

It is useful at this juncture to recap the Prosecution’s case on common intention. The Prosecution argued that the common intention to cause s 300(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) injury had arisen in advance of the incident or that the common intention arose, at latest, when they gave chase to Rahim. In terms of a plan to cause s 300(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) injury, the Prosecution highlighted (i) that the three of them were aware that the syndicate planned to fight with the rival syndicate; (ii) that the three had sufficient motive to cause s 300(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) injury to Rahim, because they wanted to send a deterrent message and to protect their income; and (iii) that the three of them had armed themselves with choppers in advance of the incident, and choppers, by their nature, were “apt to cause <span class="font-italic">deep incised wounds</span>, which are sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death”. The Prosecution further argued that, in any case, the common intention arose at the latest when they chased after Rahim, because (i) the three of them gave chase almost immediately when Rahim ran away and they used weapons against Rahim when he fell to the ground; (ii) all three used choppers, which showed an intention to cause s 300(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) injury; and (iii) their attack on Rahim was ferocious.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">91 </span>Nevertheless, the evidence surrounding the discussion of the confrontation and the distribution of weapons suggested that there was no plan to cause s 300(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) injury from the outset. Ripon testified that the instructions given were that they would only fight back if the rival syndicate fought first. There was no plan to kill anyone.

But they did not provide any details as to Manik’s position or ambitions in their testimony. Manik’s direct superior Shopon, was not called as a witness. There was therefore no evidence on which to contradict Manik’s claims that he was earning around $10 to $15 a day from the syndicate, and that he was working under Shopon selling cigarettes. This was a significant point, as it ran counter to the Prosecution’s hypothesis that Manik was willing to attack Rahim intending to cause s 300(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) injury in order to protect a lucrative business and to advance his personal standing in the syndicate. Manik’s case was that there was little incentive for him to commit murder on behalf of the syndicate.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">100 </span>The Prosecution evidence did show that Manik would have an incentive to impress Toton. In assessing the above evidence, I also took into account that it would be natural for the Prosecution witnesses, given their involvement and friendship with Manik, to be circumspect with the full truth. The contraband cigarette business was seen by the syndicates as lucrative, and Manik would have had a motive to prove himself to Toton and Shopon. The issue was whether this motive led logically to an inference of the necessary intention. Even on the Prosecution case, it was difficult to understand what Manik would have achieved by sharing a common intention with Mitho and Aziz to cause an injury that could in the ordinary cause of nature be sufficient to cause Rahim’s death. His motive was to impress Toton and Shopon and be given greater responsibility and share in the business. This motive would militate against a motive to cause serious injury to Rahim, which would upend all such aspirations. The greater scrutiny after such an event would detrimentally affect the syndicate’s business and even his continued employment in Singapore.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Surrounding circumstances</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">101 </span>Additionally, the surrounding circumstances pointed away from a finding that all three men held a common intention to cause s 300(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) injury. This undermined both the Prosecution’s argument that there was a pre-arranged plan to cause such injury and that the common intention arose on the spot just before the offence was committed. First, the medical evidence militated against a finding that the plan (either pre-arranged or emerging on the spot) was to inflict s 300(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) injury.

The wounds should be considered in the context of the strikes performed by each accused person. From the Bus Camera Footage, it can be seen that Mitho (discounting the various kicks) performed approximately two to three strikes, Manik performed three strikes, and Aziz performed five strikes. A wound on Rahim’s back that reached the muscle was described as a secondary cause of death as it contributed to the haemorrhage, while the others were superficial or just skin-deep.

None of the incised wounds were directed at what would typically be considered “vulnerable” parts of the body, <span class="font-italic">eg</span> the head, the chest or the abdomen. Rather, the majority of wounds were inflicted on Rahim’s limbs and back. The Bus Camera Footage did not show any attempts to strike directly at particularly vulnerable parts of Rahim’s body. The attack itself began with Mitho kicking Rahim a number of times, contrary to the Prosecution’s suggestion that the assailants had immediately started hacking at Rahim when he fell down.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">104 </span>The Prosecution sought to contend that it could well be that it was either the assailants’ ineptitude or Rahim’s defensive responses that rendered the injuries less serious than they otherwise would have been, and that the common intention could be inferred from the fact that the three assailants had armed themselves with choppers which were apt to cause “deep incised wounds, which are sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death”. In my view, such an inference could be drawn in a suitable case, but in the present case, the injuries caused militated against such an inference. The lack of serious injury other than the Fatal Injury raised a reasonable doubt that such was the case. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">105 </span>Conversely, the apparent violence of the attack and the medical evidence were at odds with each other. While the actions of the assailants captured on the Bus Camera Footage showed large arm movements from the assailants wielding choppers, the objective evidence of the injuries belied the apparent ferocity of the attack. The Prosecution contended that the attack on Rahim was intended to send a message. It was marking its territory and warding off any competitors. This argument would detract from any intention to cause a fatal injury, which would call the scene to the attention of the police and enforcement authorities. It explains, rather, the incongruity between the injuries caused and the nature of the attack.  The assailants simply wished to demonstrate their force without going so far as to inflict fatal wounds. In this context, even if they were reckless as to whether a fatal injury would be caused, this would be insufficient to show common intention to do so: see <span class="font-italic">Daniel Vijay</span> ([19] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) at [87]-[88].  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">106 </span>A final indication was the timing of the exit of the three men, in the light of their perceived knowledge at the time. The attack, while apparently ferocious, relented after less than nine seconds (from “21:47:06” to “21:47:15” on the Bus Camera Footage). Rahim managed to get up and run 27m away. The assailants did not give chase. If their intent was to cause such injury as would in the ordinary course of nature be sufficient to cause death, they appeared unconcerned that they had not accomplished their objective. Manik, in particular, left the scene about one second before Aziz and Mitho did. He did so after seeing Rahim get up. Further, while Manik was running away, he turned back and would have seen that Rahim had left.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">107 </span>Viewing the evidence as a whole, the Prosecution’s case that the men shared the intention to cause s 300(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) injury was a possibility, but such a possibility was insufficient to satisfy the burden of proof. Where there is a reasonable inference that is more favourable to the accused, the court should act in accordance with the presumption of innocence and prefer the favourable inference. After an extensive examination of the authorities in Singapore and in other jurisdictions, V K Rajah J (as he then was) summarised the law on the drawing of inferences in criminal cases in <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v Chee Cheong Hin Constance </span>[2006] 2 SLR(R) 24<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [85]; approved by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Tan Chor Jin v Public Prosecutor</span> [2008] 4 SLR(R) 306 at [34]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">In a criminal case, proof beyond any reasonable doubt is required. Grave suspicion is no substitute for proof beyond reasonable doubt. In the same vein, moral certainty cannot replace the requirement for explicit and certain evidence. The various links in the interlocking chain of evidence must establish a complete chain that rules out any reasonable likelihood of an accused’s innocence. Guilt must be the only rational inference and conclusion to be drawn from the complete chain of evidence. In assessing the circumstances, the court should discount fanciful or speculative possibilities. However, <span class="font-italic">if more than one reasonable inference can be elicited from the factual matrix, the inference most sympathetic to the accused ought to be used</span>. [emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">108 </span>I therefore concluded that the Prosecution had not proven the common intention to cause s 300(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) injury, and thus its Alternative Case, beyond reasonable doubt. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Amendment of charge</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">What inference could be drawn about their common intention?</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">109 </span>Notwithstanding that there was no common intention to cause s 300(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) injury, the intention to cause grievous hurt to Rahim was clear and I turn to explain this. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">110 </span>First, I considered whether there was evidence of a pre-arranged plan to do something less than inflict s 300(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) injury. Manik’s conduct on that day was completely in sync with some kind of plan.  The Prosecution witnesses were consistent throughout that Manik was a part of the plan to go to Avenue 1 to confront the rival syndicate. He had been armed by syndicate members together with Aziz, Mitho, and Goni. Ripon went so far as to testify that Manik had been left in charge of that group after Toton and Emon had left Avenue 4.

</div> At Avenue 1 itself, Manik appeared to act without hesitation and was clearly pursuing Rahim intentionally. The Bus Camera Footage shows clearly that all three assailants were acting together. After the incident, Manik entered the taxi and none of the other persons, including Toton, raised any concerns with this. On Manik’s own account, Sohel had asked him into the taxi.

While the statements were not consistent one with the other, the gist of the evidence was that Manik admitted that he “chopped” (“<span class="font-italic">kop</span>”) Rahim, even though it was unclear as to whether Manik had inflicted the Fatal Injury. In this context, Manik’s evidence must be assessed, as it was telling. He said that Sohel and Fahad were angry with him, so it was clear that they had a plan, and he had not conformed to the plan or expectation. He sought to reassure them with the following, and claimed to have said to Fahad and Sohel:

But what was clear was the concession that he had made some kind of statement in response to the consternation expressed.

</div> testified to about the Canteen conversation, that the choppers were for their own defence, only for use if attacked. This was ruled out by Mitho’s and Manik’s immediate reaction to Aziz’s signal in the context of their meeting earlier in the evening and Manik’s meeting with Toton at Avenue 1 prior to Toton confronting Rahim. Furthermore, common intention may be formed on the spot, just before the commission of the criminal act: see <span class="font-italic">Shaiful Edham bin Adam and another v Public Prosecutor</span> [1999] 1 SLR(R) 442<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [60]. In my view, the intention of the men were formed prior to Toton confronting Rahim but it was clear that the intent of the three men were formed, at the very latest, as they chased and caught up with Rahim. Rahim was not armed, and sought to run away. If the plan of the three men was simply to intimidate him, it would have been completed at that point. Instead they chased in concert after him. There was no real need to use their choppers after they caught up with Rahim either. Rahim had fallen to the ground and was unarmed. When they started to use their choppers, their joint action in slashing Rahim around 10 times in total with their choppers was sufficient to show common intention to cause hurt which endangered his life. In this context and to this extent, I agree with the Prosecution that an inference may be drawn from the fact that the men were armed with choppers, which were associated with and apt to cause serious injury, and did, in this case, cause fatal injury. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">114 </span>Therefore, I found that it was beyond reasonable doubt that “Aziz”, “Mitho” and Manik shared a common intention to attack Rahim with their choppers in order to cause grievous hurt. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Amended charge</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">115 </span>Therefore, I considered that it was appropriate to alter the charge to one under s 326 read with s 34 of the Penal Code, pursuant to the court’s power under s 128 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 2012 Rev Ed) (“CPC”). In the present case, grievous hurt was caused as Rahim had died: the hurt caused was death under s 320(<span class="font-italic">aa</span>) of the Penal Code. The accused persons used choppers, which were instruments for cutting. In the context of grievous hurt, the necessary common intention does not need to be to cause the particular grievous hurt inflicted, but need only be to cause an injury within the category of hurt as defined under s 320 of the Penal Code: <span class="font-italic">Arumugam Selvaraj v Public Prosecutor</span> [2019] 5 SLR 881 at [10]. In my view, the common intention to cause grievous hurt was satisfied given the use of the choppers, the nature of the attack, and the injuries caused. The common intention was to inflict hurt which endangered life. The criminal act, participation, and common intention elements were satisfied. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">116 </span>The amended charge was read and explained to Manik on 18 June 2020: s 128(2) of the CPC. He confirmed that he was ready to be tried on the altered charge: s 129 of the CPC. Mr Thuraisingam confirmed that he was not seeking to adduce any new evidence or to recall any witness: s 131 of the CPC. I proceeded immediately with trial as I was of the view that no prejudice would be occasioned to either the Prosecution or the Defence (s 129(3) of the CPC). Based on my findings above, I found Manik guilty of the altered charge and convicted him accordingly.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Sentencing</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">117 </span>Manik was accordingly convicted on a single charge under s 326 read with s 34 of the Penal Code. At Manik’s sentencing, with his consent, a second charge of theft of a roll of copper wire together with another, while being employed as a servant, under s 381 read with s 34 of the Penal Code, was taken into consideration for the purpose of sentencing. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">118 </span>The Prosecution sought a sentence of at least 15 years’ imprisonment and 14 strokes of the cane. The Defence argued that a sentence of ten years’ imprisonment and ten strokes of the cane would be sufficient.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">119 </span>I start with the appropriate approach to take in sentencing under s 326 of the Penal Code. I took reference from Menon CJ’s decision in <span class="font-italic">Ng Soon Kim v Public Prosecutor</span> [2019] SGHC 247 (“<span class="font-italic">Ng Soon Kim</span>”) at [12] which dealt with s 324 of the Penal Code. Section 324 of the Penal Code stands in relation to s 323 of the Penal Code in a similar manner as s 326 stands in relation to s 325. Hence, I took the following approach: first, to consider the indicative sentence if the charge had been under s 325 of the Penal Code, second, to consider an uplift for the nature of the dangerous means used, and third, to adjust the sentence according to the aggravating and mitigating factors. Defence counsel used a 2-step approach in his submissions based on in <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v BDB</span> [2018] 1 SLR 127 (“<span class="font-italic">BDB</span>”) by considering the appropriate sentence with reference to <span class="font-italic">BDB </span>and applying an uplift for the weapon. Defence agreed that this approach was similar to the Prosecution’s approach, as in any case further aggravating or mitigating factors were relevant after the uplift for the weapon used. The first step is to consider the sentence under s 325 of the Penal Code. The approach stated by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">BDB</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [55] is to first consider the seriousness of the injury and to arrive at an indicative starting sentence and then apply adjustments for culpability and aggravating and/or mitigating factors. The adjustment for aggravating and mitigating factors is to be done under the third step under <span class="font-italic">Ng Soon Kim</span>, so the focus in this step is to consider what the starting sentence would be under s 325 of the Penal Code, having regard to the hurt caused. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">120 </span>Here, death was caused. The Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">BDB</span> noted that in such cases, the starting point would be around eight years’ imprisonment, and 12 or more strokes of the cane may be warranted: <span class="font-italic">BDB</span> at [76]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">121 </span>Second, I come to an uplift for the dangerous means used. These were choppers. The assailants would have been aware of serious endangerment to life arising. Choppers are amongst the most dangerous types of weapons. By the very purpose of their invention, as the Prosecution pointed out, they are capable of cutting through bone, muscle and arteries. An uplift of three years’ imprisonment was warranted.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">122 </span>The third step involved a consideration of the mitigating and aggravating factors.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">123 </span>I dealt first with the mitigating factors raised by the Defence. The Defence stated Manik was genuinely remorseful and had cooperated with investigations. I did not find that this was entirely the case. Manik denied having a chopper at the material time, which I found to be untrue. He also raised various claims in his defence at trial that were inconsistent with his recorded statement and attempted to distance himself from the attack. While I did not hold these against him in sentencing, I did not find that the evidence showed genuine remorse. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">124 </span>The Defence also argued that there was an inordinate delay in prosecuting Manik’s case, noting that he had been arrested and held without bail since 30 September 2016, while his trial only commenced in January 2020. As explained in <span class="font-italic">Ang Peng Tiam v Singapore Medical Council</span> [2017] 5 SLR 356 at [110], however, that here is “no general proposition that any or all delays in prosecution would merit a discount in sentencing”. In the present case there has been no inordinate delay nor has there been any prejudice or injustice. It was sufficient to backdate his sentence to his first date of remand. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">125 </span>At the sentencing hearing, Manik tendered a letter to the court on his personal circumstances. He claimed to be the sole breadwinner and that he has family members in Bangladesh who are dependent on him. As explained in <span class="font-italic">Lai Oei Miu Jenny v Public Prosecutor</span> [1993] 2 SLR(R) 406 at [10], personal circumstances and hardship like these are not in general mitigating, short of any particularly exceptional personal circumstances, which I did not find in this case.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">126 </span>I turn to the aggravating factors in this case, and in the present case, I found quite a few. First, there was planning and premeditation. The group of three was actually part of a larger group assembled to intimidate and to outnumber the rival syndicate in the planned “discussion” with the rival syndicate. Manik and the two other assailants also received their choppers beforehand and brought them to the scene of the attack. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">127 </span>Second, a key aspect of this case was group violence, which carries a high risk of uncontrollable consequences. As V K Rajah J (as he then was) noted in <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v Law Aik Meng</span> [2007] 2 SLR(R) 814 at [25(b)], group offences are aggravating because they generally result in greater harm, the victim is likely to be in greater fear, and group pressure to perpetuate such offences may add to their persistency, and group dynamics necessarily imply greater damage. Group offences involving syndicates also generated wider societal harm, especially in areas where there is a high concentration of residents in nearby areas. This was certainly the case here. This happened in the vicinity of the Tuas dormitories, where a high number of workers reside. As was observed by Tay Yong Kwang JC (as he then was) in <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v Muhamad Hasik bin Sahar</span> [2002] 1 SLR(R) 1069 at [39]: “Gang fights and running street battles have absolutely no place in a civilised society.”</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">128 </span>A third aspect was the profit incentive in the context of a syndicate. The offence was committed as part of the contraband cigarette syndicate’s confrontation with a rival syndicate. It arose from the need to maintain their turf, and source of profits. This sort of territoriality was unacceptable, particularly in light of the severe violence it was apt to produce. The need for deterrence against the formation of syndicates, their attendant territoriality, and whatever criminal means they use to assert that territoriality was high. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">129 </span>Fourth, and coming to the specific incident, this attack was vicious and terrifying. The victim was unarmed and on the floor. He was alone and vulnerable, unable to defend himself effectively against his three assailants.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">130 </span>To account for these aggravating factors, I applied a further uplift of four years’ imprisonment, bringing the total imprisonment term to 15 years. In respect of the number of strokes of the cane, an uplift was also applied on account of the weapon used and aggravating factors. Taking matters in the round and having reference to Prosecution’s submissions, I added another 3 strokes of the cane. The sentence was accordingly 15 years’ imprisonment and 15 strokes of the cane.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">131 </span>In terms of sentencing precedents, the Prosecution highlighted that, the most similar case that they had found, although no grounds of decision were published, was the case of <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v Muhammad Faizal bin Md Jamal</span> HC/CC 4/2019, where the accused was charged under s 326 read with s 34 of the Penal Code. In that case, the accused was a member of a secret society, and had rallied together with other members to confront the two victims who had affronted another member of the secret society. The accused himself was not armed with a weapon, but another member, one Khalid, was. Khalid stabbed one of the victims repeatedly and the accused also joined in by punching and kicking. One victim died from the stab wounds, while the other suffered a laceration and haematoma. The accused pleaded guilty to the charge for causing hurt to the deceased victim. He was sentenced to eight years’ and six months’ imprisonment and eight strokes of the cane. I agreed with the Prosecution that the present case is significantly more serious than <span class="font-italic">Muhammad Faizal</span>. Unlike the accused in <span class="font-italic">Muhammad Faizal</span>, Manik did not plead guilty. Faizal was not armed, Manik was armed with a chopper. All the members of the trio in the present case were armed with choppers and planned the attack for the specific purpose of advancing the profit aims of the syndicate. The differential, both in the imprisonment and strokes of the cane, was appropriate in my view. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">132 </span>Another case relevant – and familiar in the earlier context of common intention to cause s 300(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) injury – was that of Galing, the accomplice of Kho Jabing in <span class="font-italic">Kho Jabing</span> ([78] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>). The two accomplices had attacked two men as part of a robbery, one of whom subsequently died from head wounds inflicted by Kho Jabing with a piece of wood. Galing had also assaulted the deceased with a belt with an exposed metal buckle. After the attack, Galing took away the deceased’s mobile phone. The Court of Appeal substituted his conviction for murder with an offence of robbery with hurt committed in furtherance of a common intention under s 394 read with s 34 of the Penal Code: <span class="font-italic">Kho Jabing</span> at [38]. Galing was later sentenced in respect of this substituted offence to 18 years’ and 6 months’ imprisonment and 19 strokes of the cane. The grounds for this decision were not reported, although the result was mentioned in <span class="font-italic">P</span><span class="font-italic">ublic Prosecutor v Kho Jabing</span> [2013] SGHC 251 at [5]. The particular offence was different. The offence of robbery with hurt carries a higher maximum than grievous hurt with dangerous weapons in terms of a term of years, whereas s 326 provides for the possibility of life imprisonment and s 394 does not. It was nevertheless useful for comparison for reasons of overall fairness in its context of a violent group attack in public for an underlying financial reason. The present case could be said to have more serious elements of syndicate participation, planning and pre-arranged weapons. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">133 </span>I also considered the case of <span class="font-italic">Sinniah Pillay v Public Prosecutor</span> [1991] 2 SLR(R) 704 (“<span class="font-italic">Sinniah Pillay</span>”). In that case, the accused and the co-accused had conspired to cause grievous hurt to the victim. Pursuant to that conspiracy, one or more of the accused persons had splashed acid on the victim, causing several burns that resulted in his death. The accused was sentenced to ten years’ imprisonment which, at the time, was the maximum term of years that could be imposed under s 326 of the Penal Code. From the evidence, it appears that the motive was revenge: <span class="font-italic">Sinniah Pillay</span> at [5], as the accused felt wronged by the deceased in a prior dispute. The accused hired the co-conspirators to attack the deceased for $5,000, of which $2,000 was paid. The Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal against sentence and refused to backdate the sentence to the date of remand: <span class="font-italic">Sinniah Pillay</span> at [27]–[29]. <span class="font-italic">Sinniah Pillay </span>was helpful as an example of when the maximum term of years was imposed for s 326 of the Penal Code. In my judgment, the present offence was not less serious than the offence in <span class="font-italic">Sinniah Pillay</span>. Death was caused, multiple people were involved, and there was an underlying dispute that the accused persons in both cases sought to resolve by violence. The present case was even more aggravated because of syndicate involvement. The sentence of 15 years’ imprisonment and 15 strokes of the cane was therefore appropriate. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">134 </span>I therefore sentenced Manik to 15 years’ imprisonment and 15 strokes of the cane. The term of imprisonment was backdated to the date of his remand, being 30 September 2016.</div><div class="Judg-Sign text-left">Valerie Thean<br/>Judge</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Kumaresan s/o Gohulabalan, Andre Chong Wei Min and Grace Chua Zhu Ern (Attorney-General’s Chambers) for the Prosecution;</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Eugene Singarajah Thuraisingam and Chooi Jing Yen (Eugene Thuraisingam LLP) for the accused.</div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"> </div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
