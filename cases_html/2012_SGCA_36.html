<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       By an action in the High Court, OMG Holdings Pte
                    Ltd (“the appellant”) sued Pos Ad Sdn Bhd (“the
                    respondent”) for arrears of royalty payments pursuant to a sub-licensing
                    agreement. The trial judge (“the Judge”) held, <em>inter alia</em>, first, that the appellant should not be allowed to
                    retain the royalties collected during the period between 22 April 1999 and
                    1 July 2002 as it did not then have any rights to sub-license; and, second,
                    that cl 9.3 of an agreement dated 1 July 2004 between the parties
                    (“the 2004 Agreement”) was in restraint of trade (see <em>OMG Holdings Pte Ltd v Pos Ad Sdn </em><em>Bhd</em> [2011] SGHC 246 (“the Judgment”)). The
                    appellant appealed against the aforementioned rulings.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       After hearing the submissions of both parties,
                    we allowed the appeal only in relation to the issue of royalties collected
                    during the period between 22 April 1999 and 1 July 2002. We now give
                    our reasons.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Facts</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Parties to the dispute</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       The appellant is a Singapore incorporated
                    company that provides in-store advertising programs and products. The appellant
                    was the licensor of a system known as the ActMedia system (“the Licensed
                    System”) for Singapore, Indonesia, Philippines, Thailand, Malaysia and
                    Hong Kong. The appellant had acquired the exclusive right to use the Licensed
                    System within the aforementioned countries through a master licence agreement
                    (“the Master Licence Agreement”) which it had entered into with
                    ActMedia Canada Inc (a Canadian company which developed the Licensed System) on
                    30 June 1993. In return, the appellant paid ActMedia Canada Inc a royalty
                    fee every quarter for this licence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       The respondent is a Malaysian incorporated
                    company which provides advertising media services to various brand owners for
                    the marketing of their products in supermarkets across Malaysia. The appellant
                    sub-licensed its right to the exclusive use of the Licensed System to the
                    respondent pursuant to a sub-licence agreement dated 1 July 1993
                    (“the 1993 Agreement”).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Background to the dispute</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       The Master Licence Agreement between the
                    appellant and ActMedia Canada Inc was terminated on 22 April 1999.
                    Consequently, on 28 June 2000, the appellant and the respondent entered
                    into a Surrender of Licence Agreement (“the Surrender Agreement”)
                    which provided that the 1993 Agreement was surrendered (effective 22 April
                    1999) following the termination of the Master Licence Agreement between ActMedia
                    Canada Inc and the appellant. The 1993 Agreement was later replaced with another
                    agreement dated 1 July 2002 (“the 2002 Agreement”); this
                    agreement was varied twice by two addenda signed by the parties on 13 May
                    2003 and 28 January 2004 respectively. During the period between the
                    termination of the Master Licence Agreement (which led to the execution of the
                    Surrender Agreement) and the entry into the 2002 Agreement (<em>ie</em>, between 22 April 1999 and 1 July 2002; hereinafter
                    referred to as the “interim period”), the appellant continued to
                    license the respondent to use the Licensed System and the respondent continued
                    to make royalty payments to the appellant in accordance with the rates provided
                    in the 1993 Agreement.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       Upon the expiry of the 2002 Agreement on
                    30 June 2004, the parties entered into the 2004 Agreement. Under the 2004
                    Agreement, the respondent was to pay to the appellant royalties amounting to 7%
                    of the former’s gross revenue generated from use of the Licensed System
                    and associated products. Of especial relevance is cl 9.3 of the 2004
                    Agreement, which stated:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Upon the termination of this Agreement, the Licensee shall return to the
                        Licensor copies of all manuals or similar written materials regarding the
                        Licensed System furnished to the Licensee hereunder. Upon any such
                        termination, the Licensee shall retain no rights to the Licensed System or
                        any part thereof, all such rights having been deemed to have been
                        surrendered to the Licensor. <em>For the avoidance of doubt,
                            the Licensee hereby agrees that upon termination of this Agreement, it
                            will refrain from making use of the Licensed System, or any part
                            thereof, or anything resembling or similar to the said
                            system.</em></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       The “Licensed System” was defined
                    in Recital 2 of the 2004 Agreement as:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">the Name, Licensed Marks and Licensed Products.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       “Licensed Marks” was defined in
                    Recital 1 of the 2004 Agreement as “various logos and intellectual
                    property”. The “Name” was not defined. “Licensed
                    Products” was defined at Schedule A to the 2004 Agreement as including

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     The appellant terminated the 2004 Agreement on
                    3 March 2009 on account of the respondent’s failure to pay RM
                    967,753.45 in royalties (as at 31 December 2008).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Pleadings </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     The appellant initiated legal proceedings
                    against the respondent for (a) arrears of outstanding royalty payments for the
                    period between December 2007 and December 2008 under the 2004 Agreement, which
                    as at 31 December 2008 amounted to RM 967,753.45; (b) an account of all
                    revenue received and profit generated from the respondent’s breach of cl
                    9.3 of the 2004 Agreement; (c) an injunction to restrain the respondent’s

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     In response, the respondent counterclaimed for
                    (a) damages for fraudulent misrepresentation and rescission of the 2004
                    Agreement, alleging that the appellant had made various pre-contractual
                    misrepresentations in relation to the agreements signed in 1993, 2002 and 2004;
                    (b) return of the royalties paid from 2003 to 2007 on the basis that, first, the
                    2004 Agreement was wrongfully terminated and the appellant had failed to inform
                    it that the Master Licence Agreement had been terminated on 22 April 1999,
                    and, second, that the Surrender Agreement was erroneously prepared and
                    imprecise; and (c) a declaration that cl 9.3 of the 2004 Agreement constituted
                    an unreasonable restraint of trade and was therefore invalid.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     The appellant pleaded the following in the
                    Statement of Claim (Amendment No 2) in relation to the issues on appeal:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_13-p2_a"></a>(a)     that it has “significant
                        goodwill in the Licensed Products and Licensed System … in Asia which
                        are used in the in-store marketing of consumer package goods in
                        supermarkets, hypermarkets, personal care stores and mass-merchandisers more
                        particularly described in Schedule A of [the 2004 Agreement]. The Licensed
                        Products and [the Licensed System] have been in use in Asia and currently in
                        use in <em>inter alia</em> Singapore, Malaysia,
                        Thailand, Phillipines, Hong Kong and Taiwan”; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_13-p2_b"></a>(b)     that the respondent expressly
                        acknowledged the above in the 2004 Agreement.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     The respondent pleaded the following in its
                    Defence and Counterclaim (Amendment No 2) in relation to the issues on
                    appeal:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_14-p2_a"></a>(a)     it denied that the appellant has
                        goodwill in the Licensed Products and Licensed System;
                    and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_14-p2_b"></a>(b)     it asserted
                        that cl 9.3 of the 2004 Agreement is unlawful in its operation as an
                        unreasonable restraint of trade, in particular:</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_14-p2_b-p3_i"></a>(i)       the phrase “anything
                            resembling or similar to the said system” constitutes an
                            unreasonable restraint of trade, restricting the respondent’s
                            freedom to make use of any other products resembling or similar to the
                            Licensed System upon termination of the 2004 Agreement;
                        and</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_14-p2_b-p3_ii"></a>(ii)       cl
                            9.3 exists in perpetuity and on a worldwide
                basis.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Decision below</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     The Judge allowed the appellant’s claim
                    in relation to the royalty payments outstanding up to 3 March 2009 (but
                        <em>not</em> for royalties accrued post-termination for
                    the period between 3 March 2009 and 3 May 2009), which amounted to RM
                    1,161,253.45. However, the Judge found that the plaintiff did not have any
                    rights to the Licensed System which it could sub-license during the interim
                    period. It was undisputed that a total of RM 840,236.49 was paid by the

                    of payment as provided under the 1993 Agreement). Consequently, the Judge
                    ordered the appellant to return to the respondent the royalties paid during the
                    interim period. Accordingly, the respondent was ordered to pay to the appellant
                    a total of RM 321,016.96.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     The remainder of the appellant’s claim

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     In these grounds we intend to address only the
                    issue of the Judge’s ruling that the royalties paid during the interim
                    period should be returned by the appellant to the respondent. The other ground
                    of appeal raised by the appellant (<em>ie</em>, that the
                    Judge erred in finding that cl 9.3 of the 2004 Agreement was in restraint of
                    trade) was without merit. We agreed with the reasoning of the Judge that the
                    ambit of cl 9.3 was “simply too wide to be reasonable” (see
                    [25]–[29] of the Judgment) and this ground of the appeal was accordingly
                    dismissed. We do not propose to say anything more on it.</p>

                    irreparable prejudice (that cannot be compensated by costs) will be occasioned
                    to the other party (see <em>Lu Bang Song v

                    appropriate, overcome defects in the pleadings provided that the other party is
                    not taken by surprise or irreparably prejudiced (see <em>Lu Bang

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     In <em>Lu Bang Song</em>,
                    a case involving personal injuries which arose out of an industrial accident,
                    the plaintiff’s pleaded case was that insufficient workers were assigned
                    to assist him in discharging pre-mixed concrete from a metal bucket at the site
                    where he was carrying out works. The district judge based his decision on
                    additional grounds which did not form part of the plaintiff’s pleaded
                    case, <em>viz</em>, <em>inter
                        alia</em>, that the plaintiff’s co-workers assigned by the
                    employers were in dereliction of their duties and that the employers were
                    thereby vicariously liable for those workers’ failure. Crucially, no
                    questions relating to the aforesaid grounds were put to the employers’
                    witnesses in cross-examination. The High Court found that, on the whole, the
                    employers were not given an opportunity to respond to these unpleaded grounds
                    which were accepted by the district judge in coming to his decision. Although
                    the High Court there also found that the pleadings were poorly drafted, it held
                    that this did not entitle the district judge to decide the case on the basis of
                    an issue that was not canvassed before him.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     Earlier, views along similar veins were
                    expressed in <em>MFH Marine Pte Ltd v Asmoniah bin
                        Mohamad</em> [2000] 2 SLR(R) 532, where the High Court
                    acknowledged at [14] that while the district judge in that case was motivated by
                    a desire not to allow poorly drafted pleadings to deprive a party of his rights,
                    this had to be balanced:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">against the requirement in our system of justice that issues for
                        determination by the court should be carefully framed and all parties should
                        have the opportunity to address the court on those issues before the court
                        adjudicates thereon.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     The court then quoted the following pithy
                    statement made by Sharma J in <em>Janagi v Ong Boon
                        Kiat</em> [1971] 2 MLJ 196:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">...<em>The court is not entitled to decide a suit on a

                            duty of the court to make out a case for one of the parties when the
                            party concerned does not raise or wish to raise the
                        point.</em> In disposing of a suit or matter involving a disputed
                        question of fact it is not proper for the court to displace the case made by
                        a party in its pleadings and give effect to an entirely new case which the
                        party had not made out in its own pleadings. The trial of a suit should be
                        confined to the plea on which the parties are at variance.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Application of law to facts</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     The Judge effectively set off the royalties
                    paid by the respondent to the appellant during the interim period against the
                    royalty payments outstanding up to 3 March 2009 in assessing the overall
                    amount of royalties payable by the respondent to the appellant (<em>viz</em>, the appellant’s claim for arrears of royalty
                    payments). He found at [86] of the Judgment that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... there was a period between the termination of the Master Licence
                        Agreement on 22 April 1999 and the commencement of the 2002 Agreement
                        on 1 July 2002 during which the Plaintiff did not have any rights which
                        it could sub-license to the Defendant. It follows that the Plaintiff should
                        not be allowed to collect royalties for that period. …</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     No further explanation was provided as to why
                    only the royalties paid during the interim period was not payable by the
                    respondent to the appellant and ought to be refunded. However, on appeal, the
                    parties inexplicably chose to submit their arguments on the basis that the
                    Judge’s decision was based on a finding that there was no contract between
                    the parties during the interim period. The respondent made the argument that the
                    payments were effected under a mistake as to its own legal obligations. Contrary
                    to the position taken by the respondent, the appellant argued that there was an
                    informal, unwritten licence agreement, relying, <em>inter
                        alia</em>, on the evidence of Mr Robert Mebruer (PW4) that, despite
                    the surrender of the 1993 Agreement, the parties had “proceeded in good
                    faith on the terms of the 1993 Agreement”,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> although Mr
                    Mebruer acknowledged that no formal written agreement was made between the
                    parties until 2002.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     The appellant further averred that the Judge
                    was not entitled to make an order for the recovery of royalties paid during the
                    interim period as it was not part of either party’s pleaded case.
                    Moreover, this was not a case where no injustice or irreparable prejudice would
                    be suffered by the appellant if such an unpleaded claim were to be allowed (see
                        <em>Boustead Trading</em> at 341–342). While the
                    appellant acknowledged that, during cross-examination, the respondent’s
                    counsel and Mr Mebruer had discussed the question of royalties paid during the
                    interim period and the Judge had similarly posed questions to Mr Mebruer on this
                    issue, the appellant contended that the questions posed to Mr Mebruer were based
                    on pleadings and were not <em>related</em> to a claim for
                    repayment of royalties paid during the interim period. Accordingly, the
                    appellant argued that the evidence given at trial could not overcome the defects
                    in pleadings and that the respondent should have applied to amend its pleadings
                    to include a claim in restitution. Finally, the appellant asserted that it was
                    prejudiced by (a) the respondent’s failure to amend the latter’s
                    pleadings and (b) the corresponding orders made by the Judge, as it could not
                    reasonably have expected that the respondent would be claiming the refund of the
                    royalties paid during the interim period, or that the Judge was considering a
                    case regarding the same.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     Conversely, the respondent argued that the
                    instant issue arose in the course of the respondent’s pursuit of its
                    counterclaims against the appellant for misrepresentation and that the fact that
                    the appellant did not have any rights to sub-license during the interim period
                    was a “mere variation to, or development of, what it had averred in its
                        pleadings”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span> (citing from <em>John G
                        Stein &amp; Co Ltd v O’Hanlon</em> [1965] AC 890
                        (“<em>John G Stein &amp; Co Ltd</em>”) at
                    909). The respondent also pointed out that the appellant did not object during
                    the trial when Mr Mebruer was directly cross-examined on this matter<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span> and similarly when Mr Chew Keng Yong
                    (DW1) was also cross-examined on this matter. The respondent further argued that
                    both parties had the opportunity to raise objections or submit on this issue and
                    highlighted the fact that its own Closing Submissions (which technically did not
                    constitute pleadings) contained the following heading at para 14(a)(ii):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">1999 – A determination of what rights the Plaintiff purportedly had
                        and royalties to be paid by the Defendant to the Plaintiff in [<em>sic</em>] light of the termination of the Master Licence
                        Agreement between the Plaintiff and ActMedia Canada.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     The respondent also pointed out that the
                    appellant acknowledged the aforementioned paragraph in its Reply to the
                    Defendant’s Closing Submissions although its reply (or rather, its
                    decision not to reply) was as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[the appellant] intends to be concise on issues which they believe are
                        irrelevant and ... [the appellant shall] concentrate on the truly pertinent
                        issues.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Our views</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     To our mind, the facts as pleaded by the
                    parties did not cover – and in any case, could not be viewed as having
                    been in contemplation of – the specific issue of the refund of the amount
                    of royalties paid by the respondent during the interim period. It could not have
                    reasonably occurred to the appellant that if the respondent should fail in its
                    counterclaim based on the general ground of misrepresentation, the respondent
                    would be asking, in the alternative, for a refund of the royalties paid during
                    the interim period based on the fact that there was no written agreement in
                    existence between the parties for that period. If this alternative basis of
                    claim had been properly pleaded (and it would have probably been a claim in
                    restitution), it would not have been difficult for the appellant to plead an
                    implied contract or a contract by conduct. The basic position of the respondent
                    at the trial was that the appellant had fraudulently concealed the termination
                    of the Master Licence Agreement with ActMedia Canada Inc and that the appellant
                    had wrongfully held themselves out as having the rights under the Master Licence
                    Agreement to sub-license the Licensed System to the respondent. The issue of
                    royalties paid during the interim period was only very briefly and tangentially
                    touched on during the trial (if it was even addressed at all). What was really
                    canvassed during the trial was the question of the outstanding amount owed to
                    the appellant, not whether royalties already paid to the appellant should be
                    returned to the respondent. In fact, neither party explicitly or impliedly
                    mentioned the refund of royalty payments made during the interim period and no
                    arguments were made in that regard. Accordingly, we did not think that the
                    Judge’s ruling could be described as a “variation, modification or
                    development of what [was] averred” (<em>John G Stein &amp;
                        Co Ltd</em> at 909) in the pleadings and the trial
                itself.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     Undoubtedly, the prejudice to the appellant in
                    this case was obvious. The direct prejudice to the appellant was that it was
                    ordered to return the royalties paid during the interim period when that was not
                    a part of the respondent’s counterclaim. This determination took the
                    appellant completely by surprise.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">No other grounds available to justify the Judge’s
                order</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     For completeness, we will hereafter discuss
                    briefly whether there could be other grounds upon which to justify the
                    Judge’s order in relation to the royalties received by the appellant
                    during the interim period.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     On the facts, there appears to have been some
                    sort of arrangement between the parties during the interim period. This is
                    evident from the respondent’s conduct. In particular, the respondent
                    continued to make royalty payments after the Surrender Agreement was signed in
                    2000 (<em>ie</em>, during the interim period), despite
                    being fully aware that the Master Licence Agreement had been terminated. In
                    fact, the Judge made a specific finding (and justifiably so) that the respondent
                    knew that the Master Licence Agreement had been terminated; he found Mr Chew
                    Keng Yong’s testimony to be contradictory and inconsistent and relied on
                    the fact that Recital B of the Surrender Agreement explicitly stated
                    that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Due to the termination of the Head Licence Agreement [<em>ie</em>, the Master Licence Agreement] between the Licensor and
                        the Head Licensor, the Licensor has no alternative but to terminate the
                        sub-licence agreement as described in the preceding recital.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     Moreover, cl 1.1 of the Surrender Agreement
                    also stated that neither party would be entitled to claim against the other as a
                    result of the surrender. The respondent’s willingness to continue making
                    royalty payments suggests that there was some sort of arrangement between the
                    parties. The appellant submitted that the respondent was willing to enter into
                    an arrangement with the appellant and pay the royalties notwithstanding that the
                    latter had no rights to sub-license because (a) it desired “the
                    continuation of relationship” and preferred to purchase the
                    appellant’s cheaper products instead of purchasing the Licensed System and
                    products directly from ActMedia Canada Inc and (b) it wished to maintain its
                    near-monopoly status in the Malaysian market and was, in any event, prepared to
                    take the risk of mistaken obligation. This could be gleaned from Mr Chew Keng
                    Yong’s testimony as he explicitly acknowledged the respondent’s
                    constant desire for a continuation of the licensing relationship:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span></p>

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     That said, however, there is evidence which
                    suggests that there was no formal contract. Mr Mebruer confirmed during
                    cross-examination that although he remembered talking to the lawyer advising the
                    appellant then about “implied agreements”, “there was no
                    agreement in place” during the interim period (see [23]
                        above).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_6" id="Ftn_6_1"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span> Obviously, in this response, Mr Mebruer must
                    have meant that there was no <em>written agreement</em> in
                    place, as opposed to there being no arrangement or understanding at
                all.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     The respondent also made other arguments in
                    this regard but they were all plagued by the same flaw: they do not necessarily
                    support the contention that there was no arrangement or understanding between
                    the parties during the interim period.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     The first argument put forth by the respondent
                    was that the appellant “acted in breach” of its settlement
                    agreement of 2006 with ActMedia Canada Inc in “continuing to sub-license
                    certain ActMedia Products”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_7" id="Ftn_7_1"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span> to the
                    respondent following the termination of the Master Licence Agreement. The
                    respondent argued that “apart from a few minor
                        changes”,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_8" id="Ftn_8_1"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span> the appellant’s product was identical
                    to that marketed by ActMedia Canada Inc. However, this acknowledgement that
                    there was an arrangement to “sub-license” in fact fortifies the
                    appellant’s case that there was some contractual arrangement between the
                    appellant and the respondent. Even if by entering into the contractual
                    arrangement with the respondent the appellant was acting in breach of its
                    contract with ActMedia Canada Inc, this did not mean that, first, there was no
                    contract between the appellant and the respondent, and, second, a sub-licensing
                    contract between the appellant and the respondent was not
                enforceable.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     The second argument related to the <em>nemo </em><em>dat non quod
                        </em><em>habet</em> principle and the respondent
                    accordingly argued that the appellant should not be allowed to retain the
                    royalties. The respondent averred that this principle has been applied to
                    personal property and in particular to debts, copyright and goodwill, citing
                    Michael Bridge, <em>Personal Property Law</em> (Oxford
                    University Press, 2002) (“Michael Bridge”). For accuracy, it
                    should be stated that despite the cited proposition from Michael Bridge, it is
                    unclear if licensing rights are proprietary in nature (and therefore
                    constituting “personal property” and attracting the application of
                    the <em>nemo </em><em>dat</em>
                    principle) or merely personal rights that may be assigned. In any case, the
                    respondent’s arguments were confused and without merit. It is trite law
                    that A may contract to sell B something that A does not presently have –
                    if B has fulfilled his part of the bargain and A has not, the remedy available
                    to B is for him to sue A for breach of contract. Accordingly, applying that
                    example to this case, it is plainly obvious that if there was such a contract to
                    sub-license during the interim period, the respondent’s remedy would be to
                    sue the appellant for breach of contract if the respondent had been unable or
                    was prevented by ActMedia Canada Inc from using the Licensed System or the
                    products supplied by the appellant. The respondent did use the Licensed System
                    during the interim period and was not prevented from doing so by ActMedia Canada
                    Inc. By the time this suit came up for trial before the High Court, any rights
                    which ActMedia Canada Inc had against the respondent would have been
                    time-barred. The appellant had fulfilled its part of the bargain. Indeed, it
                    also seems to us that the position of the parties during the interim period
                    could not really be any different from that after the parties had signed the
                    2002 Agreement. The only difference between the two situations is that for the
                    interim period there was only an oral or implied contract, whereas for the
                    subsequent period there was a formal written agreement. If, as the Judge had
                    found, the appellant was entitled to the royalty payments for the period from
                    2002, the same should follow for the interim period. It is clear from the
                    evidence of Mr Chew Keng Yong (see [31] above) that the respondent was aware
                    that the appellant was then in consultation with ActMedia Canada Inc as to the
                    arrangement between the latter two parties. This could be the explanation why
                    ActMedia Canada Inc did not take any action against the
                respondent.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     The third point raised by the respondent
                    (which is related to the second) was that it paid royalties during the interim
                    period for “exclusive rights” and as the appellant did not have
                    any rights (let alone exclusive rights) to sub-license, it was entitled to
                    recover the royalties paid. Again, this argument did not suggest that there was
                    no contract between the appellant and the respondent during the interim period.
                    For the reasons already given above, this point was without merit.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     In the result, quite apart from the issue
                    pertaining to the pleadings, we would have, on the evidence, no difficulties in
                    concluding, especially in the light of the Surrender Agreement and the conduct
                    of the parties then, that there was an informal or implied agreement between the
                    parties during the interim period implicitly along the lines of the 1993
                    Agreement, pursuant to which the respondent continued to pay royalties to the
                    appellant. On the respondent’s own evidence, it was prepared to make the
                    royalty payments to the appellant in order to retain its near-monopoly status in
                    the Malaysian market.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Restitutionary liability</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     Taking the argument one step further, and
                    assuming that there was no implied agreement between the parties during the
                    interim period, it seems to us that the only basis upon which the respondent
                    could claim for a refund of the royalties paid during the interim period was
                    restitution. However, this basis for refund was not raised by the parties at
                    trial because, as mentioned at [27] above, a claim for refund of only the
                    royalties paid during the interim period was not a part of the
                    respondent’s counterclaim. As such (and understandably so), the question
                    of restitution was not addressed by the Judge.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     While there seems to be some controversy as to
                    the legal basis upon which a claim in restitution may be made, it seems that the
                    better view is that such a claim should be founded on the basis of unjust
                    enrichment rather than implied contract (see <em>Sinclair v
                        Brougham and Another</em> [1914] AC 398; <em>cf </em><em>United Australia, Limited v Barclays Bank,
                        Limited</em> [1941] AC 1, <em>Attorney-General v Nissan</em> [1970] AC 179 and <em>Owen v Tate and Another</em> [1976] 1 QB 402). Thus
                    for the respondent to be able to establish unjust enrichment, it must show that
                    permitting the appellant to retain the payments would be unjust.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     There are also other difficulties standing in
                    the way of the respondent’s claim in restitution. We think it would
                    suffice to mark out just two problems.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     First, the claim could well be time-barred
                    under s 6(1)(a) of the Limitation Act (Cap 163, 1996 Rev Ed)
                    (“the Limitation Act”) as the date the cause of action accrued
                        (<em>ie</em>, the date of the last payment during the
                    interim period) was certainly before 1 July 2002 (<em>ie</em>, the date the 2002 Agreement was signed). We used the
                    expression “could well” because s 6(1)(a) only covers
                    “actions founded on a contract or on tort”. So the question is,
                    does a claim in restitution based on unjust enrichment come within the ambit of
                    s 6(1)(a) of the Limitation Act? Is such a claim a claim in contract or
                    tort?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     The Limitation Act was modelled after the
                    English Limitation Act 1939 (c 21) (UK) (“the English Limitation Act
                    1939”). Although the English Limitation Act 1939 has since been repealed
                    in its entirety and replaced by the Limitation Act 1980 (c 58) (UK)
                    (“the English Limitation Act 1980”), the latter Act also does not
                    expressly deal with unjust enrichment claims except for four narrow exceptions:
                    (a) s 9 provides for restitutionary actions under the Law Reform
                    (Frustrated Contracts) Act 1943 (c 40) (UK); (b) s 10(1) provides
                    for contribution claims under the Civil Liability (Contribution) Act 1978 (c 47)
                    (UK); (c) s 22(a) provides a twelve-year limitation period for
                    personal or proprietary remedies claiming a share of a deceased’s estate;
                    and (d) s 21(3) provides for actions by a beneficiary to recover trust property
                    or in respect of any breach of trust (as referenced in Andrew Burrows, <em>The Law of Restitution</em> (Oxford University Press, 3th ed,
                    2011) at pp 605–606). The Law Commission in England opined that the
                    English Limitation Act 1980 could not be directly applied to the law of
                    restitution founded on unjust enrichment (see The Law Commission, <em>Limitation of Actions: Item 2 of the Seventh Programme of Law
                        Reform</em> (10 July 2001) LAW COM No 270 at para 1.9 (Chairman:
                    The Honourable Mr Justice Carnwath CVO)) – a concern earlier voiced
                    by Lord Goff of Chieveley in <em>Kleinwort Benson Ltd v Lincoln
                        City Council</em> [1999] 2 AC 349 at 389.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     However, the English courts appear to have
                    given an extended meaning to s 2 of the English Limitation Act 1939 which
                    governed limitation on actions in contract or in tort. We see this approach
                    being taken in <em>Re Diplock</em> [1948] Ch 465 where Lord
                    Greene MR held (at 514) that s 2 could be taken to “cover actions for
                    money had and received, formerly actions on the case” though he
                    recognised that the “words used cannot be regarded as felicitous”.
                    Similarly, in <em>Kleinwort Benson Ltd v Sandwell Borough
                        Council</em> [1994] 4 All ER 890, Hobhouse J, having
                    examined the Hansard, considered s 2 to be “sufficiently broad” to
                    cover an action for money had and received. In this regard, he noted that the
                    Solicitor General had stated during a debate on the English Limitation Act 1939
                    that the Law Revision Committee’s <em>Fifth Interim Report:
                        </em><em>(Statutes of Limitation)</em> (Cmnd
                    5334, 1936) recommended that the period for all tort or simple contract actions
                    (including quasi-contractual actions) should be six years.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     It would therefore appear that in England,
                    quasi-contractual claims will be barred after six years, subject to other
                    provisions of the English Limitation Act 1980. In substance, the
                    quasi-contractual claims subsumed under s 2 would typically include the bulk of
                    what are in essence <em>restitutionary</em> claims:
                        <em>eg</em>, recovery of money paid under a mistake of
                    fact, duress or total failure of consideration, in compulsory discharge of
                    another’s debt, or in pursuance of a void contract; and recovery of goods
                    supplied or services rendered under ineffective or unenforceable transactions,
                    or contracts that fail for want of certainty, authority, illegality or mistake
                    (see HM McLean, “Limitation of Actions in Restitution” [1989] CLJ
                    472 at 476).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     In Singapore, this problem seems to have been
                    touched upon in <em>Management Corporation Strata Title No 473 v
                        De Beers Jewellery Pte Ltd</em> [2002] 1 SLR(R) 418, where the Court
                    of Appeal stated at [32] that “a claim in unjust enrichment which was
                    neither grounded in contract nor tort, and in which equitable relief was not
                    sought, did not fall within the scope of the [Limitation] Act”. However,
                    the court seemed to opine at [33] that the doctrine of laches applied to actions
                    in unjust enrichment and two important factors in this regard were the length of
                    the delay and the acts done during the time.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     The Law Reform Committee of the Singapore
                    Academy of Law, like the Law Commission in England, recommended in 2007 that the
                    Limitation Act should be amended to include a new s 6(1)(e) which provides for a
                    limitation period of six years for “actions founded on restitution
                    including restitutionary claims”. It declined to provide a definition for
                    the term “restitutionary”, stating that it would be preferable to
                    leave this to the courts to interpret (see Law Reform Committee, Singapore
                    Academy of Law, <em>Report of the Law Reform Committee on the
                        Review of the Limitation Act (Cap 163)</em> (February 2007) at para 78
                    (Chairman: Charles Lim Aeng Cheng). The Law Reform Committee also suggested that
                    a “long-stop period” of 12 years should apply with regard to
                    actions in which relief is sought from the consequences of mistake, whether of
                    law or of fact (<em>ibid</em> at para 85).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     Second, in the circumstances of the present
                    case, there would be considerable difficulty in regarding the retention of the
                    royalties received by the appellant during the interim period as being
                    unjust.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     The respondent continued to make royalty
                    payments despite being <em>fully aware</em> that the
                    appellant did not have any rights to sub-license. It is unclear what was
                    “unjust” about the appellant being enriched by the royalty
                    payments when the respondent knew precisely that the appellant did not have any
                    rights to sub-license; the respondent had its own motive to continue to make the
                    payments and would probably have recourse against the appellant if ActMedia
                    Canada Inc were to sue the respondent for the use of the Licensed System. Here
                    we would also point out that the parties contracted to give up any claims
                    against each other pertaining to the 1993 Agreement pursuant to cl 1.1 of the
                    Surrender Agreement signed in 2000 (although this would only cover a portion of
                    the payments made during the interim period). In any case, since the respondent
                    willingly made the payments to the appellant in spite of the absence of a valid
                    and enforceable agreement between them while being fully aware that the
                    appellant did not have any rights to sub-license, it would not lie in the mouth
                    of the respondent to complain that the consideration for its payment had failed
                    (see <em>Thomas v Brown</em> (1876) 1 QBD 714). In the
                    circumstances, it is also possible to infer that the respondent intended the
                    appellant to have the benefit of the enrichment in all events and voluntarily
                    assumed the risk of the vitiating factor occurring (see <em>Skandinaviska </em><em>Enskilda </em><em>Banken AB (Publ), Singapore Branch v Asia Pacific Breweries
                        (Singapore) Pte Ltd and another and another appeal</em> [2011] 3 SLR
                    540). This is warranted by Mr Chew Keng Yong’s response during
                        cross-examination<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_9" id="Ftn_9_1"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span> which is reproduced
                    below:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">And I---if I kept up with the license, I will effectively keep ActMedia
                        out of Malaysia because if I turn then---if we stop the relationship,
                        naturally they will come and, you know, at some point in the future will
                        come to Malaysia to compete with us.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     In conclusion, we restate that having
                    determined that the issue of royalties paid during the interim period was
                    neither pleaded nor canvassed in the trial below, we found that the Judge was
                    not entitled to order the appellant to return the royalties paid by the
                    respondent during the interim period. In the circumstances, we allowed the
                    appeal only in respect of the refund of royalties paid during the period between
                    22 April 1999 and 1 July 2002.</p>
