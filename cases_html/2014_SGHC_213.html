<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       This is an appeal against the
                    decision of the District Judge in <em>Public Prosecutor v Koh
                        Jing Kwang</em> [2014] SGDC 56 (“the GD”). The appellant claimed trial
                    to a charge for an offence punishable under s 325 of the Penal Code (Cap 224,
                    2008 Rev Ed) (“the PC”) and at the conclusion of the trial, was found guilty and
                    sentenced to 15 months’ imprisonment. He has appealed against the conviction and
                    sentence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The charge the appellant was found
                    guilty of is as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">You are charged that you, on the 3rd day of March 2012, at about 5.16am,
                        outside the main entrance of Shanghai Dolly, Clarke Quay, Tan Tye Place,
                        Singapore, did voluntarily cause grievous hurt to one Chua Bin Huang
                        (male/28 years old), to wit, by punching him on his face, causing the said
                        Chua Bin Huang to fall to the ground and to suffer a fracture to the skull,
                        and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 325 of
                        the Penal Code, Chapter 224 (2008 Revised Edition)</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       The appeal came before me on 25
                    June 2014, and I reserved my judgment on the appeal to be delivered on a later
                    date. After considering the arguments raised by the parties, I was satisfied
                    that the <em>mens </em><em>rea</em>
                    element of an offence under s 322 of the PC (voluntarily causing grievous hurt)
                    had not been established. The appeal was therefore allowed. As the evidence was
                    sufficient to support a conviction for a lesser charge under s 323 of the PC
                    (voluntarily causing hurt), the charge was amended accordingly. The appellant
                    was convicted and sentenced to twelve weeks’ imprisonment on the amended charge.
                    The reasons for my decision are set out below.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The facts</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       The undisputed facts are set out
                    in the GD at [4]­–[8]. The appellant and his friends were clubbing on the night
                    of 2 March 2012 at Shanghai Dolly (“the club”). They decided to leave the club
                    near closing time. The appellant accompanied two of his female friends to
                    retrieve their bags, while his friend Quek Aik Keong Pierre-Milton (“Quek”),
                    proceeded to leave first. Quek somehow got into a fight with one Chua Bin Huang
                    (“the victim”), and this carried on outside the club (“the first altercation”).
                    The appellant was near the entrance of the club when he noticed this had
                    occurred. He then ran towards the victim and made contact with the victim. The
                    victim fell backwards as a result of this and landed on the road motionless. The
                    victim was later conveyed to hospital and diagnosed with having a fracture to
                    the skull.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The decision below</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       At the trial, the appellant
                    claimed that he had merely pushed the victim in order to separate the victim and
                    Quek. The trial judge, however, noted (at [18] of the GD) that two independent
                    witnesses, one Kevin Ling Guan Jie (“Kevin”) and one Mohamad Sufarpdi Bin Senin
                    (“Sufarpdi”) both testified that they saw the appellant deliver a punch to the
                    victim. Although the first information report (“the FIR”) recorded by Sergeant
                    Cheng Li Quan (“Sgt Cheng”) recorded that the appellant had “pushed” the victim,
                    the trial judge noted (at [20] of the GD) that Sgt Cheng testified that he might
                    have wrongly recorded “punched” as “pushed”. The trial judge also noted that
                    other witnesses had testified that the appellant was behaving aggressively just
                    before he ran out and intervened in the first altercation. The trial judge had
                    the opportunity to review the closed-circuit television footage.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       Given the behaviour of the
                    appellant, the trial judge found that it was unlikely that the appellant wanted
                    to prevent a fight. On the contrary, it was more likely that he was agitated and
                    was running towards the victim with a view of “assaulting that person” (at [21]
                    of the GD). In those circumstances, the trial judge found that the appellant had
                    indeed punched the victim, and that his claim that he had pushed the victim was
                    a mere afterthought “designed to meet the charge”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       The trial judge noted (at [25] of
                    the GD) that to fulfil the <em>mens </em><em>rea</em> element of a charge of voluntarily causing grievous hurt,
                    the appellant must have intended or known himself to be likely to cause some
                    kind of grievous hurt (in that there was no need for it to be the specific form
                    of grievous hurt actually caused). The trial judge went on to hold that given
                    the considerable force used to punch the victim after the appellant dashed out
                    of the club, the appellant “must at the very least have had reason to believe
                    that he was likely to cause grievous hurt to the victim” (at [28] of the GD). He
                    therefore found that the <em>mens rea</em> element of the
                    charge had been fulfilled.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       Finally, the trial judge also held
                    that the appellant could not rely on the right of private defence. He noted (at
                    [33] of the GD) that he found it hard to accept that the appellant reasonably
                    apprehended danger due to an attempt or a threat by the victim to commit the
                    offence against Quek. Furthermore, the appellant had also failed to prove why
                    there was no time to seek the protection of public authorities, or that the harm
                    caused to the victim was reasonably necessary in private defence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       In consideration of the sentence,
                    the trial judge observed that there were several aggravating factors. The victim
                    had suffered a serious injury and was now fully dependent on his family for
                    personal care. The appellant remained unremorseful. In the circumstances, the
                    trial judge found that a deterrent sentence was warranted, and imposed a
                    sentence of 15 months’ imprisonment.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The appellant’s arguments</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     The appellant raised two main
                    arguments on appeal, contending that the learned trial judge had:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_10-p2_a"></a>(a)     erred in fact by
                        finding that the appellant had punched (as opposed to pushed) the victim
                        (“the first argument”); and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_10-p2_b"></a>(b)     erred in law by holding that the appellant
                        had the requisite knowledge or intention required under the law to sustain
                        the charge under s 325 of the PC (“the second
                argument”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     In respect of the first
                    argument, the appellant raised two main points. The first was that some doubt
                    should be cast on the evidence of Sufarpdi, who testified that he saw the
                    appellant punch the victim. This is because although it was undisputed that the
                    first altercation occurred (between Quek and the victim), Sufarpdi had testified
                    that he never saw the first altercation. This ran contrary to the evidence of
                    Kevin, who testified that he saw the first altercation very clearly. The
                    appellant argued that the trial judge did not take note of this discrepancy, and
                    that more should have been done to clarify whether Sufarpdi (or Kevin) was
                    indeed telling the truth when they testified that they saw the appellant punch
                    the victim.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     Second, the appellant also
                    argued that the trial judge had erroneously concluded that the FIR (recording
                    that the appellant had “pushed” the victim) was wrongly recorded. According to
                    the appellant, Sgt Cheng’s evidence showed that he clearly could not remember
                    the words actually used, and that the word “pushed” appeared more accurate and
                    sensible in the context of the sentence recorded in the FIR. Given that this
                    recording occurred some one year and three months ago, any recollection would be
                    relatively unreliable. The appellant therefore contended that there was
                    reasonable doubt as to whether the appellant did indeed punch the
                victim.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     In respect of the second
                    argument, the appellant contended that the Prosecution had failed to prove
                    beyond reasonable doubt that he possessed the necessary <em>mens
                        rea</em> to sustain the charge, namely, that the appellant, in hitting
                    the victim, intended or knew himself to be likely to cause grievous hurt to the
                    victim. The victim eventually fell as he had tripped over the kerb while
                    stumbling backwards. The relief of where the victim was standing was also
                    downward sloping. The blow was not so hard as to leave a fracture or a permanent
                    mark on the part of the body which was struck. In such circumstances, the
                    appellant contended that it was entirely possible that the blow was not of such
                    great force as it has been made out to be.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     According to the appellant, the
                    trial judge had also erred by applying the wrong “standard” of knowledge,
                    concluding (at [28] of the GD) that the appellant “must at the very least have
                    had <em>reason to believe</em> that he was likely to cause
                    grievous hurt to the victim” [emphasis added], while what was required was that
                    the appellant must have either intended or <em>known</em>
                    himself to be likely to cause grievous hurt.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     In addition to the above two
                    arguments, the appellant also contended that he should be able to rely on the
                    right of private defence.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">My decision</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     As to the first argument raised
                    by the appellant (<em>ie</em>, that the trial judge had
                    erred in fact by finding that he had punched the victim), I was of the view that
                    there were insufficient grounds to disturb the trial judge’s finding of fact. I
                    found that the trial judge did not err in finding that the appellant had punched
                    the victim.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     As to the appellant’s second
                    argument, I was satisfied that the appellant did not possess the requisite
                    knowledge or intention required under the law to sustain the charge under s 325
                    of the PC, insofar as there was insufficient evidence to reach this conclusion
                    beyond reasonable doubt. I elaborate on these two points below.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The evidence supports the finding that the appellant had
                punched the victim</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     There are three aspects of the
                    evidence which cast some doubt on the trial judge’s conclusion that the
                    appellant had punched the victim. They are:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_18-p2_a"></a>(a)     the evidence of the
                        encounter itself, primarily the evidence of Kevin and
                    Sufarpdi;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_18-p2_b"></a>(b)     the FIR as recorded by Sgt Cheng; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_18-p2_c"></a>(c)     the medical evidence given by Dr
                        Ivan Ng.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     Only Kevin had stated
                    unequivocally that he saw the appellant landing a punch on the victim. Sufarpdi
                    had admitted that from his position, he could not really see the appellant land
                    a punch; his evidence that the appellant had punched the victim was his own
                    deduction. This was evident from his testimony in examination-in-chief, when he
                    testified that he “saw slightly a punch” and “[t]hat seems [what] happened”.
                        <span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     He conceded that he could not
                    really recall “how the punch was” and that there was a blind spot to the side of
                    the lamppost. Under cross-examination, Sufarpdi confirmed again that he did not
                    have a direct line of vision of the fight as the fight occurred behind a
                    lamppost. He had testified that “[f]rom my view on the right side pillar, okay,
                    it’s being blocked by that pillar … and the blind spot is the
                        lamppost”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span> Sufarpdi then later
                    characterised the appellant’s action as a “right-handed movement”, rather than a
                    punch.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     It was also odd that Sufarpdi
                    did not notice the fight between Quek and the victim earlier on. It was
                    undisputed that Quek and the victim were fighting initially just before the
                    appellant intervened, and that Quek had landed a punch on victim, causing the
                    victim to fall down on his backside before the victim stood up again. However,
                    Sufarpdi described this only as a minor scuffle where no blows and only Chinese
                    vulgarities were exchanged. Given his close proximity to the entrance of the
                    club, it would have been reasonable to expect Sufarpdi to have noticed this
                    scuffle.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     I also considered the points the
                    appellant raised regarding the FIR recorded by Sgt Cheng. As stated above, the
                    trial judge noted Sgt Cheng’s evidence that he (Sgt Cheng) might have wrongly
                    recorded “punched” as “pushed” in the FIR report. Two observations can be made.
                    First, while it is true that Sgt Cheng did give evidence suggesting that he
                    could have made a mistake, I note that this had been stated hypothetically, in
                    response to a question asked by the Prosecution – Sgt Cheng was asked whether it
                    was “possible” that the caller could have used a different word, and Sgt Cheng
                    had simply agreed that it was. This was not a case where he had admitted that he
                    had recorded the FIR wrongly. His answer was in fact a result of leading
                    questions from the Prosecution. Second, as was pointed out in the closing
                    submissions for the defence in the trial below, the full context of the FIR must
                    be considered. The statement in the FIR was that “there is a fight here and
                    someone was <em>pushed</em> to the road”. If the word
                    “pushed” was substituted for the word “punched”, the sentence would make less
                    sense. It was not clear whether the trial judge had taken note of this as there
                    was no mention of the point in the GD.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     I also considered the medical
                    evidence before the court. In this appeal, the Prosecution also asserted that
                    the medical evidence supports a finding that a punch was landed. I found that
                    this was an inaccurate representation of the medical evidence. In the
                    Prosecution’s submissions for this appeal dated 16 June 2014 at paras 28 to 30
                    (“the Prosecution’s submissions”), the Prosecution contended that the medical
                    evidence showed that the injury suffered by the victim was an
                    “acceleration-deceleration” injury. It was submitted that this supports a
                    finding that the victim sustained a “sudden impact from a forceful punch”,
                    seemingly attributing the “acceleration” to the punch. This is incorrect, as an
                    acceleration-deceleration injury as explained by Dr Ivan Ng is simply when
                    something moving quickly (acceleration) comes to a sudden stop (deceleration),
                    causing an impact thus resulting in an injury. In fact, Dr Ivan Ng was very
                    clear that the injury could be attributed to a fall and not necessarily a
                        punch.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     Taking these three points into
                    consideration, it could perhaps be said that there was some doubt as to whether
                    the appellant did punch the victim. However, I was of the view that they did not
                    raise doubts sufficient to warrant appellate intervention, as there was
                    sufficient evidence to support the trial judge’s finding that the appellant had
                    indeed punched the victim.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     A punch is clearly distinct from
                    a push. While both might involve some form of hand action, a push designed to
                    separate two people, as claimed by the appellant, is distinctly different from a
                    punch swung to injure. Although Sufarpdi did admit that his line of sight was
                    not perfect, he had maintained numerous times that it was a punch rather than a
                    push. This was likewise for Kevin, who had expressly disagreed that the
                    appellant had simply run towards the victim to break up the fight:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">Q:</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">And I am suggesting to you in the process of
                            pushing them away, the white-shirted person fell when the 2nd person
                            pushed both side away</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">A:</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">Uh, no it didn’t happen that way.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">Q:</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">And that is exactly why in your text to the police
                            you said “pushed” not “punched”?</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">A:</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">After---after he separated the 2 of them, right,
                            he---he punched the guy.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1">As can be seen, Kevin clearly maintained that the appellant had delivered a
                    punch. Apart from the inconsistency in the recorded FIR, there was nothing to
                    suggest that he was mistaken in his recollection. There was also never any
                    suggestion that he had lied or fabricated evidence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     In my view, it was also not so
                    significant that the FIR had recorded Kevin as having stated “pushed” instead of
                    “punched”. Given the language of the FIR as discussed above, it was entirely
                    possible that Kevin had in fact mentioned “pushed”. It was also equally possible
                    that Sgt Cheng had indeed made a mistake in recording the FIR in an effort to
                    summarise what was being said. It is a well-settled principle in criminal law
                    that it is only in cases of <em>material discrepancies</em>
                    whereby the credibility of the witness (and hence his account of what had
                    occurred) might be called into question.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     The FIR is merely a quick report
                    of what is happening, and it is not expected to be totally accurate all the
                    time. Significantly, the court can take into account the circumstances in which
                    the FIR was made. In this case, it was made at the moment, spontaneously and
                    immediately, and therefore, some latitude should be given to inaccuracies in
                    recording. As held in <em>Sarjit Singh Rapati v Public
                        Prosecutor</em> [2005] 1 SLR(R) 638 at [41]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In so far as the first information report was concerned, the
                        law does not require the report to contain the entire case for the
                        Prosecution. Its main purpose is merely to give information of a cognisable
                        offence to the police so as to set them in motion: <em>Tan
                            Pin Seng v PP</em> [1997] 3 SLR(R) 494 at [27]. While the
                        existence of a material discrepancy between the report and the complainant’s
                        testimony in court is relevant, the circumstances in which the report was
                        lodged must be borne in mind. As the court put it in <em>Herchun </em><em>Singh </em><em>v PP</em> [1969] 2 MLJ 209 at 211:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">… it is wrong to hold up the first information report as a sure
                            touchstone by which the complainant’s credit may invariably be
                            impeached. It can only be used for that purpose with discrimination, in
                            much the same way as previous statements by the witness are used, so
                            that irrelevant errors in detail are not given exaggerated importance,
                            nor omissions, objectively considered in the light of surrounding
                            circumstances.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     Third, the trial judge had also
                    noted that the appellant was behaving aggressively, was shouting vulgarities and
                    had sprinted out of the main door. He characterised these as actions which were
                    more in line with an aggressor, rather than someone who wanted to break the
                    fight up. It was not disputed that the appellant had behaved in this manner, and
                    this did, to a certain extent, support the trial judge’s finding that a punch,
                    and not a push, was delivered.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     In the circumstances, I did not
                    find sufficient grounds to disagree with the trial judge’s finding of fact. It
                    is well-settled that an appellate court will be slow to overturn findings of
                    fact made by the trial judge, and intervention is only justified when the
                    assessment is plainly wrong or against the weight of the objective evidence
                    before the court – see <em>ADF v Public Prosecutor and another
                        appeal</em> [2010] 1 SLR 874 at [16].</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The mens rea element for a charge of grievous hurt is
                not made out</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     Section 322 of the PC
                    provides:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-Heading1">
<b>Voluntarily causing grievous
                            hurt</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>322</b>.    Whoever voluntarily
                            causes hurt, if the hurt which he intends to cause or knows himself to
                            be likely to cause is grievous hurt, and if the hurt which he causes is
                            grievous hurt, is said “voluntarily to cause grievous
                        hurt”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     The explanation to s 322 further
                    provides that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<em>Explanation</em>—A person is not said voluntarily
                        to cause grievous hurt except when he both causes grievous hurt and intends
                        or knows himself to be likely to cause grievous hurt. But he is said
                        voluntarily to cause grievous hurt if, intending or knowing himself to be
                        likely to cause grievous hurt of one kind, he actually causes grievous hurt
                        of another kind.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     In this appeal, the parties
                    agreed that the appellant must have <em>intended</em> or
                        <em>known himself to be likely</em> to cause grievous
                    hurt before the <em>mens rea</em> element of the charge is
                    made out. From the explanation of the offence, there are four permutations by
                    which the Prosecution can establish that the appellant possesses the requisite
                        <em>mens </em><em>rea</em>:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_32-p2_a"></a>(a)     The appellant, when
                        delivering the punch, intended for the victim to fall, knock his head, and
                        sustain fractures (“the direct-knowledge approach”).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_32-p2_b"></a>(b)     The appellant, when
                        delivering the punch, knew that it was likely that the victim would fall,
                        knock his head, and sustain fractures (“the direct-reasonable knowledge
                        approach”).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_32-p2_c"></a>(c)     The appellant, when delivering the punch, intended to cause
                        some form of grievous hurt. Inadvertently, this led to a fall and the
                        subsequent fracture (“the indirect-knowledge approach”).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_32-p2_d"></a>(d)     The appellant, when
                        delivering the punch, knew that it was likely to cause grievous hurt of
                        another type (“the indirect-reasonable knowledge
                approach”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     As can be seen, the “direct”
                    approach establishes a direct link between the actions of the appellant and the
                    grievous hurt actually sustained by the victim (in this case, a fracture). It is
                    clear that if a “direct” link cannot be established, then, the Prosecution must
                    show that an accused had intended or had known that his actions were likely to
                    cause some other form of grievous hurt.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     It is not clear through which
                    approach the trial judge found that the <em>mens
                        </em><em>rea</em> element was established. At
                    [28] of the GD, the trial judge mentioned that the appellant must “at the very
                    least have had reason to believe that he was likely to cause grievous hurt to
                    the victim”. The use of the phrase “at the very least”, as well as “likely to
                    cause” would suggest that the trial judge found that the <em>mens
                        </em><em>rea</em> element was established as
                    described in the fourth approach, namely, the indirect-reasonable knowledge
                    approach.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     Indeed, it is clear that in the
                    trial below, the Prosecution did not go so far as to suggest that the appellant
                    intended, or knew that his punch would be likely to cause the victim to stumble
                    backwards, trip, and then sustain the injury. In the Prosecution’s submissions
                    for this appeal at para 35, the Prosecution asserted that “the outcome of the
                    victim suffering some form of grievous hurt was <em>clearly a
                        foreseeable and reasonably</em> likely result of the [appellant’s]
                    punch”. The legal question can therefore be reduced to this – when the appellant
                    delivered his punch, did he intend or know that it was likely to cause the
                    victim some form of grievous hurt?</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The law</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     How is the court to establish
                    that an accused intended or was likely to have known that his actions would
                    cause grievous hurt? The following commentary, as found in Dr Sri Hari Singh
                    Gour, <em>Penal Law of India</em> vol 3 (Law Publishers
                    (India) Pvt Ltd, 11th Revised Ed, 2011) (“<em>Gour</em>”)
                    at p 3215, commenting on s 322 of the Indian Penal Code 1860 (Act No 45 of 1860)
                    (India) (“the IPC”) which is for all purposes <em>in pari
                        </em><em>materia</em> with s 322 of the PC, is
                    instructive. The author elaborates on how intention or knowledge is to be
                    proved:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">But <em>there must be evidence that what the accused had
                            intended or known to be likely was not only hurt, but grievous
                            hurt</em>. But how is such intention or knowledge to be proved?
                        This difficulty was suggested to the Law Commissioners who said: “The Judge
                        is not to trouble himself with seeking for direct proof of what the offender
                        thought was likely to happen, but is to infer it from the nature of his act,
                        taking him to have intended grievous hurt, or at least to have contemplated
                        grievous hurt as likely to occur, when he did what everybody knows is likely
                        to cause grievous hurt, and the more certainly drawing this conclusion where
                        there is evidence of previous enmity against the party who has suffered. …”
                        [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The learned author goes on to elaborate at p 3216, stating:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<em>This is, of course, the only way in which intention and
                            knowledge can be proved. Overt act and declarations, the amount of
                            violence used, the nature of the weapon selected for that purpose, the
                            part of the body, vital or otherwise, where the wound was inflicted, the
                            effect produced are, indeed, some of the most essential facts from which
                            the Judge or jury may infer an intention</em>. It cannot be judged
                        from any isolated fact, but must be judged from all together. For, suppose a
                        person strikes a blow with moderate violence, which would not cause death of
                        an ordinary subject, but which owing to the latent disease in him caused his
                        death, the criminality of the act could not obviously be judged by the fatal
                        result, but only by the nature of the act, namely, the severity of the blow.
                        [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     Similar observations were made
                    by the trial judge in citing the decision of the High Court in <em>Chang Yam Song v PP</em> [2005] SGHC 142 (“<em>Chang Yam Song</em>”) – intention or knowledge must be judged by the
                    actions of the accused.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     However, quite apart from
                    observing how to judge intention or knowledge, the decision in <em>Chang Yam Song</em> goes one step further – it affirms the
                    position (as laid down in <em>Sim Yew Thong v Ng Loy Nam
                        Thomas</em> [2000] 3 SLR(R) 155 (“<em>Sim Yew
                        Thong</em>”)) that even if an accused was merely negligent, meaning
                    that so long as he had <em>reason to believe</em> that his
                    actions were likely to cause grievous hurt, the <em>mens
                        </em><em>rea</em> element of s 322 of the PC
                    could be established. Although the word “knows” would seem to suggest that
                    actual knowledge is required before the <em>mens rea</em>
                    element is fulfilled, it was held that “knowledge” also encompassed recklessness
                    and negligence. The trial judge, in his GD, cited [40] of <em>Chang Yam Song</em>, which states:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Moving on to the appellant’s contention that the district judge was wrong
                        to find that he either intended to cause, or knew he was likely to cause
                        grievous hurt to Chua (supra [17]), I note first of all the explanation of
                        “intention” and “knowledge” given in <em>Sim Yew Thong v Ng
                            Loy Nam Thomas</em> [2000] 4 SLR 193 (“<em>Sim Yew
                            Thong</em>”) at [18]. That case concerned the offence of
                        voluntarily causing hurt under s 323 of the Penal Code, the <em>mens rea</em> for which is similar to that for the
                        offence under s 325 of voluntarily causing grievous hurt. The only
                        difference is that while the requisite intention and knowledge relate to
                        hurt <em>per se</em> in the case of the s 323 offence,
                        they pertain to grievous hurt where the s 325 offence is concerned. …
                            <em>As for knowledge of the likelihood of causing hurt, I
                            held that it encompassed</em> “both recklessness (where an accused
                        knows he is likely to cause a result) and <em>negligence
                            (when an accused has reason to believe that he is likely to cause a
                            result)”</em>. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Given these two decisions, it was understandable why the trial judge held (at
                    [28] of the GD) that the appellant must “at the very least have had reason to
                    believe that he was likely to cause grievous hurt to the victim” despite the
                    different language used in s 322 of the PC. These were decisions of the High
                    Court, and the trial judge might have felt bound to follow this line of
                    authority.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     However, with greatest respect,
                    I declined to adopt this standard of knowledge as laid down by the High Court in
                        <em>Chang Yam Song</em> and <em>Sim Yew
                        Thong</em>. In my judgment, an accused must possess actual knowledge,
                    meaning that the court must be prepared to find, beyond reasonable doubt, that
                    the accused <em>knew</em> that his actions were likely to
                    cause grievous hurt before the <em>mens rea</em> element is
                    made out. First, at the very least, the language used in the PC clearly and
                    unambiguously states that an accused must <em>know</em>
                    that he is likely to cause some form of grievous harm before liability attaches.
                    On first principles and on a plain reading, I see no reason why this should be
                    interpreted to encompass rashness and negligence. Neither the Prosecution nor
                    the appellant sought to argue that this should be the case.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     Second, including the concepts
                    of rashness and negligence also has the danger of causing this section to be
                    over-inclusive. As suggested by the learned authors in Chan Wing Cheong, Stanley
                    Yeo &amp; Michael Hor, <em>Criminal Law for the 21st Century – A
                        Model Code for Singapore</em> (Academy Publishing, 2013) (“<em>Chan</em>, <em>Yeo and Hor</em>”) in
                    chapter 4.1, there are, broadly speaking, four fault elements upon which
                    liability attaches – intention, knowledge, rashness (or recklessness) and
                    negligence. These fault elements reflect varying degrees of moral culpability,
                    the highest being that of intention and the lowest being that of negligence.
                    Hence, offences which are intentionally committed often attract the highest
                    maximum sentence that can be meted out, while offences which are negligently
                    committed attract a lower range of sentences.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     Interpreting knowledge to
                    encompass rashness and negligence in s 322 of the PC will mean that all four
                    fault elements are captured under this section. Considering this part of the PC
                    in its totality, in my judgment, the fault elements of rashness and negligence
                    are already adequately addressed under s 338 of the PC. Section 338
                    provides:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-Heading1">
<b>Causing grievous hurt by an
                            act which endangers life or the personal safety of
                        others</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>338</b>.    Whoever causes
                            grievous hurt to any person by doing any act so rashly or negligently as
                            to endanger human life or the personal safety of others, shall be
                            punished —</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(<em>a</em>)    in the case of a
                                rash act, with imprisonment for a term which may extend to 4 years,
                                or with fine which may extend to $10,000, or with both;
                            or</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(<em>b</em>)    in the case of a
                                negligent act, with imprisonment for a term which may extend to 2
                                years, or with fine which may extend to $5,000, or with
                            both.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Rashness and negligence are specifically addressed under s 338. This strongly
                    suggests that the <em>mens rea</em> element of an offence
                    under s 322 of the PC should be limited to that of intention and
                    knowledge.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     There is, however, a potential
                    reason why knowledge in s 322 of the PC could be interpreted to include rashness
                    and negligence. The offence under s 322 is one of “<em>voluntarily</em> causing grievous hurt”. The provisions before and
                    after s 322 likewise employ the same word, “voluntarily”. The word “voluntarily”
                    is described in s 39 of the PC, which provides:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-Heading1">
<b>“Voluntarily”</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>39</b>.    A person is said to
                            cause an effect “voluntarily” when he causes it by means whereby he
                            intended to cause it, or by means which, at the time of employing those
                            means, <em>he knew or had reason to believe to be likely
                                to cause it</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">It could therefore be argued that since the offence under s 322 of the PC uses
                    the word “voluntarily” in its title, this incorporates the standard of knowledge
                        (<em>ie</em>, that one “knew or had reason to believe
                    to be likely to cause it”) as found in s 39 of the PC. This was in fact part of
                    the reasoning adopted by the High Court in <em>Sim Yew
                        Thong</em> (at [18]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     I do not agree that the general
                    description of “voluntariness” as found in s 39 of the PC justifies the
                    incorporation of the concepts of rashness and negligence into s 322 of the PC.
                    In my judgment, this is not the purpose of s 39 of the PC. The general
                    description of voluntariness in s 39 of the PC is premised on a more fundamental
                    principle in common law, which is that a person should not be liable for
                        <em>involuntary</em> behaviour. This principle has its
                    roots in the common law concept of automatism. As the authors in <em>Chan</em>, <em>Yeo and Hor</em> at para
                    3.2.2 explain:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In general, a person is not liable for involuntary behaviour for the
                        simple reason that he or she has not <em>done</em>
                        anything. At common law, this state is termed “automatism”. Hence, if there
                        is evidence that the act was not voluntary, the accused in effect denies
                        that there was in fact an offence. Lack of voluntariness is not a “defence”
                        as such and it remains the Prosecution’s burden to prove beyond reasonable
                        doubt that the act was in fact voluntary.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     This fundamental principle means
                    that, apart from strict or absolute liability offences, liability under penal
                    law attaches only when, in the broad use of the word, there is voluntariness.
                    When an act is committed intentionally, knowingly, rashly, or negligently, it is
                    said to be voluntarily committed. The converse does not hold true – if an act is
                    voluntarily committed, it does not mean that it must include all four fault
                    elements of intention, knowledge, rashness or negligence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     The description of the offence
                    “voluntarily causing grievous hurt” therefore, need not necessarily incorporate
                    the concepts of rashness and negligence. For the reasons stated above, I hold
                    that it does not. This seems to be the position taken in the IPC as well. In
                        <em>Gour</em>, the learned author at p 3317, commenting
                    on s 337 of the IPC (“causing hurt by act endangering life or personal safety of
                    others”, which is for all purposes <em>in pari
                        </em><em>materia</em> with s 336 of the PC),
                    states:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">All these four offences possess the same elements in common, viz. rashness
                        or negligence and absence of “voluntariness” in causing hurt to anyone. As
                        such, they take a lower place in point of criminality <em>than a voluntary criminal act in which there is either intention or
                            knowledge of the consequence</em>. The mental elements controlling
                        criminality are thus fourfold: (i) rashness or negligence, (ii)
                        voluntariness, (iii) knowledge or likelihood, and lastly (iv) intention.
                        They each mark an ascending scale in point of criminality as determined by
                        the actor’s mentality which is the sole or almost the sole criterion of
                        criminal capacity in the Code.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">In the context of voluntarily causing grievous hurt, it is therefore clear
                    that this should only include either intention or knowledge, and not rashness or
                    negligence.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Application to the facts</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     I return to the legal question
                    posed earlier at [36] – when the appellant delivered his punch, did he intend or
                    know that it was likely to cause the victim some form of grievous hurt? In
                    determining this question, I considered the following factors:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_46-p2_a"></a>(a)     the appellant was
                        running out at a high speed, and had landed a single punch in continuum with
                        his movement;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_46-p2_b"></a>(b)     the appellant was aggressive and was spewing vulgarities
                        just before he made contact with the victim;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_46-p2_c"></a>(c)     the appellant had landed a single
                        punch on the victim’s face;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_46-p2_d"></a>(d)     the victim was
                    intoxicated;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_46-p2_e"></a>(e)     the victim had stumbled back as a result of the punch,
                        tripped on a kerb and then fallen.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Taking all these factors into consideration, I was of the view that the
                    appellant did not intend or know that he was likely to cause grievous
                    hurt.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     The first form of grievous hurt
                    that the appellant could have intended or known himself likely to cause was the
                    specific grievous hurt the victim suffered, which is the fracture. It must be
                    shown therefore that in the entire context of events, the appellant, in punching
                    the victim, intended or knew that it was likely that the victim would have
                    fallen, tripped, and then hit his head. In the course of a fight, a fall
                    resulting from a punch might not be surprising or even unexpected. However, I
                    was not convinced in the present context that intention or knowledge can be
                    attributed to the appellant for the entire ensuing chain of events, <em>ie</em>, that the victim would stumble, trip and fall and
                    then knock his head, thus sustaining the fracture. At the very most, it could be
                    said that the appellant ought to have known that it was likely that the victim
                    would stumble and fall. That alone does not fulfil the <em>mens
                        rea</em> of an offence under s 322 of the PC.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     The second form of grievous hurt
                    that the appellant could have intended or known himself likely to cause was any
                    other form of grievous hurt. As asserted by the Prosecution at para 35(b) of
                    their submissions for this appeal, the appellant should have known that by
                    punching the victim’s face, this could have led to “a whole host of fractures,
                    such as nose fractures, orbital blowouts and maxillary fractures”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     While there is some merit to
                    this argument, it cannot be the case that the <em>mens
                        </em><em>rea</em> element of the offence is made
                    out once a punch is thrown to the face. Based on the facts of this case, in my
                    judgment, the Prosecution had not proven beyond reasonable doubt that the
                    appellant intended or knew that his punch was likely to have caused grievous
                    hurt. First, I was of the view that this punch, though delivered with some
                    degree of force, was not of such considerable force as suggested by the
                    Prosecution. If the appellant had landed a punch of such considerable force, the
                    victim would in all likelihood have sustained some severe form of injury to his
                    face. It is noteworthy that in the medical report dated 20 July 2012 from Dr
                    Ashfaq A Larik of the Singapore General Hospital to Staff Sergeant Ong Zhiwei to
                    assist with the investigation, there was little mention of bruising to the face,
                    which would be more consistent with an injury sustained from a forceful punch.
                    The injuries noted were as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Initial findings were hematoma on the forehead, bleeding from right ear,
                        constricted right pupil, some abrasions found on right arm and leg and his
                        breath smelled of alcohol …</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">According to hospital notes, he sustained almost all major injuries only
                        to his skull and brain, which is consistent with high impact external force,
                        directed to his head area …</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     There were no apparent facial
                    injuries other than hematoma on the forehead and a constricted right pupil. I
                    noted that it was possible that the attending doctor’s focus may have been on
                    the more serious injuries sustained by the victim, but this would also support
                    the inference that there were few serious facial injuries sustained. Moreover,
                    the victim was intoxicated and had already been involved in an earlier fight
                    during those early hours of the morning. Taking all these into account, there
                    was at least a measure of doubt as to whether the appellant had delivered such a
                    strong and powerful blow as to have felled the victim through the sheer force of
                    the blow alone, causing him to sustain a fracture as a result.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     More importantly, I also noted
                    that the appellant had only thrown a single punch at the victim. This was not a
                    situation where the appellant had repeatedly rained blows on the victim on a
                    vulnerable area. Taking the above factors into consideration, I was of the view
                    that the <em>mens rea</em> element of the charge was not
                    made out.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">There is no right of private defence</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     The trial judge at [29]–[34] of
                    his GD addressed why the appellant could not rely on the right of private
                    defence. I agreed with his finding, apart from two points where I differed. At
                    [33], the trial judge concluded that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">On the facts of the present case I find it hard to accept that the accused
                        reasonably apprehended danger due to an attempt or a threat by the victim to
                        commit an offence affecting [Quek]. The accused had failed to show that
                        there was no time to seek the protection of public authorities or that the
                        harm caused to the victim was reasonably necessary in private
                        defence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     First, there is evidence (given
                    by Kevin) to suggest that Quek had been punched by the victim before the
                    appellant intervened. The victim continued to attempt to assault Quek. As such,
                    I found that the appellant indeed reasonably apprehended that Quek was in danger
                    of further harm. Second, I was of the view that there was insufficient time to
                    seek protection from public authorities. Quek and the victim were already
                    engaged in a fight, and blows had already been exchanged. In those
                    circumstances, it was reasonable that the appellant felt that he had to
                    intervene immediately.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     However, as stated above, I
                    agreed with the trial judge that the appellant ultimately could not rely on the
                    right of private defence, even if such a right had arguably arisen. The first
                    altercation between Quek and the victim was a hand-to-hand fight. Neither party
                    was armed. The harm that could possibly result from the first altercation was
                    therefore minimal. In order to break up the fight or to disable the victim in
                    that context of exercising the right of private defence, a shove or tackle, a
                    push, or at most a punch to a less vulnerable area might have been more
                    justifiable. A punch to the face was clearly unnecessary and
                excessive.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     Finally, doubt can also be cast
                    on the appellant’s motivations for intervening in the first altercation,
                    especially given his aggressive behaviour just prior to his intervention. The
                    trial judge rightly accorded weight to the finding that the appellant was the
                    aggressor, and his aggressive conduct would also support the finding that the
                    harm caused was not reasonably necessary.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     I should add that the Court of
                    Appeal’s observations in <em>Tan Chor Jin v Public
                        Prosecutor</em> [2008] 4 SLR(R) 306 at [46] pertaining to whether an
                    aggressor can avail himself of the right of private defence would appear to
                    relate strictly to two-party scenarios. In such situations, it would usually be
                    possible to easily distinguish between the aggressor and the victim. In the
                    present case, the appellant had intervened ostensibly in order to defend Quek.
                    It cannot be correct to suggest that a person who attacks another in order to
                    defend a third party will invariably be characterised as an aggressor and thus
                    be deprived of the right of private defence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     I found no reason to disturb the
                    trial judge’s holding that the appellant could not rely on the right of private
                    defence. The right of private defence had been exceeded. I agreed with the trial
                    judge that the harm caused was not reasonably necessary in the
                    circumstances.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Sentencing</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a>58     Given my finding that the
                        <em>mens rea</em> element of the charge was not made
                    out, the appeal against conviction was allowed to the extent that the conviction
                    of an offence punishable under s 325 of the PC was set aside. As stated above, I
                    was of the view that the ingredients of an offence under s 321 of the PC had
                    nevertheless been made out. I therefore amended the charge from one of
                    voluntarily causing grievous hurt to one of voluntarily causing hurt <em>simpliciter</em>, punishable under s 323 of the PC, and
                    convicted the appellant accordingly. The amended charge would thus state that he
                    had voluntarily caused hurt to the victim by punching him on his face. The
                    evidence adduced at trial showed that as a result of the punch, the victim
                    stumbled back, tripped and then fell to the ground.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a>59     Various sentencing precedents
                        (<em>Abdul Aziz bin Omar v Public Prosecutor</em> (MA
                    145/2000/01) (unreported); <em>Public Prosecutor v Lee Beng
                        Chuan</em> (MAC 6332-2011) (unreported); <em>Public
                        Prosecutor v Loh Kim Teow</em> (MCN 44-2012) (unreported)) were cited
                    in support of the Prosecution’s submission seeking a sentence of at least six
                    months’ imprisonment. The precedents cited involved cases where the victims died
                    after the assault, in circumstances which did not necessarily suggest any causal
                    link between the assault and death. There were, however, no precedents where the
                    facts were broadly similar.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a>60     Counsel for the appellant
                    proposed a fine or at most a short custodial term instead, noting that the
                    appellant had committed the offence on the spur of the moment, as a spontaneous
                    and one-off act. Moreover, he was a first-time offender. A review of the cases
                    as set out in <em>Sentencing Practice in the Subordinate
                        Courts</em> vol 2 (LexisNexis, 3rd Ed, 2013) shows that the sentences
                    generally imposed for an offence under s 323 of the PC have ranged from a fine
                    of about $1,000 to up to six months’ imprisonment. The wide range in sentences
                    imposed reflects the reality that much depends on the relevant sentencing
                    factors and considerations in each case.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a>61     I considered the fact that the
                    hurt caused should be viewed in the context of the first altercation between
                    Quek and the victim, and the fact that the appellant had punched the victim in a
                    vulnerable region. He had only thrown a single punch. As counsel had rightly
                    noted, the appellant was also a first-time offender and the offence was
                    committed very much in the heat of the moment.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_62"></a>62     I noted, however, the severity
                    of the injuries suffered by the victim, and I sympathise with the victim’s
                    current plight. The sentence must reflect the moral culpability of the appellant
                    even though he cannot be held to account for the full extent of the unfortunate
                    consequences that befell the victim. It was most unfortunate that the victim had
                    sustained these injuries from a situation that could have been easily avoided if
                    either party, right from the start, had chosen to be the bigger man. The law
                    strongly frowns upon the use of violence in any situation, and both parties have
                    a part to play in the whole context of the incident.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_63"></a>63     Finally, I also noted and agreed
                    with the trial judge’s observations at [40] that the appellant was unremorseful.
                    He maintained that he had merely wanted to prevent a fight. Nonetheless, he
                    sought to disavow all responsibility for the victim’s injuries. Notwithstanding
                    my decision to set aside his conviction of an offence punishable under s 325 of
                    the PC, there was no reason to accord any additional weight to any of the
                    mitigating factors he had raised on appeal.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_64"></a>64     In consideration of all these
                    factors set out above, I sentenced the appellant to 12 weeks’ imprisonment. In
                    my view, this was substantial enough to serve the needs of both specific and
                    general deterrence.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_65"></a>65     For the reasons stated above,
                    the appeal was allowed to the extent that the conviction of an offence
                    punishable under s 325 of the PC would be set aside, but the charge was amended
                    to one of voluntarily causing hurt <em>simpliciter</em>,
                    punishable under s 323 of the PC. The amended charge thus stated that he had
                    voluntarily caused hurt to one Chua Bin Huang by punching him on his
                    face.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_66"></a>66     The appellant was convicted on
                    the amended charge and sentenced to 12 weeks’ imprisonment. I allowed him to
                    commence serving his sentence on 27 October 2014 in view of his request for time
                    to attend to his personal arrangements.</p>
