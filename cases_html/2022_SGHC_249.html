The Convention is silent on whether the term “arbitral award” includes awards made by emergency arbitrators. Article 1(2) of the Convention only states that “[t]he term ‘arbitral awards’ shall include not only awards made by arbitrators appointed for each case but also those made by permanent arbitral bodies to which the parties have submitted”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 The definition of “arbitral award” in s 27(1) of the IAA also includes an order or direction made by an “arbitral tribunal in the course of an arbitration in respect of any of the matters set out in section 12(1)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) to (<span class="font-italic">j</span>)”. The term “arbitral tribunal” is defined in s 2(1) to include “an emergency arbitrator”. However, s 2(1) does not apply to Part 3 of the IAA, which is where ss 27 and 29 are found. There is no definition of “arbitral tribunal” in s 27(1) or anywhere else in Part 3 of the IAA.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 The defendant thus submitted that Parliament intended the term “arbitral award” in s 27(1) of the IAA to exclude awards made by emergency arbitrators; otherwise, Parliament would have amended s 27(1) to expressly refer to awards by emergency arbitrators. The defendant argued that consequently, the Award (being an award by an emergency arbitrator) could not be enforced in Singapore because it was not an “arbitral award” under s 27(1) of the IAA, and therefore could not be a “foreign award” within the meaning of s 29 of the IAA.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 I rejected the defendant’s submission. In my view, on a purposive interpretation, the term “arbitral award” in s 27(1) of the IAA includes awards by emergency arbitrators. Consequently, s 29 of the IAA applies to foreign awards by emergency arbitrators.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 The purposive interpretation of a legislative provision involves three stages, <span class="font-italic">per</span> <span class="font-italic">Tan Cheng Bock v Attorney-General</span> [2017] 2 SLR 850 (“<span class="font-italic">Tan Cheng Bock</span>”)<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [37]:</div><div class="mb-3"><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(a) First, ascertain the possible interpretations of the provision, having regard not only to the text of the provision but also the context of that provision within the written law as a whole.</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(b) Second, ascertain the legislative purpose or object of the statute.</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(c) Third, compare the possible interpretations of the text against the purposes or objects of the statute.</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 With respect to stage one, as stated earlier, the definition of “arbitral award” in s 27(1) includes an order or direction made or given by an “arbitral tribunal”. However, the term “arbitral tribunal” is not defined in s 27(1) or elsewhere in Part 3 of the IAA. In my view, the text is capable of being interpreted to include emergency arbitrators. Such an interpretation is also consistent with the context of the IAA as a whole given that the definition of “arbitral tribunal” in s 2(1) includes emergency arbitrators.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 Stage two deals with the legislative purpose of the IAA. In 2012, the definition of “arbitral tribunal” in s 2(1) was amended to include emergency arbitrators and the definition of “arbitral award” in s 27(1) was amended to include orders or directions made or given in respect of any of the matters set out in s 12(1)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) to (<span class="font-italic">i</span>). Section 12(1)(<span class="font-italic">i</span>) includes “an interim injunction or any other interim measure”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 The amendments in 2012 speak to an intention to make the IAA applicable to all awards, including foreign interim awards by emergency arbitrators. This intention was confirmed by the following statement in Ministry of Law, “Proposed amendments to the International Arbitration Act and the new Foreign Limitation Periods Act”, press release (8 March 2012) <https: news="" press-releases="" proposed-amendments-to-the-international-arbitration-act-and-the-new-foreign-limitation-periods-act="" www.mlaw.gov.sg="">:</https:></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">16. Clauses 2(a) and 10 of the IA(A) Bill amend the definitions of an ‘arbitral tribunal’ and an ‘arbitral award’ to clarify the status of orders made by such ‘emergency arbitrators’. The amendments accord emergency arbitrators with the same legal status and powers as that of any other arbitral tribunal and ensure that orders made by such emergency arbitrators (<span class="font-italic">whether appointed under the SIAC rules or the rules of any other arbitral institution, in both foreign and local arbitrations</span>) are enforceable under our IAA regime. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 The defendant argued that the phrase “both foreign and local arbitrations” in the passage above could be read as a reference to the <span class="font-italic">venue </span>of the arbitration, rather than the <span class="font-italic">seat</span> of the arbitration. I rejected the defendant’s argument. In my view, it was clear that the phrase “both foreign and local arbitrations” referred to local and foreign-<span class="font-italic">seated </span>arbitrations. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 With respect to stage three, the interpretation that the term “arbitral award” in s 27(1) of the IAA includes awards by emergency arbitrators was clearly consistent with the legislative purpose of the statute.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 A purposive interpretation therefore led to the conclusion that the term “arbitral award” in s 27(1) and by extension, the term “foreign award” in s 29(1), included awards by emergency arbitrators. This conclusion also found support in Timothy Cooke, <span class="font-italic">International Arbitration in Singapore: Legislation and Materials</span> (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 2018) at para 1.232:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The phrase ‘arbitral award’ was originally defined to have the same meaning as in the New York Convention. This was amended in 2012 to include orders or directions of a tribunal in respect of any of the matters set out in section 12(1)(c)–(i) of the IAA. Section 12 refers to powers granted to tribunals seated in Singapore such as making orders or giving directions for the preservation or interim custody of property forming the subject matter of a dispute, for securing the amount in dispute, for interim measures and so on. <span class="font-italic">The effect of this change in definition is that such orders or directions made in foreign arbitrations will be considered ‘foreign awards’ and enforceable like any other New York Convention award in accordance with Part III of the IAA</span>. Additionally, enforcement of such orders or directions can be refused like any other New York Convention award. <span class="font-italic">The broader definition of ‘arbitral award’ and, by extension ‘foreign award’ will encompass emergency arbitration awards whether they are in substance awards or orders or directions (if they relate to matters set out in section 12(1)(c)–(</span><span class="font-italic">i) of the IAA)</span>. Although this was not a stated aim of the amendment in 2012, it would be consistent with the express legislative support for emergency arbitrators in Part II of the IAA, reflected in the amendment, also in 2012, to the definition of ‘arbitral tribunal’ in section 2.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Whether the Award was binding</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 Section 29(2) of the IAA provides as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(2) Any foreign award which is enforceable under subsection (1) must be recognised as binding for all purposes upon the persons between whom it was made and may accordingly be relied upon by any of those parties by way of defence, set-off or otherwise in any legal proceedings in Singapore.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 I agreed with the claimant that the Award was a binding award within the meaning of s 29(2) of the IAA. This is unarguably clear from Art 7(4) of the ICDR’s International Arbitration Rules (“ICDR Rules”), which states:

In that case, the appellants were contractors responsible for the construction of a polycrystalline silicon plant.

The appellants’ pleaded defence was that mechanical completion had been achieved on time, and alternatively that the respondent had waived its right to claim liquidated damages or was estopped from doing so. In their written closing submissions in the arbitration, the appellants raised for the first time a defence claiming an extension of time so as to reduce the amount of liquidated damages payable (“the EOT Defence”). In its written closing submissions, the respondent objected to the appellants’ raising of the EOT Defence. In its award, the arbitral tribunal found that there was 99 days of delay in mechanical completion of the plant but accepted the EOT Defence and extended the time for mechanical completion by 25 days, such that the respondent was only entitled to liquidated damages for 74 days instead of 99 days.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 The High Court set aside the tribunal’s decision to grant the extension of 25 days on the ground that it exceeded the scope of the parties’ submission to arbitration and that it breached natural justice. The Court of Appeal affirmed the High Court’s decision. With respect to the issue of the tribunal’s jurisdiction, the Court of Appeal explained <span class="font-italic">CDM </span>as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">50 ... it would plainly be wrong to construe our decision [in <span class="font-italic">CDM</span>] to mean that so long as the point was covered in the closing submissions, that would be sufficient for it to come within the scope of the submission to arbitration <span class="font-italic">even if it was not pleaded</span>. This court’s remark in <span class="font-italic">CDM </span>was made in the context of closing submissions which were filed to address issues that were <span class="font-italic">already pleaded</span>. In other words, the five sources referred to at [18] of <span class="font-italic">CDM</span> are not <span class="font-italic">discrete or independent</span> sources. It would not suffice for the purposes of determining the tribunal’s jurisdiction that the issue in question had been raised in <span class="font-italic">any one</span> of the five sources. Instead, the overriding consideration is to determine whether the relevant issues had been properly pleaded before the tribunal.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">52 Here, it was common ground that the EOT Defence did not feature anywhere except in the appellants’ written closing submissions in the Arbitration. Thus, it would have been plain and obvious that, until then, the respondent simply had no prior notice that it had to deal with the EOT Defence. The EOT Defence would <span class="font-italic">only</span> fall within the scope of the parties’ submission to arbitration <span class="font-italic">upon </span>the introduction of the EOT Defence (by way of an amendment to the pleadings, if so permitted by the Tribunal) and <span class="font-italic">not any earlier</span>. This is subject, of course, to compliance with any directions made by the Tribunal in relation to the consequential orders arising from a decision to allow the introduction of the EOT Defence … Absent this process, our view was that the EOT Defence could not possibly fall within the scope of the parties’ submission to arbitration. …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis in original]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 At first blush, the decision in <span class="font-italic">CAJ</span> appeared to support the defendant’s case. After all, the claimant’s New Case was raised only in the claimant’s post-hearing submissions in response to the EA’s list of issues (see [15]–[16] above). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 However, as the Court of Appeal explained in <span class="font-italic">CJA v CIZ </span>[2022] SGCA 41 (“<span class="font-italic">CJA</span>”) at [38]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… in considering whether the jurisdiction has been exceeded, the court must look at matters in the round to determine whether the issues in question were live issues in the arbitration. In doing so, it does not apply an unduly narrow view of what the issues were: rather, it is to have regard to the totality of what was presented to the tribunal whether by way of evidence, submissions, pleadings or otherwise and consider whether, in the light of all that, those points were live.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 In <span class="font-italic">CJA</span>, the fundamental point on which the tribunal found for the appellant had not been part of the appellant’s pleaded case. However, it had been raised for the parties’ consideration by the tribunal during the hearing, and it was part of the appellant’s submissions in the arbitration. The respondent had, in its closing submissions, also argued against the fundamental point raised by the appellant. The Court of Appeal concluded that the tribunal had not acted in excess of its jurisdiction. The Court of Appeal (at [61]) distinguished <span class="font-italic">CAJ</span> on the ground that in <span class="font-italic">CAJ</span>, the EOT Defence had been accepted by the tribunal although it was raised for the first time in the appellants’ closing submissions.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Applying the legal principles to the facts</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 The claimant’s New Case came about as a result of questions raised by the EA during the Emergency Hearing. Specifically, the EA asked the claimant whether it would want the distribution channel to continue pending a determination by the full tribunal if it did not get the reliefs sought in the Demand for Arbitration.

</div> Effectively, this meant restoring the status quo on the basis that the Agreements were not terminated.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 Although the claimant’s New Case came about late in the day, it had been raised by the EA for the claimant’s consideration during the Emergency Hearing and in the EA’s post-hearing list of issues, and the claimant made it its alternative case in its post-hearing submissions. The claimant’s New Case was therefore a live issue that had been submitted for the EA’s decision. In my view, the facts of the present case were more similar to those in <span class="font-italic">CJA </span>than <span class="font-italic">CAJ</span>. Accordingly, the Award was not beyond the scope of the submission to the arbitration and I rejected the defendant’s challenge based on s 31(2)(<span class="font-italic">d</span>) of the IAA.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Whether the Award breached the rules of natural justice</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 Pursuant to s 31(2)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the IAA, a court may refuse enforcement of a foreign award if the party against whom enforcement is sought proves that it “was otherwise unable to present [its] case in the arbitration proceedings”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 The grounds for curial intervention in arbitration proceedings are narrowly circumscribed; parties to an arbitration do not have the right to a “correct” decision from an arbitral tribunal but only the right to a decision that is within the ambit of their agreement to arbitrate, and that is arrived at following a fair process: <span class="font-italic">CJA</span> at [1]. However, where either ground for curial intervention can be shown, the court must not hesitate to intervene. In such cases, the arbitral tribunal’s decision cannot be said to be what the parties to the arbitration had agreed to submit to.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 I agreed with the defendant that the circumstances in which the Award was made did not give it an opportunity to present its case with respect to the claimant’s New Case. The claimant’s New Case was raised only in its post-hearing submissions, and even then, it was raised in the alternative. The defendant had no reason to treat the claimant’s New Case as being part of the submission to arbitration until then. However, the EA made the Award after the parties made their post-hearing submissions without hearing any further submissions. The EA simply did not give the defendant any opportunity to resist the claimant’s alternative application for injunctive relief based on the claimant’s New Case. In particular, the defendant contended that it was denied the opportunity to:

For the purposes of the present application, the defendant adduced an expert’s opinion stating that as a matter of Pennsylvanian contract law, the claimant would not be able to seek relief on the basis that the Agreements had not been terminated, if the claimant had taken actions unequivocally indicating that it considered the Agreements to be terminated.
