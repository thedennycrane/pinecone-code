Lim, Heah, Han, Wang and Mr John Koh Kay Hock (“John Koh”) were the shareholders in the third defendant, Ensure Engineering Pte Ltd (“the Company”) when this action started. As the Company is a nominal defendant, I will use the term “defendants” in this judgment to refer to Han and Wang only.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 Lim and Heah tried to exit the Company by offering their shares to the other shareholders in 2013.

</div> Thereafter, Lim and Heah ceased to be shareholders in the Company, and Kwok became a shareholder in the Company. However, the purchase of Kwok’s shares by Han and Wang did not take place because Kwok failed to persuade Lim and Heah to file a notice of discontinuance of the present action. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">5 On 6 April 2016, Kwok filed Summons No 1638 of 2016 and applied to be joined as a plaintiff in this action. Kwok sought to rely on the same claims made by Lim and Heah as well as the evidence already adduced in court. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">6 I heard Kwok’s application together with the closing submissions for the present action on 12 April 2016. Han and Wang opposed Kwok’s application. I reserved judgment. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">7 In the meantime, on 3 May 2016, the remaining shareholder in the Company, John Koh, decided to join the fray. He filed Summons No 2109 of 2016 in which he applied to be joined as a party to this action. I heard the application on 16 June 2016 and dismissed the application for the reasons set out later in this judgment. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">8 Two preliminary issues need to be dealt with first:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) whether Lim and Heah have the requisite standing to continue with their oppression claim under s 216 of the Act (“the s 216 Claim”) since they are no longer shareholders in the Company; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) whether Kwok should be joined as a plaintiff in this action.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Whether Lim and Heah have standing to continue the s 216 Claim</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">9 Only a member or holder of debentures of a company is entitled to seek relief under s 216 of the Act: <span class="font-italic">Kitnasamy s/o Marudapan v Nagatheran s/o Manogar and another</span> [2000] 1 SLR(R) 542 (“<span class="font-italic">Kitnasamy</span>”) at [25]. However, in appropriate circumstances, the respondents to a claim under s 216 may be estopped from asserting that the applicant is not a member: <span class="font-italic">Kitnasamy</span> at [26].<span class="font-italic"> </span>In the present case, it is clear that when this action was commenced, Lim and Heah had the necessary standing to bring the s 216 Claim as they were shareholders of the Company then. However, they ceased to be shareholders of the Company when the transfer of their shares to Kwok was registered on 22 January 2016.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">10 Lim and Heah submitted that they continue to have the requisite standing to maintain the s 216 Claim and referred me to <span class="font-italic">United Rural Enterprises Pty Ltd v Lopmand Pty Ltd</span><span class="font-italic"> and others</span> (2003) 47 ACSR 514 (“<span class="font-italic">Lopmand</span>”). In that case, United Rural Enterprises Pty Ltd (“URE”) and Lopmand Pty Ltd (“Lopmand”) were shareholders of a company called Painten Holdings Pty Ltd (“Painten Holdings”). Lopmand had given a charge over its shares in Painten Holdings as security for a loan given by URE. Lopmand brought an oppression claim against URE. The court held that there was oppression by URE, but before the hearing on remedies, URE registered its equitable charge over Lopmand’s shares and became their owner. By the time the hearing on remedies was held, Lopmand was therefore no longer a shareholder. However, URE conceded that s 234 of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) was satisfied because Lopmand was a member of Painten Holdings at the time of filing the action and that any relevance of its having ceased to be a member subsequently lies at the level of discretion, not jurisdiction (at [25]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">11 Lim and Heah also referred me to <span class="font-italic">Kitnasamy</span>. In that case, the court found that although the appellant was not a registered shareholder, he had the <span class="font-italic">locus standi</span> to petition under s 216 as he had agreed to become a shareholder and was not registered as one due to the default of those responsible for the company’s administration, including the respondents. The court held that the respondents were estopped from asserting that the appellant had no <span class="font-italic">locus standi</span>.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">12 <span class="font-italic">Lopmand</span> is not authority for the proposition that a shareholder who has ceased to be one still has the <span class="font-italic">locus standi</span> to maintain an oppression action. The point was conceded by the respondent in that case. As for <span class="font-italic">Kitnasamy</span>, the facts were very different. The applicant was for all intents and purposes a shareholder except that the company had not registered him as one. On the facts, the respondents were estopped from challenging the applicant’s <span class="font-italic">locus standi</span>. In the present case, Lim and Heah had clearly ceased to be shareholders and it has not been alleged that any estoppel arises in this case. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">13 I agree with the statement in R Hollington QC, <span class="font-italic">Hollington on Shareholders’ Rights</span> (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 7th Ed, 2013) (“<span class="font-italic">Hollington</span>”) at para 9-15 that “where a registered shareholder has freely disposed of his shares … he will no longer have <span class="font-italic">locus standi</span> once he has ceased to be registered as a member”. As a matter of principle, this must be correct. After all, it is trite that the matters complained of under s 216 must affect the applicant <span class="font-italic">qua</span> shareholder and that the court’s powers under s 216(2) are to be exercised “with a view to bringing to an end or remedying the matters complained of”. With one exception, it is difficult to see how a plaintiff would still be entitled to a remedy under s 216 if he has ceased to be a shareholder. In such circumstances, it seems to me quite pointless to allow the plaintiff to carry on with the action. The one exception is where the events which caused the plaintiff to cease to be a shareholder are also the subject matter of the complaint under s 216. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">14 In my opinion, Lim and Heah lost their <span class="font-italic">locus standi</span> to continue with the s 216 Claim when they ceased to be registered as shareholders in the Company.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Whether Kwok should be joined as a plaintiff </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">15 Kwok applied to be joined as a plaintiff under either</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) O 15 r 6(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>)(i) of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2014 Rev Ed) (“the Rules of Court”) on the ground that his “presence before the Court is necessary to ensure that all matters in the cause or matter may be effectually and completely determined and adjudicated upon”; or</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) O 15 r 6(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>)(ii) of the Rules of Court on the ground that “there may exist a question or issue arising out of or relating to or connected with any relief or remedy claimed in the cause or matter which in the opinion of the Court it would be just and convenient to determine” as between Kwok and the other parties to the matter.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">16 Kwok sought to pursue the s 216 Claim either alone or jointly with Lim and Heah, relying on the same evidence that has already been adduced. It is therefore clear that the requirements of O 15 r 6(2)<span class="font-italic">(</span><span class="font-italic">b)</span>(i) would be satisfied provided that Kwok is entitled to pursue the s 216 Claim. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">17 Section 216(1) of the Act provides as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Personal remedies in cases of oppression or injustice</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">216.—</span> (1) Any member or holder of a debenture of a company, or, in the case of a declared company under Part IX, the Minister may apply to the Court for an order under this section on the ground – </div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) that the affairs of the company are being conducted or the powers of the directors are being exercised in a manner oppressive to one or more of the members or holders of debentures including himself or in disregard of his or their interests as members, shareholders or holders of debentures of the company; or</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) that some act of the company has been done or is threatened or that some resolution of the members, holders of debentures or any class of them has been passed or is proposed which unfairly discriminates against or is otherwise prejudicial to one or more of the members or holders of debentures (including himself).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">18 It is common ground that under s 216 only a member or a holder of a debenture of a company is entitled to seek relief (see [9] above). Kwok’s first hurdle is that he was not a member of the Company when this action was commenced. However, Kwok’s joinder as a plaintiff takes effect from the date that the amended writ is served on him and does not operate retrospectively so as to take effect at the commencement of the proceedings: <span class="font-italic">Singapore Civil Procedure 2016</span> vol 1 (Foo Chee Hock JC gen ed) (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 2016) (“<span class="font-italic">Singapore Civil Procedure</span>”)<span class="font-italic"> </span>at para 20/8/3. In my view, Kwok only needs to be a member or holder of a debenture of the Company as of the date that his joinder takes effect. This requirement is satisfied in this case.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">19 Kwok’s next hurdle is that the conduct complained about in the s 216 Claim took place before he became a shareholder. Kwok referred me to <span class="font-italic">Re Spargos Mining NL</span> (1990) 3 ACSR 1 (“<span class="font-italic">Spargos</span>”) and submitted that an applicant under s 216 can rely on conduct that took place before he became a shareholder. In <span class="font-italic">Spargos</span>, the applicant’s complaints in the oppression action included conduct that took place before he became a shareholder. The Supreme Court of Western Australia held that it was not necessary that the applicant be himself aggrieved by the conduct complained of. However, the decision in <span class="font-italic">Spargos </span>was based on the language in s 320 of the Australian Companies Code which referred to “… affairs of the company … being conducted in a manner that is oppressive or unfairly prejudicial to, or unfairly discriminatory against, a member or members, or in an manner that is contrary to the interests of the members as a whole” (at 3). Murray J was of the view that “if the legislature had intended that only an aggrieved member should be able to apply to the court under s 320, it would have said so” (at 6). It was for this reason that his Honour concluded that “the unfairness required to be established … need not be to the particular member who is the applicant” (at 6).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">20 The language in s 216 of the Act is different (see [17] above). Section 216(1) provides four alternative limbs – oppression, disregard of interests, unfair discrimination and prejudicial conduct. The first, third and fourth limbs are expressly qualified by the words “including himself” thus making it clear that for these three limbs at least, the applicant must be an aggrieved party. As for the second limb – disregard of interests – the language in s 216(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) appears not to require the applicant’s interest to be affected. However, it is settled law that the four limbs in s 216(1) are not to be read disjunctively. The common thread underlying the entire section is that of unfairness. The common test is that of “a visible departure from the standards of fair dealing and a violation of the conditions of fair play which a shareholder is entitled to expect”: <span class="font-italic">Over &amp; Over Ltd v Bonvests Holdings Ltd </span><span class="font-italic">and another </span>[2010] 2 SLR 776 (“<span class="font-italic">Over &amp; Over</span>”) at [70] and [77]. This is a “composite test of commercial unfairness”: Margaret Chew, <span class="font-italic">Minority Shareholders’ Rights and Remedies</span> (LexisNexis, 2nd Ed, 2007), at p 228. In my view, this must mean that an applicant under s 216 has to show that he is an aggrieved shareholder, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, that the conduct complained of is commercially unfair <span class="font-italic">to him</span>. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">21 To the extent that the decision in <span class="font-italic">Spargos</span> was based on the specific language in the provision before the court, it is therefore distinguishable. However, this does not spell the end of Kwok’s application to be joined as a plaintiff. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">22 In <span class="font-italic">L</span><span class="font-italic">loyd v Casey and others </span>[2002] 1 BCLC 454, the court held that an applicant under s 459 of the Companies Act 1985 (c 6) (UK) could rely on conduct which took place before he became a registered shareholder. The court noted that the words used in s 459 were “the company’s affairs are being <span class="font-italic">or have been</span> conducted in a manner which is unfairly prejudicial” (at [50]). That decision was followed in New Zealand in <span class="font-italic">Tyrion Holdings Ltd v Claydon </span>[2015] NZAR 698. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">23 Section 216(1)<span class="font-italic">(</span><span class="font-italic">b) </span>of the Act refers to acts that have been done and resolutions that have been passed. In my view, Kwok can rely on acts that were done before he became a member of the Company. Section 216 merely requires Kwok to (a) be a member of the company when he applies for relief and (b) show that the defendants’ misconduct is commercially unfair to him. In this case, once joined as a plaintiff, Kwok would be a member who is claiming relief under s 216. The remaining question then is whether the defendants’ misconduct (including their past misconduct) is commercially unfair to Kwok. The issue of commercial unfairness will be discussed later (see [160] below). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 The defendants’ main objection to Kwok’s joinder was that Kwok’s joinder operates retrospectively from the commencement of the action and that Kwok was not a shareholder of the Company then. However, as seen earlier (at [18]), this is incorrect; Kwok’s joinder takes effect from the date the amended writ is served on him. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 Lim and Heah also made a separate submission that the defendants should not have registered the transfer to Kwok since the settlement negotiations had broken down in that Kwok failed to persuade Lim and Heah to discontinue this action (see [4] above). It was not clear where Lim and Heah were headed with this submission as they did not seek to set aside the transfer to Kwok. Lim and Heah did not press this point. In any event, it is clear that under the 2016 Deed, the registration of the transfer to Kwok was not dependent upon Kwok successfully persuading Lim and Heah to discontinue this action. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 For the above reasons, I grant Kwok’s application to be joined as a plaintiff in this action. In this judgment, I will use the term “plaintiffs” to refer to Lim, Heah and Kwok.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Reasons for dismissal of John Koh’s application</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 John Koh’s application to be joined as a party was made pursuant to O 15 r 6(2)<span class="font-italic">(</span><span class="font-italic">b)</span>(ii) of the Rules of Court. It was not clear from his application or his supporting affidavit whether he sought to be joined as a plaintiff or as a defendant. It was only during the hearing before me that his counsel confirmed that John Koh sought to join the action as a plaintiff. John Koh submitted that if I ordered the defendants to buy out the Lim and Heah, or Kwok, then I should make a similar order for the defendants to buy out his shares too.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 John Koh submitted that he should be joined as a party because all shareholders of a company should be included as parties in an action under s 216. In support of this proposition, John Koh referred me to <span class="font-italic">Re a Company (No 007281 of 1986) </span>[1987] BCLC 593 (“the <span class="font-italic">3i </span>case”) and <span class="font-italic">Re BSB </span><span class="font-italic">Holdings Ltd</span> [1993] BCLC 246 (“<span class="font-italic">Re BSB</span>”). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 In the <span class="font-italic">3i </span>case, the petitioner in an oppression action joined 3i as a respondent. 3i was a shareholder in the company whose affairs were alleged to be conducted in an unfairly prejudicial manner. However, there were no allegations or claims for relief made against 3i. 3i applied to have the petition against it struck out.<span class="font-italic"> </span>The application was dismissed. Vinelott J referred to a practice of the Companies Court to require all shareholders of a company whose interests have been affected by the alleged misconduct or who would be affected by the court’s order in an oppression action to be made respondents to the action even if no allegations of misconduct or claims for relief are made against them. In his view, a buy out order would affect other shareholders because it would override any pre-emption provisions in the company’s articles and alter the balance of voting rights (at 598–599). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 In <span class="font-italic">Re BSB</span>, Vinelott J referred to his earlier decision in the <span class="font-italic">3i </span>case and reiterated the views he had expressed in that case (at 253). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 In my view, the proposition advanced by John Koh goes too far. I do not accept that, as a general principle, all shareholders of the company must be joined as parties in an action under s 216. In this respect, I would respectfully depart from the view expressed in the <span class="font-italic">3i </span>case<span class="font-italic"> </span>and <span class="font-italic">Re BSB</span>.<span class="font-italic"> </span>Whether any shareholder should be joined as a party must depend on the facts. In particular, I do not see any reason to join a shareholder as a party in an action under s 216 against his will if there is no relief claimed against him: see, also, <span class="font-italic">Hollington</span> at para 9-43. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 That said, John Koh still could come within O 15 r 6(2)<span class="font-italic">(</span><span class="font-italic">b)</span>(ii) of the Rules of Court. After all, he was seeking to join the action as a plaintiff and be bought out as well. There was therefore an issue connected with a relief claimed in this action. However, whether he should be joined as a party was subject to the overriding consideration that his joinder must be “just and convenient”: <span class="font-italic">Chan Kern Miang v Kea Resources Pte Ltd</span> [1998] 2 SLR(R) 85 at [22]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 Both the plaintiffs and the defendants objected to John Koh’s application, primarily for two reasons. First, joining John Koh as a plaintiff would be prejudicial to the plaintiffs and defendants as the trial would have to be re-opened. John Koh’s joinder would result in amendments to pleadings, discovery and further evidence including cross-examination of John Koh. The question of how John Koh’s interests as a shareholder had been prejudiced had to be tried. Second, John Koh’s application was made very late in the day although he had known about this action all along. John Koh had even attended the trial and listened to the evidence in court. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 I agreed with the plaintiffs and defendants. John Koh’s case was very different from that of Kwok. Kwok had merely stepped into the shoes of Lim and Heah after he was registered as a shareholder on 18 February 2016.

</div> There were no new facts or evidence required in his case. In contrast, joining John Koh would require the trial to be re-opened and this would be prejudicial to the plaintiffs and defendants. In addition, John Koh offered no explanation whatsoever as to why he sat on his hands until after closing submissions had been made. John Koh’s application seemed opportunistic.

It is common ground that during the Pre-Agreement Period no dividends were declared. The directors’ fees served as distribution of dividends. This approach worked during the Pre-Agreement Period as all the shareholders were directors. However, after the 2001 Agreement, not all shareholders were directors. The 2001 Agreement provided for dividends (payable to all shareholders) separate from directors’ fees (payable only to Han and his appointees). The directors’ fees no longer served as dividends. Since Lim and Heah were required to resign as directors under the 2001 Agreement, it would not have made any sense for them to agree to continue computing directors’ fees, after the 2001 Agreement, in the same way as it was computed during the Pre-Agreement Period. On the stand, Han could not offer any explanations why the same formula should continue to apply after the 2001 Agreement.

As stated earlier, in my view, Han understood the contents of the 2001 Agreement and he did not correct clauses 3.7 and 9 because they were correct. I note that the 2001 Agreement also differed from the March 2001 letter in that the 2001 Agreement (a) does not restrict directors to members of the “Top Management Team” and instead gives Han the power to appoint a majority of the Board; (b) does not provide for any Shareholders’ Committee; and (c) contains a specific formula for the computation of dividends instead of leaving it to the Board’s discretion.

The only difference is that if computed based on profits before tax, the amount of directors’ fees will be a larger amount and therefore the taxable profits will be correspondingly lower.

That Han and Wang were in a situation of actual conflict could not have been clearer. Han and Wang owned SVF. Han was director of SVF from 2004 to 2008. Wang remains a director of SVF. As Han admitted, he was the decision-maker for both the Company and SVF. Han and Wang did not inform Lim and Heah of the arrangement with SVF or obtain their consent. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">125 In an attempt to justify the arrangement with SVF, Han referred to a similar arrangement with another entity called Verchem Asia Pacific Pte Ltd (“Verchem”) in which Verchem was paid 45% of the profits made.

She then generated purchase orders amounting to $60,328.27 for the excess stock so that she could balance the inventory in the accounting system. According to her, she issued the purchase orders in SVF’s name as she knew that Han and Wang owned SVF. The Company’s accounts staff subsequently paid the amount to SVF by mistake. Anna Ng claimed that she did not notice the mistake. Also, she did not inform Han or Wang about this matter until recently.

</div></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Conclusion on s 216 Claim</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">154 Lim and Heah have proven most of their allegations. In my judgment, Han and Wang have conducted the affairs of the Company in a manner that is clearly oppressive and in blatant disregard of the interests of Lim and Heah.  The acts which Han and Wang have caused the Company to take also clearly unfairly discriminate against and are unfairly prejudicial to Lim and Heah.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">155 Although he held only 18% of the shares in the Company, Han managed to secure control over the Company in 2001. Han believed in 2000 that the other shareholders needed him to run the Company and would not be prepared to let him leave the Company. This belief turned out to be correct. After offering to resign, Han wrote to the Board two days later on 15 May 2000 and pointed out that the Board had no alternative person who could lead the Company. This led to the 2001 Agreement, under which Lim and Heah agreed to resign as directors and Han was given control of the Company and a very generous share of the profits as directors’ fees. In return, the agreement among the shareholders was that 75% of the Company’s Net Profits each year would be distributed as dividends. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">156 However, having obtained control over the Company, Han proceeded to ignore the terms of the 2001 Agreement save when it suited him. He paid himself more directors’ fees than permitted under the 2001 Agreement. Indeed, over the years, his computations of directors’ fees became more and more favourable to himself. Dividends paid to the shareholders were way below what had been agreed. In some years, no dividends were declared despite provisions having been made for them. As Han admitted, there was no need for him to raise the question of dividends as he had his directors’ fees. Han brushed aside objections from Lim and/or Heah by asserting his own interpretations of the 2001 Agreement. Wang stood firmly in Han’s camp. Lim and Heah were unable to take Han on. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">157 Han even ignored the votes cast in 2004 by Ang, Bernard and Heah through their proxies. Han’s conduct in respect of the voting at the 30th AGM in 2003 was atrocious. His refusal to let the proxies appointed by Lim and Heah vote at the 40th AGM in 2014 was inexcusable.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">158 In addition, Han’s attitude towards any question of conflict of interest was cavalier, to say the least. Han and Wang had no qualms about making secret profits using SVF, a company which they owned. Han also decided his own remuneration in the Company. Han summed up his own attitude best when he said that as the “boss” of the Company there was nothing wrong with him deciding his own remuneration. Evidently, there was no place in his mind for the interests of Lim and Heah. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">159 This case bears all the hallmarks of a classic case of oppression. There is no question in my mind that the defendants’ conduct violated all reasonable expectations of commercial fairness. In my view, the defendants’ conduct was plainly reprehensible.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">160  The next question is whether the defendants’ misconduct can be said to be commercially unfair to Kwok despite the fact that the conduct complained off took place before Kwok became a shareholder of the Company. In my view, the answer must be in the affirmative. The overpayment of directors’ fees and the payments to SVF have significantly reduced the funds available to the Company. This is commercially unfair to Kwok.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">161 I should also refer to the defendants’ submission that the plaintiffs are not entitled to any remedy under s 216 because the plaintiffs, together with John Koh, have majority control of the Company. Relying on <span class="font-italic">Ng Kek Wee v Sim City Technology Ltd</span> [2014] 4 SLR 723 (“<span class="font-italic">Sim City</span>”), the defendants argued that the plaintiffs, together with John Koh, could exercise their majority rights as shareholders. I reject the defendants’ submissions. The touchstone of control is not whether the plaintiffs are minority shareholders of the Company but whether they lack the power to stop the oppressive acts: <span class="font-italic">Sim City </span>at [48]. In this case, Lim and Heah could not control the Board; the 2001 Agreement gave Han the right to appoint a majority of the Board. In addition, when Ang, Bernard and Heah tried to exercise their shareholders’ votes in 2004, Han simply ignored their votes. In 2014, Lim and Heah tried to exercise their votes as shareholders but Han refused to let them vote. Finally and in any event, there was no evidence that John Koh was prepared to vote with the plaintiffs to remove Han and Wang from the Board. In fact, at the 30th AGM (FY2003) held in 2004, after the proxies appointed by Ang, Bernard and Heah had voted and left the meeting, John Koh was the one who proposed re-voting after which he voted alongside Han and Wang.

I respectfully agree with the decision in <span class="font-italic">Tan Yong San</span>.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">164 Han and Wang tried to draw a distinction between the conduct alleged to be oppressive and any remedy under s 216 which involves the return of monies paid. It was submitted that the Limitation Act applies to the latter but not the former. I disagree with the submission. I agree with <span class="font-italic">Tan Yong San </span>that an claim under s 216 is statutory in nature and does not fall within any of the limbs in s 6 of the Limitation Act.

The defendants referred me to <span class="font-italic">Tan Yong San</span>. In that case, the court decided that </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) equitable defences including laches or inordinate delay are not an automatic bar to relief under s 216, which is statutory in nature; rather, any inequity would simply be a relevant factor in the court’s overall assessment of whether there has been unfairness warranting relief under s 216(2) and what type of relief is just and equitable in the circumstances (at [106]);</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) relief may be refused due to the minority shareholder’s acquiescence in the affairs complained of (at [115]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">167 I respectfully agree with the decision in <span class="font-italic">Tan Yong San </span>that any inequity (including laches) is just a factor in the overall assessment of unfairness under s 216 and the relief which should be granted.

Merely because a shareholder does not immediately initiate legal proceedings complaining about treatment unfairly dished out to him does not mean that he is always precluded from doing so subsequently: <span class="font-italic">Over &amp; Over</span> at [103].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">169 In the present case, the defendants argued that Lim and Heah did not protest against the directors’ fees and dividends at the AGMs until the AGM for FY2013 and Lim attended most of the AGMs and approved the directors’ fees and dividends. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">170 I agree with the plaintiffs that the allegations of laches and acquiescence must be looked at in the context of the following:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) At the 28th AGM for FY2001 held in May 2002, Lim protested that the dividends and directors’ fees were not in the ratio of 75:25. However, Han insisted that he had misinterpreted the 2001 Agreement. I accept Lim’s evidence that he felt cowed by Han’s hostility and insistence. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Lim felt that there was no point protesting at the AGM for FY2002 held in 2003 because of what had happened the year before.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) At the 30th AGM for FY2003 held in 2004, Heah, Ang and Bernard, acting through their proxies, (i) appointed Ang, Bernard and Heah’s proxy as directors; (ii) did not appoint Han and Wang as directors; and (iii) voted against the resolutions relating to directors’ fees and remuneration. However, Han disregarded the proxies’ votes and reinstated Wang and himself as directors.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) In 2003, Lim turned down Ang’s request to join him in his action against Han due to his limited financial resources and the fact that he was still employed by the Company. Lim felt it was pointless to challenge Han.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) I accept the assertions by Lim and Heah that the dismissal of Ang’s suit against Han in August 2004 made them feel helpless against Han. Lim and Heah are not as well educated as Han and both are of a gentler disposition compared to Han. They also had limited financial resources to challenge the defendants.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(f) At the 39th AGM (FY2012) held on 28 June 2013, $2,042,479 was declared as directors’ fees.

Lim and Heah then sold their shares to Kwok in February 2014 but Han and Wang did not approve the transfers to Kwok then.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(g) At the 40th AGM (FY2013) held in 2014, Lim and Heah, through their proxies, challenged the proposed directors’ fees and directors’ remuneration and wanted to nominate directors. Han refused to let them vote on the proposed directors’ fees and remuneration or to nominate directors.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">171 In my view, the mere fact that the plaintiffs commenced this action only in 2014 does not in any way lessen the unfairness of the defendants’ reprehensible conduct towards Lim and Heah. Neither can it be said that there was any acquiescence on the part of Lim or Heah. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The appropriate relief</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">172 The plaintiffs sought orders that: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) the defendants repay to the Company the overpayment of directors’ fees received by them;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) the defendants be liable in damages for, make restitution of or account for the monies wrongfully paid by the Company to SVF.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">173 In my view, (b) above represents claims by the plaintiffs seeking restitution of the amounts siphoned off by the defendants from the Company. These are corporate wrongs that could have been pursued by the plaintiffs by way of a derivative action under s 216A of the Act. As the Court of Appeal observed in <span class="font-italic">Sim City</span> at [63], s 216 should not be used to vindicate corporate wrongs.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">174 The relief to be ordered must be made with a view to bringing to an end or remedying the matters complained of: s 216(2). For the reason stated in [173] above, the orders sought by the plaintiffs would not address all the matters complained of. In my view, the more appropriate order to make in this case is that Han and Wang are to buy the shares held by Kwok in the Company. Directions can be given for the valuation to take into consideration the matters complained of. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">175 In their statement of claim, the plaintiffs did not ask for an order that the defendants purchase their shares in the Company. However, the court hearing an s 216 application “has an unfettered discretion to make such order as it thinks appropriate” (<span class="font-italic">Low Peng Boon v Low Janie and others and other appeals</span> [1999] 1 SLR(R) 337 at [55]), and is not constrained by the parties’ pleaded remedies<span class="font-italic">.</span> The issue of a buy out was raised during closing submissions and the parties made further submissions on this issue. The plaintiffs did not raise any objections to a buy out by the defendants.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">176 I therefore order Han and Wang to purchase Kwok’s shares in the Company at fair valuation. If parties are unable to agree on the valuer within 21 days, Kwok, and Han and Wang, are to submit details of their respective proposed valuers to me within seven days thereafter, and I will decide on the valuer to be appointed. The costs of the valuation are to be paid by Han, Wang and Kwok in equal proportions. The shares are to be valued as of the date of this judgment and the valuer is to proceed on the basis of the following assumptions:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The total amount of directors’ fees paid out for the period from FY2001 to FY2013 is $1,571,763 instead of $7,600,027.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The amount of $1,746,000, paid to SVF pursuant to the revenue sharing arrangement, has been returned to the Company.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) An amount of $486,000, paid to SVF as rental, has been returned to the Company.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) The amount of $60,328.27, paid to SVF in respect of the purchase order for excess stock, has been returned to the Company.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) The amount of $229,249.57, paid for the materials used to refurbish the AMK Church, has been returned to the Company.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">177 Lim and Heah are entitled to their costs in this action (including the counterclaim). Orders would have been made in their favour but for the fact that Han and Wang registered the transfers to Kwok after all the evidence had been taken. I therefore order Han and Wang to pay costs to Lim, Heah and Kwok fixed at $320,000 plus reasonable disbursements to be fixed by me if not agreed.</div><div class="Judg-Sign text-left">Chua Lee Ming<br/>Judicial Commissioner</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Jimmy Yim, SC, Daniel Soo, Andrew Lee and Ben Chia (Drew &amp; Napier LLC) for the plaintiffs;<br/>Lim Seng Siew (OTP Law Corporation) for the defendants.</div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
