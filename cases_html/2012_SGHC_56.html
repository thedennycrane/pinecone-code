<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Interlocutory and Joinder applications</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       United Overseas Bank (“UOB”) was
                    the mortgagee of a property known as 530 East Coast Road, #18-04 Ocean Park,
                    Singapore (“Ocean Park”). On 5 June 2009, UOB exercised its
                    power of sale over the property following a default on the repayment of the loan
                    secured by the mortgage. The property was sold for the price of $1,650,000.
                    After the sale proceeds were used to settle all outstanding sums due and owing
                    to UOB, the sum of $1,092,086.70 remained as balance sale proceeds. UOB tried to
                    return the balance sale proceeds to the registered proprietors, Giok Bie Jao
                    (“Madam Giok”) and Jaury Jacob (“Jaury”). In the
                    ordinary course of things, this would have happened. After a lengthy discourse,
                    UOB found itself faced with conflicting views: Jaury agreed to the release of
                    the balance sale proceeds to the registered proprietors but Madam Giok wanted
                    the balance sale proceeds to be divided equally amongst five people: the
                    registered proprietors, Jimmy Jonathan (“Jimmy”), Arifin Jacob,
                    and Antonius Jao. In those circumstances, UOB interpleaded and filed Originating
                    Summons No 514 of 2010 against Madam Giok as the first defendant, and Jaury
                    as the second defendant. I need only note that pending the determination of the
                    rival contentions in the present case, UOB was ordered to pay into Court the
                    balance sale proceeds and its solicitor’s attendance at all future
                    hearings was dispensed with.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       On 4 March 2011, Jimmy was joined as a
                    party to the proceedings. He was the named third defendant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       By an Order made by the Senior Assistant
                    Registrar, the interpleader issues to be tried were as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_3-p2_i"></a>(i)     Whether [Jaury or Jimmy] is the
                        beneficial owner of the property ... which was purchased under the names of
                        [Madam Giok and Jaury] [and] who is therefore entitled to the balance sale
                        proceeds from [UOB’s] mortgagee sale of the property;
                    and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_3-p2_ii"></a>(ii)     Whether
                        [Jaury] was aware of and executed the UOB Mortgage for the property in
                        Surabaya, Indonesia in 2004.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       It was also directed that the interpleader
                    issues be tried with Jaury in the position of plaintiff.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       I hasten to mention at the outset that I
                    declined to rule on the second interpleader issue as it was concerned with the
                    circumstances surrounding the procurement of the mortgage which had no relevance
                    at all to the substance of the interpleader relief sought by UOB in the light of
                    the competing claims to the balance sale proceeds paid into Court. The purpose
                    of interpleader relief is observed in <em>Australia and New
                        Zealand Banking Group Ltd v Ding Pei Chai and others</em> [2004]
                    3 SLR(R) 489 at [3]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">an interpleader issue directed under O 17 of the Rules of Court
                        (Cap 322, R 5 [2006] Rev Ed), is a means for the court to decide
                        the claims as between the persons present at the proceedings in order that
                        the person interpleading may get the relief to which he is entitled (see
                            <em>De La Rue v Hernu, Peron &amp; Stockwell,
                            Limited</em> [1936] 2 KB 164 at 173).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Background Facts</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       The parties in the present proceedings are
                    siblings from an Indonesian family. As is common with fairly well to do
                    Indonesians, they bought properties in Singapore and their children spent their
                    growing up years in Singapore.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       In the 1980s, Jaury sent his children to be
                    educated in Singapore. In 1983, he purchased an apartment at 20 Amber Road,
                    #14-02 King’s Mansion, Singapore (“King’s Mansion”) to
                    accommodate his children. Madam Giok, Jaury’s sister, took care of his
                    children in Singapore. King’s Mansion was subsequently sold in 1989. In
                    1985, Jaury purchased an apartment at Shelford Road, which he later sold on
                    4 May 1992.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       On 26 November 1986, a property known as 7
                    Siglap Road, #20-65 Mandarin Gardens, Singapore (“Mandarin
                    Gardens”) was purchased in the sole name of Jimmy. On 16 January
                    1988, Jimmy transferred one-half share of Mandarin Gardens to Jaury. Stamp duty
                    was duly paid but no consideration passed in respect of this transfer.
                    Consequently, Jimmy and Jaury became registered proprietors holding as tenants
                    in common in equal shares. Ocean Park was acquired in June 1990 and it was at
                    all times registered in the names of Madam Giok and Jaury as tenants in common
                    in equal shares.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The competing claimants</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       The dispute was squarely between Jimmy and
                    Jaury. Although Madam Giok was the registered owner of one-half share in the
                    Ocean Park property, she did not assert any beneficial interest in the
                    same.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     Jimmy’s pleaded case was tolerably
                    straightforward - Jimmy had purchased the Ocean Park property
                    which was registered in the names of Madam Giok and Jaury. He argued that there
                    was a resulting trust in his favour in respect of the property, with the result
                    that he held beneficial ownership. As such, he was entitled to the balance sale
                    proceeds in Court. On the other hand, Jaury said he provided the purchase money
                    arguing that Jimmy’s claim of beneficial ownership must fail. In short,
                    Jimmy and Jaury were contending for a purchase money resulting trust. I had to
                    decide where the beneficial interest in the Ocean Park property lay. The main
                    factual issue in dispute was the provenance of the purchase money.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Presumption of resulting trust</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The legal principles</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     The type of resulting trust relied upon in
                    these proceedings is what is commonly known as a purchase money resulting trust,
                    and the classic statement of the law on this subject is to be found in the
                    judgment of Eyre CB in <em>Dyer v Dyer</em> (1788) 30 ER 42
                    at 43. The passage below was cited with approval and followed in <em>Peh Eng Leng v Pek Eng Leong</em> [1996]
                    1 SLR(R) 939 at [16]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The clear result of all the cases, without a single exception, is, that
                        the trust of a legal estate ... whether taken in the names of the purchasers
                        and others jointly, or in the name of others without that of the purchaser;
                        whether in one name or several; whether jointly or successive, results to
                        the man who advances the purchase-money. This is a general proposition
                        supported by all the cases, and there is nothing to contradict it; ...
                        .</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     It was also noted in <em>Dyer v
                        Dyer</em> that such a resulting trust may be rebutted by circumstances
                    in evidence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     The modern day authority on this species of
                    resulting trust is by Lord Browne-Wilkinson’s observations in
                        <em>Westdeutsche Landesbank Girozentrale v Islington Borough
                        Council</em> [1996] AC 669 at 708, cited with approval
                    by the Court of Appeal in <em>Lau Siew Kim v Yeo Guan Chye
                        Terence</em> [2008] 2 SLR(R) 108 (“<em>Lau Siew Kim</em>”) at [34]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<em>Under existing law a resulting trust arises in
                                two sets of circumstances: (A) where A makes a voluntary payment to
                                B or pays (wholly or in part) for the purchase of property which is
                                vested either in B alone or in the joint names of A and B, there is
                                a presumption that A did not intend to make a gift to B: the money
                                or property is held on trust for A (if he is the sole provider of
                                the money) or in the case of a joint purchase by A and B in shares
                                proportionate to their contributions. It is important to stress that
                                this is only a presumption, which presumption is easily rebutted
                                either by the counter-presumption of advancement or by direct
                                evidence of A’s intention to make an outright transfer ... (B)
                                Where A transfers property to B on express trusts, but the trusts
                                declared do not exhaust the whole beneficial interest ... Both types
                                of resulting trust are traditionally regarded as examples of trusts
                                giving effect to the common intention of the parties. A resulting
                                trust is not imposed by law against the intentions of the trustee
                                (as is a constructive trust) but gives effect to his presumed
                                intention</em>.    [emphasis in
                        original]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">For present purposes, it is sufficient to refer to the first
                    circumstance above where A pays for the purchase of property in the name of B
                    alone, or in the joint names of A and B.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     The Court of Appeal in <em>Lau
                        Siew Kim</em> explained that where a transfer of property to another
                    takes place for which the recipient does not provide the whole of the
                    consideration, the lack of intention to benefit the recipient on the part of the
                    purchaser is the fact that is being inferred when the presumption of resulting
                    trust is applied. The presumption is based on a traditional commonsense
                    presumption that, outside of certain relationships (that is, relationships
                    giving rise to the presumption of advancement), an owner of property never
                    intends to make a gift, and, by extension, that a person who provides the money
                    required to purchase a property intends to obtain an equivalent equitable
                    interest in the property acquired (see <em>Lau Siew
                        Kim</em> at [35] to [36]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     From the passages quoted, for the presumption
                    of resulting trust to apply, the money must be provided by the person claiming
                    beneficial interest in the property in his capacity as purchaser, or that his
                    contributions of money were to the purchase price. This means that his
                    beneficial interest under a resulting trust will be determined (a) in the
                    proportion of his direct financial contribution to the purchase price and
                    (b) assessed as at the time when the property was purchased and the trust
                    created.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     A presumption of resulting trust can be
                    rebutted by contrary evidence (see <a href="#p1_12">[12]</a>
                    above and <em>Lau Siew Kim</em> at [52] to [55]). Intention
                    may also be found or inferred from conduct (see generally <em>Hohol v Hohol</em> [1981] VR 221 at p 226). For a guide to the
                    type of evidence admissible to rebut a presumption of resulting trust, I refer
                    to the case of <em>Shephard v Cartwright</em> [1955]
                    1 AC 431. In that case, the House of Lords approved of a passage from
                    the 24<sup>th</sup> Edition of <em>Snell’s
                        Equity</em> which stated that the acts and declarations of the parties
                    before or at the time of the purchase, or so immediately after it as to
                    constitute a part of the transaction, are admissible in evidence either for or
                    against the party who did the act or made the declaration. As for subsequent
                    declarations, they are admissible as evidence only against the party who made
                    them, and not in his favour. However, in the latest edition the authors of
                        <em>Snell’s Equity</em>
                        (32<sup>nd</sup> Ed, 2010) suggested that such evidence
                    should not be excluded but left to the court to decide on the weight to be given
                    to it (see emphasis in bold below). Para 25-013 states:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<em>Contemporaneous and subsequent conduct.</em> The
                        acts and declarations of the parties before or at the time of the purchase,
                        or so immediately after it as to constitute a part of the transaction, are
                        admissible in evidence either for or against the party who did the act or
                        made the declaration. It has been held that subsequent acts and declarations
                        may only be admissible as evidence against the party who made them, and not
                        in his favour. <b><em>The preferable approach nowadays may be
                            to treat the parties’ subsequent conduct as admissible even in
                            their own favour, and to leave the court free to assess its probative
                            weight. This approach would be consistent with the looser significance
                            attached to the presumptions of resulting trust and of advancement in
                            the modern authorities</em></b><em>.</em></p>

<p class="Judg-1">While local courts have previously expressed approval of the rule

<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The Burden of Proof</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     The distinction between legal and evidential
                    burdens of proof was restated in <em>Britestone Pte Ltd v Smith
                        &amp; Associates Far East, Ltd</em> [2007] 4 SLR(R) 855 at
                    [58]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The term “burden of proof” is more properly used with
                        reference to the obligation to prove. There are in fact two kinds of burden
                        in relation to the adduction of evidence. The first, designated the legal
                        burden of proof, is, properly speaking, a burden of proof, for it describes
                        the obligation to persuade the trier of fact that, in view of the evidence,
                        the fact in dispute exists. This obligation never shifts in respect of any
                        fact, and only “shifts” in a matter of loose terminology when
                        a legal presumption operates. The second is a burden of proof only loosely
                        speaking, for it falls short of an obligation to prove that a particular
                        fact exists. It is more accurately designated the evidential burden to
                        produce evidence since, whenever it operates, the failure to adduce some
                        evidence, whether in propounding or rebutting, will mean a failure to engage
                        the question of the existence of a particular fact or to keep this question
                        alive. As such, this burden can and will shift.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     It is well accepted that for a resulting trust
                    to arise, proof of payment of the purchase price is crucial. This is because
                    where the money used for the purchase of the property in the name of B was
                    provided by A, there is a <em>prima facie</em> implication
                    of a resulting trust in favour of A. The legal burden of proof is on that person
                    A who is asserting the existence of a resulting trust to establish that he
                    provided the entire purchase price of the property at the time of the purchase.
                    It has been said that mortgage repayments do not constitute a direct
                    contribution to the purchase price, but the assumption of liability under a loan
                    such as by way of mortgage can constitute such a direct contribution (see
                        <em>Calverley v Green</em> [1984] 155 CLR 242
                        (“<em>Calverley</em>”) at pp 252,
                    257-8). In cases where only a proportion of the price was provided by A, then
                    only a proportionate interest can be claimed in reliance of the presumption. The
                    evidential burden is on B to adduce evidence of circumstances that would rebut
                    the implication of a resulting trust in favour of A. This approach (<em>ie</em>, he who asserts must prove (see s 103 of the
                    Evidence Act Cap 97, Rev Ed 1997)) is similarly taken by the Hong Kong
                    Court of First Instance in <em>Lee Tso Fong v Kwok Wai Sun &amp;
                        anor</em> [2008] 4 HKC 36 at [25] to [26]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I do not think there is any simple rule that the burden of proof lies upon
                        the party against whom the presumption [of resulting trust] operates.
                        Presumptions are rules of evidence. They are not determinative of which
                        party bears the legal burden of proof. The legal burden of proof in any
                        particular case depends on the circumstances in which the claim arises. The
                        general rule is <em>Ei qui affirmat non ei equi negat
                            incumbit probatio</em>. Proof rests on he who affirms, not he who
                        denies. It therefore lies upon the party who substantially asserts the
                        affirmative of the issue: see <em>Constantine Line v Imperial
                            Smelting Corp</em> [1942] AC 154 at 174. This
                        burden is fixed at the beginning of the trial by the state of the
                        pleading.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Prima facie, beneficial ownership goes hand in hand with legal ownership.
                        If a plaintiff seeks to divorce the beneficial ownership from legal
                        ownership and to claim the beneficial ownership in the property which he
                        purchased and transferred to the name of another, he must bear the burden of
                        proving his equitable right which is inconsistent with the undisputed legal
                        title. He may discharge that burden by proving an express trust. Or, he may
                        be assisted by the presumption of resulting trust by proving that he paid
                        the purchase price of the property. But, like all presumptions, the
                        presumption of resulting trust operates only in the absence of evidence to
                        the contrary. Once this presumption is raised, the party seeking to
                        challenge it bears the evidential, but not legal burden, of adducing
                        evidence to displace the presumption of resulting trust. That party may
                        adduce evidence of a contrary common intention of making a gift. If that
                        evidence is insufficient to displace the presumption of resulting trust, the
                        presumption prevails. But if that evidence is sufficient to displace the
                        presumption of resulting trust, the party who has the legal burden will fail
                        unless he can prove the resulting trust.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     The upshot of the stated propositions in the
                    present case is that Madam Giok held her one-half interest in Ocean Park on a
                    resulting trust, and the extent of the trust is measured by the proportion of
                    the purchase money which either Jaury or Jimmy provided. Since Jaury already has
                    one-half legal interest in Ocean Park, the trust is in respect of so much of his
                    beneficial interest as exceeds one-half. As registered owner of one-half
                    interest in Ocean Park, Jaury was <em>prima facie</em> the
                    beneficial owner of that one-half interest. However, if Jimmy did provide the
                    whole of the purchase price, the presumption arises that the property was held
                    on a resulting trust by Madam Giok and Jaury in favour of Jimmy. As this
                    presumption can be rebutted by evidence of contrary intention, the next question
                    is whether there was evidence which showed that Jimmy possessed the intention to
                    benefit Madam Giok and Jaury. The evidential burden of proving such intention
                    would lie with Jaury.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     In the present case, the nub of the issue
                    concerns the purchase moneys. The legal burden of establishing the payment(s)
                    giving rise to a presumption of resulting trust lay with the person who asserts
                    the existence of a resulting trust. Jimmy asserts beneficial ownership of Ocean
                    Park on a claim that he provided the entire purchase price of Ocean Park. In the
                    event Jimmy establishes his financial contribution to the entire purchase price,
                    the entire beneficial ownership is claimed in reliance of the presumption. At
                    that stage, the evidential burden shifts to Jaury. However, if Jimmy is able to
                    establish that only a proportion of the price was provided, then only a
                    proportionate interest can be claimed in reliance of the presumption. Again, the
                    evidential burden shifts to Jaury to rebut the proportionate interest. Jaury has
                    to show by countervailing evidence that Jimmy’s beneficial interest in
                    Ocean Park is not proportionate to his contribution to the purchase price. For
                    example, the money was contribution other than to the purchase price; or that it
                    was money subsequently expended on improvements to the property.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The Provenance of the Purchase Money</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Outline of the decision</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     It was common ground that the purchase price
                    of Ocean Park was funded by the proceeds of sale of Mandarin Gardens. The
                    dispute in the main was on the source of funds for the purchase of Mandarin
                    Gardens.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     Initially, Mandarin Gardens was registered in
                    Jimmy’s name. After a year, Jimmy transferred one-half share to Jaury so
                    that the registered tenants in common in equal shares were Jimmy and Jaury. I
                    should explain that the beneficial interest established at the time of purchase
                    could be altered by subsequent events. One example is where the resulting trust
                    is superseded by an express or constructive trust. Again, beneficial interests
                    can be altered if, for example, the parties came to a later agreement about
                    those interests. Neither party submitted, as it was not their case, that the
                    beneficial interest under the resulting trust (which was created at the time the
                    property was purchased) was altered by the transfer of one-half share to
                    Jaury’s name. In the circumstances, my decision proceeded on the basis
                    that the beneficial interest under the resulting trust was not altered by the
                    transfer of one-half share to Jaury.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     In this written Grounds of Decision, I will
                    first deal with Jimmy’s evidence that he contributed to the whole of the
                    purchase price to acquire Mandarin Gardens. I will examine Jimmy’s oral
                    evidence as to the source of funds for the purchase of Mandarin Gardens. I will
                    also consider Jaury’s evidence on the source of funds for the purchase of
                    Mandarin Gardens.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     If Jaury had contributed the entire purchase
                    price of Mandarin Gardens, Jaury would be entitled to the entire sale proceeds
                    when Mandarin Gardens was sold in 1990. Thus, on the basis that the purchase of
                    Ocean Park was derived from the application of the sale proceeds of Mandarin
                    Gardens, a presumption of resulting trust arose in favour of Jaury. His
                    beneficial interest in Ocean Park would commensurate with his proportionate
                    contribution to the purchase price of Ocean Park.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Purchase of Ocean Park and sale of Mandarin Gardens</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     Before Mandarin Gardens was sold, Jimmy and
                    Jaury opened a DBS joint account numbered [xxx] (the “DBS
                    account”) into which the sale proceeds were eventually deposited. The
                    sale of Mandarin Gardens was completed on 28 July 1990. As stated, the
                    purchase price of Ocean Park was funded by the proceeds of sale of Mandarin
                    Gardens.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     The purchase price of Ocean Park was stated to
                    be $665,000.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> However, a total sum of $687,940.85
                    was in fact paid. This total sum can be split into three sums paid on separate
                    occasions, namely, a booking fee, the balance of the 10% deposit, and the
                    balance of the purchase price. These payments will be discussed not
                    chronologically but in accordance with size of the payment in decreasing order
                    of quantum. The advantage of adopting such an approach is plain as a
                    person’s beneficial interest is determined by the proportion of his direct
                    financial contribution towards the purchase price. The largest payment was
                    $621,440.85 made up of three cheques issued on 4 August 1990 from the DBS
                    account. In percentage terms, this amount works out to approximately 90.33% of
                    the total sum paid. I will refer to this payment as “the 90%
                    payment”. The next payment was for $61,500 and a cheque was issued on
                    6 June 1990 from the same DBS account. In percentage terms, this amount
                    works out to be approximately 8.94% of the total sum. I will refer to this
                    payment as “the 9% payment”. Finally, the smallest payment was the
                    booking fee of $5,000. This was 1% of the purchase price, or the booking fee as
                    it will be referred to below.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">(1)   90% Payment towards acquisition of Ocean Park</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     The immediate origin of the 90% payment was
                    not in dispute. The parties agreed that three cheques from their DBS account
                    totalling $621,440.85 were issued to Messrs Teo &amp; Lim, a firm of solicitors,
                    for the purchase of Ocean Park.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span> It was common ground that the sum of $621,440.85
                    was from the sale proceeds of Mandarin Gardens which had been deposited into the
                    DBS account.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     At the time Mandarin Gardens was sold, the
                    property was registered in the joint names of Jimmy and Jaury. It was not either
                    party’s case that Mandarin Gardens was <em>prima
                        facie</em> jointly owned in equity. I was persuaded on the overall
                    evidence that it was Jaury who more probably than not provided the purchase
                    money for this property at the time of its acquisition, and that at the time the
                    resulting trust was created in favour of Jaury with the property registered in
                    Jimmy’s sole name. Jaury produced two HSBC cheques made payable to Messrs
                    Lee Bon Leong &amp; Co totalling $657,067.35 for the purchase of Mandarin
                        Gardens.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span> The HSBC account from which the
                    cheques were issued was in the name of one Jao Joe Hok, a name by which Jaury
                    was also known. Jaury also produced some documents issued by the Singapore and
                    Jakarta offices of HSBC documenting foreign currency deposits into the HSBC
                    account in Singapore <em>via</em> telegraphic transfers
                    from a separate HSBC account in Jakarta which was also in the name of Jao Joe
                    Hok. His evidence as to the source of funds for the purchase of Mandarin Gardens
                    was more consistent than that of Jimmy, and was also supported by some of the
                    documents disclosed. Compared to Jimmy’s evidence, Jaury had substantial
                    funds available to him in his HSBC account in Singapore to fully pay for the
                    purchase of Mandarin Gardens. In particular, there were deposits into the
                    Singapore HSBC account from as early as 30 December 1981. At that time,
                    US$100,000 was sent by telegraphic transfer from the Jakarta HSBC account to the
                    Singapore HSBC account.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span> Over the next two
                    years, a further US$450,000 was sent to the HSBC account in Singapore in the
                    same manner.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_5" id="Ftn_5_1"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span> An audit confirmation showed
                    that on 31 October 1983 there was $1,342,294.90 in Jaury’s HSBC
                    account in Singapore dollars.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_6" id="Ftn_6_1"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span> On 16 June 1986, five months before the
                    purchase of Mandarin Gardens, the available funds appeared to be
                        $3,607,347.20.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_7" id="Ftn_7_1"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span> At the end of
                    September 1987, a customer statement for the US Dollar account still showed a

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     I now come to Jimmy’s evidence. He
                    contended that he paid for the purchase, alleging that he had deposited his
                    funds from his overseas business in Jaury’s HSBC account in Jakarta, from
                    which they were transferred to the HSBC account in Singapore and subsequently
                    used to purchase Mandarin Gardens. Jimmy claimed that Jaury’s HSBC
                    accounts were merely used as a conduit for funds transfer, an arrangement which
                    was not unusual given the cordial relationship between the parties at the time.
                    I make two comments. First, Jimmy proffered no evidence to substantiate his
                    claim. If the documentation produced by Jaury was to be understood differently
                    from what appeared at face value, Jimmy had not adduced contextual evidence to
                    assist this Court. Second, Jimmy’s story that the funds came from his
                    overseas business was later changed to something else in cross-examination. In
                    fact, the versions he came up with were extraordinary. His case simply
                    deteriorated with each tale.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     The number of times Jimmy changed his evidence
                    happened when it came to explaining the source of funds, and each time, the
                    explanation was at odds with the earlier version. I begin with his first
                    affidavit dated 27 May 2011 where Jimmy stated:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_9" id="Ftn_9_1"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[Jaury] makes bare and unsubstantiated claims that all the monies in the
                        DBS Joint Account were monies provided from the sale proceeds of his
                        previous properties sold in Singapore. He did not identify which properties
                        the sale proceeds relate to and provided no documentation to substantiate
                        his claim. [Jaury’s] claim is not true as I was responsible for
                        furnishing most of the funds into the said DBS Joint Account to finance the
                        purchase of the property. <em>To the best of my recollection,
                            some of the funds came from overseas business and some came from sale
                            proceeds of properties that I owned</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     In his second affidavit dated 30 June
                    2011, Jimmy stated that the purchase of Ocean Park was funded from the sale
                    proceeds of Mandarin Gardens, which was in turn funded through his overseas
                        business.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_10" id="Ftn_10_1"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span> He
                    therefore asserted that Madam Giok and Jaury held Ocean Park on resulting trust
                    for him and he was the sole beneficial owner of the property.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_11" id="Ftn_11_1"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     At trial, when examined by his counsel,
                    Mr Tan Hee Joek (“Mr Tan”), Jimmy clarified that the
                    funds in Jaury’s HSBC account were his earnings from his family business,
                    a business which involved his siblings. During cross-examination, Jimmy said
                    that he had no personal bank accounts of his own at the relevant times, and that
                    his salary and profits were left in the company’s bank account which he
                    had access to as a signatory of the account. Whenever he needed funds, whether
                    for expenses, to go overseas, for the children’s education or to purchase
                    houses, money would be transferred to the HSBC account in Jaury’s name.
                    This was the arrangement back then as the family was united and the business was
                    a family business. It therefore did not matter where and in whose name the funds
                    were placed. Counsel for Jaury, Ms Wong Soo Chih
                    (“Ms Wong”), then asked if the other siblings had the same
                    arrangement as regards their salaries and profits, to which Jimmy replied in the
                    affirmative. He accepted Ms Wong’s reasoning that if this was true
                    the money in the HSBC account would belong to “everybody” and not
                    just Jimmy. Later on in cross-examination, Jimmy shifted his position to one
                    whereby Ocean Park was regarded as the family’s property.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     It is to be noted that none of Jimmy’s
                    evidence narrated thus far was part of his pleaded case. The assertion that the
                    property belonged to the family was inconsistent with his claim to sole
                    beneficial ownership of Ocean Park and, hence, his entitlement to the balance
                    sale proceeds in Court. It was obvious to me that his claim that the property
                    belonged to the family was made up in the witness box. Under pressure of
                    cross-examination, his evidence took on an iridescent quality which did nothing
                    for his pleaded case. He was uncooperative to his own detriment, such as when he
                    refused to explain the source of funds and became dismissive of
                    Ms Wong’s questions, preferring to adopt the attitude that as the
                    money was his, there was no need to explain where it came from.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     Jimmy was relying on Madam Giok to provide
                    corroborative evidence since she had disavowed any beneficial interest in Ocean
                    Park. I found her to be an unreliable witness. Her oral testimony under
                    cross-examination contradicted her earlier written statement that it was Jimmy
                    who had paid for Ocean Park. In addition, her other assertions were also at odds
                    with Jimmy’s evidence. Madam Giok herself had taken different stances at
                    various occasions. First, her initial instructions to UOB were for the balance
                    sale proceeds to be divided five-ways between the registered proprietors, Jimmy
                    and two other siblings. Next, in her affidavit supporting Jimmy’s joinder
                    as a party to the proceedings, she claimed that it was Jimmy who had provided
                    all of the purchase money. In cross-examination, Madam Giok took yet another
                    position. This time she said that the purchase money had been provided by Jimmy
                    and their brother Arifin and that they were the true beneficial owners of Ocean
                    Park. She was asked in cross-examination as to why she had taken inconsistent
                    positions, and her answer in reply was that it was because Jaury had insisted
                    that the entire property belonged to him. Eventually, she admitted to having no
                    personal knowledge of who provided the purchase price for Ocean
                Park.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     Mr Tan tried to salvage the disastrous
                    situation. In his closing submissions, he relied on other evidence which I have
                    set out below. I rejected their probative value. Evidentially, the other
                    evidence did not establish what was required of Jimmy, which had to be evidence
                    in the nature of direct financial contribution to the purchase price at the time
                    the property was purchased (see <a href="#p1_15">[15]</a>
                    and <a href="#p1_18">[18]</a> above). To repeat, for a resulting
                    trust to arise, proof of the payment of the purchase price is crucial. It was
                    clear to me that the other evidence relied upon either in isolation or
                    collectively would not and did not satisfy this evidential fact.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     First, it was Jimmy who viewed Mandarin
                    Gardens and handled all the paperwork relating to the purchase, including
                    liaising with the conveyancing solicitors for the purchase; that the HSBC
                    cheques referred to above were issued in response to a letter from Messrs Lee
                    Boon Leong &amp; Co addressed to Jimmy requesting payment for the purchase of
                    Mandarin Gardens at best is part of the background facts but falls short of
                    proof of payment of the purchase price.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     Second, Jimmy’s explanation that
                    one-half share of Mandarin Gardens was subsequently transferred to Jaury in
                    order to enjoy concessionary property tax rates. He had been advised by a friend
                    that lower rates would apply to foreigners if it could be shown that the
                    property was for the purpose of enabling the owner’s children to study in
                    Singapore. As stated, this evidence explaining the reason behind the transfer
                    had nothing to do with and could not constitute a direct contribution to the
                    purchase price (see <a href="#p1_15">[15]</a> and <a href="#p1_18">[18]</a> above). It may be that a constructive trust
                    rather than a resulting trust governs the ownership in this case but it is not
                    necessary for me to express a view on this issue for the reasons stated in
                        <a href="#p1_22">[22]</a> above.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     Third, Jimmy sought to establish that he had
                    control of the sale proceeds of Mandarin Gardens in the DBS account, and by
                    virtue of control, he owned the proceeds. He argued that he had sole custody of
                    the cheque book and was the person who issued the three cheques used for the 90%
                    payment to acquire Ocean Park. The cheques were drawn from a joint account and
                    his signature of itself was hardly evidence determinative of Jimmy’s
                    financial contribution to the purchase price of the property. Similarly, the
                    withdrawal of $169,200 from the joint account and the subsequent deposit of the
                    money into a bank account with BNP in his own name was not proof that the money
                    in the DBS account was his.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     Fourth, Jimmy asserted that, as with Mandarin
                    Gardens, he had also handled the purchase of Ocean Park. His called as his
                    witness, Sim Chai Huat, also known as Roland Sim (“Mr Sim”).
                    Mr Sim confirmed that Jimmy had told him that he was looking to purchase a
                    freehold property in the East Coast area. Mr Sim referred Ocean Park to
                    Jimmy and they viewed it together. Mr Sim paid 1% of the purchase price for
                    the option to purchase Ocean Park, and he was subsequently reimbursed for this
                    outlay. However, Mr Sim did not know whose money was used to reimburse
                    him.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     Finally, Jimmy gave reasons for placing Ocean
                    Park in the names of Madam Giok and Jaury. It had to do with assisting Madam
                    Giok’s application for permanent residency, as well as to reduce the
                    property tax rate as Jaury’s children were studying in Singapore. Neither
                    the reasons proffered nor the fact of registering ownership in the name of
                    another would of itself be good enough. What is crucial was evidence of
                    Jimmy’s financial contribution towards the purchase price at the time the
                    property was purchased and there was no such evidence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     I rejected attempts to undermine Jaury’s
                    credibility for mistakes made in his earlier testimonies in an attempt to
                    overcome the deficiencies in Jimmy’s evidence. I do not see that it is
                    necessary to narrate these mistakes. Suffice it to say that the legal burden was
                    on Jimmy and it could not be discharged by simply attacking the credibility of a
                    witness.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     To summarise, having heard the parties’
                    evidence as well as the criticism of Jaury’s credibility as a witness, I
                    concluded that it was Jaury and not Jimmy who had, on a balance of
                    probabilities, contributed the 90% payment to acquire Ocean Park.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">(2)   9% Payment towards acquisition of Ocean Park</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     It was undisputed that this 9% payment was
                    from a cheque drawn on the DBS account and en-cashed on 6 June 1990, prior
                    to the receipt of the Mandarin Gardens sale proceeds and the subsequent deposit
                    of the money into the DBS account.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_12" id="Ftn_12_1"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span> This 9% was the balance of the 10% due upon
                    exercise of the Option to purchase. According to Jimmy, the money came from his
                    company in Hong Kong called Cosmos Faith Pte Ltd (“Cosmos Faith”).
                    The latter company had used money withdrawn from its Bangkok Bank account to
                    purchase a banker’s order in the sum of $65,000 made payable to Jimmy and
                    Jaury. Jimmy was able to produce a copy of the banker’s order.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_13" id="Ftn_13_1"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span> In contrast, Jaury in his affidavit
                    asserted that he had deposited a cheque for $65,000 drawn on a Bangkok Bank
                    account belonging to him into the DBS account. However, in cross-examination
                    Jaury accepted that the Bangkok Bank account was in the name of Cosmos
                    Faith.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     In this state of the evidence, neither Jimmy
                    nor Jaury could show on a balance of probabilities the provenance of this
                    $65,000. Both were shareholders of Cosmos Faith, and even accepting for the sake
                    of argument that Jimmy had caused the company to purchase the banker’s
                    order, that fact in itself did not prove anything significant. In fact, the
                    testimonies generated more questions than answers. Was Jimmy as shareholder
                    entitled to and had the right to claim the money as dividends? If it was the
                    company’s money, was it a loan from the company? In the result, I found
                    that neither party had proven his contribution of this 9% payment towards the
                    acquisition of Ocean Park.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">(3)   1% Booking Fee for the Option to purchase Ocean
                Park</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     Initially, Jaury claimed that he had paid the
                    1% booking fee directly to the vendors of Ocean Park. However, he later conceded
                    that this was incorrect. It was Mr Sim who paid the booking fee and was
                    later reimbursed for it. In his affidavit, Mr Sim stated that he was
                    reimbursed by Jimmy. However, at trial he clarified that he was paid by a
                    Mr Foo. Mr Sim’s impression was that Jimmy and Mr Foo were
                    involved in a trading company. However, no further light was shed on this
                    company. It was also not clear whose company it was; whether it was this company
                    that had paid Mr Sim, or that Mr Foo had merely handed the money over
                    to Mr Sim on Jimmy’s behalf. I was unwilling to conclude on the basis
                    of such flimsy evidence that it was Jimmy who had provided the booking
                    fee.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The overall position on the contributions</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     In summary, Jaury had established that he had
                    contributed 90% of payments to acquire Ocean Park. Neither Jimmy nor Jaury could
                    establish that the remaining 10% of the payments towards the purchase of Ocean
                    Park was contributed by either of them.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     Jaury was the registered owner of half of the
                    property and Jimmy had not rebutted Jaury’s <em>prima
                        facie</em> beneficial interest in the same. However, separately and
                    independently, the overall picture is that Jaury had contributed 90% of the
                    payment towards the purchase of Ocean Park. In the context of a purchase money
                    resulting trust, Jaury’s beneficial interest would be in the proportion of
                    his direct financial contribution to the purchase price (see <a href="#p1_15">[15]</a> above and <em>Calverley</em> at pp 246, 253, 258 &amp; 266-267). In other
                    words, his beneficial interest in the property based on the proportion of his
                    financial contribution to the purchase price was 90%.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     In relation to the remaining 10% of the
                    payments, Ms Wong conceded that Jaury was unable to establish that the
                    money came from him. Since Jimmy’s situation was also the same, she
                    proposed an amicable resolution by sharing equally the remaining 10%. She
                    justified this solution by alluding to the fact that the 9% payment came from
                    Cosmos Faith, a company owned by both parties. Mr Tan supported
                    Ms Wong’s proposal. He reasoned that since the immediate source of
                    the 9% payment was from the DBS account which was jointly held by Jimmy and
                    Jaury, the share attributable to this sum should also be jointly
                held.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     The proposal, which was acceptable to both
                    parties, was practical. In effect, it served to treat by agreement the
                    parties’ contributions towards 10% of the purchase price as equal, and I
                    agreed to it.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Result</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     Accordingly, I found and declared that
                    Jaury’s beneficial interest in Ocean Park was 95% and with the remaining
                    5% to Jimmy. Therefore, the balance sale proceeds paid into Court were to be
                    paid out in the percentages declared, with any interest earned to be paid out in
