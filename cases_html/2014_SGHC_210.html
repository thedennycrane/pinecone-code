        Tan Siong Thye J:</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       The
appellant was Boxsentry Pte Ltd (“Boxsentry”), a Singapore-incorporated
company, while the respondent was Eleven Gesellschaft Zur Entwicklung
Und Vermarktung Von Netzwerktechonologien MBH (“Eleven”). They had
entered into a Partner Agreement (“the PA”) to integrate Eleven’s
“eXpurgate” spam filter and email categorisation service (collectively
referred to as the “eXpurgate service”) into Boxsentry’s “RealMail”
application. Under the PA, Boxsentry had guaranteed quarterly revenue
payments for the first three years to Eleven for the use of the eXpurgate
service.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       Boxsentry
made payment to Eleven for the first and second quarters of the
first year. However, it failed to make payment for the third and
fourth quarters of that year. Subsequently, Eleven sued Boxsentry
in Berlin, Germany, and obtained a default judgment (“the Berlin
default judgment”) against Boxsentry as it had failed to respond
to Eleven’s claim. Subsequent events led Eleven to take out a Writ
of Summons in Singapore so as to enforce the Berlin default judgment.
In the meantime, Boxsentry took out a summons to stay the enforcement
proceedings.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       At
the hearing below, the Assistant Registrar (“AR”) granted Eleven’s summary
judgment application which would allow the enforcement of the Berlin
default judgment in Singapore. The latter’s stay application was dismissed.
Boxsentry appealed against both the decisions.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       I
heard both Registrar’s Appeal No 292 of 2013 (“RA 292”) and Registrar’s
Appeal No 293 of 2013 (“RA 293”). In RA 292, Boxsentry appealed
against the dismissal of the stay application by the AR. In RA 293, it
appealed against the grant of summary judgment by the same AR. I dismissed
both the appeals.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> Boxsentry is
dissatisfied with my decisions and has appealed against them. I
now give my reasons for my decisions.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The facts</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       Boxsentry
and Eleven were involved in the supply of information technology
services. Central to this dispute was the PA entered into by them on
27 November 2007.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       Under
the terms of the PA, Boxsentry agreed to integrate Eleven’s eXpurgate
service into its “RealMail” application. The bundled application would
then be sold to certain specified territories where Boxsentry operated in.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span> Those
territories were the Asia Pacific region and the Middle East.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span> For

<p class="Judg-1">As can be seen, the total sum payable to Eleven for the first
year was €220,000.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_5" id="Ftn_5_1"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Boxsentry’s breach of the PA</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       Boxsentry
had paid Eleven for the first and second quarters of the first year
under the PA. Those payments were €15,000 and €25,000 respectively.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_6" id="Ftn_6_1"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span> However, Boxsentry failed to make
payment for the third and fourth quarters. The facts below illustrate
the sequence of events that took place between Boxsentry and Eleven
after the first and second quarter payments.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       On
6 August 2008, Eleven sent an invoice for the third quarter payment
to Boxsentry. The latter did not reply.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_7" id="Ftn_7_1"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span> Eleven subsequently
sent an email to Boxsentry on 29 October 2008 to remind Boxsentry
of its obligations to make payment for the third quarter within
the next 14 days.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_8" id="Ftn_8_1"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span> Boxsentry eventually
replied Eleven, stating that the eXpurgate service had not performed
up to expectations. Boxsentry also alleged that this problem had
been raised to Eleven on several occasions but to no avail. This
had caused damage to Boxsentry’s reputation.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_9" id="Ftn_9_1"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span> For that reason, Boxsentry rescinded
the PA on the ground of misrepresentation.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_10" id="Ftn_10_1"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     On
20 November 2008, Eleven sent an email to Boxsentry, stating that there
was no legal basis for a premature termination of the PA or a cessation of
the business relationship between them.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_11" id="Ftn_11_1"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span> Eleven also
demanded Boxsentry to make the payments for the third and fourth
quarters. Boxsentry replied in its email dated 15 December 2008
that it would not make any further payment.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_12" id="Ftn_12_1"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     Under
the PA, German law governed the PA and the parties had agreed to
submit to the Berlin court’s exclusive jurisdiction.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_13" id="Ftn_13_1"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span> On
that basis, Eleven commenced legal action again Boxsentry in Berlin
on 19 February 2009. Subsequently, German court documents were served
on Boxsentry in Singapore informing it that legal proceedings had
been commenced by Eleven against it.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     Boxsentry
ignored the Berlin legal proceedings. Accordingly, Berlin Regional
Court issued the default judgment against Boxsentry. That judgment
was served on Boxsentry but it continued to ignore the Berlin legal
proceedings. When Eleven issued a letter of demand to enforce the default
judgment in Singapore, Boxsentry again failed to respond.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The present proceedings</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     Exasperated,
Eleven commenced the present proceedings in Singapore to enforce
the Berlin default judgment under the common law. The Writ of Summons,
together with the endorsed Statement of Claim, was served on Boxsentry,
which finally entered its appearance on 24 August 2012. It filed
its defence and counterclaim against Eleven on 12 September 2012.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_14" id="Ftn_14_1"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span> On 27 September 2012,
Eleven filed an application for a stay of proceedings in relation
to Boxsentry’s counterclaim. The parties agreed to this application.
Accordingly, the court granted the stay in relation to Boxsentry’s
counterclaim by consent on 22 October 2012.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_15" id="Ftn_15_1"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     On
23 November 2012, Eleven applied for summary judgment under O 14
r 1 of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2006 Rev Ed) (“ROC”) in Summons
No 6024 of 2012 (“SUM 6024”) against Boxsentry. This was to enforce
the Berlin default judgment.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_16" id="Ftn_16_1"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span> Boxsentry
retaliated by commencing Civil Action Case No 98 O9/13 in Berlin
to set aside the Berlin default judgment and to restrain Eleven
from enforcing the Berlin default judgment (“the Berlin restrain
action”).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_17" id="Ftn_17_1"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a></span> It also filed
an application to stay the present action in Summons No 3974 of
2013 (“SUM 3974”) pending the outcome of the Berlin proceedings.
The AR granted Eleven its application for summary judgment and dismissed
Boxsentry’s application for a stay of proceedings. Boxsentry appealed
against both his orders.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_18" id="Ftn_18_1"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Boxsentry’s restrain action
in Berlin to prevent Eleven from enforcing the Berlin’s default
judgment in Singapore</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     Subsequently,
the Berlin restrain action was heard in the Berlin High Court on
1 April 2014. The Berlin High Court ruled against Boxsentry on 13
May 2014.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_19" id="Ftn_19_1"><sup>[note: 19]</sup></a></span> Boxsentry
filed an appeal on 13 June 2014 (“the Berlin appeal”). In its appeal,
Boxsentry sought to set aside the Berlin judgment as well as another
default judgment (see [28(i)] and [43]) issued against it and also
to transfer the case to be heard before the Senate. If it again
failed in its action, Boxsentry then would ask for its case to be
transferred to the Federal Supreme Court of Germany.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_20" id="Ftn_20_1"><sup>[note: 20]</sup></a></span> Boxsentry
informed me that the appeal would be heard in Berlin at the end
of October 2014 or in early November 2014.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_21" id="Ftn_21_1"><sup>[note: 21]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The issues before me</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     The
issues on appeal were thus twofold:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_16-p2_a"></a>(a)     whether
the present action should be stayed in the light of the concurrent
Berlin proceedings; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_16-p2_b"></a>(b)     whether
I should grant summary judgment on the strength of the Berlin default
judgment.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The application to stay enforcement
of the Berlin default judgment</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The AR’s reasons for dismissing
the stay application</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     At
the hearing below, the AR dismissed Boxsentry’s stay application. He
held that while international comity was an important consideration,
he had to consider two issues. First, whether Boxsentry’s application
to restrain Eleven from enforcing the Berlin default judgment in
Singapore was <em>bona fide</em> and second,
whether Eleven would be put through further delay and expense in
recovering what it was rightfully entitled to. The AR was of the
view that Boxsentry’s actions appeared to be calculated to delay the
current proceedings. Thus he did not grant a stay.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_22" id="Ftn_22_1"><sup>[note: 22]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Boxsentry’s submissions</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     Boxsentry’s
appeal was founded on two grounds. The first was based on s 18 of
the Supreme Court of Judicature Act (Cap 322, 2007 Rev Ed) (“SCJA”)
read with para 9 of the First Schedule. The second was premised on
the inherent jurisdiction of the court under O 92 r 4 of the ROC.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_23" id="Ftn_23_1"><sup>[note: 23]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Boxsentry’s case premised on
the Supreme Court of Judicature Act</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     On
its first submission, Boxsentry’s case was that a stay of the present proceedings
should be granted as:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_24" id="Ftn_24_1"><sup>[note: 24]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_19-p2_a"></a>(a)     there
would be a multiplicity of proceedings if the present proceedings
were not stayed;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_19-p2_b"></a>(b)     there
would be a risk of conflicting judgments if the present proceedings
were not stayed as the Berlin appeal and the present proceedings
involved the interpretation and enforceability of the Berlin default
judgment;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_19-p2_c"></a>(c)     justice
and fairness required that Eleven’s cases be heard by the same forum;
and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_19-p2_d"></a>(d)     Eleven
had not adduced any evidence to show that it would suffer substantial
justice if the action was stayed pending the outcome of the Berlin
appeal.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_25" id="Ftn_25_1"><sup>[note: 25]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     Boxsentry
submitted that a limited stay had been granted before, for example,
in <em>Chan Chin Cheung v Chan Fatt Cheung and
others</em> [2010] 1 SLR 1192 (“<em>Chan
Chin Cheung</em>”). In <em>Chan Chin Cheung</em>,
the Court of Appeal had granted a limited stay pending the outcome
of the Malaysian proceedings as it would (at [46]):</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_20-p2_a"></a>(a)     minimise
the risk of conflicting judgments;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_20-p2_b"></a>(b)     enable
the Singapore courts to have the benefit of the findings of the
Malaysian courts;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_20-p2_c"></a>(c)     promote
international comity; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_20-p2_d"></a>(d)     prevent
legal resources from being wasted.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Therefore on the strength of <em>Chan Chin
Cheung</em>, Boxsentry submitted that a limited stay should
be granted.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     Boxsentry
also submitted that neither the place where the legal action was
first commenced nor the stage of any foreign proceedings was of
any relevance to the stay application.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     First,
in <em>UBS AG v Telesto Investments Ltd and others
and another matter</em> [2011] 4 SLR 503 at [133], the High
Court held that the order in which the claims were brought in the
competing jurisdictions was not to be given significant weight.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_26" id="Ftn_26_1"><sup>[note: 26]</sup></a></span> It also did
not matter whether the action was started locally first or in a
foreign country: <em>Rickshaw Investments Ltd v Nicolai
Baron von Uexkull</em> [2007] 1 SLR(R) 377 at [88].<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_27" id="Ftn_27_1"><sup>[note: 27]</sup></a></span> Therefore,
the fact that it had commenced the Berlin restrain action <em>only</em> after the present action was commenced
was not important. The policy reason behind this was clear: a party
should not be stopped from pursuing its claim in the appropriate
forum just because an action had been commenced in another forum.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_28" id="Ftn_28_1"><sup>[note: 28]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     Second,
whether the foreign proceedings were at a beginning or advanced
stage was an irrelevant consideration. This was apparent from Belinda
Ang Saw Ean J’s judgment in <em>The Reecon Wolf</em> [2012]
2 SLR 289, in which a stay of proceedings in Singapore had been
granted even though the Malaysian proceedings which were concurrent
were not very advanced: at [47].</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Boxsentry’s case premised on
the court’s inherent jurisdiction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     Alternatively,
Boxsentry submitted that this court should grant it a stay based
on its inherent jurisdiction to grant a temporary stay under O 92 r
4 of the ROC.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     Boxsentry
submitted that in <em>Shanghai Construction (Group)
General Co. Singapore Branch v Tan Poo Seng</em> [2012] SGHCR
10 (“<em>Shanghai Construction</em>”), the
High Court held that a stay would be ordered where there were “strong
reasons” for doing so and where the benefits clearly outweighed
any disadvantage to the plaintiff. An abuse of the court’s process
and the promotion of efficient dispute resolution were two situations
which justified such a stay.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_29" id="Ftn_29_1"><sup>[note: 29]</sup></a></span> Boxsentry’s
counsel added that <em>Shanghai Construction</em> was
based on <em>Reichhold Norway ASA and another v Goldman

which had granted a stay on the basis of pending arbitration so
that disputes could be efficiently resolved: see <em>Shanghai
Construction</em> at [18]–[19]. He pointed out that <em>Reichhold</em> had since been accepted in other

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     Since
the outcome of the Berlin appeal would have an impact on the present
proceedings, Boxsentry sought for a stay. Furthermore, there would be
no prejudice to Eleven as the Berlin appeal would decide the very
same claim and action it commenced in 2009.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_31" id="Ftn_31_1"><sup>[note: 31]</sup></a></span> Boxsentry was
also of the view that Eleven had been dilatory for delaying nearly
three years before it decided to enforce the Berlin default judgment
in Singapore.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_32" id="Ftn_32_1"><sup>[note: 32]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Eleven’s submissions</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     Eleven’s
response was that Boxsentry’s application for a limited stay came
almost a year after the present action was commenced by Eleven and two
days before the hearing of SUM 6024 (application for summary judgment).
This showed that Boxsentry had not been serious about its stay application
and that Boxsentry had made the stay application in bad faith.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_33" id="Ftn_33_1"><sup>[note: 33]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     Eleven
submitted that the grant of a limited stay was a matter fully within
the court’s discretion. First, the court should be slow to interfere with
the AR’s exercise of that discretion.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_34" id="Ftn_34_1"><sup>[note: 34]</sup></a></span> Second,
a stay should not be granted for the following reasons:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_35" id="Ftn_35_1"><sup>[note: 35]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_28-p2_a"></a>(a)     Whether
a foreign judgment should be enforced in Singapore was a matter
for the Singapore courts to decide (<em>Owens Bank
Ltd v Bracco and another</em> [1992] 2 AC 443).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_28-p2_b"></a>(b)     The
present action was at a more advanced stage than the Berlin proceedings.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_28-p2_c"></a>(c)     The
present action was commenced five months before Boxsentry’s Berlin
restrain action was commenced and there was no reason why Boxsentry
could not have commenced the Berlin restrain action earlier.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_28-p2_d"></a>(d)     Dr
Klaus Peter Rentsch (“Dr Klaus”), Eleven’s legal expert on German
law, had opined that first instance proceedings with respect to
Boxsentry’s Berlin restrain action would typically take between
one year and 18 months while an appeal would take about another
year to conclude. This would cause Eleven considerable delay to
realise their judgment sum and could result in Boxsentry dissipating
its assets.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_28-p2_e"></a>(e)     There
would be no prejudice to Boxsentry as it could claim damages caused
by the wrongful execution of the Berlin default judgment if it succeeded
in the Berlin restrain action.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_28-p2_f"></a>(f)     Dr
Klaus’s evidence was that Boxsentry’s action in Berlin was unlikely
to succeed since it had known of its basis for alleging fraud against
Eleven but chose to do nothing for a long time. Furthermore, Dr
Christian Czychowski’s (“Dr Czychowski”) (Boxsentry’s legal expert
on German law) opinion was erroneous.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_28-p2_g"></a>(g)     The
merits of the alleged fraud should not be considered by the Singapore
courts since the material was already in existence and known to
Boxsentry prior to the commencement of the Berlin legal proceedings.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_28-p2_h"></a>(h)     Boxsentry
might become insolvent and that would prejudice Eleven’s legal rights
if a stay was granted.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_28-p2_i"></a>(i)     It
would be unfair and unjust if a stay was granted as Boxsentry had
chosen to do nothing for four years. Boxsentry had every opportunity
to defend itself in Berlin or challenge the Berlin default judgment.
It did not, and also ignored the second set of Berlin legal proceedings
for further guaranteed revenue payments. This showed that it was
not genuine about defending the claims made by Eleven.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_28-p2_j"></a>(j)     The
restraining proceedings brought in Berlin to stop the enforcement
of the Berlin default judgment was brought in bad faith. It was
brought solely to delay enforcement proceedings in Singapore from
taking place.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">My decision on the stay application</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     Both
sides agreed that the court has jurisdiction and power to grant
a stay of proceedings. This discretion had to be exercised judiciously
and it was the exercise of this discretion that the parties disagreed
upon.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The factors that the court should
consider for a stay application</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     Paragraph
9 of the First Schedule to the SCJA is instructive on the factors
that the court should consider in its exercise of its power to stay
a proceeding:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-Heading1">
<b>Stay of proceedings</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>9</b>.    Power
to dismiss or stay proceedings where the matter in question is res
judicata between the parties, or where by reason of multiplicity
of proceedings in any court or courts or by reason of a court in
Singapore not being the appropriate forum the proceedings ought
not to be continued.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     In <em>Sterling Pharmaceuticals Pty Ltd v Boots &amp; Co
(Aust) Pty Ltd</em> (1992) 34 FCR 287 (“<em>Sterling
Pharmaceuticals</em>”) at [15], Lockhart J listed several factors
that the court should consider in an application for a stay:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_31-p2_a"></a>(a)     which
proceeding was commenced first;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_31-p2_b"></a>(b)     whether
the termination of one proceeding is likely to have an impact on
the other;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_31-p2_c"></a>(c)     the
public interest;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_31-p2_d"></a>(d)     the
undesirability of two courts competing to see which of them determines
common facts first;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_31-p2_e"></a>(e)     consideration
of witness circumstances;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_31-p2_f"></a>(f)     whether
work done on pleadings, particulars, discovery, interrogatories
and preparation might be wasted;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_31-p2_g"></a>(g)     the
undesirability of a substantial waste of time and effort if it became
a common practice to bring actions in two courts involving substantially
the same issues;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_31-p2_h"></a>(h)     how
far advanced the proceedings are in each court;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_31-p2_i"></a>(i)     the
interest of the law in striving against allowing multiplicity of proceedings
in relation to similar issues; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_31-p2_j"></a>(j)     generally
balancing the advantages and disadvantages to each party.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     The
factors listed in <em>Sterling Pharmaceuticals</em> are
useful guides that can be applied for any case where there is an
application for a stay of proceedings. In <em>Bella
Products Pty Ltd v Creative Designs International Ltd</em> [2009]
FCA 868 at [23], the Federal Court of Australia endorsed the factors listed
by <em>Sterling Pharmaceuticals</em>. It
held that it was undesirable that there were two courts determining
the same dispute (see also <em>Chan Chin Cheung</em> at
[46]) and practical considerations based on common sense and fairness should
dictate which action should proceed first. The implication was that simultaneous
proceedings in two jurisdictions did not necessarily mean that a
stay would be granted as of right. The decision for a stay application must
fundamentally depend on whether it is fair to the parties. Thus
the parties’ conduct was important.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The conduct of Boxsentry and
Eleven</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     I
agreed with Eleven that to grant the stay would be to condone Boxsentry’s
intention to prolong and drag the proceedings. Boxsentry’s sole intention
was to deny Eleven of the payments sought by abusing the court’s procedural
rules. The stay was sought by Boxsentry in order to defer its payment
obligation to Eleven for as long as it could. Such conduct was unacceptable.
I shall now trace the chronology of events to support my finding.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(I)   Boxsentry failed
to make the third quarter payment</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     The
parties entered into the PA on 27 November 2007. The first and second
quarter payments for the first year were duly paid for. It was only when
Eleven chased Boxsentry for the third quarter payment of €70,000 that
the latter refused to make any payment. This sum was larger than
the combined total of the two previous payments.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     Eleven
first sent Boxsentry the invoice for €70,000 on 6 August 2008. Boxsentry
did not respond. Subsequently, after more than two months, Eleven
sent to Boxsentry on 29 October 2008 a reminder that the third quarter
payment was due. On 30 October 2008, Boxsentry refused to make payment
and alleged that the eXpurgate service did not serve its purpose.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     When
it became evident that Boxsentry was not going to pay for the third
and fourth quarter under the PA, Eleven commenced legal action on 19
February 2009 in Berlin as stipulated under the PA. This was about
three months after Boxsentry first indicated that it would not make
the third quarter payment on 30 October 2008.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(II)   The Berlin proceedings</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     Eleven
commenced the Berlin legal proceedings against Boxsentry on 19 February
2009.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_36" id="Ftn_36_1"><sup>[note: 36]</sup></a></span> It claimed the
following sums:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_37" id="Ftn_37_1"><sup>[note: 37]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_37-p2_a"></a>(a)     €180,000,
the sum being the outstanding due from Boxsentry to Eleven under
the PA as guaranteed revenue payments for the first year;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_37-p2_b"></a>(b)     interest
at a rate of 8 percentage points above the base rate from 15 December
2008; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_37-p2_c"></a>(c)     costs
of the Berlin action.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The subsequent facts will reveal how Boxsentry had abused
the procedural rules of the Berlin and Singapore courts to its own
advantage. As a result Boxsentry had in <em>substance</em> obtained
a stay from the numerous adjournments and delays which were previously
granted to it.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-5" style="font-variant: small-caps;">(A)   The Berlin’s court
documents were served on Boxsentry in Singapore</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     Boxsentry’s
registered business address was in Singapore. The Berlin Regional
Court had sent a letter dated 19 May 2009 to the Registrar of the Singapore
Supreme Court (“the Registrar”). It requested that the Berlin Statement
of Claim (“the Berlin SOC”) and a judicial order dated 19 March 2009
issued by the Berlin Regional Court in the Berlin legal proceedings (“the
Berlin Judicial Order”) be served on Boxsentry in accordance with local
procedures.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_38" id="Ftn_38_1"><sup>[note: 38]</sup></a></span> Pursuant
to this request, the Berlin SOC and the Berlin Judicial Order were
personally served on Boxsentry at its registered office on 29 July
2009 via a process server of the Singapore Supreme Court.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_39" id="Ftn_39_1"><sup>[note: 39]</sup></a></span> The effected service was then
communicated to the Berlin Regional Court via the Embassy of the
Federal Republic of Germany in Singapore. A Ministry of Foreign
Affairs letter also confirmed that the said documents had been served
on Boxsentry.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_40" id="Ftn_40_1"><sup>[note: 40]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     A
perusal of the Berlin Judicial Order showed that if Boxsentry did not
respond, the Berlin court was at liberty to enter a default judgment against
it. The Berlin Judicial Order read as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In the event that you fail to have the
lawyer to be appointed to indicate within the set deadline of four
weeks your intention of defence against the Claim, <em>the court
may – upon request by the Claimant – issue a judgment by default, without
an oral hearing</em>. In such event, you will have to bear
the court fees and all costs necessarily incurred by the adverse
party (Sec 91 ZPO). Based on this judgment of default, the Claimant
is entitled to institute a compulsory execution into your assets,
without having to provide a security (Sec. 708 No. 2 ZPO).</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<em>The court requested
that you reply to the Statement of Claim in writing. This Statement
of Reply must be received by the court on the last day of the set deadline,
at the latest, and contain any and all means of defence. In case
you miss the deadline for the reply and fail to state an important
reason for such failure, you are normally barred from fending off
the claim, and risk losing this case just because of having missed
this deadline.</em>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-5" style="font-variant: small-caps;">(B)   The Berlin default
judgement was issued against Boxsentry</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     Despite
receiving the Berlin Judicial Order, Boxsentry failed to enter a defence
in Berlin. Since it did not do so, the Berlin default judgment was entered
into on 27 October 2009. It ordered the following:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_40-p2_a"></a>(a)     Boxsentry
was to pay Eleven €180,000 plus interest at a rate of 8 percentage
points above the base rate as of 15 February 2008, which amounted
to €59,229 as at 18 November 2012 and which would continue to accumulate
until the date of full payment.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_41" id="Ftn_41_1"><sup>[note: 41]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_40-p2_b"></a>(b)     Boxsentry
was to pay €8,561.34 as the costs of the Berlin legal proceedings
plus interest at the rate of 5 percentage points above the applicable
base rate as of 30 April 2010, which amounted to €770.79 as at 18
November 2012 and which would continue to accumulate until the date
of full payment.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_42" id="Ftn_42_1"><sup>[note: 42]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_40-p2_c"></a>(c)     The
Berlin default judgment was to be provisionally enforceable.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">From the foregoing, the total claim against Boxsentry was
€248,561.13 as at 18 November 2012. Boxsentry could object to the
Berlin default judgment within four weeks from the date of service
of the Berlin default judgment..</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-5" style="font-variant: small-caps;">(C)   The Berlin’s default
judgment was served on Boxsentry in Singapore</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     After
the Berlin default judgment was issued, the Berlin Regional Court
sent a letter to request the Registrar of the Supreme Court of Singapore
to serve Boxsentry the following documents: <span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_43" id="Ftn_43_1"><sup>[note: 43]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_41-p2_a"></a>(a)     the
Berlin default judgment; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_41-p2_b"></a>(b)     the
Notes of Objection to allow Boxsentry to lodge its objection against
the judgment in the “form prescribed by [Singapore] laws”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The Registrar was also requested to send the Certificate of
Service to the Berlin Regional Court.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_44" id="Ftn_44_1"><sup>[note: 44]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     The
Berlin default judgment together with the Notes of Objection were
served personally on Boxsentry on 9 February 2010 and the Berlin Regional
Court was informed of this through a letter dated 5 March 2010.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_45" id="Ftn_45_1"><sup>[note: 45]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     As
an aside, I noted that there was another set of Berlin proceedings commenced
on 1 December 2011 and a second Berlin default judgment was obtained
on 8 October 2012.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_46" id="Ftn_46_1"><sup>[note: 46]</sup></a></span> However,
those proceedings were irrelevant to the present action.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-5" style="font-variant: small-caps;">(D)   Boxsentry failed
to file an objection to the Berlin default judgment</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     The
Notes of Objection that were sent to Boxsentry stated that Boxsentry
could file an objection to the Berlin default judgment within four weeks
from the date of service of the Berlin default judgment. The objection should
have contained its arguments and defences. The Notes further mentioned
that if the objection was filed outside the stated timeline, it would
be inadmissible and be dismissed. Boxsentry, however, had the right to
apply for an extension of time to file its arguments and defences
if certain conditions were met. The court would allow for the extension
provided that the action would not be delayed or the delay was reasonable.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_47" id="Ftn_47_1"><sup>[note: 47]</sup></a></span> Boxsentry did not file
any objection to the Berlin default judgment.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_48" id="Ftn_48_1"><sup>[note: 48]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(III)   Boxsentry repeatedly
ignored Eleven’s requests for payment</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     Boxsentry
continued to ignore the Berlin legal proceedings and the Berlin
default judgment despite being informed. Consequently, Eleven engaged
Singapore lawyers to issue a letter of demand dated 24 June 2010
to Boxsentry’s registered office. Boxsentry was requested to make
payment of the sums due under the Berlin default judgment within
seven days from the date of the letter.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_49" id="Ftn_49_1"><sup>[note: 49]</sup></a></span> The letter of
demand had a translated copy of the Berlin default judgment. Boxsentry
failed to respond to the letter of demand. When Eleven’s Singapore
solicitors sent a second letter of demand dated 20 July 2010 to
Boxsentry’s registered office, this was again to no avail.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(IV)   Boxsentry sought
repeated adjournments in the Singapore proceedings</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     When
Eleven commenced legal proceedings in Singapore, Boxsentry sought
to delay the matter. It applied for numerous adjournments for various
reasons, including (a) that the court should wait for developments in
the Berlin courts; and (b) that they were exploring the possibility
of a settlement. The appeal against the AR’s decisions was first
fixed for hearing on 17 October 2013. Parties sought an adjournment
to settle the matter. This was granted. Thereafter, several adjournments
were granted for parties to attempt to settle the matter.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     Eventually,
the case came before me again on 22 April 2014. Boxsentry sought
an adjournment to await the outcome of its action to set aside the
Berlin default judgment. Eleven objected to the adjournment but since
the Berlin court would release its decision on 13 May 2014, I allowed the
matter to be adjourned. As matters transpired, Boxsentry lost its
case in Berlin.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     After
Boxsentry had lost its case in Berlin, I heard the matter fully
on 22 August 2014. I was not prepared to adjourn this case further
pending the outcome of the Boxsentry’s appeal to the Supreme Court
of Berlin. Therefore, Boxsentry had <em>in substance</em> obtained
a partial stay of about ten months. I was of the firm view that
the matter should not be delayed any further.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">My observations regarding Boxsentry’s
conduct</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     Boxsentry
had thus calculated its strategy to delay the enforcement of the
third and fourth quarter payments. Additionally, I also find that
it had been nonchalant, that it had brought the stay application
in bad faith and its allegation against Eleven was a sham.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(I)   Boxsentry was nonchalant</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     Boxsentry’s
attitude towards Eleven’s efforts to seek redress through legal
proceedings in Singapore and Germany was nonchalant. The narration
of the events above clearly revealed that Boxsentry had been properly
served with the Berlin SOC, which contained a notice for it to attend
the Berlin proceedings. It chose not to do so and failed to enter
an appearance in Berlin. When Boxsentry was notified of the Berlin
default judgment, again it chose not to exercise its right to object
despite being informed about its right to do so. Every due process
to defend itself was accorded to Boxsentry.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     When
the two letters of demand were subsequently sent out by Eleven’s
solicitors, Boxsentry chose not to reply. It was only when Eleven took
out legal proceedings to enforce the Berlin default judgment in Singapore
that Boxsentry suddenly sprang into action. It contested the present
proceedings. Boxsentry filed an appeal in Berlin to restrain the enforcement
of both the Berlin default judgments in Singapore and to set aside
both the Berlin default judgments. The last minute actions of Boxsentry
indicated its tactics to effect a delay when it was faced with a
real threat that it would be compelled to pay Eleven the sums sought.
Such conduct was extremely unbecoming.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(II)   Boxsentry’s stay
application was brought in bad faith</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     Next,
I found that Boxsentry had brought the stay application in bad faith.
The cases cited by Boxsentry to support its stay application were
not of much assistance. The party who sought a stay in those cases
could hardly be described as dilatory. In the present case, the
resistance started from the time when Eleven sought payment from
Boxsentry for the third quarter payment on 6 August 2008 and Boxsentry
ignored that invoice. Since then, it had been refusing and challenging
payments due to Eleven for the last six years.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     Boxsentry’s
conduct clearly revealed an intention to deprive Eleven of its legal
rights. Its actions were calculated to deny Eleven of its third
and fourth quarter payments under the PA. Therefore, its application
was brought in bad faith.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(III)   Boxsentry’s complaint
that the eXpurgate service was unusable lacked bona fides</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     Boxsentry
also alleged that it had previously raised to Eleven the matter
regarding the unsuitability of the eXpurgate service. Thereafter, Boxsentry
terminated the PA. On 20 November 2008 Eleven informed Boxsentry
via email that it had no legal basis to rescind the PA. Was Boxsentry’s
allegation that the eXpurgate service was unfit for its purpose
a genuine and legitimate basis to refuse payment and rescind the
PA?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     Prior
to the signing of the PA on 27 November 2007 Boxsentry tested the
eXpurgate service for free under License No 150727 granted by Eleven. A
copy of the graph showing the number of emails scanned and classified (as
spam or legitimate email) by eXpurgate service showed that Boxsentry started
using the eXpurgate service since 16 April 2007. This was approximately
seven months before the signing of the PA. During this period, Boxsentry
had the opportunity to test eXpurgate service without charge. Boxsentry
must have been satisfied with eXpurgate service otherwise it would
not have signed the PA on 27 November 2007. Moreover, Boxsentry
made the first and second quarter payment to Eleven without any
reservations. Suddenly, when Eleven chased Boxsentry for the third
quarter payment of €70,000 the latter refused to pay, alleged that eXpurgate
service could not be used for the first time and rescinded the PA on
the ground of Eleven’s misrepresentation.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     Moreover,
Boxsentry later made the first and second quarter payment to Eleven
without any reservations. It was only when Eleven chased Boxsentry
for the third quarter payment of €70,000 that the latter refused
to pay, alleged that eXpurgate service could not be used for the
first time and rescinded the PA on the ground of Eleven’s misrepresentation.
On the above facts, the allegation made by Boxsentry appeared to
be a sham.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Boxsentry’s interests vs Eleven’s
interests</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     I
was aware of the undesirability of multiple proceedings in multiple jurisdictions
and the undesirability of each court competing to be the first to
find on common facts. However, balancing the interests of Eleven
and Boxsentry, the former would be greatly prejudiced by any continued
delay of the Singapore proceedings which were caused by Boxsentry’s
calculated attempts to effect delays. Boxsentry had been given numerous opportunities
to defend its rights in Germany. It consciously chose to ignore
them. When the legal action came to its door step in Singapore,
it decided to frustrate Eleven through its actions in Berlin. Under
such circumstances, it was clear to me that Eleven’s interests had
to be preferred and I could not grant a stay application.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a>58     Subsequent
to the events above, I noted that the Berlin court had heard Boxsentry’s
application to restrain the Singapore proceedings and had dismissed
its application on 13 May 2014. Boxsentry had filed an appeal on
13 June 2014 with the Supreme Court of Berlin against the dismissal.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a>59     Thus
far, the Boxsentry’s legal action to stop Eleven’s enforcement of the
judgment debt has been unsuccessful. The outcome of Boxsentry’s appeal
in Berlin is still pending, but having regard to the prejudice already suffered
by Eleven, I took the view that the latest developments in the Berlin proceedings
could not justify the grant of a stay.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Inherent jurisdiction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a>60     Boxsentry’s
second submission was based on the exercise of my inherent jurisdiction
to grant a stay. It was made pursuant to O 92 r 4 of the ROC, which
reads:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-Heading1">
<b>Inherent powers
of Court (O. 92, r. 4)</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(1)    For the avoidance of doubt it is hereby
declared that nothing in these Rules shall be deemed to limit or
affect the inherent powers of the Court to make any order as may
be necessary to prevent injustice or to prevent an abuse of the
process of the Court.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a>61     I
was again of the view that it would be unfair to grant the stay
under the court’s inherent jurisdiction. As observed by Asst Prof
Goh Yihan in his article “The Inherent Jurisdiction and Inherent
Powers of the Singapore Courts: Rethinking the Limits of their Exercise”
[2011] SJLS 178 at p 207, the inherent jurisdiction of the court
is meant to ensure that the court has the proper authority to deal
effectively with an abuse of its process or the compromise of justice
through written law. This is also the position in <em>Heng </em><em>Joo See v Ho Pol Ling</em> [1993] 2 SLR(R)
763 where Punch Coomaraswamy J held at [24]–[25] that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">24    Master
Jacob describes the inherent [power] “as being the reserve or fund
of powers, a residual source of powers, which the court may draw
upon as necessary whenever it is just or equitable to do so, and
in particular to ensure the observance of the due process of law,
to prevent improper vexation or oppression, to do justice between
the parties and to secure a fair trial between them”.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">25    He classifies cases in which this inherent
power may be used by the summary powers of the court as falling
into these four categories:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(a)    proceedings
which involve a deception on the court, or are fictitious or constitute
a mere sham;</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(b)    
                <em>proceedings where
the process of the court is not being fairly or honestly used but
is employed for some ulterior or improper purpose or in an improper
way</em>;</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(c)    proceedings which are manifestly groundless
or without foundation or which serve no useful purpose;</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(d)    
                <em>multiple or successive
proceedings which cause or are likely to cause improper vexation
or oppression</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_62"></a>62     In
my view, this case fell within the second and fourth categories listed
by Coomaraswamy J. Exercising my inherent jurisdiction in favour
of Boxsentry would have meant that I condoned Boxsentry’s lackadaisical conduct.
As mentioned at [57] of this judgment, it would further prejudice Eleven,
which had conscientiously complied with the laws of Singapore and Germany
in claiming against Boxsentry.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Eleven was not dilatory in its
pursue of its claim</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_63"></a>63     Boxsentry
alleged that Eleven was dilatory in its conduct when it was pursuing
its claim. This was totally baseless as Eleven had been pursuing
its claim conscientiously through lawful means. It was Boxsentry
that had placed obstacles in Eleven’s way and made it difficult
for Eleven to seek legal redress. In fact, it was my view that through
its actions, Boxsentry had <em>in effect</em> obtained
a partial stay against Eleven (see [48] above). When I balanced
the rights and interests of Boxsentry and Eleven, my finding was that
on the basis of fairness and justice, this appeal against the stay
of the proceedings had to be dismissed.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The summary judgment application</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_64"></a>64     This
part of my judgment will deal with the remaining appeal against the
AR who had granted a summary judgment to Eleven to enforce its Berlin
default judgment. I had also dismissed Boxsentry’s appeal for the reasons
that follow.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The AR’s reasons for granting
summary judgment to Eleven</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_65"></a>65     The
AR below agreed to grant Eleven summary judgment on the strength
of the Berlin default judgment. He accepted the evidence provided by
Dr Klaus that there was proper service of the Berlin SOC, the Berlin Judicial
Order, and the Berlin default judgment under German law. The AR was
also of the view that the Berlin default judgment was final and conclusive
between the parties.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_50" id="Ftn_50_1"><sup>[note: 50]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_66"></a>66     At
the hearing below, Boxsentry had raised the fraud exception and sought
to deny the enforcement of the Berlin default judgment. It alleged that
the Berlin default judgment was obtained fraudulently as the eXpurgate service
was defective and that fact had not been raised to the Berlin court. This
was denied by Eleven.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_67"></a>67     The
AR held that the allegation was contained in emails which were in Boxsentry’s
possession when the Berlin legal proceedings were commenced. Boxsentry
could have produced them if it had chosen to respond to the Berlin
legal proceedings. Therefore the emails did not constitute fresh evidence
and the fraud exception could not stand.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_51" id="Ftn_51_1"><sup>[note: 51]</sup></a></span> Since Boxsentry
did not raise the public policy exception and had also abandoned
its argument on the breach of natural justice exception, the AR
held that the Berlin default judgment was recognisable and enforceable
at common law. Therefore, he granted Eleven’s application for summary
judgment.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_52" id="Ftn_52_1"><sup>[note: 52]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Boxsentry’s submissions</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_68"></a>68     On
appeal, Boxsentry’s case was that Eleven had not proven that it was
entitled to summary judgment. This was because there were triable issues
that would be more suitably determined at trial. Alternatively,
there was a considerable degree of complexity and detail which went
against Eleven’s case for summary judgment. Lastly, the present
proceedings ought to be adjourned pending the Berlin appeal.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_53" id="Ftn_53_1"><sup>[note: 53]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Triable issues were present</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_69"></a>69     Boxsentry
submitted that the following triable issues arose for determination.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(I)   The Berlin default
judgment was not final and conclusive on the merits</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_70"></a>70     First,
Boxsentry submitted that the Berlin default judgment could not be
final and conclusive on its merits. This was because it was obtained
as a default judgment and no arguments had presented on the merits
of Eleven’s claim. Second, the Berlin court had not made findings
on the merits of the case.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_54" id="Ftn_54_1"><sup>[note: 54]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_71"></a>71     For
the above two reasons, Boxsentry submitted that the present case was
distinguishable from <em>Hong Pian Tee v Les Placements
Germain Gauthier Inc</em> [2002] 1 SLR(R) 515 (“<em>Hong Pian Tee</em>”) and <em>Bellezza
Club Japan Co Ltd v Matsumura Akihiko and others</em> [2010]
3 SLR 342 (“<em>Bellezza</em>”) as those
cases did not deal with the enforcement of default judgments.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_55" id="Ftn_55_1"><sup>[note: 55]</sup></a></span> Those were
also the reasons why Eleven could not assert that the matter ought
not to be re-litigated since it had never been litigated in the
first place.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_56" id="Ftn_56_1"><sup>[note: 56]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(II)   The Berlin default
judgment had been procured by fraud</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_72"></a>72     Boxsentry
next submitted that the Berlin default judgment had been procured
by fraud. According to Dr Czychowski, Eleven had failed to give full
and frank disclosure of the background facts in obtaining the Berlin default
judgment. Eleven had also suppressed facts in order to obtain the Berlin
default judgment against Boxsentry. Those actions constituted fraud under
German law.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_57" id="Ftn_57_1"><sup>[note: 57]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_73"></a>73     Additionally,
Boxsentry submitted that Eleven had erred in its interpretation
of <em>Hong Pian Tee</em> and <em>Bellezza</em>. In its view, Eleven had taken the
position that allegations of fraud must be based on evidence which
arose subsequent to the grant of the foreign judgment. However Boxsentry submitted
that the approach was wrong. In its view, those cases indicated that
foreign judgments could be challenged on the ground of fraud when:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_58" id="Ftn_58_1"><sup>[note: 58]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_73-p2_a"></a>(a)     fresh
evidence was uncovered;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_73-p2_b"></a>(b)     the
defendant had failed to uncover the fresh evidence earlier despite
his reasonable diligence in doing so; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_73-p2_c"></a>(c)     the
fresh evidence would have made a difference in the eventual outcome
of the case.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">On that basis, Boxsentry submitted that it was not seeking
to introduce the same evidence of fraud presented in the Berlin
Regional Court but rather, it was the first time that it was presenting
such evidence. Therefore, the Singapore court was not precluded
from making a finding that the Berlin default judgment was tainted
by fraud.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_59" id="Ftn_59_1"><sup>[note: 59]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_74"></a>74     Third,
Boxsentry submitted that it had recently uncovered a new piece of
evidence which could not have been obtained previously even with reasonable
diligence. Boxsentry further submitted that an adjournment ought
to be granted at the very least pending the Berlin appeal.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(III)   The Berlin default
judgment had been obtained in breach of natural justice</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_75"></a>75     Boxsentry
submitted that the Berlin default judgment was obtained in breach
of natural justice as Boxsentry did not have the opportunity to present
its case. Additionally, the court papers had been served improperly and
that constituted one of the restrictions on the registration of Commonwealth
judgments in s 3(2)(<em>c</em>) of the Reciprocal
Enforcement of Commonwealth Judgments Act (Cap 264, 1985 Rev Ed)
(“RECJA”). In Boxsentry’s view, that restriction should similarly
apply to the recognition and enforcement of foreign judgments under
the common law.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_60" id="Ftn_60_1"><sup>[note: 60]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Complex and conflicting issues
of fact were present</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_76"></a>76     Boxsentry’s
next submission on appeal was that there were complex and conflicting
issues of fact which militated against the grant of summary judgment.
Instead, since there were complex and conflicting issues of fact, unconditional
leave to defend the action should have been granted.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_61" id="Ftn_61_1"><sup>[note: 61]</sup></a></span> First, Boxsentry
submitted that the “sheer length and volume of the affidavits filed
by the parties speak of the complex issues of fact involved”. The
issues related to the PA, its breach and the service of the documents
in the Berlin legal proceedings.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_62" id="Ftn_62_1"><sup>[note: 62]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_77"></a>77     Second,
it was Boxsentry’s position that there were defects in the eXpurgate
service. It alleged that the defects were caused by Eleven after
the PA was signed which rendered the eXpurgate service unfit for
use.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_63" id="Ftn_63_1"><sup>[note: 63]</sup></a></span> Whilst
it was true that Boxsentry had tested the eXpurgate service before signing
the PA, Eleven had total control over the eXpurgate service and
it could change the algorithms or methodology at any time. Therefore,
the testing of the service was irrelevant if it could be changed
so readily.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_64" id="Ftn_64_1"><sup>[note: 64]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Eleven’s submissions</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The Berlin default judgment
is final and conclusive</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_78"></a>78     Eleven
responded by submitting that the Berlin default judgment had satisfied
the criteria for enforcement under the common law. It was undisputed
that the Berlin default judgment was a foreign judgment given <em>in personam</em> by a court of competent jurisdiction
and for a definite sum of money.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_65" id="Ftn_65_1"><sup>[note: 65]</sup></a></span> It
was final and conclusive, notwithstanding the fact that it was a default
judgment. This would be compliant with the guidelines in <em>Bellezza</em> which had adopted the following
test for determining finality (at [14]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The test of finality is the treatment of
the judgment by the foreign tribunal as <em>res
judicata</em>. ‘In order to establish that [a final and conclusive]
judgment has been pronounced, it must be shown that in the court
by which it was pronounced, it conclusively, finally, and forever
established the existence of the debt of which it is sought to be
made conclusive evidence in this country, so as to make it <em>res judicata</em> between the parties.’ <em>A foreign judgment which is liable to be abrogated
or varied by the court which pronounced it is not a final judgment</em>.
[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_79"></a>79     Default
judgments have been held to be final and conclusive (<em>Vanquelin v Bouard</em> (1863) 15 CB (NS) 341).
But to determine the issue of finality, it is necessary to have
regard to evidence of foreign law: <em>Carl Zeiss Siftung
v Rayner &amp; Keeler Ltd (No 2)</em> [1967] 1 AC 853 at 919.
Dr Klaus’s evidence was that the Berlin default judgment was final
and conclusive. His evidence had not been challenged on this point.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_66" id="Ftn_66_1"><sup>[note: 66]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The exceptions to the enforcement
of the Berlin default judgment did not apply</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_80"></a>80     Eleven
also submitted that none of the three exceptions to enforcement
of the Berlin default judgment applied. The public policy exception
had not been relied on while the breach of natural justice exception
was neither pursued in the affidavits which were filed in respect of
SUM 6024 nor at the hearing below. The main contention was with regards
to the fraud exception, which Boxsentry submitted should apply to bar
enforcement (see above at [72]).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_67" id="Ftn_67_1"><sup>[note: 67]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(I)   The requirements
in <em>Hong Pian Tee</em> had not been met</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_81"></a>81     Eleven
submitted that this court should not consider the merits of Boxsentry’s
fraud allegations. <em>Hong Pian Tee</em> was
clear that an allegation of intrinsic fraud should not be entertained
when the evidence was available to the parties at the time of the
earlier foreign proceedings. Since the evidence that Boxsentry was
relying on had existed when the Berlin legal proceedings were commenced,
the fraud allegations should not be entertained as Boxsentry had
made a conscious choice not to defend the Berlin action.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_68" id="Ftn_68_1"><sup>[note: 68]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_82"></a>82     Second,
Eleven submitted that it had not suppressed any facts in obtaining
the Berlin default judgment. It had been upfront with the Berlin Regional
Court as it had stated in the Berlin SOC that Boxsentry had previously
alleged that there were defects in the eXpurgate service.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_69" id="Ftn_69_1"><sup>[note: 69]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_83"></a>83     Third,
the AR had found that the material was unlikely to make any difference
to the outcome of the Berlin proceedings as they merely reflected isolated
incidences of the eXpurgate service’s failure.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_70" id="Ftn_70_1"><sup>[note: 70]</sup></a></span> Therefore Boxsentry’s
allegation of fraud was baseless and unsustainable.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(II)   Boxsentry’s receipt
of bad legal advice was a bare allegation and irrelevant</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_84"></a>84     Eleven
submitted that Boxsentry’s allegation that it did not respond to Eleven’s
actions in Berlin because of bad legal advice was a bare assertion. Boxsentry
had neither waived legal advice privilege nor shown evidence to support
its allegation.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_71" id="Ftn_71_1"><sup>[note: 71]</sup></a></span> The
receipt of wrong legal advice was a matter between Boxsentry and
its lawyers. It should not affect Eleven’s rights.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_72" id="Ftn_72_1"><sup>[note: 72]</sup></a></span> If it was true that
Boxsentry received wrong legal advice, Boxsentry would not have
remained silent for nearly three years.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_73" id="Ftn_73_1"><sup>[note: 73]</sup></a></span> Therefore
the fraud exception did not apply.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(III)   Boxsentry’s allegation
of the eXpurgate software’s defectiveness was baseless</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_85"></a>85     Finally,
Eleven submitted that Boxsentry’s allegation with respect to the
defectiveness of the eXpurgate’s software had no merit for the following reasons:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_74" id="Ftn_74_1"><sup>[note: 74]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_85-p2_a"></a>(a)     Boxsentry
had not produced any evidence of the alleged defects in the eXpurgate
service. Its allegation of defects and fraud rested on one isolated
incident in which Eleven acknowledged there was misclassification.
There was no evidence that other customers had been affected by
the misclassifications of emails by the eXpurgate service. Almost
six months after the PA’s commencement, Boxsentry sent an email
to thank Eleven for its support. No mention was made about the eXpurgate
service being defective.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_85-p2_b"></a>(b)     There
was no concealment of facts by Eleven as it had raised the issue
of the PA’s termination and the allegation of defects in the eXpurgate
service by Boxsentry in the Berlin SOC, which was sent to Boxsentry.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_85-p2_c"></a>(c)     Boxsentry
paid for first and second quarters of the first year without any
protest, objection and/or qualification. It also did not demand
a refund of the payments made or bring a counterclaim for them.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_85-p2_d"></a>(d)     There
was a gap of more than two months between the time that Eleven first
asked for the third quarter payment and the point at which Boxsentry
sought to terminate the PA. If the service was truly defective,
it would have raised them earlier.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_85-p2_e"></a>(e)     Boxsentry
tested the eXpurgate service for about seven months prior to signing
the PA. It would not have entered into the PA if it was as defective
as it said it was. It continued to use the eXpurgate service for
about one year and eight months after it purportedly terminated the
PA.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_85-p2_f"></a>(f)     Boxsentry
did not respond when Eleven tried to find out what the defects were.
Furthermore the allegations of Boxsentry were inconsistent with
the evidence tendered. Boxsentry alleged that there were defects
from the inception of the PA but it had only tendered evidence showing
misclassified emails arising from 2 October 2008 or later.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_85-p2_g"></a>(g)     Boxsentry
did not raise any issues with respect to the eXpurgate service when
Eleven commenced the Berlin legal proceedings. It also did not raise
any issues after the Berlin default judgment was entered against
it despite having been personally served with the judgment.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_86"></a>86     Therefore
Boxsentry’s allegation of fraud was baseless and unsustainable.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">My decision on the summary judgment
application</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_87"></a>87     In
my judgment, the Berlin default judgment had not been procured by
fraud. Therefore, Boxsentry’s appeal must be dismissed. Before giving the
reasons for my decision, I shall first deal with the burden of proof required
in an application for summary judgment.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The burden of proof for a summary
judgement</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_88"></a>88     The
parties agreed that the burden of proof was on Eleven to prove on a <em>prima facie</em> basis before the court would
grant it a summary judgment in the enforcement of the foreign judgment.
Boxsentry only had to show that it had a fair or reasonable chance
that there was a real or <em>bona fide</em> defence: <em>Associated Development Pte Ltd v Loong Sie </em><em>Kiong Gerald</em> [2009] 4 SLR(R) 389 at [22].
Thus Boxsentry had to show that there was a triable issue or the need
for certain apposite issues to be determined at trial: <em>Tulip Furniture Enterprise Pte Ltd v Roberto Building
Material Pte Ltd</em> [1997] SGHC 114 at [7].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_89"></a>89     In
the context of the enforcement of foreign judgments at common law,
it is trite law that the foreign judgment must be final and conclusive
on the merits of the case. <em>Hong Pian Tee</em> set
this out well at [12]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… [I]t is settled law that a foreign judgment <em>in personam</em> given by a foreign court of
competent jurisdiction may be enforced by an action for the amount due
under it so long as the foreign judgment is final and conclusive
as between the same parties. The foreign judgment is conclusive
as to any matter thereby adjudicated upon and cannot be impeached
for any error, whether of fact or of law: <em>Godard
v Gray</em> (1870) LR 6 QB 139. <em>In respect
of such an action, an application for summary judgment may be made
on the ground that the defendant has no defence to the claim</em>: <em>Grant v Easton</em> (1883) 13 QBD 302. The
local court will only refrain from enforcing a foreign judgment
if it is shown that the plaintiff procured it by fraud, or if its enforcement
would be contrary to public policy or if the proceedings in which
the judgment was obtained were opposed to natural justice … [emphasis
added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Having established the legal position with respect to summary
judgments in the context of enforcing foreign judgments, I shall
proceed to examine the appeal brought by Boxsentry and assess whether
it was meritorious.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">There was no breach of natural
justice</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_90"></a>90     Boxsentry
in its written submissions submitted that there was a breach of
natural justice if there was no hearing on the merits or improper service
of the court documents. However, it did not pursue this argument
at the hearing before me.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_75" id="Ftn_75_1"><sup>[note: 75]</sup></a></span> Nevertheless,
I found that there was no breach of natural justice as the relevant
legal documents had been properly and correctly served on Boxsentry.
It was Boxsentry that chose not to respond and sat on its legal
rights. Therefore that allegation was without merit.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The Berlin default judgment
was final and conclusive</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_91"></a>91     The
parties’ disagreement as to the final and binding nature of the Berlin
default judgment was more apparent than real. It centred on the
fact that it was a default judgment which was not granted on the
merits of the case. Boxsentry’s position was that because the merits
of the case were not tried, the judgment was not final and binding
on Boxsentry. Thus it could not be enforced in Singapore (see [69]
above). Eleven’s position was that the judgment had fulfilled the
criteria as set out <em>Bellezza</em> and
hence, enforceable (see [79] above).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_92"></a>92     In
my view, the Berlin default judgment was final and binding on Boxsentry.
The test for finality and conclusiveness was not whether the decision
was made on the merits of the case but on whether it could be reopened
by the court that granted the judgment. Boxsentry’s contention was
not supported by the local jurisprudence. Default judgments have
been recognised as final and conclusive, even though the merits
of the case had not been examined. As commented in <em>Halsbury’s
Laws of Singapore</em> vol 6(2) (Butterworths Asia, 2013 Reissue)
(“<em>Halsbury’s Laws of Singapore</em>”)
at paras 75.157–75.158:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The judgment must be final and conclusive
under the law of its originating jurisdiction; the judgment must
be <em>res judicata</em> between the parties
under that law, ie, it must make a final determination of rights
between the parties. A judgment is not final and conclusive in this
sense if it can be re-opened by the same tribunal, or if the tribunal
can alter its terms, or of there is another body, not being an appellate
or supervisory body, that can override the decision of the tribunal.
…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<em>A default judgment
can be final and conclusive, even though it may be liable to be
set aside in the same court, so long as it satisfies the general
test of finality. Finality of a default judgment is tested by its
effect under the law of the originating jurisdiction, so that it
is necessary to determine the effect of the default judgment under
the foreign law</em>. If it has been given the effect of finality
until set aside, it will be regarded as a final and conclusive judgment, but
if it is subsequently set aside in the foreign jurisdiction, that
can be a ground for setting aside a summary judgment made in the
enforcing forum entirely on the basis of the foreign judgment. …</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_93"></a>93     Eleven’s
expert on German law, Dr Klaus, stated that the Berlin default judgment
was final and conclusive as to the merits. His view was that under
ss 276 and 331 para 3 of the <em>Zivilprozessordnung</em> (“ZPO”),
the Berlin Regional Court was able and entitled to issue a default
judgment without an oral hearing after the time period for Boxsentry
to file its defence had lapsed.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_76" id="Ftn_76_1"><sup>[note: 76]</sup></a></span> Under s 338
and 339 of the ZPO, Boxsentry was granted four weeks to object to
the Berlin default judgment, during which the Berlin default judgment
would only be provisionally enforceable.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_77" id="Ftn_77_1"><sup>[note: 77]</sup></a></span> It failed to
do so, and thus, the judgment became final and conclusive which could
be enforced.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_78" id="Ftn_78_1"><sup>[note: 78]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_94"></a>94     Dr
Czychowski disagreed on the basis that in Germany, a plaintiff was fraudulent
if he had pleaded wrong or incomplete facts before the defendant
had time to respond.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_79" id="Ftn_79_1"><sup>[note: 79]</sup></a></span> Therefore the
Berlin default judgment was unenforceable in Germany and should
not be enforced in Singapore.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_95"></a>95     In
my view, there was no real dispute as to the judgment’s finality.
Dr Klaus and Dr Czychowski both agreed that Berlin default judgment
was final and conclusive. The only difference was that Dr Czychowski
opined that fraud would vitiate enforceability of the judgement.
In this case there was no evidence of fraud by Eleven when it obtained
the Berlin default judgment. I shall elaborate in greater details
when I deal with the issue of fraud below. Thus this allegation
also had no real merit and I was satisfied that the Berlin default
judgment was final, conclusive and binding on Boxsentry.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The Berlin default judgment
was not obtained by fraud</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_96"></a>96     One
of the most important issues was whether the Berlin default judgment
was obtained by fraud. If there was fraud, the Berlin default judgment
would not be enforced nor would it be a suitable case for summary
judgment.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(I)   Fraud and foreign
judgments</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_97"></a>97     The
issue of fraud for the purposes of resisting the recognition and enforcement
of foreign judgments was discussed in the Court of Appeal case of <em>Hong Pian Tee</em>. In that case, the Court
of Appeal departed from the traditional English position in <em>Abouloff v Oppenheimer &amp; Co</em> (1882)
10 QBD 295 (“<em>Abouloff</em>”) and instead,
adopted the Canadian-Australian approach laid down in <em>Jacobs v Beaver</em> (1908) 17 OLR 496 (“<em>Jacobs</em>”) and <em>Keele
v Findley</em> (1990) 21 NSWLR 444. As the facts of <em>Hong Pian Tee</em> are similar to the present
case, it is helpful to examine them in greater detail.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_98"></a>98     In <em>Hong Pian Tee</em>, the respondent had commenced
an action against the appellant in Canada and the appellant had
been held liable. Later, the respondent sought to enforce the Canadian
judgment in Singapore and it obtained a summary judgment from Choo
Han Teck JC (as he then was). Dissatisfied with the outcome, the
appellant appealed against Choo JC’s decision and the issue on appeal
was whether the Canadian judgment was obtained by fraud or not.
In dismissing the appeal, Chao Hick Tin JA held that the English
approach in <em>Abouloff</em> was undesirable
in that it encouraged endless litigation (at [27]). He therefore
restricted the fraud exception to the following circumstances (at
[30]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… [W]here an allegation of fraud had been
considered and adjudicated upon by a competent foreign court, the
foreign judgment may be challenged on the ground of fraud only where
fresh evidence has come to light which reasonable diligence on the
part of the defendant would not have uncovered and the fresh evidence
would have been likely to make a difference in the eventual result
of the case. …</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_99"></a>99     The
approach adopted by <em>Hong Pian Tee</em> differentiated
between <em>extrinsic</em> and <em>intrinsic</em> fraud. If the former was being
alleged, it would not be subject to the same stringent safeguards
as the latter, where the claimant must show that the evidence was
(a) newly discovered in that it could not have been obtained with
reasonable diligence at trial; and (b) so material that its production
at the trial would have affected the result: at [19].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_100"></a>100    The
parties were at odds as to what constitutes <em>extrinsic</em> and <em>intrinsic</em> fraud. Eleven opined that Boxsentry’s
case was built on intrinsic fraud as Boxsentry had submitted that
Eleven had failed to give full and frank disclosure of the background
facts of the case to the Berlin court.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_80" id="Ftn_80_1"><sup>[note: 80]</sup></a></span> Having heard
the evidence and the law, my finding was that the fraud sought to
be raised by Boxsentry appeared to be extrinsic rather than intrinsic.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(II)   Boxsentry alleged
extrinsic fraud and not intrinsic fraud</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_101"></a>101    The
Court of Appeal in <em>Hong Pian Tee</em> at
[21] discussed intrinsic and extrinsic fraud as held in <em>Jacobs</em>. Intrinsic fraud related to fraud
which was “collateral or extraneous, and not merely the fraud which
is imputed from alleged false statements made at the trial, which
were met by counter-statements by the other side, and the whole
adjudicated upon by the Court and so passed on into the limb of
estoppel by the judgment” (see <em>Jacobs</em> at 505)
while extrinsic fraud was described as “situations where the judgment went
against the defendant by fraud of the judgment creditor, <em>eg</em>, where the defendant had never been
served, or the suit had been undefended without the defendant’s
default, or the defendant had been fraudulently persuaded or deceived
to allow the judgment to go by default, or some other fraud to the
defendant’s prejudice committed or allowed in the proceedings of
the foreign court”: <em>Halsbury’s Laws of Singapore</em> at
para 75.228. <em>Dicey, Morris &amp; Collins on
the Conflict of Laws</em> (Lord Collins of Mapesbury gen ed)
(Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 15th Ed, 2012) at p 727 further gives examples
of what is meant by extrinsic fraud: “…whether the fraud is extrinsic,
e.g., consists in bribing witnesses, or intrinsic, e.g., consists
in giving or procuring of perjured or forged evidence.”</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_102"></a>102    The
Supreme Court of Canada has also described the distinction as between
fraud going to the jurisdiction of the court (extrinsic fraud) and fraud
going to the merits of the judgment (intrinsic fraud): <em>Beals v Saldanha</em> [2003] 3 SCR 416 (“<em>Beals</em>”) at [51]. In its view:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">51    It
is simpler to say that fraud going to jurisdiction can always be
raised before a domestic court to challenge the judgment. On the
other hand, the merits of a foreign judgment can be challenged for
fraud only where the allegations are new and not the subject of
prior adjudication. Where material facts not previously discoverable
arise that potentially challenge the evidence that was before the
foreign court, the domestic court can decline recognition of the
judgment.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_103"></a>103    It
is therefore evident that the distinction between intrinsic and extrinsic
fraud has been drawn along the lines of whether the fraud took place
within or outside the trial. This distinction can be attributed
to the history of English legal development. Traditionally, common
law courts would only treat a judgment as void for fraud based on
collusion and other extrinsic fraud, ignoring the evidence given
at trial. The courts of equity however were more willing to examine
whether judgments were obtained by false evidence: D M Gordon, “Fraud
or New Evidence as Grounds for Actions to Set Aside Judgments–I”
(1961) 77 LQR 358 at p 366 and D M Gordon, “Fraud or New Evidence
as Grounds for Actions to Set Aside Judgments–II” (1961) 77 LQR
533 (“Fraud or New Evidence II”) at p 533. The following passage
from Fraud or New Evidence II at p 555 provides a good analysis
as to the practical differences between alleging extrinsic and intrinsic
fraud:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">One important factor in fraud actions is
whether the fraud set up is extrinsic, or is false evidence that
produced the judgment. In all cases, the plaintiff must begin by
producing his new evidence, and by showing that this is newly-discovered
and not discoverable before by exercise of diligence. Unless this new
evidence is strong and convincing, the court may dismiss the action
at once. …</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In a case of extrinsic fraud, such as <em>bribery of a solicitor, counsel or witnesses, or
collusion with a representative party to the prejudice of beneficial
interests</em>, even though the principle is accepted that
fraud to be remediable must be shown to have brought about the judgment
attacked, the court may well dispose of the case on a hearing in
which the fact of the fraud is the only point tried, and on making
a finding of fraud the court goes no further, but reverses the judgment
attacked. In such an event, the court restores the parties to their original
positions before the first judgment, without prejudice to the right
of the loser to try for another judgment in a fresh action, if he
sees fit. This means that the court presumes that the fraud proved
contributed to the judgment reversed; in most cases of extrinsic
fraud it would be impossible to trace the connecting links between
the fraud and the judgment following, even if the same judge sat
without a jury in both trials.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">But this course could rarely, if ever,
be appropriate in a review based on intrinsic fraud, and particularly
perjury. As James LJ has pointed out, in most contested actions
a certain amount of perjury goes on, perhaps on both sides, the
judge knowing that some person or persons must be lying; and because on
review some particular piece of evidence on the first trial appears
to have been false, it does not follow that the judgment should
be presumed to have been produced by it. So in general review calls
for a hearing in which both the old and the new evidence is weighed
together.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_104"></a>104    In
my view, Boxsentry’s fraud allegation was premised on Eleven’s failure
to give full and frank disclosure of the background facts to the
Berlin Regional Court. This was purportedly done so that the Berlin
default judgment could be obtained unfairly against Boxsentry. It
appeared to be an allegation of extrinsic fraud and not intrinsic
fraud since it was an allegation that Eleven fraudulently sought
to mislead the Berlin court.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(III)   There was no extrinsic
fraud on the facts</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_105"></a>105    I
found that there was no extrinsic fraud. There was nothing to suggest
that Eleven had sought to deceive the Berlin courts. The evidence showed
that Eleven had stated in the Berlin SOC that Boxsentry had made allegations
regarding the eXpurgate service.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_81" id="Ftn_81_1"><sup>[note: 81]</sup></a></span> Eleven had annexed to
the Berlin SOC its email dated 20 November 2008 to Boxsentry and
the latter’s email to Eleven dated 15 December 2008. Those emails
related to the termination of the PA and Boxsentry dissatisfaction
of eXpurgate service. If Eleven had the intention to deceive the
Berlin Regional Court, what was the point of saying that and hurting
its own chances of succeeding in the German action? Eleven mentioned
those facts as it was honest with the Berlin court. I thus hold
that the allegation of extrinsic fraud made by Boxsentry was without
merit.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_106"></a>106    I
noted as well that in the Berlin Regional Court’s decision rendered on
13 May 2014, the court had held that Eleven had disclosed all the
facts relating to the allegations of the eXpurgate service being
defective. Therefore its allegation that the Berlin default judgment
was procured by fraud was groundless. The Berlin court had also
found that there were no circumstances which would lead to the enforcement
of the Berlin default judgment being contrary to public policy.
Thus I found that the present proceedings were merely desperate
and weak attempts to set aside a valid and legitimate judgment.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(IV)   There was no intrinsic
fraud on the facts</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_107"></a>107    I
earlier held at [100] that the fraud raised by Boxsentry was in
fact extrinsic fraud. But if it was intrinsic fraud, Boxsentry would
have needed to show me that new evidence had surfaced since the
Berlin default judgment. I noted that in <em>Beals</em>,
the Supreme Court of Canada had held that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">53    Although <em>Jacobs</em>, supra, was a contested foreign
action, the test used is equally applicable to default judgments. <em>Where the foreign default proceedings are not inherently
unfair, failing to defend the action, by itself, should prohibit the
defendant from claiming that any of the evidence adduced or steps
taken in the foreign proceedings was evidence of fraud just discovered.
But if there is evidence of fraud before the foreign court that
could not have been discovered by reasonable diligence, that will
justify a domestic court’s refusal to enforce the judgment</em>.
[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_108"></a>108    Fraud
or New Evidence II at p 538 also commented that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Perjury at a trial could in a sense be
called intrinsic fraud, and perhaps other perjury, as in giving
discovery, could be called extrinsic. But it seems more than doubtful
whether any such distinctions have value. What the reviewing court
is concerned with are the questions: <em>How strong
is the probability that such perjury produced the judgment given?
How strong is the probability that the evidence of perjury will
convince the second court?</em> [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_109"></a>109    I
was unconvinced that new evidence had surfaced. The new evidence sought
to be relied upon was a brochure produced by Eleven. The brochure claimed
that it was technically impossible to be 100% accurate in categorising
spam. That was allegedly contrary to what Eleven had said in its
contractual negotiations with Boxsentry.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_82" id="Ftn_82_1"><sup>[note: 82]</sup></a></span> The
latter also claimed that it could not obtain the brochure with “reasonable
diligence” prior to the present action. I found that hard to believe.
If it was a brochure, it would have been made easily available by
Eleven to the world since it would have been used by Eleven for
marketing purposes.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The merits of the substantive
action were irrelevant</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_110"></a>110    Lastly,
I found that Boxsentry’s submission that there were complex and
conflicting facts to be decided was irrelevant to the grant of summary judgment.
The case before me was not one on the merits, but one for the enforcement
of a foreign decision. The parties had agreed in the PA to the exclusive
jurisdiction of the Berlin courts and the application of German law
to govern the PA (at [10] above). As such, the presence of complex
and conflicting facts was not an issue to be determined by the Singapore
court and I had no intention to usurp the position of the Berlin
courts in determining factual issues such as the quality of the
eXpurgate service.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_111"></a>111    In
conclusion, I was of the view that RA 292 and RA 293 were unmeritorious.
Accordingly, I dismissed both the appeals and ordered Boxsentry
to pay Eleven the following:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_111-p2_a"></a>(a)     fixed
costs of $5,000 for both appeals;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_111-p2_b"></a>(b)     $1,000
for the adjournment; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_111-p2_c"></a>(c)     reasonable
disbursements.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_112"></a>112    I
further ordered Boxsentry to pay fixed costs of $5,000 for both
RAs plus reasonable disbursements.</p>
