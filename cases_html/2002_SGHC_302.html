<p xmlns="">1.        The plaintiff applied by this originating

summons for an order that a caveat lodged against the plaintiff’s property at 79

Farrer Drive #13-04 Sommerville Park by the defendant be removed. The defendant countered

with a summons-in-chambers for a stay of the originating summons pending trial of Suit 798

of 2002, or alternatively, for the originating summons to be heard with that suit. The

trial of Suit 798 of 2002 has been scheduled to commence in two months’ time.</p>
<p xmlns="">2.        The background facts are as follows. The

plaintiff had contracted to supply logs from Indonesia to the defendant. The defendant

subsequently entered into a contract to sell the logs to a third party. The plaintiff then

informed the defendant that by reason of a ban imposed by the Indonesian government the

plaintiff was unable to fulfil his obligations to the defendant.</p>
<p xmlns="">3.        Undeterred, the defendant prevailed upon

the plaintiff to make further efforts to deliver the logs. It was then agreed that the

defendant should advance a sum of US$150,000 (approximately S$270,000) to the plaintiff.

The purpose of this advance is disputed and will be an issue in the trial of Suit 798 of

2002. The plaintiff says that it was money intended to "pay off key officials"

so that the logs can be shipped out. The defendant denies this and claims that the money

was intended to be used to make legitimate payments.</p>
<p xmlns="">4.        In any event, the plaintiff did eventually

obtain an advance of US$270,000 from the defendant. There is an issue concerning the

payment of interest and whether the advance was illegal or otherwise in breach of the

Moneylenders Act. That issue would also be a matter for the trial of Suit 798 of 2002.</p>
<p xmlns="">5.        The advance was partially made, that is, a

sum of S$90,000, on 24 December 2001. The plaintiff asked for the balance of S$180,000 on

28 December 2001. The defendant’s representatives then asked for security before the

balance would be released. Consequently, an option to purchase in respect of the said

property was prepared and signed. It appears that the option was prepared by the

defendant’s then solicitors but this does not seem to be a material fact for present

purposes although it may be in the trial of Suit 798 of 2002. The S$180,000 was paid upon

the plaintiff signing the option on 28 December 2001. The plaintiff subsequently contended

that the option was a sham, partly because he says that the normal option fee is 1% of the

purchase price but in this case it was almost 23%. Furthermore, the purchase price was

well below market valuation. Various other factors were raised in support of this

contention.</p>
<p xmlns="">6.        However, despite the payment of S$270,000,

the plaintiff was unable to secure the logs. The defendants was told that more funds were

required but the defendant did not provide any more money and the logs were eventually

sold and released to some other party who provided the money.</p>
<p xmlns="">7.        The defendant then exercised the option on

10 May 2002. The plaintiff instructed their solicitors to write to the defendant a long

letter dated 5 June 2002 stating that he considers the option to be a sham and was null

and void by reason, <i>inter alia</i>, of illegality under the Moneylenders’ Act. The

defendant was asked to remove the caveat against the property.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">8.        The defendant instead

commenced Suit 798 of 2002 on 5 July 2002. The plaintiff applied to remove the caveat on

the basis that it was an independent issue from the matters raised in the suit. The

application was made under s 127 of the Land Titles Act, Ch 157 which provides as

follows:-</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"127.—(1) At any time after the lodgment of a caveat, the

    caveatee may summon the caveator to attend before the court to show cause why the caveat

    should not be withdrawn or otherwise removed, and the court may make such order, either ex

    parte or otherwise, as seems just."</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">9.        Mr Appoo, counsel for the

plaintiff, submitted before me that the defendant had lost its caveatable interest because

it had accepted the plaintiff’s breach of contract and elected to seek payment of the

sum of S$270,000 instead of specific performance. Counsel drew my attention to  8 of the

defendant’s solicitors’ letter of 12 June 2002 in reply to the plaintiff’s

solicitors’ letter of 5 June 2002. The said  8 reads as follows:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"In respect of the advance and the security obtained by our

    clients over your clients’ property, our instructions are to demand for the payment

    of the sum of $270,000 within the next 7 days. <i>Upon the receipt of these monies, our

    clients will withdraw the caveat</i>". (my emphasis)</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">10.        I agree with Mr Wong for

the defendant that this originating summons should be heard together with Suit 798 of

2002. That s 127(1) of the Land Titles Act has been likened to a statutory injunction of

an interlocutory nature can be traced to the judgment of Lord Diplock in <i>Eng Mee Yong v

Letchumanan </i><nobr>[1979] 2 MLJ 212</nobr> and that had since been followed by the Court of Appeal

in <i>Sim Kwang Mui Ivy v Goh Peng Khim</i> <nobr>[1995] 1 SLR 186</nobr>.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">11.        I agree entirely with Mr

Wong that the balance of convenience lay in allowing the caveat to remain. First, there is

no prejudice to the plaintiff if it is to remain. If there were, none had been drawn to my

attention. Secondly, the trial of Suit 798 of 2002 is only two months away. There are two

other grounds why the application should not be allowed at this stage. First, the election

that Mr Appoo says the defendant had made through its solicitors was a qualified one and

whether it amounts to an election is a triable issue. I have already emphasized the

relevant portion of the alleged elections above. The effect of that paragraph is best left

to the trial judge who will have a fuller and clearer view of the facts after evidence is

led. Furthermore, if the caveat is removed now, the defendant may be left with a paper

judgment should it succeed in Suit 798 of 2002. The balance of convenience is clearly in

favour of the defendant. Mr Appoo submitted that there is no issue of a balancing of

convenience because there is no serious issue to be tried. I do not think that that is

right. On the contrary, there is a very serious issue to be tried. The defendant had

exercised an option for sale. The plaintiff is challenging that on the ground that the

option was illegal and void. That is a serious, primary issue. There is also a serious

secondary issue, namely, whether the defendant had accepted the plaintiff’s

repudiation and elected to forfeit its rights under the option. All these issues are

intricately co-related. It will be unfair to release the caveat before these issues are

addressed; and the proper place to address them is at trial.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">12.        I note the strenuous

contentions by Mr Appoo that the defendant has no chance of success, but his assertions

depend on important assumptions of fact which can only be established at trial. For

instance, whether there was an illegal transaction or not is clearly a matter of fact that

is hotly in dispute. Reading the email sent by the plaintiff to the defendant’s Lewis

Lim on 7 December 2001, I am of the view that the facts must be flushed out at trial and

to allow the plaintiff’s application at this stage, in these circumstances, would not

be just.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">13.        I therefore allowed the

defendant’s application that this originating summons be heard together with the

trial of Suit 798 of 2002, or stood down pending that trial as the trial judge may deem

preferable.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">14.        Costs of the proceedings

to be reserved to the trial judge in Suit 798 of 2002.</p>
