The bills of costs were issued for and in relation to Mr Ho’s litigation in Suit No 195 of 2012 (“Suit 195”), which was later consolidated with Suit No 1267 of 2014 (“Suit 1267”), and Suit No 108 of 2013 (“Suit 108”) (collectively, “the Suits”). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">3 Having heard the submissions of the parties, I dismissed the taxation application on the sole ground that the letters of engagement that Mr Ho had entered into with SLC in respect of both Suit 195 and Suit 108 (“the Suit 195 Engagement Letter” and “the Suit 108 Engagement Letter” respectively; collectively, “the Engagement Letters”) were CBAs within the meaning of s 111 of the LPA, such that the bills of costs issued pursuant to the Engagement Letters were precluded under s 112(4) from being sent for taxation. I also ordered Mr Ho to pay to MLS the costs of the taxation application, which I fixed at S$6,500 including disbursements.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">4 Mr Ho has since filed an appeal against my decision. I now furnish the grounds for my decision.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Background</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Mr Ho’s engagement of legal services</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">5 I begin with a survey of the lawyers and law firms whose services Mr Ho had engaged in relation to his dispute with his two brothers, Mr Ho Poey Wee and Mr Ho Seow Ban, and Guan Ho Construction Co (Pte) Ltd (“Guan Ho Construction”).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">6 In or around February 2012, Mr Ho engaged Ms Lynette Chew Mei Lin (“Ms Chew”) and Mr Tan Saey Chong, Gadriel (“Mr Gadriel Tan”), who were practising in INCA Law LLC (“INCA Law”) at that time, to advise and represent him.

However, in the interest of the efficient resolution of the taxation application, I allowed Mr Daniel’s oral application and limited myself, in disposing of the taxation application, to dealing only with the CBA Issue. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The applicable legal principles</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 I shall now set out the general legal principles that guided my analysis before turning to consider the specific arguments raised by the parties.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 Section 111 of the LPA permits a solicitor or law corporation to enter into CBAs. The significance of entering into a CBA is that pursuant to s 112(4) of the LPA, the client would lose his or her right to request for a bill of costs issued pursuant to the CBA to be sent for taxation.

</div> The crux of the disagreement thus resided in whether the terms within the Engagement Letters that govern the solicitor’s fees were sufficiently certain or specific. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 Before me, Mr Daniel made, to my mind, two types of objections regarding why the Engagement Letters were not sufficiently specific to qualify as CBAs.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 First, Mr Daniel’s primary submission was a blanket objection in principle against <span class="font-italic">any</span> agreement as to charge-out rates being found to be sufficiently specific to constitute CBAs (“the Broad Objection”). In this regard, Mr Daniel argued that an agreement as to charge-out rates of the solicitors handling the matter could <span class="font-italic">never </span>be considered sufficiently specific to constitute a CBA, and that a CBA had to contain an agreement as to a lump-sum fee that was to be charged for the entire matter.

To this end, Mr Daniel suggested that an agreement as to charge-out rates had to also be accompanied by an agreement as to the fixed number of hours (which would essentially make the agreement a lump-sum fee agreement) or the maximum number of hours (which would essentially make the agreement a capped lump-sum fee agreement) that will be committed by the lawyers to the matter in order to be sufficiently specific.

</div>
</div> In this case, the agreements in the Engagement Letters provided that the charge-out rates of the lawyers assigned to take charge of the conduct of the Suits were to be multiplied by the actual number of hours utilised by the respective lawyers in order to obtain an ascertainable total fee on completion of handling the matter.

<div class="FootnoteRef text-justify">  NE 6 September 2017, 24:13–26:19.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> To this end, I set out once again for convenient reference the text of s 111(1) of the LPA as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Agreement as to costs for contentious business</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">111.</span>—(1) Subject to the provisions of any other written law, a solicitor or a law corporation or a limited liability law partnership may make an agreement in writing with any client <span class="font-italic">respecting the amount and </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">manner of payment</span><span class="font-italic"> for the whole or any part of its costs in respect of contentious business</span> done or to be done by the solicitor or the law corporation or the limited liability law partnership, <span class="font-italic">either by a gross sum </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">or otherwise</span>, and at either the same rate as or a greater or a lesser rate than that at which he or the law corporation or the limited liability law partnership would otherwise be entitled to be remunerated.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added in italics and bold italics]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 I make two observations about the text of s 111(1) of the LPA. First, the provision’s express reference to an agreement as to the <span class="font-italic">manner</span> of payment, and not only as to the <span class="font-italic">amount</span> of payment, suggests that it is open to solicitors and clients to agree to different modes of payment. Any suggestion that solicitors and clients are only permitted to agree to a single manner of payment, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, by lump-sum fee, was thus clearly misconceived. Secondly, the provision expressly provides that the mode of payment adopted in the CBA could be “either by a gross sum or otherwise”. To my mind, this particular reference in the provision made it abundantly clear that Parliament had intended for CBAs within the meaning of s 111(1) to include agreements between solicitors and clients as to charge-out rates. Specifically, insofar as an agreement to pay “by a gross sum” clearly corresponds to an agreement for a lump-sum fee, an agreement to pay “by … otherwise” would therefore point towards solicitors and clients being allowed to agree on any other method of payment in a CBA, including charge-out rates.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 I was also of the view that the relevant case precedents did not preclude the finding that agreements as to the charge-out rates of solicitors could be sufficiently specific to constitute CBAs. In the <span class="font-italic">Chamberlain</span> decision, Lord Denning MR, in holding that the agreement in question was not a CBA, was careful in refraining from coming to a view in this regard when he made the following remarks (at 1445):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">We discussed in the course of the argument the sort of <span class="font-italic">method of remuneration</span> which could be covered by a contentious business agreement. <span class="font-italic">Such as whether an hourly rate would come within it. I need say nothing as to that.</span> Also, whether it should be such as to say whether it is the higher or lower rate of remuneration. I say nothing as to that either. Because, to my mind it is plain that this agreement was not a contentious business agreement in writing such as to satisfy the statute. … [emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">It was thus necessary to look beyond the <span class="font-italic">Chamberlain </span>decision for more instructive guidance on this point.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 Mr Daniel put forward the case of <span class="font-italic">Chancery Law</span> as a decision that offered strong support for the Broad Objection. I did not agree. In <span class="font-italic">Chancery Law</span>, the letters of engagement that the solicitors and the clients had entered into were described in the following terms (at [65]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… the LOEs provide for <span class="font-italic">hourly rates of the lawyers in charge</span>. The LOEs further provide that the professional fees charged may take account of a range of factors including the complexity of the matter, the urgency and importance of the matter and the skill or specialized knowledge expended by the lawyer. In addition to pre-trial and post-trial work, the LOEs set out what was described as the “minimum” court attendance fees. The LOEs made further provision for chargeable disbursements. [emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">Wei J held that the letters of engagement were <span class="font-italic">not </span>sufficiently specific or certain to constitute CBAs under s 111 of the LPA because although they identified the charging rates of the lawyers involved, their terms were not sufficient to allow the client to make a “reasoned forecast as to what it was letting itself in for in respect of fees and disbursements; they merely set out the relevant rates of charging” (at [66]). While this particular holding might appear to be construed as a blanket disapproval of agreements as to charge-out rates ever being sufficiently specific to constitute CBAs, I did not think that there was sufficient information regarding the exact contents of the letters of engagement in <span class="font-italic">Chancery Law </span>to draw such an inference. Instead, what seemed to me to be the key principle in <span class="font-italic">Chancery Law </span>was found in the following passage (at [64]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">It is clear from the above cases that the <span class="font-italic">fee agreements specifying only the rate of charging such as hourly rates </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">run the risk </span><span class="font-italic">of being found to be insufficiently certain and specific to constitute valid CBAs.</span> The CBA in question must make it clear to the client what he is letting himself in for in respect of legal fees. Merely setting out an indication or guide as to the rate of charging upon which the bill is to be drawn may not be enough to constitute a CBA that would fall within s 111. As O’Connor LJ commented or impliedly queried in the <span class="font-italic">Chamberlain </span>case …, how is the agreement to be construed as a CBA if it does not set out any plan by which the client can make a reasoned calculation as to what his monthly or quarterly liability might be? [emphasis in original removed; emphasis added in italics and bold italics]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">From this extract, it was clear that Wei J indeed did not hold that agreements as to solicitor charge-out rates could <span class="font-italic">never</span> in principle be sufficiently specific to constitute CBAs. All that was observed was that agreements as to charge-out rates had a greater <span class="font-italic">risk</span> of being found to be insufficiently certain, presumably as compared to lump-sum fee agreements.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 The next case that I considered was the Singapore High Court decision of <span class="font-italic">Shamsudin</span>. In <span class="font-italic">Shamsudin</span>, the solicitor and client entered into an agreement for the client to pay the solicitor a lump-see fee of S$15,000 for the solicitor’s costs. Chan JC held that the lump-sum fee agreement was not an agreement that came within the scope of s 111(1) of the Legal Profession Act (Cap 217, 1970 Rev Ed), which was in all material aspects identical to the current iteration of that provision under s 111(1) of the LPA, “by reason of its uncertain scope and its failure to contain the full terms of the bargain between the solicitor and the applicant” (at [22]). In my view, the fact that the agreement as to costs in <span class="font-italic">Shamsudin </span>was adjudged to be insufficiently specific despite being a lump-sum agreement spoke volumes of the fact that the key inquiry was not whether the fee agreement was a lump-sum fee agreement or an agreement as to charge-out rates. Rather, the only indicia that mattered was whether the fee agreement was specific or clear enough for the client to know what he is letting himself in for in respect of legal fees. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 Finally, I was also referred to the English High Court (Senior Courts Costs Office) decision of <span class="font-italic">Addleshaw Goddard LLP v Nicholas Stewart Wood, Kevin John Hellard as General Administrators of the Estate of Platon Elenin (formerly Boris Abramovich Berezovsky) </span>[2015] EWHC B12 (Costs) (“<span class="font-italic">Addleshaw Goddard</span>”). In this case, one of the issues considered by the Costs Judge, Master Campbell, was whether an engagement letter was a CBA enforceable under s 61 of the English Solicitors Act, which was <span class="font-italic">in pari materia </span>with s 113 of the LPA. One of the clauses contained in the engagement letter provided for hourly expense rates for the solicitors whilst reserving the right to increase its rates (at [30]). Hence, Master Campbell, in finding that the engagement letter was sufficiently specific to constitute a CBA, clearly held that a fee agreement that sets out the hourly rates of the solicitors would be sufficiently specific to constitute a CBA (at [74]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 I thus concluded from the relevant authorities surveyed that it was not contrary to any longstanding or well-established jurisprudence for me to hold that an agreement as to the solicitor’s charge-out rates could in principle be sufficiently specific to constitute a CBA.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 For the sake of completeness, I turn now to address Mr Daniel’s reliance on the Law Society’s Sample Letter of Engagement at Appendix 11C of the Law Society’s Practice Management Manual. Specifically, Mr Daniel brought to my attention the first suggested para 12 of the Sample Letter of Engagement, which reads as follows:

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 I was not able to comprehend the logic underlying this submission, and found that this Sample Letter of Engagement had little, if any, relevance to the present analysis. Crucially, the Sample Letter of Engagement also contains a second alternative clause, which provides a suggested template for a lump-sum fee agreement. Reducing Mr Daniel’s submission <span class="font-italic">ad absurdum</span>, any agreement as to costs featuring a lump-sum fee agreement also ought not to constitute a CBA, since the Sample Letter of Engagement also features a lump-sum fee agreement, which would represent a “normal act of engagement”.

It was thus clear that any inference about the requisite specificity of a CBA that was to be drawn from the inclusion of a reference to an agreement as to charge-out rates in the Sample Letter of Engagement was entirely speculative. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 Accordingly, I concluded that the mere fact that a solicitor’s fee agreement contained an agreement as to the charge-out rates of the solicitors involved in the matter should not preclude a possible finding that the fee agreement was a CBA within the meaning of s 111 of the LPA.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The Narrow Objection</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 Having said all that, it was also equally clear to me that not <span class="font-italic">all</span> agreements that provided for agreements as to the charge-out rates of the solicitors in charge of the case would necessarily be considered sufficiently specific to constitute a CBA. As alluded to earlier, the key principle in this regard may be distilled from Wei J’s decision in <span class="font-italic">Chancery Law</span>. I set out once again the material passage (at [64]) for convenient reference as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">It is clear from the above cases that the fee agreements specifying only the rate of charging such as hourly rates run the risk of being found to be insufficiently certain and specific to constitute valid CBAs. <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The CBA in question must make it clear to the client what he is letting himself in for in respect of legal fees</span><span class="font-weight-bold">. </span>Merely setting out an indication or guide as to the rate of charging upon which the bill is to be drawn may not be enough to constitute a CBA that would fall within s 111. As O’Connor LJ commented or impliedly queried in the <span class="font-italic">Chamberlain </span>case …, <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">how is the agreement to be construed as a CBA if it does not set out any plan by which the client can make a reasoned calculation as to what his monthly or quarterly liability might be?</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis in original removed; emphasis added in bold italics] </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">In other words, whether an agreement as to charge-out rates was sufficiently specific to constitute a CBA depended on whether the agreement was specified in sufficiently clear terms so that the client would be in a position to make a reasoned calculation based on the agreement as to what his legal fees would eventually be upon completion of the contentious legal matter. What was to be regarded as sufficiently clear for such purposes would naturally be an intensely fact-specific inquiry.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 Applying this principle to the present facts, I found the Narrow Objection to be without merit. Contrary to Mr Daniel’s submissions, I did not think that the terms of the Engagement Letters were insufficiently specific. While it would certainly be helpful for an agreement as to charge-out rates to also specify either a fixed or a maximum number of hours to be utilised by the solicitor for the scope of work as set out in the agreement, I did not think that these terms were necessary in order for an agreement as to charge-out rates to qualify as a CBA. To my mind, it was sufficient that the Engagement Letters had specified: (a) the specific scope of the matters that were covered under the fee agreement, (b) the solicitors that were assigned to take charge of the conduct of the Suits, (c) the specific charge-out rates of each of the solicitors in charge of the matter, and (d) the fact that the charge-out rates were to be applied to the actual number of hours<span class="font-italic"> </span>utilised by the respective solicitors concerned. I drew this conclusion from both an evaluation of the relevant precedents that had been brought to my attention, as well as my reading of the appropriate remedies that were available to cover instances of overcharging under agreements as to charge-out rates that were to be applied to the actual number of hours utilised.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Survey of relevant precedents regarding specificity of solicitor fee agreements</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 I now direct my mind to a survey of the relevant precedents in this area. We begin with the Singapore High Court decision of <span class="font-italic">Shamsudin</span>, which, as may be recalled, involved a lump-sum fee agreement of S$15,000 (see [60] above). In <span class="font-italic">Shamsudin</span>, Chan JC held that the lump-sum fee agreement<span class="font-italic"> </span>could not pass muster as a sufficiently specific agreement as to costs particularly because it was unclear whether “the fee of [S]$15,000 [was] payable for work done from 2 May 1980 to 20 September 1985 or for any future period and if so, what period”, and whether “the fee of [S]$15,000 include[d] disbursements” (at [14]). <span class="font-italic">Shamsudin </span>thus demonstrated the significance of specifying clearly the scope of matters encompassed by the fee agreement. Comparing the facts of <span class="font-italic">Shamsudin </span>with those of the present case, the deficiencies that plagued the lump-sum fee agreement in <span class="font-italic">Shamsudin </span>clearly did not present themselves within the Engagement Letters. The Engagement Letters clearly specified the scope of SLC’s services at para 4 of each of the Engagement Letters. Paragraph 4.1 of SLC’s standard terms and conditions of engagement also provided that SLC would avoid undertaking any other tasks unless it received further instructions. Further, para 10 made it clear that the charge-out rates did not include disbursements, while para 6.3 specified that Mr Ho had to reimburse SLC for all expenses incurred in the performance of the assignment. See [8]–[10] above. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 Next, in the English Court of Appeal decision of <span class="font-italic">Chamberlain</span>, the claimant applied for the bills of costs issued by his solicitors to be taxed. The solicitors demurred, arguing that the claimant had no right to have them taxed because there had been an agreement in writing between themselves and the claimant that amounted to a CBA within the meaning of s 59 of the English Solicitors Act. The letter, which supposedly encapsulated the CBA, read as follows (at 1444):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Boodle &amp; King will bill you for its services rendered on the basis of the standard hourly rates applicable to the particular attorneys or solicitors involved in the litigation. <span class="font-italic">These rates range from £60 to £80 per hour for</span><span class="font-italic"> lawyers of partner status and from £30 to £45 per hour for associates who may be involved.</span> These standard rates are reviewed for adjustment on a regular basis, ordinarily at the conclusion of the firm’s fiscal year.

First, the agreement in <span class="font-italic">Chamberlain </span>merely provided the charge-out rates that generally applied to the partners or associates in the firm that might be assigned to the matter. In contrast, the Engagement Letters in the present case go out of the way to identify the solicitors that are assigned to take charge of the conduct of the Suits and specify the charge-out rates that corresponded to each assigned solicitor in the following manner:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">3. Ms Lynette Chew, our Director, will be in charge of your matter. She will be assisted by Mr Gadriel Tan and Mr Leonard Chew. From time to time, she may be assisted, as and when necessary, by other lawyers or associates in the law corporation.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">8. As a matter of goodwill, we are pleased to offer you the preferential hourly rates for the lawyers on your matter:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">a. Lynette Chew, Director  S$800 / hour</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">b. Gadriel Tan, Associate Director S$600 / hour</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">c. Leonard Chew, Associate  S$400 / hour</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">Secondly, the agreement in <span class="font-italic">Chamberlain</span> merely provided the <span class="font-italic">ranges </span>of the charge-out rates that could apply to the matter in question. In contrast, the Engagement Letters in the present case, as seen in the above extract, provide clear and discrete charge-out rates for each individual lawyer, leaving no room for any doubt as to the precise charge-out rates that would apply to the conduct of the Suits. Accordingly, while the agreement in <span class="font-italic">Chamberlain</span> was rightly found to be “simply an <span class="font-italic">indication</span> of the rate of charging on which the solicitors propose to make up their bill” [emphasis added], the agreements as to charge-out rates present in the Engagement Letters were significantly more specific, and thus could constitute CBAs.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">71 In the British Columbia Supreme Court decision of <span class="font-italic">Nash v Swann </span>[1994] BCJ No 1824 (“<span class="font-italic">Nash</span>”), the client had engaged the services of the solicitor pursuant to a letter of agreement dated 29 July 1991, which stated as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">I confirm that at our initial meeting I advised you that my hourly rate is [C]$190.00 for all work done on your file, including but not limited to consultations, telephone calls, correspondence, preparing documents and pleadings, research, Court appearances (excluding trial) or negotiating with other lawyers. I further confirm that my fee for trial is [C]$2,050.00 per day. Disbursements (out-of-pocket expenses) are charged separately and will be indicated on my statements of account which will be sent to you at periodic intervals. Time spent independently on the file by my secretary (i.e., matters handled by my secretary which would otherwise have to be performed by me) is billed at the rate of [C]$65.00 per hour. <span class="font-italic">In the event that I am unusually successful, I may charge an additional fee at the time the matter is completed which will be discussed with you at the time of billing</span>. [emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">There were thus four different modes of remuneration that were specified within the letter of agreement, namely, an hourly rate of C$190 for all matters except court appearances for trial, a <span class="font-italic">per diem </span>(<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, daily) rate of C$2,050 for court appearances for trial, an hourly rate of C$65 for matters handled by the secretary, and an additional lump-sum fee for the event where the solicitor was “unusually successful” (“the Unusual Success Fee”). The issue in this case was whether the letter of agreement was “unfair or unreasonable” within the meaning of s 78(9) of the Legal Profession Act, SBC 1987, c 25 (Can) (“the Canadian LPA”), such that the letter of agreement would be liable to be set aside. Whether the letter of agreement constituted a “contract for remuneration to be paid” within the meaning of s 78(1) (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, a CBA), such that the fees were beyond taxation unless the contract was set aside as “unfair or unreasonable” under s 78(9), was strictly speaking not in issue because the impugned solicitor did not assert that the letter of agreement was a CBA (see <span class="font-italic">Nash </span>at [59] and [67]). However, <span class="font-italic">Nash</span> remained instructive because Master Brandreth-Gibbs nevertheless proceeded to conduct a general survey of the attendant legal principles in this regard and proffer his opinion as to whether the letter of agreement was a “contract for remuneration” as defined under s 78(1).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">72 Master Brandreth-Gibbs found that the letter of agreement was <span class="font-italic">not </span>a “contract for remuneration” within the meaning of s 78(1) of the Canadian LPA. Whereas the hourly and <span class="font-italic">per diem </span>rates were not objectionable <span class="font-italic">per se</span>, Master Brandreth-Gibbs determined that it was impermissible for the solicitor’s fee agreement to include the Unusual Success Fee because the latter caused the entire fee agreement to amount to no more than “an agreement to render services at a rate to be fixed later” (<span class="font-italic">Nash </span>at [60]–[61], citing <span class="font-italic">Fiddes v Cowan </span>34 BCLR (2d) 38 at 41 <span class="font-italic">per </span>Spencer J). This resulted in the client having “no way of estimating with any degree of certainty what her exposure in fees would ultimately be, at the time the agreement was made” (<span class="font-italic">Nash </span>at [64], citing <span class="font-italic">DS Moir v Trenciansky </span>[1989] BCJ No 564 <span class="font-italic">per </span>Shaw J). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">73 It was clear to me that the letter of agreement in <span class="font-italic">Nash </span>was found to be insufficiently specific to amount to a CBA, not because it contained hourly or daily charge-out rates, but <span class="font-italic">only</span> because it provided for the Unusual Success Fee. In this respect, not only was the meaning of “unusual success” undefined, but the quantum of the additional fee was also unspecified. The Unusual Success Fee was thus not specified in sufficiently clear terms so that the client would be in a position to make a reasoned calculation based on the agreement as to what her legal fees would eventually be upon completion of her contentious legal matter. Given that the Engagement Letters did not contain such a fee component, they were factually distinguishable from the letter of agreement in <span class="font-italic">Nash</span>, and could be upheld as being sufficiently specific to constitute CBAs. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">74 Next, I was also referred to the case of <span class="font-italic">DM Davidson v Seltzer </span>Vancouver Registry No J820268 (“<span class="font-italic">Seltzer</span>”), which Master Brandreth-Gibbs’ had referred to in <span class="font-italic">Nash </span>(at [64]). In <span class="font-italic">Seltzer</span>, Registrar Turriff held that an agreement whereby the lawyer would be paid a specific hourly rate did <span class="font-italic">not </span>constitute a “contract as to remuneration” because:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">There is nothing in the document which suggests that the parties had agreed about which of them, if either of them, would decide how much of [the solicitor’s] time would be spent</span><span class="font-italic">.</span> <span class="font-italic">Without agreement on that point, or the number of hours that would be spent it could not be said that an agreement about remuneration to be charged had been made</span>. This is so because, on the basis of [the solicitor’s] own document, no amount of fees was calculable at the time the agreement was signed. [emphasis added in italics and bold italics]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">75 Although <span class="font-italic">Seltzer </span>was referred to with approval by Wei J in <span class="font-italic">Chancery Law </span>(at [63]) in the course of his discussion of the <span class="font-italic">Nash</span> decision, I harboured certain reservations about the learned registrar’s observations in <span class="font-italic">Seltzer</span>. In particular, insofar as it was suggested in <span class="font-italic">Selzter</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>as a matter of principle, that an agreement on the number of hours that would be spent had to be reached in order for an agreement as to charge-out rates to amount to a CBA, I disagreed. In my view, it was sufficient for an agreement as to charge-out rates to contain an agreement that the charge-out rates would be applied to the actual time utilised by the solicitor. I considered such an agreement to be specified in sufficiently clear terms so that the client would be in a position to make a reasoned calculation based on the agreement as to what the legal fees would eventually be upon completion of his or her contentious legal matter. And that was indeed what the Engagement Letters in the present case had provided for (at para 6), when it was stated that the legal fees would ultimately be governed by the:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">actual time spent in connection with this matter by the lawyers having conduct of your matter</span>, including the time spent in meetings with you, including any telephone conversations, emails to or from you, letters and others; preparing, reviewing and working on the matter, preparing papers including correspondence; making and receiving telephone calls and others on your behalf; preparing for and attending court on your behalf; travelling and waiting and the overall management of this matter. [emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">76 As for the observation in <span class="font-italic">Seltzer </span>that the fee agreement could not amount to a CBA as it lacked any agreement as to which party would decide how much time the solicitor should allocate to the case, I agreed with the learned registrar in this regard. Indeed, it was on this specific basis that the agreement in <span class="font-italic">Seltzer </span>was one step removed from the Engagement Letters in relation to the specificity of its terms. The agreement as to charge-out rates in <span class="font-italic">Seltzer </span>did not appear to provide for any mechanism to determine the amount of time that the solicitor should spend on the matter. In contrast, pursuant to para 6 of the Engagement Letters as set out above, the costs billed by SLC would ultimately be premised on the <span class="font-italic">actual time spent</span> on the matter by the solicitors in charge, which would clearly be dictated by the total amount of time needed and actually spent by the respective assigned solicitors themselves in order to perform the scope of works as specified in the agreement. This made all the difference because there was now certainty and specificity as to <span class="font-italic">how</span> the total amount of legal fees would be arrived at. <span class="font-italic">Seltzer </span>thus demonstrated the significance of providing in the fee agreement that the charge-out rates specified in the agreement were to be applied to the actual time that the assigned solicitors had in fact spent to handle all the work as specified in the agreement.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">77 Finally, in the English High Court (Senior Courts Costs Office) decision of <span class="font-italic">Addleshaw Goddard</span>, which I had briefly dealt with earlier when addressing the Broad Objection (see [61] above), the engagement letter entered into between the solicitor and the client contained a clause that provided for hourly expense rates for the solicitors whilst reserving the right to increase its rates, and also contained a clause that reserved the right to bring in additional fee earners as work progresses (at [30]). However, the latter clause provided no indication as to the partners’ seniority, skills or disciplines, nor did it provide any information about the grades, rates, seniority or other information about any additional solicitors who might be brought in to handle the matter (at [51]). In spite of the presence of those clauses, the Costs Judge, Master Campbell held that the terms of the engagement letter were still sufficiently certain to constitute a CBA (at [74]). Specifically, Master Campbell pointed out that the clause that reserved the right on behalf of the solicitors to bring in additional fee earners was “not a term that is either uncertain or unreasonable” because it was plain from the evidence that the client had been involved in discussions with his solicitors regarding which personnel to deploy in the case. Finally, Master Campbell even found that the clause that reserved the solicitor’s right to increase his hourly charging rate was not uncertain or unreasonable because the clause was accompanied by the caveat that any changes would be discussed with the client before implementation, and such clauses were in any event ubiquitous in solicitors’ engagement letters. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">78 <span class="font-italic">Addleshaw Goddard </span>thus demonstrated that an agreement as to the charge-out rates of the solicitors to be applied on the actual number of hours used could be regarded as being permissibly specific <span class="font-italic">even if </span>there were clauses that permitted the <span class="font-italic">alteration</span> of the solicitors involved in the matter or of even the charge-out rate of the solicitors, <span class="font-italic">as long as</span> the client had been suitably apprised of those arrangements and there were adequate safeguards in place to protect the interests of the client. But it was unnecessary for me in the present case to endorse unreservedly the conclusion derived from <span class="font-italic">Addleshaw Goddard</span>, given that the terms of the Engagement Letters in the present case did not go quite as far as those of the engagement letters in <span class="font-italic">Addleshaw Goddard</span>. Nevertheless, <span class="font-italic">Addleshaw Goddard</span> was undoubtedly helpful in showing, by way of a more extreme example, that the terms in the Engagement Letters in the present case were certainly not quite as uncertain as Mr Daniel was attempting to make them out to be.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">79 From the foregoing survey of the relevant precedents, it was clear that none of the authorities supported Mr Daniel’s suggestion that an agreement as to charge-out rates had to be accompanied by either the fixed or the maximum number of hours that the solicitors involved would spend on the matter in order to be sufficiently specific. At the end of the day, the only relevant inquiry was whether the fee agreement was specified in sufficiently clear terms so that the client would be in a position to make a reasoned calculation based on the agreement as to what his legal fees would eventually be upon completion of the contentious legal matter. In that regard, I had no doubt that the agreements as to the charge-out rates of SLC’s solicitors in the Engagement Letters that were to be applied to the actual hours spent on the agreed scope of work by the respective solicitors were sufficiently specific to constitute CBAs.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Remedies for overcharging under agreements as to charge-out rates that were to be applied to the actual number of hours utilised</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">80 My finding that an agreement as to charge-out rates was sufficiently specific, especially when the agreement also provided that that charge-out rates were to be applied to the actual number of hours utilised by the solicitors, was also fortified by my reading of the appropriate remedies that an aggrieved client could turn to in the event of overcharging carried out under such agreements. Mr Daniel contended that such agreements as to charge-out rates ought not to be precluded from taxation by dint of being considered sufficiently specific to constitute CBAs, because this would deprive clients like Mr Ho of their fundamental right to have their fees taxed, and they would be left with very limited recourse.

</div>
</div> While there was indeed a veneer of attractiveness to Mr Daniel’s submission, I did not think that it was a principled reason to find that agreements as to charge-out rates cannot be considered CBAs, especially when the agreements also specified that the charge-out rates were to be applied to the actual number of hours utilised. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">81 In the first place, I recognised that it was entirely possible for overcharging to occur even when there had been an agreement as to the solicitor’s charge-out rate. As usefully observed by Chan Sek Keong CJ (delivering the judgment of the Court of Three Judges) in the decision of <span class="font-italic">Law Society of Singapore v Andre Ravindran Saravanapavan Arul </span>[2011] 4 SLR 1184 (“<span class="font-italic">Andre Arul</span>”) at [30]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… where fees are charged on a time basis, overcharging can also occur even where the client has agreed to the tariff of charges … <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">if the number of hours billed for has been inflated or if work unnecessary to achieve the purpose of the retainer has been billed for</span>. This is because <span class="font-italic">while the client has contractually agreed to the tariff of charges, he has not agreed to the number of hours which he may be charged for</span>. … [emphasis added in italics and bold italics] </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">I would supplement Chan CJ’s observations in <span class="font-italic">Andre Arul </span>by adding that overcharging by inflation of the number of hours billed for would typically occur when: (a) the solicitor had dishonestly set out to cheat the client by falsifying the actual number of hours used, or (b) the solicitor had not set out to cheat the client, but had failed to keep proper records of the actual number of hours used and subsequently proceeded to specify or estimate a number of hours larger than the actual number of hours utilised. Also, overcharging might also occur when the actual number of hours utilised had in fact been honestly recorded and presented in the bill, but the solicitor had enlarged the size of the total bill by: (a) deliberately engaging in work unnecessary to achieve the purpose of the retainer (as pointed out by Chan CJ), or (b) taking an unnecessarily long time for the work by failing to act with reasonable due diligence in order to slow down and increase the actual time taken for the work. These were but some examples of factual overcharging that could occur if the bills were based on the actual number of hours utilised, but the solicitor had not been diligent or honest.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">82 One might thus argue that agreements as to charge-out rates ought not to be construed as CBAs because taxation would be precluded by virtue of s 112(4) of the LPA, and this would seriously prejudice clients in instances of overcharging. I acknowledged that a client’s right under s 120 of the LPA to refer his solicitor’s bills to taxation is indeed “a powerful right” because it is “the only judicial process designed specifically to assess and fix the reasonable fees which a solicitor is entitled to charge a client”:<span class="font-italic"> </span><span class="font-italic">Kosui Singapore Pte Ltd v Thangavelu </span>[2015] 5 SLR 722 (“<span class="font-italic">Thangavelu</span>”) at [56]. However, I was similarly mindful of the fact that a client’s <span class="font-italic">prima facie </span>right to have his fees taxed under s 120 was never meant to be absolute, and that one clear, statutorily-defined way in which this right may be given up is if the client enters into a CBA under s 111: <span class="font-italic">Thangavelu </span>at [59]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">83 Also, insofar as it was suggested that taxation is “the client’s <span class="font-italic">only</span> protection against overcharging” [emphasis added] (<span class="font-italic">Thangavelu </span>at [56]), I would disagree. It is true that s 113(1) of the LPA precludes any party to the fee agreement from bringing or instituting any action or suit upon the fee agreement. However, the client who is a victim of overcharging is not completely without recourse. Indeed, “[t]he fact that no action may be maintained in respect of a contentious business agreement … essentially means that all such agreements will have to survive the scrutiny of the court and it reflects the particular jealousy with which the court regards work done in court”: Tan Yock Lin, <span class="font-italic">The Law of Advocates and Solicitors in Singapore and West Malaysia </span>(Butterworths Asia, 2nd Ed, 1998) at p 691, cited in <span class="font-italic">Wong Foong Chai v Lin Kuo Hao </span>[2005] 3 SLR(R) 74 at [29] <span class="font-italic">per </span>Andrew Phang Boon Leong JC (as he then was). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">84 One obvious remedy would be for the aggrieved client to <span class="font-italic">not</span> pay any amount reflected in the bill of costs issued by the solicitor, and proceed to apply pursuant to s 113(2) of the LPA for a declaration under s 113(4) that the fee agreement is void on the grounds that “the terms of the agreement are deemed by the court or Judge to be unfair or unreasonable”, whereupon the court would then have the discretion under s 113(5) to direct the impugned bill to be sent for taxation: <span class="font-italic">Lin Jian Wei and another v Lim Eng Hock Peter </span>[2011] 3 SLR 1052 at [26]; see also <span class="font-italic">Andre Arul </span>at [29]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">85 It might be contended that where there was an agreement as to charge-out rates that were to be applied to the actual number of hours utilised, it would <span class="font-italic">not</span> be open to the court to declare the fee agreement void under s 113(4) of the LPA when the solicitor has been accused of overcharging (using the methods stated at [81] above) because the “terms” of this fee agreement <span class="font-italic">per se </span>were not in fact unfair or unreasonable. I disagreed for the following two reasons: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) First, “reasonableness” in the context of s 113(4) has been defined as being “not excessive in relation to the amount of work done, taking into account the nature of the work, the duration of his [or her] work, the standing of the solicitor concerned, and also the range of fees payable in a High Court action” (<span class="font-italic">Shamsudin </span>at [28] and [33]). From the foregoing definition, it seemed clear to me that the instances of overcharging described earlier (at [81] above) were precisely the type of misconduct that fell squarely within the ambit of s 113(4). Any overcharging by inflating the actual number of hours utilised or engaging in unnecessary work or slowing down the work to increase the actual number of hours utilised would thus fall afoul of the “reasonableness” requirement under s 113(4). </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Secondly, “the terms of the agreement” as provided for under s 113(4) of the LPA ought to be read broadly when the fee agreement concerned was an agreement as to charge-out rates, so as to encompass a review of how the solicitor had in fact utilised his time on the agreed scope of work to be done by him. This was because s 113(4) was clearly meant to be read in concert with s 113(2), which provides that the court may examine and determine every “question respecting the validity or <span class="font-italic">effect</span> of the agreement” [emphasis added]. Hence, considerations of the <span class="font-italic">effect</span> of an agreement as to charge-out rates that were to be applied to the actual number of hours utilised should, in turn, naturally encompass considerations of how the actual number of hours utilised were arrived at by the solicitor based on the agreed scope of work.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">86 Having said that, even if the aggrieved client <span class="font-italic">has</span> paid the amount under the fee agreement, he or she would still not be without further recourse. The next option open to the aggrieved client would be for him or her to apply pursuant to s 113(7) of the LPA, within 12 months after making payment under the fee agreement, for the court to reopen the fee agreement, order the fees to be taxed, and order the amount that has been paid to be repaid to the client, provided he or she is able to prove that there are “special circumstances” within the meaning of s 113(7). In respect of what kind of circumstances would be considered sufficiently “special” to justify reopening the fee agreement and sending it for taxation, it is well established that there is no rigid rule, and it is for the court to determine on the facts of each case whether there are special circumstances that make it right to reopen the fee agreement: <span class="font-italic">Wee Harry Lee v Haw Par Brothers International Ltd </span>[1979-1980] SLR(R) 603 at [15], cited in <span class="font-italic">Thangavelu </span>at [61] and <span class="font-italic">Sports Connection Pte Ltd v Asia Law Corp and another </span>[2010] 4 SLR 590 at [31] (in the context of defining what kind of circumstances are sufficiently special to justify taxation of a solicitor’s bill under s 122 of the LPA). I would also note at this point that given that a disciplinary committee’s finding that the solicitor had in fact overcharged has been regarded as one of the circumstances that satisfies the “special circumstances” requirement (<span class="font-italic">Thangavelu </span>at [61(b)], citing <span class="font-italic">Ho Cheng Lay v Low Yong Sen </span>[2009] 3 SLR(R) 206 at [5]), it would to my mind be prudent for the aggrieved client to, alongside the s 113(7) application, lodge a complaint with the Law Society of Singapore regarding alleged overcharging by the solicitor in question in breach of rules 17(7) and 17(8) of the Legal Profession (Professional Conduct Rules) 2015 (S 706/2015).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">87 In the final analysis, I found this contention by Mr Daniel on behalf of Mr Ho – that the risk of overcharging should preclude me from construing an agreement on a charge-out rate to be applied to the actual hours utilised for the agreed scope of work as a CBA within the meaning of s 111 of the LPA – to be a specious one. The various options that an aggrieved client could avail himself or herself of in the face of an incident of overcharging by his or her solicitor showed that there were, in my view, sufficient safeguards against overcharging for agreements as to charge-out rates to be applied on the actual number of hours utilised by the solicitor on the scope of work as agreed. This was thus another ground on which I rejected the Narrow Objection advanced by Mr Daniel.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">88 For the reasons aforesaid, I found that the Engagement Letters were CBAs within the meaning of s 111 of the LPA, such that the bills of costs in question were precluded under s 112(4) from being sent for taxation. In the result, I dismissed the taxation application, with costs fixed at $6,500 (inclusive of disbursements) to be paid by Mr Ho to MLS.</div><div class="Judg-Sign text-left">Chan Seng Onn<br/>Judge</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Christopher Anand s/o Daniel and Arlene Foo Li Chuan (Advocatus Law LLP) for the plaintiff;<br/>Tan Gim Hai, Adrian and Lu Huiru, Grace (Morgan Lewis Stamford LLC) for the defendant.</div><div class="Judg-EOF text-left"></div><div class="HN-CaseName text-left font-weight-bold"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
