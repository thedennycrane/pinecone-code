<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       This
was an appeal against the decision of the High Court judge (“the Judge”)
in Originating Summons No 118 of 2011 (“the Singapore Action”): see <em>SetClear Pte Ltd and others v Ashlock William Grover</em> [2011] SGHC 130 (“the
GD”) where he ruled in favour of the plaintiffs on the construction
of an agreement and in consequence thereof he issued an anti-suit
injunction against the defendant. In the Singapore Action, William
Grover Ashlock (“the Appellant”) was the defendant while SetClear
Pte Ltd, CLSA Limited, SetClear Inc, Credit Agricole Securities
(USA) Inc (Formerly known as Caylon Securities (USA) Inc) and IX
Net Holding Limited (individually the “1<sup>st</sup> Respondent”,
“2<sup>nd</sup> Respondent”, “3<sup>rd</sup> Respondent”,
“4<sup>th</sup> Respondent” and the “5<sup>th</sup> Respondent”
respectively, and collectively “the Respondents”) were the plaintiffs.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The
appeal was heard on 24 October 2011. After hearing submissions of
the parties, we dismissed the appeal with costs. We now give the
grounds for our decision.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The background to the dispute</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       In
August 2005, the Appellant, together with one Jonathan Slone (“Slone”),
were  the co-founders of a start-up business operated in New York
by the 5<sup>th</sup> Respondent. Although Slone
and the Appellant each initially held 50% of the equity shares in
the 5<sup>th</sup> Respondent, their equity shareholding
was, for reasons which were immaterial to this appeal, subsequently
diluted and agreed to be not less than 4% each (“the Founder’s Equity”
or, interchangeably, “the founder benefits”).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> The 2<sup>nd</sup> Respondent subsequently
invested in the 5<sup>th</sup> Respondent’s business
on terms that Slone would be in the 2<sup>nd</sup> Respondent’s
employment while at the same time retaining his equity shares in
the 5<sup>th</sup> Respondent.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       In
March 2006, the Appellant was designated as Chief Operating Officer
of the 5<sup>th</sup> Respondent and concurrently
seconded to the 4<sup>th</sup> Respondent in New
York.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span> In a letter from
the 1<sup>st</sup> Respondent dated 10 May 2007,
the Appellant was offered to come under the employment of the 1<sup>st</sup> Respondent.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span> The Appellant accepted the
offer, as a result of which the Appellant re-located to Singapore
but continued to shuttle between Singapore and New York from time
to time. One of the provisions in the said letter stated:</p>
<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2" colsep="1" frame="none" rowsep="1"><colgroup><col width="30%"/><col width="70%"/></colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top">
<p align="justify" class="QuoteList-Table-1">Founder Status:</p>
</td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top">
<p align="justify" class="QuoteList-Table-1">In
light of your [<em>ie</em>, the Appellant’s]
effort and contribution to the initial set up and establishment of
the [1<sup>st</sup> Respondent], you will be recognised
as one of its founders and be eligible for consideration for additional
“founder” benefits, if any, subject to negotiation with Bloomberg
Tradebook. and on terms to be mutually agreed between you and the [1<sup>st</sup> Respondent].</p>
</td></tr></tbody></table><br clear="left"/><br clear="left"/>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       In
his first affidavit filed in the Singapore Action, the Appellant averred
that the provision for “Founder Status” in the letter served to reiterate
his original entitlement to the Founder’s Equity.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span> The Respondents,
however, claimed that no agreement was reached or even alleged to
be reached between the Appellant and the 1<sup>st</sup> Respondent
as to the founder benefits.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_5" id="Ftn_5_1"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       In
or around late June 2008, the Appellant was put on a few weeks’ “leave”
after a disagreement arose between him and Slone on certain plans regarding
the 1<sup>st</sup> Respondent’s business. On 17 July
2008, while the Appellant was on “leave”, he was asked to meet one
Mr Laurie James Young (“Young”) who was then Acting on behalf of
the 1<sup>st</sup> Respondent. At the meeting, the
Appellant and Young signed an agreement providing for the cessation
of the Appellant’s employment with the 1<sup>st</sup> Respondent
(“the 17 July 2008 Agreement”).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_6" id="Ftn_6_1"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span> Clause 14
of the 17 July 2008 Agreement (“cl 14”) provided as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-Heading1">

</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">By signing this letter and accepting the abovementioned payments,
this represents full and final settlement of all and any claims
against [the 1<sup>st</sup> Respondent] and its
affiliated companies.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Additionally, it confirms that you [<em>ie</em>, the Appellant] agree not to pursue
any future claim against [the 1<sup>st</sup> Respondent]
and its affiliated companies.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       Subsequent
to the signing of the 17 July 2008 Agreement, the Appellant sent
an email to Young on the same date stating:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_7" id="Ftn_7_1"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Laurie,</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I want to go on record with you that it
is my understanding that by signing the resignation agreement today
that I am Acting in good faith that a subsequent agreement will
be reached in terms of my resignation with CLSA and insurance for

that Section 14 does not preclude an agreement or possible Actions should
we not be able to reach an agreement. Please let me know if this understanding
differs from yours.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Regards,</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Bill</p>

Appellant subsequently reaffirmed the terms and conditions set out
in the 17 July 2008 Agreement by signing two letters (dated 9 October 2008

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     On
20 January 2010, the Appellant commenced proceedings (“the American
Action”) against the Respondents and Slone in the United States District
Court, Southern District of New York (“the New York court”) claiming
“violations of New York State Labor Laws, breach of contract, breach
of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, unjust enrichment,
quantum meruit, breach of fiduciary duty, promissory estoppel, constructive
trust, and for an Accounting”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_12" id="Ftn_12_1"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span> Essentially,
the American Action was brought to seek relief in respect of the

17 February 2011, the Respondents commenced the Singapore Action
with the following prayers:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_13" id="Ftn_13_1"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span></p>

Judge further clarified that “[f]or the avoidance of doubt, nothing
in these orders prohibits the [Appellant] from commencing or continuing
any Action against Jonathan Slone”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_15" id="Ftn_15_1"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span> As
a result of the Judge’s decision, the Appellant was restrained from
continuing the American Action or commencing any further or other
proceedings in the United States of America or elsewhere against
the Respondents in respect of the founder benefits. Dissatisfied
with the Judge’s decision, the Appellant appealed.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The decision below</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     In
the GD, the Judge dealt mainly with the issue of whether cl 14 should
be construed to mean that the Appellant had agreed thereunder not to
pursue any  claims in the future against the Respondents, including
the Appellant’s claim for the founder benefits in the American Action.
The Judge held that the terms of cl 14 were simple and clear and
that under it the parties had effected a full and final settlement
of all claims by the Appellant against the Respondents. As such,
the former was not entitled to commence or continue with the American
Action against the latter (see <a href="#p1_36">[36]</a> of
the GD). Following from the construction which the Judge had placed
on cl 14, and as the Appellant had submitted to the jurisdiction
of the Singapore courts, the Judge held that in those circumstances
an anti-suit injunction should, generally speaking, be granted to
enforce cl 14.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The issues on appeal</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     The
Appellant relied on two main grounds in his appeal. First, the Appellant
contended that the Judge erred in his construction of cl 14. In particular,
the Appellant argued that:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_16" id="Ftn_16_1"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Readin the context of the [17 July 2008
Agreement] as a whole, the reference in clause 14 is obviously only
to claims arising from the employment relationship between the Appellant
and the 1<sup>st</sup> Respondent. Where clause
14 was intended to benefit more than just the 1<sup>st</sup> Respondent,
this was made clear by the express reference to the 1<sup>st</sup> Respondent’s
affiliated companies. If it was intended by the parties that clause
14 should have effect in respect of all claims, whether arising
from the Appellant’s employment relationship or not, the parties
would have so provided in clear terms, as they did in respect of
the parties who are entitled to rely on clause 14.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     Second,
the Appellant argued that given that the ultimate relief sought by
the Respondents in the Singapore Action was Actually an anti-suit injunction,
the Judge was wrong to begin his analysis of the matter with a determination
on the <em>substantive</em> reliefs prayed
for by the Respondents in the Singapore Action (see <a href="#p1_11">[11]</a> above). Instead, the Judge
in his analysis ought to have first directed his mind to the private
international law principles applicable in respect of interlocutory
anti-suit injunctions in the present case. This, the Appellant contended,
would lead to a result that is different from that arrived at by
the Judge in his decision. He also asserted that besides cl 14,
the Judge should also have considered other relevant factors, <em>eg</em>, the New York court was the natural
forum for the dispute; while the Appellant’s employment contract
provided for jurisdiction before the Singapore courts, it was expressly
stated to be non-exclusive; the 3<sup>rd</sup> and
4<sup>th</sup> Respondents had submitted to the
jurisdiction of the New York court; and the delay in the institution
of the Singapore Action and the failure of the Respondents to apply
for a stay of the American Action, was contrary to international
comity.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     In
light of the arguments raised by the Appellant, the issues in the appeal
were essentially twofold:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_16-p2_a"></a>(a)     Whether
the Judge erred in his construction of cl 14; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_16-p2_b"></a>(b)     Whether
the Judge was wrong to determine the case before him on its merits
first before concluding as a matter of consequence that an anti-suit
injunction was justified.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The decision</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Interpretation of cl 14 </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     Mr Kelvin
Tan (“Mr Tan”), Acting for the Appellant, raised a preliminary point
in his written submissions that cl 14 was not apt for summary determination.
In particular, he contended that cl 14:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_17" id="Ftn_17_1"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... cannot be properly interpreted summarily
in an originating summons and needs to be interpreted at a full
trial having regard to the full evidence surrounding the making
of the Agreement and the parties’ conduct. Given that the Agreement
has been long pleaded as a defence in the [American Action], the
interpretation of clause 14 ought to be tried in the [American Action].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     He
further argued that cl 14 was not free of ambiguity such that it
was apt for summary determination in the Singapore Action which
was commenced by way of an originating summons. In that vein, Mr Tan
also pointed out that the preamble of the 17 July 2008 Agreement
referred to the cessation of the Appellant’s employment without
any reference to the founder benefits. The preamble read:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_18" id="Ftn_18_1"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a></span></p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     Mr Tan
then drew our attention to the closing words of the 17 July 2008
Agreement which only referred to the termination of the Appellant’s employment
and payments associated thereof, without reference to the founder
benefits. This, he claimed, further demonstrated that the parties
in signing the 17 July 2008 Agreement had not intended the scope
of cl 14 to be as wide as the Respondents contended it to be. He
underscored the following closing words:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_19" id="Ftn_19_1"><sup>[note: 19]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In acknowledgement of the above <em>termination and associated payments</em>, please
sign the duplicate of this letter and return to me.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     Mr Tan
also alluded to the factual matrix leading up to, and subsequent
to, the signing of the 17 July 2008 Agreement which he claimed rendered
a summary determination of the construction of cl 14 in the Singapore
Action inapt. Accordingly, he argued that cl 14 ought to be determined
at a full trial in the American Action instead. In his written submissions
he stated:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_20" id="Ftn_20_1"><sup>[note: 20]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">68.</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">In the present case, it is submitted that this Honourable
Court should give due consideration to the matrix of facts leading
up to and subsequent to the signing of the termination agreement.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">69.</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">The first set of relevant facts relates
to the circumstances in which the Appellant became involved in the
business. In particular, the Appellant had only agreed to establish
the start-up with Slone if he was given equal equity participation
by way of the Founder’s Equity. Subsequently, even when the Appellant
entered into an employment relationship with the 5<sup>th</sup> Respondent,
the Appellant continued to maintain an equity interest in the business.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">70.</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">Despite the Appellant’s subsequent
entry into contracts of employment, the Appellant’s Founder’s Equity
remained separate and distinct from his employment relationships
with the 5<sup>th</sup> Respondent and subsequently
the 4<sup>th</sup> and 1<sup>st</sup> Respondents.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">71.</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">Secondly, it is important to consider
the circumstances leading to the 17 July 2008 meeting when the Agreement
was entered into. The Appellant was on “leave” since his disagreement
with Slone and received a call from Young, who works for the Human
Resources Department of the 2<sup>nd</sup> Respondent,
requesting for the meeting. It was only natural for the Appellant
to assume that this meeting concerned his employment with the 1<sup>st</sup> Respondent.
Therefore, the Appellant signed the Agreement, believing that it
was applied to the termination of his employment, and not his Founder’s
Equity.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">72.</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">Thirdly, consideration should be given
to the fact that the discussions between the Appellant and Young,
during the time of the signing of the Agreement itself or over the
course of the 6-month long e-mail, did not indicate that the Appellant’s
claim for his Founder’s Equity was to be subsumed within the ambit
of clause 14.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">73.</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">For the above reasons, it is respectfully submitted that there
are real and substantial questions of law and fact in respect of
whether clause 14 of the Agreement provides a defence to the Appellant’s
claim or whether the Agreement only pertains to the Appellant’s
employment relationship with the 1<sup>st</sup> Respondent.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     On
the other hand, counsel for the Respondents, Mr Alvin Yeo SC, argued
that the Judge was correct in interpreting cl 14 in the way he did
and in holding that it precluded the Appellant from continuing the
American Action and/or commencing any further or other proceedings
in the United States of America or elsewhere against the Respondents.
The primary basis for Mr Yeo’s case for the Respondents lay in the
words “full and final settlement of <em>all and
any claims</em>” and “not to pursue <em>any
future claim</em> against SetClear Pte Ltd and its affiliated
companies” [emphasis added] in cl 14 which undoubtedly indicated
that the Appellant’s alleged entitlement to the founder benefits
was within the knowledge of the 1<sup>st</sup> Respondent<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_21" id="Ftn_21_1"><sup>[note: 21]</sup></a></span> when setting out cl 14. This, among
other things, Mr Yeo reasoned, demonstrated that the parties had
unambiguously contemplated and intended cl 14 of to “achieve finality
in settling all claims which the Appellant had or may have against
the Respondents” which would naturally include the Appellant’s claim
for the founder benefits.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_22" id="Ftn_22_1"><sup>[note: 22]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     We
do not propose to belabour what is very much a straightforward point.
Contrary to the Appellant’s submission, we agreed with the Respondents
that cl 14 was not ambiguous. On a plain reading of cl 14, it could
not have been clearer that it provided for the full and final settlement of
all and any of the Appellant’s claims, future or existing, against
the Respondents. This would include whatever claims the Appellant
might have against each of the Respondents, irrespective of their
nature. Another significant factor which was incompatible with the
submission of the Appellant was that if it was indeed the case that
cl 14 was concerned only with his entitlement or benefits in relation
to his employment – and here we would note that his employment was
with the 1<sup>st</sup> Respondent – why would it
also cover “all and any claims” he might have against the other Respondents?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     It
seemed to us clear that the “matrix of facts” which Mr Tan had sought
to rely in support of the Appellant’s case principally pertained
to the Appellant’s subjective belief as to the Actual ambit of cl 14
(see <a href="#p1_20">[20]</a> above). As rightly
pointed out by Mr Yeo, a court in undertaking a contextual approach
in the construction of a contract “does not inquire into the parties’
subjective states of mind but makes an objective judgment based
on the materials already identified”:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_23" id="Ftn_23_1"><sup>[note: 23]</sup></a></span> see <em>Bank
of Credit and Commerce International SA v Ali and others</em> [2002]
1 AC 251 at 258. The “matrix of facts” brought up by Mr Tan were,
therefore, for the most part irrelevant. In the result, we did not
see any merit in the Appellant’s contention that a summary determination
on the ambit of cl 14 in the Singapore Action was inapt.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     Accordingly,
we agreed with the Judge that this was a proper case for summary
determination and that there was really nothing to go for trial.
In passing, we would only add that, while generally subsequent conduct should
not be relied upon to construe a document, in this case the Appellant’s
acceptance of the two letters (see <a href="#p1_8">[8]</a>-<a href="#p1_9">[9]</a> above) certainly confirmed what,
in our view, was the correct construction of cl 14.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The propriety of the Judge’s
approach in deciding the Singapore Action</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     We
now turn to consider the second issue. It was true that the Judge first
determined the case before him on its merits before holding that,
in consequence, an anti-suit injunction should be granted. To better appreciate
the approach of the Judge, we set out his reasoning below (see [41]-[42]
of the GD):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">41    In
the present case, [the Appellant] had agreed under cl 14 not to pursue
any future claim against the [1<sup>st</sup> Respondent]
and its affiliated companies. This was a consequence of the full
and final settlement of all his claims... Moreover, the cases which
[counsel for the Appellant] relied on were cases in which the court
was asked to grant an interlocutory anti-suit injunction to restrain
a party from proceeding with a foreign Action pending the outcome
of the proceedings in the jurisdiction from which the injunction was
sought. In the case before me, the plaintiffs [<em>ie</em>,
the Respondents] were not seeking an interlocutory anti-suit injunction
but a permanent one on the premise that the court would be able
to and would make a finding in their favour on the interpretation
of cl 14.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">42    I agreed with [counsel for the Respondents]
that if I were to interpret cl 14 in the [Respondents’] favour,
then an anti-suit injunction ought, generally speaking, to be granted
to enforce my ruling since [the Appellant] had submitted to the
jurisdiction of the Singapore courts. Indeed he is currently working
in Singapore. The general rule is subject to [the Appellant] showing
a special or exceptional reason why the injunction should not be granted.
No such reason was shown. All [counsel for the Appellant] could
say was that the American Action was at an advanced stage but that
was no reason to allow [the Appellant] to continue with it once
a final ruling was given by a competent court whose jurisdiction
he had submitted to. In the light of my ruling on the interpretation
of cl 14, the American Action against the [Respondents] was both
in breach of cl 14 and vexatious and oppressive.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     Clearly,
the Appellant had submitted to the jurisdiction of the Singapore
courts. The Appellant could have, but did not make any application
for a stay of the Singapore Action. Instead, he was content to enter
his appearance unconditionally and defend the Singapore Action in the
hearing before the Judge. Coupled with the fact that the Respondents did
not make any application for an <em>interlocutory</em> anti-suit
injunction pending the final determination of the substantive matters
engendered by the Singapore Action, this showed that the Judge was
merely dealing with the Singapore Action as per the manner it was
pleaded and contended by the Respondents.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     Indeed,
there would have been little difficulty for this court to accept the
Appellant’s complaint if the Respondents had Actually applied for
an <em>interlocutory</em> anti-suit injunction
while the determination on the merits of the Singapore Action was
still pending. This is illustrated by the Australian case of <em>CSR Ltd v Cigna Insurance Australia Ltd</em> (1997)
71 ALJR 1143 (HCA) (“<em>CSR Ltd v Cigna Insurance
Australia Ltd</em>”), where the appellants had sued their
insurers, the respondents, in the United States of America claiming
indemnity in respect of certain third-party asbestos claims brought
against the appellants in the United States of America. In response, the
respondents commenced proceedings in New South Wales against the appellants
seeking, <em>inter alia</em>, (a) negative
substantive declarations to the effect that the respondents were
not liable to indemnify the appellants, and (b) permanent anti-suit
injunctions restraining the appellants from taking further steps
in the American proceedings. However, the respondents later sought
an interlocutory anti-suit injunction when the appellants applied
for a stay of the New South Wales proceedings subsequently. It was
against such a backdrop that the High Court of Australia decided
the appeal applying the legal principles governing the grant of
interlocutory anti-suit injunctions. However, in the present case,
the Respondents had not applied for an interlocutory anti-suit injunction
pending the determination of the Singapore Action.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     In
this regard, we would cite the following two passages from Steven Gee
QC, <em>Commercial Injunctions</em> (Sweet
&amp; Maxwell, 5<sup>th</sup><sup></sup>Ed,
2004) at p 416 to show that the approach taken by the Judge is correct:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<em>The English [ie, domestic]
court may grant an injunction to prevent a party bound by the res
judicata or issue estoppel effect of an English judgment relitigating
the underlying dispute or issue abroad.</em> This extends
to litigating abroad matters which could and should have been litigated
as part of the original Action. <em>Granting an
anti-suit injunction for this purpose both forwards an important
English public policy of preventing collateral attack on a final
judgment by a disappointed litigant, and gives effect to a substantive right
not to be sued which has been created by the relevant judgment.
This is very different from an alternative forum case where the
English court has not yet rendered a judgment on the merits.</em> On
the other hand in <em>E.D. &amp; F Man (Sugar)
Ltd v Haryanto (No. 2)</em> the public policy was not so strong
as to justify an injunction against a party relying in any court
worldwide upon a foreign judgment which was inconsistent with an
English one. The granting of a declaration established the position
in English law, whereas a worldwide injunction would have been an
illegitimate intrusion on the processes of courts throughout the
world.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The application can be made by application
notice issued in the original proceedings. This is because <em>the purpose of the anti-suit injunction is in effect to
uphold and enforce the judgment given in the Action. Proceedings
to do this are within the scope of the original Action for which
both parties have submitted to the English jurisdiction</em>.
A Mareva injunction in aid of execution would be a matter within
the scope of the proceedings in which a final judgment had been
obtained and this can be sought by application in those proceedings.
It is not necessary to bring separate proceedings for the purpose of
enforcing the judgment or obtaining relief in aid of execution. <em>Likewise where the purpose of the injunction is to
prevent litigation abroad of a point covered by that judgment</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added; footnotes omitted]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     It
is also apposite to note that there is nothing irregular or improper in
the Respondents commencing the Singapore Action seeking (as an alternative
strategy to an outright anti-suit injunction application) a negative
declaration of non-liability which in turn could lead to the grant
of an anti-suit injunction in accordance with the views expressed
in the passages quoted above. In <em>Halsbury’s
Laws of Singapore vol </em>6(2) (Butterworths Asia, 2009)
at para 75.140, it is stated:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Another alternative strategy is to pre-empt
the foreign judgment by obtaining a judgment (usually a declaration
of non-liability) in another forum which will be recognised under
the law of the enforcing forum as creating a <em>res
judicata</em> effect between the parties.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     In
the present case, the Respondents commenced the Singapore Action <em>after</em> the Appellant instituted proceedings
in the American Action which was still pending final determination
in the United States (see <a href="#p1_10">[10]</a>-<a href="#p1_11">[11]</a> above). Despite this, not only
did the Appellant fail to take steps to challenge the local court’s
jurisdiction in the Singapore Action, he had made a conscious decision
to participate in the hearing of the Singapore Action before the
Judge. As observed earlier, the Appellant had chosen to resist the
Singapore Action on the substantive and not the jurisdictional front
despite the fact that he could have pursued the latter course (see <a href="#p1_26">[26]</a> above). It was not in dispute
that the Appellant had not taken out any stay of proceedings application
in relation to the Singapore Action.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     In
our judgment, parties to a dispute who have entered into parallel proceedings
in more than one national court take the risk of being bound by
the decision of the court which first renders its decision and,
subject to the rules on the doctrine of <em>res
judicata</em>, being barred by way of a permanent anti-suit
injunction from prosecuting further any pending proceedings in the
other national courts once that decision is rendered. This is so
regardless of whether the decision of the deciding court is appealable
under the laws of that country. In such a situation, the parties can
only either seek recourse via appellate review of the deciding court’s decision
in that country or continue to be bound by the deciding court’s ruling
on the dispute. It would be highly unsatisfactory if the position
were to be otherwise as that would effectively spell no conclusive
end to the resolution of disputes between parties embroiled in parallel
proceedings in more than one national court.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The grant of the anti-suit injunction
following the Judge’s construction of cl 14</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     Following
from the above, it seemed to us entirely logical for the Judge,
after holding that cl 14 did preclude the Appellant from claiming against
the Respondents for the founder benefits, to proceed to grant the anti-suit
injunction in the present case.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     At
[40] of the GD, the Judge applied his mind to the principles applicable
to the grant of anti-suit injunctions, having regard to the case
of <em>John Reginald Stott Kirkham and others v
Trane US Inc and others</em> [2009] 4 SLR(R) 428 (“<em>John Reginald Stott Kirkham</em>”) and other
cases cited therein. The fact that the Judge was conscious of those
principles can be found in [42] of the GD where some considerations,
reminiscent of those highlighted in what may be considered the <em>locus classicus</em> on anti-suit injunctions
(<em>ie</em>, <em>Société
Nationale Industrielle Aérospatiale v Lee Kui Jak</em> [1987] AC 871), could
be detected:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">42    I
agreed with [counsel for the Respondents] that if I were to interpret cl 14
in the [Respondents’] favour, then an anti-suit injunction ought, generally
speaking, to be granted to enforce my ruling since [the Appellant] had
submitted to the jurisdiction of the Singapore courts. Indeed he
is currently working in Singapore. The general rule is subject to
[the Appellant] showing a special or exceptional reason why the
injunction should not be granted. No such reason was shown. All
[counsel for the Appellant] could say was that <em>the
American Action was at an advanced stage</em> but that was
no reason to allow [the Appellant] to continue with it once a final
ruling was given by a competent court whose jurisdiction he had
submitted to. In the light of my ruling on the interpretation of
cl 14, the American Action against the [Respondents] was both in
breach of cl 14 and <em>vexatious and oppressive</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     The
question that remained was therefore whether there were any other
reasons or grounds upon which the Judge should, nevertheless, not have
exercised his discretion to grant the anti-suit injunction after
deciding on the merits in respect of cl 14.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     One
of the trite principles as regards <em>interlocutory</em> anti-suit
injunction is that the court’s jurisdiction in respect of such remedies
should only be exercised sparingly and with great caution: see <em>Halsbury’s Laws of England vol </em>2 (LexisNexis,
5<sup>th</sup> Ed, 2008) p 938 at para 1224; <em>Dicey, Morris and Collins on the Conflict of Laws
vol </em>1 (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 14<sup>th</sup> Ed,
2006) at pp 502-7. However, the principles governing <em>interlocutory</em> anti-suit injunctions do not
apply unmodified to cases where a permanent injunction is sought
after a judgment on the merits. In <em>National
Westminster Bank plc v Utrecht-America Finance Co</em> [2001]
CLC 1372, the plaintiff in an Action in England complained, <em>inter alia</em>, that the defendant had initiated
proceedings in California in breach of a contract (<em>ie</em>,
there was no alleged breach of an arbitration agreement or any jurisdiction
clause). The judge at first instance made an order restraining the
proceedings brought by the defendant in California. The defendant’s
appeal to the English Court of Appeal was dismissed. In dismissing
the appeal, Clarke LJ (with whom Laws and Aldous LJJ agreed) stated
(at <a href="#p1_29">[29]</a>-<a href="#p1_35">[35]</a>) the following which is necessary
to be quoted at length:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[After setting out the principles that
apply to the grant of <em>interlocutory</em> anti-suit
injunctions]</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">29.    I
accept that those are among the considerations which are relevant
to the question whether an injunction should be granted at an interlocutory stage.
I am also conscious of the principle stated by the Supreme Court
of Canada in <em>Amchem Products Inc v British
Columbia (Workers Compensation Board)</em> [1993] 1 SCR 897,
which was quoted with approval by Lord Goff in the Airbus Industrie
case at p. 713; 139:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">‘… the domestic court as a matter of comity
must take cognisance of the fact that the foreign court has assumed
jurisdiction. If, applying the principles relating to forum non
conveniens … the foreign court could reasonably have concluded that
there was no alternative forum that was clearly more appropriate,
the domestic court should respect that decision and the application
should be dismissed.’</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">30.    
              <em>It is common ground that those principles require
significant modification where the foreign proceedings are brought
in breach of an English jurisdiction clause because the English
court will readily grant an injunction restraining a party from
commencing or continuing foreign proceedings which are in breach
of contract</em>: see e.g. <em>Continental
Bank NA v Aeakos Compania Naviera SA</em> [1994] 1 WLR 588, <em>The Angelic Grace</em> [1995] 1 Ll Rep 87 and <em>Donohue v Armco Inc</em> [2000] CLC 1090. Mr Brindle
submitted that those principles have no application here because
the TOA does not contain an exclusive jurisdiction clause.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">31.    
              <em>Equally, in my
opinion, the principles identified above require significant modification
in a case where a permanent injunction is sought after a judgment
on the merits. If the English court gives judgment for the claimant on
the merits and the judgment includes a declaration that the defendant
has brought foreign proceedings in breach of contract, and it is
asked to exercise its equitable jurisdiction to grant a permanent
injunction to restrain a continued breach of contract by further
pursuing such foreign proceedings, different considerations arise
from those which arise at an interlocutory stage.</em>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">32.    
              <em>Indeed it seems
to me that the principles which then become applicable are very
similar to those which apply in the case where an interlocutory judgment
is sought on the ground that the foreign proceedings are in breach
of contract. The relevant principles in that class of case can be
seen from the judgments in The Angelic Grace [1995] 1 Ll Rep 87.
Although that was a case in which the clause provided for arbitration
in London and not for the exclusive jurisdiction of the English
courts, it is plain that the same principles apply to both classes
of case.</em> Thus in <em>The Angelic Grace</em> Leggatt
LJ (at p. 94) followed this statement of principle from the judgment
of Steyn LJ in <em>Continental Bank NA v Aeakos
Compania Naviera SA</em> (as reported in [1994] 1 Ll Rep 505 at
p. 512 — where the report is more accurate than in the WLR):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">‘In our view the decisive matter is that
the bank applied for the injunction to restrain the defendants'
clear breach of contract. In the circumstances, a claim for damages
for breach of contract would be a relatively ineffective remedy
for the defendants' breach of contract. If the injunction is set
aside, the defendants will persist in their breach of contract,
and the bank's legal rights as enshrined in the jurisdiction agreements
will prove to be valueless. Given the total absence of special countervailing
factors, this is the paradigm case for the grant of an injunction
restraining a party from Acting in breach of an exclusive jurisdiction
agreement. In our judgment the continuance of the Greek proceedings
amounts to vexatious and oppressive conduct on the part of the defendants.
The judge exercised his discretion properly.’</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">33.    In <em>The Angelic Grace</em> this court rejected
in robust terms the argument that the grant of an injunction to
restrain foreign proceedings which were in clear breach of contract
would offend against comity. It did so on the basis that it is vexatious
and oppressive for a party to maintain proceedings in breach of
its agreement not to do so: see e.g. per Leggatt LJ at p. 96. Millett
LJ expressed his views in the following passages (at p. 86) which
have been much quoted since:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">‘<em>In my judgment, the
time has come to lay aside the ritual incantation that this is a
jurisdiction which should only be exercised sparingly and with great
caution. There have been many statements of great authority warning
of the danger of giving an appearance of undue interference with
the proceedings of a foreign Court. Such sensitivity to the feelings
of a foreign Court has much to commend it where the injunction is
sought on the ground of forum non conveniens or on the general ground
that the foreign proceedings are vexatious or oppressive but where
no breach of contract is involved</em>. <em>In
the former case, great care may be needed to avoid casting doubt
on the fairness or adequacy of the procedures of the foreign Court.
In the later case, the question whether proceedings are vexatious
or oppressive is primarily a matter for the Court before which they
are pending. But in my judgment there is no good reason for diffidence
in granting an injunction to restrain foreign proceedings on the
clear and simple ground that the defendant has promised not to being</em> [sic] <em>them</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">
<em>I cannot accept the
proposition that any Court would be offended by the grant of an
injunction to restrain a party from invoking a jurisdiction which
he had promised not to invoke and which it was its own duty to decline</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">In my judgment, where an injunction is
sought to restrain a party from proceeding in a foreign Court in
breach of an arbitration agreement governed by English law, the English
Court need feel no diffidence in granting the injunction, provided
that it is sought promptly and before the foreign proceedings are
too far advanced. I see no difference in principle between an injunction
to restrain proceedings in breach of an arbitration clause and one
to restrain proceedings in breach of an exclusive jurisdiction clause
as in <em>Continental Bank NA v Aeakos Compania
Naviera SA</em>, [1994] 1 WLR 588. The justification for the grant
of the injunction in either case is that without it the plaintiff
will be deprived of its contractual rights in a situation in which
damages are manifestly an inadequate remedy. The jurisdiction is,
of course, discretionary and is not exercised as a matter of course,
but good reason needs to be shown why it should not be exercised
in any given case.’</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">34.    In <em>Donohue v Armco</em> [2000] CLC 1090 Stuart-Smith
LJ adopted those principles, although he said that he thought that
we should adhere to the expressions ‘strong cause’ or ‘strong reason’
rather than good reason. <em>I should add that
it seems to me that the English court should not feel diffidence
in granting such an injunction in order to restrain a breach of
contract whether or not it would be the duty of the foreign court
to decline jurisdiction.</em></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">35.    Those principles apply to the granting
of an interlocutory injunction to restrain foreign proceedings which
are brought in breach of an exclusive jurisdiction clause. Mr Brindle
correctly submitted that in this case cl. 8.2(d) is not an exclusive
jurisdiction clause. However, once it is held that Utrecht were
in breach of the TOA in commencing the Californian proceedings and that
they remain in breach of the TOA in continuing to pursue them, as
held by the judge, it seems to me that essentially the same principles
apply. Thus it would be vexatious to allow Utrecht to continue its
breach in circumstances where damages would not be an adequate remedy.
As Millett LJ put it, there is no good reason for diffidence on
the clear and simple ground that Utrecht promised not to do what
it is now doing. I can see no reason in principle why comity should
stand in the way of the granting of an injunction.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     Having
regard to the foregoing and the reasons given by the Judge at [41]-[42]
of the GD, we did not see anything to suggest that the Judge had erred
in his decision to grant the anti-suit injunction after deciding
on the underlying merits of the Singapore Action.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     For
completeness, we wish to add that even assuming that the principles
governing the grant of <em>interlocutory</em> anti-suit
injunctions were to be applied <em>unmodified</em> in
the present case, the grant of the anti-suit injunction would be
justified. The general principles governing the grant of <em>interlocutory</em> anti-suit injunctions are
set out at <a href="#p1_35">[35]</a> above and
will not be repeated here. As far as local authorities are concerned,
the position has been established by this Court in <em>John
Reginald Stott Kirkham</em> at <a href="#p1_28">[28]</a>-<a href="#p1_29">[29]</a> where the approach taken by
the High Court in <em>Evergreen International SA v
Volkswagen Group Singapore Pte Ltd</em> [2004] 2 SLR(R) 457
at <a href="#p1_16">[16]</a> (“<em>Evergreen
International SA</em>”) was approved:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">28    In <em>Evergreen International SA v Volkswagen Group Singapore
Pte Ltd</em> [2004] 2 SLR(R) 457 ("<em>Evergreen
International SA</em>"), Belinda Ang Saw Ean J ("Ang J") stated
that she had to consider the following elements in determining whether
an anti-suit injunction ought to be granted in the case (at [16]):</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(a)    whether
the defendants are amenable to the jurisdiction of the Singapore
court;</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(b)    the natural forum for resolution of
the dispute between the parties;</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(c)    the alleged vexation or oppression
to the plaintiffs if the foreign proceedings are to continue; and</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(d)    the alleged injustice to the defendants
as an injunction would deprive the defendants of the advantages
sought in the foreign proceedings.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">29    In
our view, this is as good a list as any with only one qualification, which
would constitute a fifth element - whether the institution of the
foreign proceedings is in breach of any agreement between the parties
(see <em>South Carolina Insurance Co v Assurantie
Maatschappij "De Zeven Provincien" NV</em> [1987] AC 24).
Where there is such an agreement, the court may not feel diffident
about granting an anti-suit injunction as it would only be enforcing a
contractual promise and the question of international comity is
not as relevant (see <em>The Angelic Grace</em> [1995]
1 Lloyd's Rep 87 at 96 and <em>WSG Nimbus Pte Ltd
v Board of Control for Cricket in Sri Lanka</em> [2002] 1 SLR(R) 1088 at
[91]). However, as far as the present case was concerned, this element
did not come into play as there was no such agreement between the
parties. That said, we will now examined each of these elements
in relation to the facts and circumstances of the present case,
although one could say that the third and fourth elements are really
quite closely related, being two sides of the same coin.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     In
line with the approach elaborated in <em>John Reginald
Stott Kirkham</em> quoted above, we also saw a preponderance
of factors which weighed in favour of granting an anti-suit injunction
in our present case. These factors were:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_38-p2_a"></a>(a)     The
Appellant was at the material time amenable<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_24" id="Ftn_24_1"><sup>[note: 24]</sup></a></span> to
the jurisdiction of the local courts because he was working in Singapore
at the time the Singapore Action was commenced. Further, the Appellant
had submitted to the jurisdiction of the Singapore courts by not
making any application for a stay of that Action;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_38-p2_b"></a>(b)     There
were strong reasons to believe that the natural forum for the resolution
of the underlying dispute between the Appellant and the Respondents
was Singapore given that (i) the 1<sup>st</sup> Respondent
was a company incorporated in Singapore and the Appellant was stationed in
Singapore while he was employed by the 1<sup>st</sup> Respondent;<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_25" id="Ftn_25_1"><sup>[note: 25]</sup></a></span> (ii) the 17 July 2008 Agreement was
discussed and signed in Singapore;<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_26" id="Ftn_26_1"><sup>[note: 26]</sup></a></span> (iii) the
Appellant was residing in Singapore;<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_27" id="Ftn_27_1"><sup>[note: 27]</sup></a></span> (iv) there
was a non-exclusive jurisdiction clause in favour of the Singapore
courts under the letter from the 1<sup>st</sup> Respondent
dated 10 May 2007 which was linked to the 17 July 2008 Agreement;
and (v) the governing law in respect of the matters covered in the
letter dated 10 May 2007 was expressed to be Singapore law (see <a href="#p1_33">[33]</a> of the GD);</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_38-p2_c"></a>(c)     There
would be vexation or oppression to the Respondents if the American
Action were to continue because the American Action would, for the
reasons stated at <a href="#p1_17">[17]</a>-<a href="#p1_24">[24]</a> above indicating that the Appellant
had breached cl 14 by commencing the American Action, likely be
“bound to fail”: see <em>Dicey, Morris and Collins
on the Conflict of Laws vol </em>1 (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 14<sup>th</sup> Ed,
2006) at pp 504-5;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_38-p2_d"></a>(d)     The
Appellant had not pointed out any potential advantage sought in
the American Action which he would be deprived of if the anti-suit
injunction were to be granted;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_38-p2_e"></a>(e)     Contrary
to what the Appellant submitted, the American Action was not at
an advanced stage. No doubt certain interlocutory motions arising
from the American Action had already been argued before in the United
States of America and discovery was already underway in the American
Action,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_28" id="Ftn_28_1"><sup>[note: 28]</sup></a></span> the trial had yet commenced.
Furthermore, the Appellant had, so far, still not effected service
of the legal documents on the 1<sup>st</sup> and
5<sup>th</sup> Respondent in respect of the American Action;
and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_38-p2_f"></a>(f)     An
anti-suit injunction in the present case would not, strictly-speaking,
offend against the notion of international comity because the injunction
would effectively be no more than an <em>in personam</em> order
made against the Appellant following his breach of a specific contractual
promise encapsulated in cl 14: see <em>Bank of
America National Trust and Savings Association v Djoni Widjaja</em> [1994] 2 SLR(R) 898
at <a href="#p1_11">[11]</a> and <a href="#p1_24">[24]</a> and <em>The
Angelic Grace</em> [1995] 1 Ll Rep 87 quoted in <a href="#p1_35">[35]</a> above.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     For
all the reasons given above, the appeal was dismissed.</p>
