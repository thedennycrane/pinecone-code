</div> Sometime in the latter half of 2018, Mr Phua and Mr Pang came up with the COFAN mark. In Mr Phua’s view, the COFAN mark was felicitous for the following reasons:

The plaintiff avers that the inclusion of an element of Mr Phua’s name in product branding was also consistent with its prior BESTAR mark, which incorporated Mr Phua’s Chinese name (‘星’, which means ‘star’ in Chinese).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Mr Pang felt that the first syllable of ‘COFAN’ could stand for ‘cooperation’. He thought this to be representative of the work dynamic within the plaintiff.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">8 Shortly after, the plaintiff applied for the registration of the COFAN trade mark on 27 February 2019 (the “Application”). This, according to Mr Phua, was done in order to “reserve” the mark before further preparations were made for its use. The Application received no objections and was accepted by the Trade Marks Registry (the “Registry”) after the two-month period for filing opposition had lapsed. Mr Phua testified that it was after the opposition period that Mr Pang and him first made casual mention to industry counterparts that the plaintiff was planning to release fans bearing the COFAN mark to the market. However, Mr Phua explained that the plaintiff did not formally publicise nor apply the COFAN trade mark to its products as it was not ready for launch. Instead, the plaintiff was focused on building the BESTAR brand.

</div> In particular, Mr Quek and Mr Lim testified that at that point in 2016, fans sold under the FANCO mark were powered by alternating current (“AC”), which was largely associated with a lower price range in the market. It was thus their hope that the defendant could enter the market for direct current (“DC”) fans, which could command a higher price as they were quieter and consumed less power. Mr Lim therefore developed the CO-FAN mark for the defendant’s newly conceived DC fan product range by simply reversing the syllables of the defendant’s FANCO mark.

</div> when Mr Quek and Mr Lim held a meeting in Mr Quek’s office for a formal discussion of the plans to produce DC fans (the “March 2016 Meeting”). The March 2016 Meeting was allegedly attended by Mr Phua, Mr Lim, Mr Quek and Ms Claudia Fong (“Ms Fong”), who is the defendant’s human resource manager and Mr Quek’s wife. Mr Quek’s evidence is that, in the course of the March 2016 Meeting, it was decided that this new line of DC fans would bear the CO-FAN mark. In particular, the first “model” of fans with the CO-FAN mark would be named “HELI”.

These preparatory steps are distilled as follows: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Sometime in January 2017, the defendant engaged Qiangjing Lightning Electrical Co Ltd (“Qiangjing”), a factory in China, as its manufacturer. Discussions were held with Qiangjing in order to refine and obtain the final prototypes for safety testing and eventual sale. These prototypes were shipped to Singapore sometime in 2018.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) On 9 November 2018, the defendant applied for “Certificates of Conformity” (“COCs”) from TÜV SÜD PSB (“PSB”). PSB is a conformity assessment body (“CAB”) designated by the Consumer Protection Safety Authority (“CPSA”) to certify that certain products satisfy the applicable safety standards and requirements. In order to obtain the COCs, the defendant also submitted test certificates which certified that the prototypes were electrically fit-for-purpose (the “Test Certificates”).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) On 7 June 2019, PSB issued the COCs in relation to all fans which the defendant submitted applications for. Shortly after, the defendant’s products were registered with CPSA on 11 June 2019. This enabled the defendant to affix its products with a “SAFETY Mark”. This was the final regulatory hurdle before the defendant could begin selling the fans.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Sale of CO-FAN and COFAN products</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">12 Following the aforementioned preparations, the defendant advertised and sold DC fans bearing the CO-FAN mark sometime in August 2019. These fans also bore the HELI identifier (hereinafter referred to as the “CO-FAN HELI-marked fans”).

</div> It was at this time that the defendant learnt that the plaintiff was the registered proprietor of the COFAN trade mark. Shortly after, the defendant received a letter from the plaintiff’s lawyers dated 27 April 2021 demanding that the defendant immediately cease its use of the CO-FAN mark (the “27 April 2021 Letter”). This was closely followed by another letter from the plaintiff’s lawyers dated 30 April 2021 (the “30 April 2021 Letter”) which repeated the plaintiff’s demands. It is undisputed that, after these letters were sent, the plaintiff proceeded to launch its own fans bearing the COFAN mark on 2 May 2021. These fans also bore the secondary product identifier “HALI” (the “HALI identifier”). I hereinafter refer to fans bearing the COFAN mark and HALI identifier as the “COFAN HALI-marked fans”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">14 On 24 May 2021, the plaintiff filed the present action claiming that the defendant’s use of the CO-FAN mark infringed the plaintiff’s registration for the COFAN mark. The defendant filed its defence and counterclaim on 21 June 2021, seeking invalidation of the COFAN mark on the ground of bad faith. It also seeks relief arising from the plaintiff’s alleged groundless threats of trademark infringement.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The parties’ cases  </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">15 The parties’ arguments largely focus on the defendant’s counterclaim, relating to the ground of bad faith under s 7(6) read with s 23(1) of the TMA. The defendant seeks to subvert the plaintiff’s infringement claim on the basis that the registration of the COFAN mark is invalid because the Application was filed in bad faith. The defendant asserts that bad faith is made out in two main ways. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">16 First, the defendant argues that Mr Phua learnt that the defendant intended to launch ceiling fans under the CO-FAN mark during the February 2016 Meeting and the March 2016 Meeting. As such, it avers that the plaintiff’s application for registration of the COFAN trade mark on 27 February 2019 was made in bad faith due to Mr Phua’s knowledge at the time. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">17 Second, the defendant submits that the plaintiff’s motive for registering the COFAN mark was to “free ride on the defendant’s goodwill and reputation in its trade mark FANCO”. It submits that bad faith can be inferred where the trade mark applicant knew that a third party had a claim to the goodwill in the mark, and further that in these circumstances, it is not necessary to show that the marks were confusingly similar.

</div> On the facts, the defendant contends that Mr Phua, as the defendant’s former sales and marketing manager, was well aware of the defendant’s goodwill associated with the FANCO mark.

Flowing from its argument regarding the invalidity of the COFAN registration, the defendant also seeks relief for groundless threats of trade mark infringement proceedings under s 35 of the TMA in relation to the 27 April 2021 Letter and the 30 April 2021 Letter (collectively referred to as the “April 2021 Letters”).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">19 The plaintiff denies that the COFAN trade mark was registered in bad faith.

These principles were summarised in <span class="font-italic">Tomy</span><span class="font-italic"> Inc v Dentsply Sirona Inc </span>[2020] 5 SLR 424 (at [32]), the relevant portions of which I reproduce below:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Bad faith constitutes one exception to the “first-to-file system”: <span class="font-italic">Hotel Cipriani </span><span class="font-italic">Srl and others v Cipriani (Grosvenor Street) Ltd and others </span>[2008] EWHC 3032 (Ch) (“<span class="font-italic">Cipriani</span>”) at 185, which was upheld on appeal in <span class="font-italic">Hotel Cipriani </span><span class="font-italic">Srl and others v Cipriani (Grosvenor Street) Ltd and others </span>[2010] EWCA Civ 110.

Where allegations of bad faith are concerned, the “standard of proof is on the balance of probabilities, but cogent evidence is required due to the seriousness of the allegation”: <span class="font-italic">Cipriani</span> at 177; see also <span class="font-italic">Valentino </span>at [30]. Nevertheless, a conclusion of bad faith is “largely, if not invariably, based on circumstantial evidence”: see <span class="font-italic">Festina</span><span class="font-italic"> Lotus </span>at [115]; see also <span class="font-italic">Brutt</span><span class="font-italic"> Trade Marks </span>[2007] RPC 19 at [29]–[30] and Ng-Loy Wee Loon, <span class="font-italic">Law of Intellectual Property of Singapore </span>(Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 2nd Ed, 2014) at para 21.4.1.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(g) The bad faith inquiry is a fact-sensitive one that demands careful examination of all the relevant circumstances. In this regard, the nature of parties’ pre-existing relationship is a factor relevant to the determination of bad faith: see <span class="font-italic">Nautical Concept Pte Ltd v Jeffery Mark Richard </span>[2007] 1 SLR(R) 1071 at [24]–[27]. Examples include “an applicant attempting to register the trade mark of a competitor, an ex-employer, a supplier, a licensor or any party with whom the applicant has or had a contractual or pre-contractual relationship”: see Tan Tee Jim, <span class="font-italic">Law of Trade Marks and Passing Off in Singapore </span>(Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 3rd Ed, 2014) at para 7.178.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 To the foregoing, I add that there is a body of local case law that has consistently adopted the position that a likelihood of confusion (in the sense intended by s 8(2) of the TMA) is not necessary in order for a finding of bad faith to be made: see <span class="font-italic">Rothmans of Pall Mall Ltd v </span><span class="font-italic">Maycolson International Ltd </span>[2006] 2 SLR(R) 551 at [29]; <span class="font-italic">Valentino </span>at [20]; <span class="font-italic">Festina</span><span class="font-italic"> Lotus </span>at [113]. This position is not inconsistent with that in European jurisprudence: see <span class="font-italic">Koton</span><span class="font-italic"> Mağazacilik Tekstil Sanayi ve Ticaret v EUIPO</span> Case (C-104/18 P, EU:C:2019:724) (<span class="font-italic">“</span><span class="font-italic">Koton”</span>) at [48]–[52]; [55]–[56]. In <span class="font-italic">Koton</span><span class="font-italic">, </span>the appellant argued that the General Court had erred in its interpretation of the <span class="font-italic">Lindt </span>case. The General Court had concluded that the <span class="font-italic">Lindt</span> case meant that bad faith could not arise under Article 52(1)(b) of Regulation No 207/2009 (which is equivalent to s 7(6) of the TMA) in the absence of a confusing similarity. The Court of Justice of the European Union allowed the appeal, and clarified the position on the factors listed by the court in the <span class="font-italic">Lindt </span>case (summarised at [24(d)] above):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">48 In [<span class="font-italic">Lindt</span>], the Court… was specifically asked about the situation where, at the time of the application for the contested mark, several producers were using, on the internal market, identical or similar signs for identical or similar products, which was capable of giving rise to confusion…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">49 Thus, and while the issue of the assessment of the existence of bad faith was different from that of the assessment of the existence of a likelihood of confusion, those two concepts of trade mark law being separate, the Court was asked to set out criteria to assess whether there is bad faith in a situation in which it has been established that there exists a likelihood of confusion.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">50 The Court replied that, in such a case, it is necessary to consider … whether the applicant for a trade mark knew or should have known that a third party was using… the sign capable of being confused with the sign applied for…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">51 <span class="font-italic">It does not follow from that judgment that the existence of bad faith… may only be established in the situation… where there is use on the internal market of an identical or similar sign for identical or similar goods capable of being confused with the sign for which registration is sought.</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">52 There may be situations… where the application for registration of a trade mark is liable to be regarded as having been filed in bad faith notwithstanding the fact that, at the time of that application, there was no use by a third party on the internal market of an identical or similar sign for identical or similar goods.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">55 It is to be inferred from the interpretation provided by the Court in paragraph 53 of [<span class="font-italic">Lindt</span>] merely that, where it is established that use by a third party of an identical or similar sign for identical or similar goods or services existed and was capable of causing confusion, it is necessary to examine, in the context of the overall assessment of the relevant circumstances of the particular case, whether the applicant for the contested mark had knowledge of this. <span class="font-italic">That factor is, however, only one relevant factor among others to be taken into consideration</span>.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">56 … <span class="font-italic">[I]t must be held that, in the absence of any likelihood of confusion between the sign used by a third party and the contested mark, or if there has been no use, </span><span class="font-italic">by a third party, of a sign identical with, or similar to, the contested mark, other factual circumstances may, depending on the circumstances, constitute relevant and consistent indicia establishing the bad faith of the applicant.</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 With these principles in mind, I turn to the first of the defendant’s two contentions.

</div> Mr Phua, on the other hand, denies that this meeting took place. There is no objective evidence that points in favour of either parties’ testimony. Mr Quek and Mr Lim were not able to provide greater detail as to what transpired at the meeting. When cross-examined, Mr Quek was unable to accurately recall when the alleged informal discussion had taken place. He first stated that the meeting happened in January 2016 before correcting himself and aligning his testimony with that in his affidavit evidence. In light of the paucity of reliable evidence, I find the defendant has failed to satisfy me that the February 2016 Meeting occurred.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(2) The March 2016 Meeting</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 Turning to the March 2016 Meeting, the defendant relies on the Minutes to substantiate its case. The plaintiff, however, alleges that the Minutes were forged and that no such meeting had transpired. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 The Minutes of the March 2016 Meeting were allegedly hand-written by Mr Lim. The Minutes reflect that the March 2016 Meeting began at 10.50 am, and that its subject matter was a “Discussion for New Launch Brand (CO-FAN)”. Mr Phua, Mr Lim, Mr Quek and Ms Fong are reflected as attendees. The Minutes list, in point form, the discussions held by the parties in attendance:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[Item 2]: First Product under CO-Fan will be Heli 56” – Discuss about specification of products, &amp; size &amp; color</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[Item 4]: Person [<span class="font-italic">sic</span>] for using CO-Fan, to capture more market share</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[Item 7]: [Mr Lim] have suggest using CO-Fan because of Reverse name of Fanco</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 While an allegation of fabrication is a serious one and should not be lightly made, there is little doubt in my mind that the Minutes were indeed forged. To elaborate, Mr Lim’s evidence during cross-examination was that the Minutes were the <span class="font-italic">only</span> written record ever taken in the course of the defendant’s existence from 2013 to 2021. Mr Quek and Mr Lim further testified that they did not have the practice of taking minutes during meetings regarding the defendant’s affairs. Mr Lim also testified that even on the occasions where he took notes for his own benefit, he eventually threw them away as they were insignificant.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 I make a preliminary observation in relation to the defendant’s use of the phrase “free ride on the goodwill”. The use of this phrase may give rise to confusion. The tort of passing off protects the goodwill of a trader from damage by a misrepresentation. The misrepresentation can arise by, <span class="font-italic">inter</span> <span class="font-italic">alia</span>, the use of a confusingly similar mark. The defendant is not relying on the ground of passing off provided by s 8(7)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the TMA to invalidate the registration. As such I do not understand the defendant’s use of the phrase “free ride on the goodwill” to refer to damage to the defendant’s goodwill in the sense required by the passing off ground. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 Having assessed the evidence, I find that the plaintiff indeed made the Application in bad faith.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 I begin with the nexus between the parties on which a finding of bad faith is usually premised: <span class="font-italic">Festina</span><span class="font-italic"> Lotus </span>at [115]. In the present context, Mr Phua’s prior employment with the defendant, and the similarities between the FANCO and COFAN marks, form a clear nexus between the parties. To the latter, it is clear, in my view, that these marks bear <span class="font-italic">some </span>similarity. Both marks comprise the same letters and are merely reversals of the syllables of the other mark. I add, however, that this should not be construed as a finding that the COFAN and FANCO marks are confusingly similar (see [25] above). Confusing similarity, in the sense set out in s 8(2) of the TMA, is not in issue in the present proceedings nor has it been pleaded by the parties. In any case, I am of the provisional view that the marks are not confusingly similar; that the registration of the COFAN mark was accepted by the Registry without issue also indicates so. Instead, the extent of similarity between the marks forms the basis on which an inference of bad faith, taken together with all the relevant circumstances, may be drawn. As Tay Yong Kwang J (as he then was) astutely observed in <span class="font-italic">Festina</span><span class="font-italic"> Lotus</span> (at [115]):  </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… [D]espite the broad nature of the notion of bad faith, one must show some sort of nexus between the parties in dispute. Otherwise, the notion of bad faith would have to be decided in vacuum. A clear-cut example of such a nexus would be an outright copying of the proprietor’s mark such that the two competing marks are practically identical. However, the nexus may be in the guise of something more subtle. In finding a nexus between the parties, a parallel may be drawn between ss 8(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) and 7(6) TMA. For example, there may be cases where although there is some similarity of marks or of the goods or services, it falls short of confusing similarity (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, no likelihood of confusion) within the meaning of s 8(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) TMA. <span class="font-italic">Nevertheless, the evidence of this similarity may be </span><span class="font-italic">taken into account and considered against the background facts from which bad faith may be inferred. In other words, while the finding of bad faith is largely, if not invariably, based on circumstantial evidence, the party alleging bad faith needs to show some link between the parties, perhaps by way of a pre-existing relationship or some acts of association with the proprietor or some nexus between the two competing marks</span>. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis in original omitted, emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 In this regard, I do not accept Mr Phua’s explanation that the COFAN mark is his independent and original creation. As detailed at [7] above, Mr Phua’s evidence is that the COFAN mark is an amalgamation of his Christian name with the word ‘fan’. However, when confronted in cross-examination regarding the fact that the COFAN mark was a mere reversal of the syllables of the defendant’s FANCO mark, Mr Phua testified that it simply did not occur to him that this was so.

</div>
</div> This, to my mind, is incredible, particularly in light of Mr Phua’s seven years of working for the defendant, whose name includes the word ‘Fanco’.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 Further, notwithstanding my findings regarding the February 2016 Meeting and the March 2016 Meeting, I accept that the defendant had indeed taken preparatory steps (as summarized at [11]) to use the CO-FAN mark as early as 9 November 2018. As such, the plaintiff’s assertion that the defendant adopted the CO-FAN mark only after it heard about the plaintiff’s plans to do so cannot be true, as both Mr Phua and Mr Pang’s evidence is that the <span class="font-italic">first </span><span class="font-italic">time</span> they had disclosed the defendant’s plans to launch fans bearing the COFAN mark was sometime in April or May 2019.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41   In order to prove that it had taken these preparatory steps, the defendant exhibited the following documents, many of which bear mention of the CO-FAN mark on their face:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) A written confirmation of Mr Quek’s purchase order with Qiangjing, which contained a rough sketch of the prototype Qiangjing was to produce (the “Written Confirmation”). This prototype was labelled “CO-FAN HELI 56”/66””. The Written Confirmation was initially dated “18 January 2016”, although Mr Quek’s affidavit evidence was that he had intended to write 18 January <span class="font-italic">2017</span> instead. The Written Confirmation further reflects a “Purchase Order” of 500 pieces each of “HELI 56”” and “HELI 66””.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) An application form dated 9 November 2018 sent by the defendant to PSB in order to obtain COCs (the “PSB Application”). The description of the controlled goods for which the PSB Application was made had “CO-FAN” listed as its “Trade Name”, and “HELI” as its “Model Number”.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) An e-mail dated 9 November 2018 sent by Ms Toh Lay Chun (“Ms Toh”), a representative of PSB, informing the defendant that she had received the PSB Application (the “PSB E-mail”). Attached to the e-mail was the application number for each of the fan models the defendant sought COCs for. These attachments contained application numbers for both “FANCO” and “CO-FAN”-marked fans (the “Attachments”). A subsequent e-mail dated 12 November 2018 sent by Ms Toh was also adduced.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) A test report dated 15 April 2019 issued by PSB, setting out the mechanical tests conducted between 21 November 2018 and 13 March 2019 on various fan models for which certification was sought (the “Test Report”). The CO-FAN mark appears numerous times in the “Trade Name” field, corresponding to the model names that were allocated application numbers in the PSB E-mail. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) The COCs dated 7 June 2019 issued by PSB to the defendant, certifying that the defendant’s CO-FAN HELI-marked fans met the requisite regulatory requirements.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 The plaintiff filed notices disputing the authenticity of all the aforementioned documents, save for the COCs. In its written submissions, it challenged only items [41(a)] to [41(c)]. I set out the plaintiff’s arguments on authenticity before dealing with its challenge to the defendant’s preparatory steps as a whole.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 Beginning with the Written Confirmation, the plaintiff highlights that its initial date of “18 January 2016” suggests that the Written Confirmation was likely an order made in January 2016 for 500 fans to be sold under the <span class="font-italic">FANCO</span><span class="font-italic">, </span>rather than CO-FAN, mark. It further submits that the defendant had tampered with the document by adding the word “CO-FAN” to create a false impression of the purpose of the purchase order. The plaintiff also challenges the defendant’s evidence that he was unable to produce the original correspondence with Qiangjing due to his phone being confiscated by IRAS. In this regard, the plaintiff points to the fact that Mr Quek could have easily obtained the WeChat conversations by initiating contact with Qiangjing for a record of their correspondence. Mr Quek acknowledged that he could have done so but conceded that he did not.

</div>
</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 Turning to the PSB E-mail, the plaintiff takes issue with the fact that it appears that the entire chain of e-mails between the defendant and PSB was not disclosed, as only the e-mails dated 9 November 2018 and 12 November 2018 were disclosed. Relying on its allegations of post-date tampering in relation to the PSB Application, the plaintiff asserts that the details of the Attachments could also have been incomplete as of 9 November 2018 and its veracity is thus suspect. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 In my judgment, the plaintiff’s arguments in relation to the PSB E-mail and the Attachments thereto are not convincing. First, its argument that there were undisclosed communications between PSB and the defendant was speculative at best. Second, it is unclear to me how the contents of the Attachments could have been altered after 9 November 2018, when they were clearly appended to an e-mail bearing that date. In this regard, I did not understand the plaintiff’s submission to be that the PSB E-mail and the Attachments adduced in court were fabricated or altered by the defendant, but that PSB and the defendant had continued to fill in the details of the Attachments past the date of 9 November 2018. This, however, was no more than mere conjecture. As such, I am satisfied that the PSB E-mail and the Attachments were authentic. There is also no reason to doubt the authenticity of the Test Report, nor the COCs for that matter. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 Turning to the Written Confirmation, I agree with the plaintiff that, in light of the reasons highlighted at [43], the authenticity of the Written Confirmation is doubtful. In particular, Mr Quek could not satisfactorily explain why he did not seek the relevant records of the WeChat conversations from Qiangjing despite accepting that he could have easily done so.

</div>
</div> This, however, does not detract from the reliability of the other documentary evidence highlighted in [41]. The documentary evidence satisfactorily establishes that the defendant had taken preparatory steps in relation to the CO-FAN mark and lends credence to the defendant’s case that it conceived the CO-FAN mark on its own. This was not least because the various documents used in the course of its preparations contain mention of the CO-FAN mark prior to the plaintiff’s application to register the COFAN trade mark. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 As such, it is clear to me that the plaintiff’s claim that the defendant adopted the CO-FAN mark only after it heard about the plaintiff’s plans to do so sometime after April or May 2019 cannot be accepted. The PSB Application, for instance, evidences the use of the CO-FAN mark as early as 9 November 2018.

It is undisputed that the defendant had sold its CO-FAN HELI-marked fans more than a year prior to when the plaintiff launched its own COFAN HALI-marked fans on 2 May 2021. Against this backdrop, the defendant exhibits photos of the marketing brochures and product packaging for the CO-FAN HELI and the COFAN HALI-marked fans respectively and highlights several similarities between them.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 The brochures for the respective products, for instance, depict a near-identical image of a six-bladed fan with a 56-inch blade length. A notable difference between the brochures, however, is that the COFAN HALI-marked fans retailed at $1 cheaper.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 The product packaging of the respective goods discloses even greater similarities. I highlight the following:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) an identical picture of a 6-bladed fan above the fan model name;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) the words “DC Motor Series”, “Modern Design, Eco-Friendly, Super-Silent” and “Energy Saving” on the top left-hand corner in the exact same font and format; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) the words “Remote Control Last Memory Function, DC Brushless Motor, ABS Blades, LED (Day/Warm/Cool White), 5/6 Speed (Reversible)” on the top right-hand corner in the exact same font and format.      </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 When Mr Phua was confronted with these similarities in cross examination, his evidence was that they were the result of a <span class="font-italic">mere</span> <span class="font-italic">coincidence</span>. This was an incredible and unbelievable explanation given the sheer extent of similarities detailed above. Instead, these striking similarities suggest to me that the plaintiff had intentionally (and rather blatantly) sought to replicate the defendant’s product design and packaging in relation to the CO-FAN HELI-marked fans. The plaintiff launched the COFAN HALI-marked fans shortly after demanding that the defendant cease use of the CO-FAN mark via the 27 April 2021 Letter. It is clear from the brochures exhibited that the plaintiff then took the steps to undercut the defendant by retailing the fans at a $1 discount. Taken together, this chronology gives rise to great suspicion regarding the <span class="font-italic">bona fides</span> of the plaintiff’s intentions at the time of the Application.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 At this juncture of the analysis, I summarize the key findings:</div><div class="mb-3"><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(a) The defendant has been the registered proprietor of the FANCO mark since 2013.</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(b) Mr Phua had worked for the defendant for seven years before he left to incorporate the plaintiff in 2016.</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(c) Shortly after, Mr Phua registered the COFAN mark. Mr Phua’s evidence that it did not occur to him that “COFAN” was merely a reversal of the syllables of “FANCO” is unbelievable, especially in light of his employment history with the defendant (at [39]).</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(d) The defendant had taken preparatory steps in relation to the CO-FAN mark as early as 9 November 2018. This means that the plaintiff’s assertion that the defendant created the CO-FAN mark after learning of the plaintiff’s COFAN mark in 2019 cannot be true (at [48]). </div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(e) After learning that the defendant was selling the CO-FAN HELI-marked fans, the plaintiff demanded via the 27 April 2021 Letter that the defendant cease use of the CO-FAN mark. Shortly after, the plaintiff launched its COFAN HALI-marked fans, using packaging and brochures which bore uncanny similarities to those used by the defendant (at [52]).</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(f) The plaintiff’s explanation that the similarities between the packaging and brochures were merely coincidental is incredible (at [52]).</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 Tying the various threads together, there is no doubt in my mind that the plaintiff registered the COFAN mark in bad faith. Taking the subjective component of the “combined” test of bad faith, I find that the plaintiff, through Mr Phua, had knowledge of the similarities between the COFAN and FANCO marks at the point of the Application (see [39] above). Further, I find that by virtue of Mr Phua’s previous employment with the defendant, the plaintiff was aware of the goodwill the defendant enjoyed in its business under the FANCO mark. Taken together, the plaintiff’s subsequent conduct in launching the nearly identical COFAN HALI-marked fans (all while also attempting to stifle the sale of the defendant’s CO-FAN HELI-marked fans) creates the unmistakable impression that the plaintiff intended to capitalize on the defendant’s goodwill at the point the Application was made. In my judgment, such conduct clearly falls foul of the objective component of the test; it cannot be said that the plaintiff’s actions meet the standards of acceptable commercial behaviour observed by reasonable and experienced men.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 The consequence of this is that the defendant succeeds in its counterclaim for the invalidation of the plaintiff’s COFAN mark registration.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 The defendant relies on the English case of <span class="font-italic">Best Buy Co Inc v Worldwide Sales Corp </span><span class="font-italic">Espana SL</span> [2011] FSR 742 (“<span class="font-italic">Best Buy</span>”) on what constitutes a “threat” under s 35 of the TMA. In <span class="font-italic">Best Buy</span>, the English Court of Appeal had to deal with the issue of whether the contents of a letter constituted a threat for the purposes of the then s 21(1) of the Trade Marks Act 1994 (“UK TMA”) (the old s 21(1)). The old s 21(1) was the equivalent of s 35(1) of the TMA. I clarify here that the groundless threats provisions in the UK TMA have since been amended by the Intellectual Property (Unjustified Threats) Act 2017, an Act which replaced the old s 21 with ss 21-21F. Returning to the decision in <span class="font-italic">Best Buy</span>, the court held that whether a “threat” arises is an assessment made (at [18]): </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… by reference to what a reasonable person, in the position of the recipient of the letter, with its knowledge of all the relevant circumstances as at the date the letter was written, would have understood the writer of the passage to have intended, when read in the context of the letter as a whole…</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 I accept the defendant’s reliance on <span class="font-italic">Best Buy</span>. In <span class="font-italic">Dr </span><span class="font-italic">Babor, </span>Chan Seng Onn J (as he then was) held that the applicable approach to the first limb is to construe the relevant correspondence in accordance with the perspective of a reasonable person in the shoes of the recipient, with the knowledge of all the relevant circumstances as at the date of the correspondence: at [39]. To my mind, there is little material difference between the approaches laid out in <span class="font-italic">Dr </span><span class="font-italic">Babor</span> and <span class="font-italic">Best Buy</span>. It is sensible to construe “threats” objectively, <span class="font-italic">ie</span><span class="font-italic">,</span> from the perspective of the reasonable person with knowledge of all the relevant circumstances at the time of correspondence. In my view, this is in line with the underlying rationale of the groundless threats provision, which aims to strike a satisfactory balance between the protection of existing intellectual property rights and the prevention of “bullying” tactics where rights-holders use the threat of infringement proceedings to chill legitimate commercial activity: <span class="font-italic">Singsung</span><span class="font-italic"> Pte Ltd v LG 26 Electronics Pte Ltd (trading as L S Electrical Trading) </span>[2016] 4 SLR 86 (“<span class="font-italic">Singsung</span>”)<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [129]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 In <span class="font-italic">Best Buy</span>, the court stated (at [20]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">It is well established that it is unnecessary for a claimant in a case such as this</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">“to prove that the defendant has in so many words said: ‘I intend to issue a writ against you for infringement …’.

In <span class="font-italic">Tech 21 </span><span class="font-italic">UK</span>, the English High Court assessed whether the statements contained in a cease and desist letter sent by the defendant’s lawyers to the claimant were  “threats” for the purposes of the old s 21. The letter identified allegedly infringing acts committed by the claimant and requested the claimant to cease the infringing conduct. The court, adopting (at [70]) the test in <span class="font-italic">Best Buy</span>, found that the phrase “… our client will reserve its rights to take legal action against you…” was sufficient to amount to a threat of infringement proceedings (at [81]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 The language used in the April 2021 Letters is similar to that employed in the cease and desist letter in <span class="font-italic">Tech 21 UK. </span>The 27 April 2021 Letter states that “[the defendant’s] actions amount to infringement of [the plaintiff’s] trademark”, and further that the letter constitutes notice to “[c]ease and desist from using the brand name “CO-FAN” or “COFAN” or any variation…”.

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 In my judgment, the plaintiff’s argument is unfounded. Section 35(1) of the TMA is expressed in exclusionary language – any aggrieved person may bring a threats action when threatened with proceedings for infringement in relation to acts “other than” those listed in s 35(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)–(<span class="font-italic">c</span>). Nothing in the language of subsections (<span class="font-italic">a</span>) to (<span class="font-italic">c</span>) indicates that threats made in relation to further acts such as the sale and/or advertising of goods bearing the impugned mark are unactionable.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 This conclusion is buttressed by s 27(4) of the TMA. In s 27(4), a distinction is drawn between a person who “applies [the mark] to goods or the packaging thereof” (s 27(4)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)) and one who “offers or exposes goods for sale” (s 27(4)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>)) or “uses the sign in advertising” (s 27(4)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>)). This suggests that s 35(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the TMA should not be interpreted in the manner argued by the plaintiff, <span class="font-italic">ie</span><span class="font-italic">,</span> to go beyond the mere affixation of the mark to the subsequent <span class="font-italic">use</span> of the mark when so affixed.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 In <span class="font-italic">Dr </span><span class="font-italic">Babor</span>, a similar result was arrived at in relation to s 35(1)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the TMA (which refers to the supply of services under the contested mark). Chan J relied on <span class="font-italic">Best Buy</span>, where the English Court of Appeal held that the old  s 21(1) of the UK TMA should be “construed by reference to [its] natural meaning” (<span class="font-italic">Best Buy </span>at [32]). In that case, Lord Neuberger also drew support for this conclusion from the distinction drawn between a person who “offers or supplies services under the sign” and one who “uses the sign on business papers or in advertising” under the then s 10(4) of the UK TMA. This reasoning was adopted in <span class="font-italic">Dr </span><span class="font-italic">Babor</span> as s 27(4) of the TMA draws a similar distinction (at [57]). It was thus held in <span class="font-italic">Dr</span><span class="font-italic"> Babor</span> that the ordinary language of s 35(1)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the TMA did not support the interpretation that the <span class="font-italic">advertising</span> of services using the mark fell within the provision (<span class="font-italic">Dr </span><span class="font-italic">Babor </span>at [57]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 As I briefly noted above, the position in the UK has since been legislatively amended. Following the Intellectual Property (Unjustified Threats) Act 2017, s 21A of the UK TMA now provides that no threat made to acts of primary infringement is actionable even if the threat also related to acts of secondary infringement committed by the same alleged infringer. The broadening of the exclusionary provisions by s 21A was intended to address an issue which arose under the old s 21(1). This was that threats made to a manufacturer which related solely to the application of the mark were not actionable, while threats which mentioned the sale of the same goods were. According to a report of the UK Law Commission entitled “Patents, Trade Marks and Design Rights: Groundless Threats” (Law Com No 346) dated April 2014 (“the UK Law Commission Report”), this was not an accurate reflection of the commercial reality that manufacturers or importers were likely to be involved in the sale of the allegedly infringing goods as well (at paragraph 2.40). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">71 This criticism is also mirrored in the plaintiff’s written submissions. The plaintiff submits that, should s 35(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) TMA be taken literally, it would lead to the absurd result that it “can only warn the defendant against applying the [COFAN mark] to its [ceiling] fans, but cannot tell the defendant to stop making representations to the public that it is selling and advertising ceiling fans under the CO-FAN [mark]” without facing a possible threats action.

</div> Indeed, there is considerable force behind this submission. In addition, I agree with UK Law Commission Report at paragraph 2.41 that this hinders the settlement of disputes: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Correspondence with an alleged infringer often asks for undertakings not to do certain acts. If these are agreed, that can be enough to settle the dispute. However, asking for undertakings not to sell or distribute was enough to trigger the groundless threats provision, while not asking for them did not completely deal with the infringement.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">However, until the prevailing legislative framework in Singapore undergoes similar development, I am satisfied that s 35(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) TMA should be given its natural meaning.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">72 Turning to the facts of the present case, the plaintiff’s allegations clearly went beyond the mere affixation of the mark to the defendant’s goods. In the April 2021 Letters, the plaintiff alleged that the defendant had “continued to <span class="font-italic">market</span> [its] other products under the mark ‘CO-FAN’” and that it was “<span class="font-italic">advertising</span> the “CO-FAN brand on online platforms such as Lazada, Qoo10, Shopee etc” [emphasis added].

Section 35(1) of the TMA provides that “any aggrieved person” may bring proceedings for relief for groundless threats of infringement proceedings. In <span class="font-italic">Dr </span><span class="font-italic">Babor</span>, the High Court (at [32]–[33]) adopted the test laid out in <span class="font-italic">Lee Tat Cheng v </span><span class="font-italic">Maka GPS Technologies Pte Ltd </span>[2018] 1 SLR 856 (“<span class="font-italic">Lee Tat Cheng</span>”). In <span class="font-italic">Lee Tat Cheng</span>, the Court of Appeal defined the applicable approach to s 77 of the Patents Act (Cap 221, 205 Rev Ed) (“PA”). Section 77 of the PA is the equivalent provision for groundless threats in the context of patent infringement. The CA held that the grant of relief for groundless threats of infringement under s 77 PA was ultimately discretionary. In this regard, it explained that a claimant would not be “aggrieved” if he is unable to demonstrate that (a) he has suffered any loss as a result of the defendant’s threats; or (b) it is appropriate for the court to intervene by granting a declaration (to the effect that the threats are unjustified) or an injunction (to restrain the defendant from continuing the threats), even if the defendant’s threats were found to be groundless (at [104]–[109]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">74 The defendant submits that it is an “aggrieved person” under s 35(1) TMA.

According to Mr Quek’s affidavit evidence, these distributors cancelled their orders for the defendant’s CO-FAN-marked fans as a result. The defendant exhibits copies of “Sales Tax Invoices” and credit notes sent to four of its distributors to support its case that it suffered loss. These distributors are:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Effi Home Pte Ltd (“Effi Home”);</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Kaze Lighting Pte Ltd (“Kaze Lighting”); </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) New Balestier Lighting Pte Ltd (“New Balestier Lighting”); and </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) Noble Lighting House Pte Ltd (“Noble Lighting House”).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">Of the above distributors, the defendant called Mr Koh Kaiyi (“Mr Koh”) of Kaze Lighting and Mr Yap Tian Yong (“Mr Yap”) of Effi Home to testify. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">75 In my judgment, the defendant has not shown that it was “aggrieved” in the sense that it had suffered loss as a result of the threats contained in the April 2021 Letters. Much of its evidence pertained to the alleged cancellation of orders for the defendant’s CO-FAN-marked fans by the defendant’s distributors. However, these cancellations emanated from what the defendant alleges were threats made by the plaintiff<span class="font-italic"> </span>in<span class="font-italic"> phone calls to the distributors</span>. In other words, such loss, even if shown, has nothing to do with the threats made in the April 2021 Letters. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">76 In any case, the defendant was unable to demonstrate any causal link between the alleged phone calls and the cancellations. Both Mr Koh and Mr Yap spoke in concert that they had cancelled their orders <span class="font-italic">not</span> because of the threat of trademark infringement proceedings, but rather out of concern that the defendant’s CO-FAN-marked fans would not sell as well relative to the lower price point of the plaintiff’s COFAN-marked fans.

</div> supports the conclusion that the cancellations were made for reasons independent of the alleged threats. In light of the foregoing, it was clear that, at least in the case of Kaze Lighting and Effi Home, the loss claimed by the defendant did not arise <span class="font-italic">as a result</span> of the alleged groundless threats. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">77 It is also unclear whether the cancellations effected by the other distributors, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, New Balestier Lighting and Noble Lighting House, were a result of the alleged groundless threats as no witness from these distributors took the stand to give evidence. As such, I find that the defendant has failed to establish a causative link between the alleged loss suffered by the cancellation of these orders and the plaintiff’s threats. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">78 I turn to the defendant’s claim for declaratory and injunctive relief. In my judgment, nothing in the evidence before me suggests that the plaintiff would persist in making further threats of infringement proceedings such as to justify injunctive relief. In terms of declaratory relief, it is also unnecessary for me to grant the said relief as the plaintiff’s infringement claim has been rejected. In the words of the CA in <span class="font-italic">Singsung</span> at [149] (where declaratory relief under s 200(1) of the Copyright Act (Cap 63, 2006 Rev Ed) was rejected): “To put it shortly, the appellant sued and lost and there is nothing more that needs to be said or done in this regard”. I therefore dismiss the defendant’s claim under s 35(1) of the TMA.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">79 As the defendant has succeeded in its counterclaim for invalidation of the registration of the plaintiff’s COFAN mark in Classes 9 and 11 on the ground of bad faith under s 7(6) of the TMA, I grant an order in terms of prayer (1) of the defendant’s counterclaim and order that the plaintiff’s COFAN mark be expunged from the register. Accordingly, I dismiss the plaintiff’s claim in its entirety. However, as the defendant has not established that relief under s 35(2) of the TMA should be granted, no order in respect of prayers (2) to (4) of the defendant’s counterclaim is made. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">80 I will hear the parties separately on costs. </div><table class="table table-sm table-borderless"><tbody><tr><td><div class="txt-body text-left">Dedar Singh Gill<br/>Judge of the High Court</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-left"></div></td></tr></tbody></table><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Sarbrinder Singh s/o Naranjan Singh and Tay Yu E (Sanders Law LLC) for the plaintiff and defendant in counterclaim;</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Kang Choon Hwee Alban, Oh Pin-Ping and Loy Ming Chuen Brendan (Bird &amp; Bird ATMD LLP) for the defendant and plaintiff in counterclaim.</div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
