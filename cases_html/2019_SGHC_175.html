The alleged defects include water seepage in a number of rooms, rain ingress on the first floor, and an irregularly designed and built staircase.

</div> A total of 492 defects are alleged by the plaintiff (“general defects”). In addition to general defects, the plaintiff also alleges that the defendant supplied defective home passenger and car lifts for the Property (“lift defects”). Among other things, the plaintiff is claiming damages for the costs of rectification works.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">4 The defendant admits that there were a number of defects in the Property. However, it argues that it had a contractual right to rectify the defects under the SPA during the defects liability period but was prevented by the plaintiff from exercising that right. It claims that the plaintiff had imposed a number of unreasonable conditions on the defendant and did not ultimately grant access to the defendant to carry out the rectification works. The defendant submits that the plaintiff is therefore precluded from claiming damages in respect of the defects which it would have rectified but for the plaintiff’s actions. The defendant also claims that some of the defects alleged by the plaintiff do not constitute defects.

As the evidence adduced was sufficient for me to make a decision on: (a) the defendant’s liability for the defects in the Property; and (b) the defendant’s counterclaim in defamation, I directed counsel to make submissions on these two issues.  Parties filed written submissions on 8 April 2019.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">6 Having considered the evidence and the submissions made by the parties, I find that the defendant has breached the SPA since the Property contained numerous defects. In addition, the plaintiff has breached the defects liability clause of the SPA by impeding the defendant’s access to the Property to perform rectification works. Such breach does not however remove the plaintiff’s right to recover damages under common law but would be relevant in the assessment of the quantum of damages that the plaintiff is entitled to. The extent of the defects which the defendant is liable for and the precise quantum of damages are to be determined at the second tranche of the trial after the taking of evidence on all the defects is completed.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">7 As regards the counterclaim, the plaintiff admitted to one of the three meanings pleaded by the defendant. I am satisfied that one other meaning was made out. Of these two meanings, I find that the plaintiff succeeded on the defence of justification in respect of one of them but failed in relation to the other. The plaintiff also pleaded the defence of fair comment for this latter meaning. Although I hold the words constitute fair comment, I find malice on the part of the plaintiff and therefore this defence fails. However I award nominal damages of $1,000 to the defendant as I am satisfied that the defendant has not suffered any substantive damages in view of the fact that it is a company formed for the purpose of developing the properties at Sandy Island in Sentosa, and there was no evidence of further business activity after the sale of all the units in the development.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Facts </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">8 On 29 December 2011, the Building and Construction Authority (“BCA”) issued the temporary occupation permit (“TOP”) for the Property.

At the most, the plaintiff’s breach of the defects liability clause is relevant to the issue of mitigation of loss and the quantum of damages recoverable by the plaintiff. It does not remove the plaintiff’s right to recover damages in totality.

As to whether the defendant has also breached other express terms of the SPA and/or the implied term alleged by the plaintiff, the issue is rendered moot given my finding that the defects in the Property, to the extent that they are admitted by the defendant, constitute a breach of cl 10.1.

While the plaintiff had taken photographs of the defects and informed the defendant in his first email of 5 April 2012 that he would be sending a CD with the photographs via courier to the defendant, he eventually declined to provide the photographs to the defendant (see [10] above). The plaintiff testified under cross-examination that he did so because he had difficulty cross-referencing the photographs taken with the locations of the defects in the Property.

</div> However, I find the plaintiff’s explanation not credible given that in the defects list sent on 5 April 2012, he included a column referencing a photograph number for a majority of the listed defects.

That the plaintiff was dissatisfied with the defendant’s characterisation of some of his requests for rectifications as requests for enhancements was clear. Even after the plaintiff carried out a second tender exercise, the parties were still at a disagreement on the items which the defendant was liable to rectify. The plaintiff wanted the defendant to perform all items of work as stated in and in compliance with Mr Goshawk’s tender specifications while the defendant was willing to proceed only on the basis of a subset of the same (see [26] above).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">102 Notwithstanding the disagreement between the parties, the plaintiff should have allowed the defendant to rectify the defects that it was willing to rectify, while reserving his position on the rest of the items which were disputed by the defendant: <span class="font-italic">Yap Boon Keng Sonny </span><span class="font-italic">v Pacific Prince International Pte Ltd and another</span> [2008] 1 SLR(R) 285 (“<span class="font-italic">Sonny Yap</span>”) (at [114]). In this case, the defendant had, on numerous occasions, expressed its intention to rectify the admitted defects and requested access to perform the rectification works. This was the case at an early stage in May 2012 when the defendant was first notified of the defects (see [14] above), and when the defendant provided its method statements to the plaintiff. Even when the defendant offered the plaintiff a monetary settlement in December 2012 after its method statements had been rejected by the plaintiff, it made clear to the plaintiff that it was willing and able to perform the works in the event the offer was rejected by him (see [17] above). Moreover, after the second tender exercise, the defendant was still willing to perform a subset of items in the tender specifications under the supervision of the plaintiff’s architect (see [25]–[26] above).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">103 At the end of the day, while the plaintiff’s dissatisfaction with the Property was understandable, he was still contractually obliged under cl 17 of the SPA to give the defendant an opportunity to rectify the defects that the defendant had agreed to rectify. The plaintiff had failed to do so.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Issue 2: Whether the plaintiff has a common law right to claim damages </span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Case law</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">104 On the issue of the legal implications of the plaintiff’s breach of the defects liability clause of the SPA, the defendant relied on the decision of the High Court in <span class="font-italic">Sonny Yap</span> for the position that such breach removed the plaintiff’s right to claim damages. On the other hand, the plaintiff relied on the decision of the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Management Corporation Strata Title Plan No 1993 v Liang Huat Aluminium</span> [2001] 2 SLR(R) 91 (“<span class="font-italic">Liang Huat </span><span class="font-italic">Aluminium</span>”) and the English case of <span class="font-italic">Pearce and High Ltd v Baxter</span> [1999] CLC 749 (“<span class="font-italic">Pearce</span>”), as cited in <span class="font-italic">Liang Huat Aluminium</span>.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">105 In <span class="font-italic">Sonny Yap</span>, the plaintiff homeowner entered into a Memorandum of Agreement with a contractor for the latter to design and construct a semi-detached house. The homeowner commenced suit against the contractor for defective works. The contractor’s defence was <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span> that the homeowner breached the maintenance clause of the parties’ contract by unreasonably refusing to allow the contractor to access the property during the maintenance period to carry out repair works. The homeowner’s position – somewhat akin to that of the plaintiff in the present case – was that he did not act unreasonably in refusing to grant access to the contractor as he did not agree with the contractor’s assessment of whether some items constituted defects and with the remedial actions proposed. He also claimed that he had lost confidence in the contractor.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">106 The High Court held that the homeowner was contractually obligated to allow the contractor to rectify the undisputed defects during the maintenance period. To the extent that he did not, he was in breach of contract (at [115]). Further, it was held that the consequence of the homeowner’s failure to grant access to the contractor was that he could not recover the costs of rectifying those defects (at [130]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">I have found that the plaintiff was unreasonable in not permitting [the contractor] to have access to remedy those defects that [the contractor] recognised. The consequence of this finding must be that the plaintiff cannot now recover the cost of rectifying those defects from [the contractor]. There were, however, other defects which [the contractor] did not recognise as defects and was not willing to rectify and which I have now found to be defects. The cost of rectifying those defects must be borne by [the contractor] …</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">107 The case of <span class="font-italic">Liang Huat Aluminium </span>involved a dispute between a property owner and a sub-contractor over defects in a property. In that case, the plaintiff MCST (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the property owner) did not deny access to the sub-contractor to carry out rectification works. On the contrary, the sub-contractor in that case refused to perform the rectification works requested by the MCST. The MCST instituted proceedings against the sub-contractor before proceeding with rectification works. The issue in that case was whether the MCST could advance a claim against the sub-contractor before it incurred the costs of rectification.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">108 Although the relevant issue before the court in <span class="font-italic">Liang Huat Aluminium</span> was strictly speaking not the same as that in the present case, the legal principles set out by the Court of Appeal are nevertheless relevant. This is because in determining the issue before it, the Court of Appeal considered the question of whether a property owner’s right to be reimbursed for the costs it incurred in rectifying defects, as conferred under an express clause of a building contract, could have the effect of supplanting the property owner’s right at common law to claim damages against the contractor. In <span class="font-italic">Liang Huat Aluminium</span>, the relevant clauses on defects in the parties’ deed read as follows (at [11], [32]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">2. In the event of any deterioration or defects … the Contractor (**) shall forthwith upon notice given to either of them and within such time as the Employer [i<span class="font-italic">e</span>, the MCST] may direct, effect remedial works to the defective area or areas and shall make good to the absolute satisfaction of the Employer all damages … arising directly or indirectly out of the said defects.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">3. In the event that remedial works undertaken by the Contractor or the Sub-Contractor prove ineffective as determined by the Employer … the Contractor and the Sub-Contractor shall effect such additional works in such a manner and within such time as the Employer may direct and shall carry out all test, as directed by the Employer until all the defects have been remedied to the absolute satisfaction of the Employer.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">4. Should the Contractor or the Sub-Contractor fail to perform their obligations under Clause 2 and 3 above within the time directed by the Employer or in the absence of such direction, within a reasonable period, the Employer shall [<span class="font-italic">sic</span>] entitled to remedy the said defects and the Contractor and the Sub-Contractor shall forthwith on demand reimburse the Employer all costs and expenses incurred by the Employer for making good the said defects including all legal costs on a Solicitor and Client basis incurred by the Employer in enforcing this Clause.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">109 The Court of Appeal held that even if the parties’ deed was in the nature of an indemnity, it did not follow that in the event of a breach of cll 2 or 3 of the deed, the MCST’s right against the contractor/sub-contractor was confined only to a claim for reimbursement under cl 4 (at [16]). While cl 4 gave the MCST a right to claim the costs incurred for remedial works it had undertaken, it did not, by its express terms or by implication, take away the MCST’s common law right of action for damages for breach of contract (at [18]–[19]). In holding that cl 4 did not supplant the MCST’s common law right to recover damages for breach of contract, the Court of Appeal referred, amongst others, to the English case of <span class="font-italic">Pearce</span> (at [21]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">110 In <span class="font-italic">Pearce</span>, the homeowner (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the employer) in a building contract failed to give notice of the defects to the contractor during the defects liability period as required under cl 2.5 of the parties’ contract. The first instance judge held that as the defects were not notified within the defects liability period, the homeowner was not entitled to rely on cl 2.5 to seek payment from the contractor to remedy the defects. On appeal, the English Court of Appeal held that cl 2.5 did not take away the right of the homeowner to claim damages for breach of contract, since there were no express words in the contract to such effect. The appeal was therefore allowed. Evans LJ cited with approval the decision of <span class="font-italic">William Tomkinson &amp; Sons Ltd </span><span class="font-italic">v Parochial Church Council of St Michael </span>[1990] CLJ 319 (at 752–753).

<div class="FootnoteRef text-justify">  Plaintiff’s Bundle of Authorities for Opening Statement Tab 8. </div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The recorder proceeded from his finding that notice should be given, to hold that if no notice is given during the period then the employer loses all right to recover damages for the defects which have become apparent. This view, if it is correct, gives the clause a particular potency. The existence of the defect means that there was a breach of contract by the contractors. That clearly is the effect of the opening words. That breach gave the employers, subject to the contract terms, a right to recover damages, but they would have no right to require the contractors to rectify the defect, apart from the theoretical and speculative possibility that in certain circumstances the court might order specific performance of the contractor’s obligation which had been broken. <span class="font-italic">Clause 2.5 gives the employers an express right to require the contractor to return, as well as to the contractor himself the right to return and repair the defect himself, if he is willing to do so. There are no words of exclusion, yet the effect of the clause, if the judgment is correct, is that the employer’s right to damages in respect of the cost of repairs is lost for all time. It is unnecessary to cite authority for the proposition that such a right cannot be excluded except by clear, express words or by a clear and strong implication from the express words used.</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>[Emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">111 At the same time, the English Court of Appeal recognised that the cost of employing a third-party repairer was likely to be higher than the cost to the contractor from doing the work himself. It was held in <span class="font-italic">Pearce </span>that this would be taken into account in the assessment of damages by reducing the damages awarded to the plaintiff to the costs that would have been incurred by the defendant had it been given an opportunity to rectify the defects (at 752):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… The cost of employing a third party repairer is likely to be higher than the cost to the contractor of doing the work himself would have been. So the right to return in order to repair the defect is valuable to him. The question arises whether, if he is denied that right, the employer is entitled to employ another party and to recover the full cost of doing so as damages for the contractor’s original breach.</div><div class="txt-body text-justify"></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">In my judgment, the contractor is not liable for the full cost of repairs in those circumstances. The employer cannot recover more than the amount which it would have cost the contractor himself to remedy the defects.</div><div class="txt-body text-justify"></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Thus, the employer’s failure to comply with cl 2.5 whether by refusing to allow the contractor to carry out the repairs or by failing to give notice of the defects, limits the amount of damages which he is entitled to recover. This result is achieved as a matter of legal analysis by permitting the contractor to set off against the employer’s damages claim the amount by which he, the contractor, has been disadvantaged by not being able or permitted to carry out the repairs himself, or more simply, by reference to the employer’s duty to mitigate his loss.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Finding</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">112 In my judgment, the approach in <span class="font-italic">Pearce</span>, which was affirmed by the Singapore Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Liang Huat Aluminium</span> should be adopted. Thus, a defects liability clause does not extinguish a plaintiff’s right to recover damages under common law unless there is express language to the contrary in the contract. A plaintiff’s departure from the requirements of a defects liability clause will affect the quantum of damages he is entitled to recover (under the principle of duty to mitigate), rather than exclude his right to claim damages altogether.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">113 Although the homeowner in <span class="font-italic">Sonny Yap</span> was not allowed to recover the costs of rectifying the defects which the contractor intended to rectify, from a review of the relevant facts and holdings in that case, I do not think that the case goes so far as to endorse the proposition put forward by the defendant in the present case, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, that a defects liability clause has the effect of supplanting the right to claim damages at common law. The plaintiff in <span class="font-italic">Sonny Yap</span> denied that he was in breach of the maintenance clause. He did not argue in the alternative that he was entitled to damages at common law even if he was found to have breached the clause (see [109] to [113]). In this regard, neither the case of <span class="font-italic">Pearce</span> nor <span class="font-italic">Liang Huat Aluminium</span> was considered in <span class="font-italic">Sonny Yap</span>. I therefore do not read <span class="font-italic">Sonny Yap</span> as suggesting that a departure from the English approach as set out in <span class="font-italic">Pearce</span> is appropriate.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">114 Further and in any event, I am of the view that the approach set out in <span class="font-italic">Pearce</span> is sound. First, the approach is consistent with the principle that a common law right cannot be abrogated unless by express wording. In <span class="font-italic">Gilbert-Ash (Northern) Limited v Modern Engineering (Bristol) Limited</span> [1974] AC 689, a case cited by the plaintiff, Lord Diplock stated that in construing contracts, “one starts with the presumption that neither party intends to abandon any remedies for its breach arising by operation of law, and clear express words must be used in order to rebut this presumption” (at 717). Second, the fact that the requirements of the defects liability clause have not been fulfilled by the property owner does not detract from the fact that the contractor has breached its contractual obligation (in this case, under cl 10.1 of the SPA), which gives the property owner a right to claim damages. At the same time, under the <span class="font-italic">Pearce</span> approach, the contractor’s right (here, the developer’s right) to make good the defects at its own cost is recognised through a calibration of the quantum of damages awarded to the property owner, at the assessment of damages stage.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">115 In addition, there is support for the <span class="font-italic">Pearce</span> approach in academic literature. The learned author of <span class="font-italic">Building Contract Law in Singapore</span> (Edwin Lee Peng Khoon, 3rd Ed, LexisNexis 2016) states (at p 217):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">In [<span class="font-italic">William Tomkinson &amp; Sons Ltd v Parochial Church Council of St Michael </span>[1990] CLJ 319], it was held that during the defects liability period, despite no notice and opportunity having been given to the contractor to rectify the defects, the contractor was nonetheless still liable for the defects — except that the damages to be awarded would be reduced to what it would have cost the contractor to rectify had it been given the proper notice; rather than the actual cost of rectification incurred by the employer by engaging a third party contractor to do so. The latter decision, which was not raised and considered in the [<span class="font-italic">Sonny Yap</span>] decision, may be more sound in principle since the failure to provide access does not negate the fact that the works were defective in the first place. Hence damages should be awarded to the extent that it places parties back into the position of what it would have been the case had proper access been given.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">116 Likewise, in <span class="font-italic">Hudson’s Building and Engineering Contracts</span> (Nicholas Dennys &amp; Robert Clay gen ed, 13th Ed, Sweet &amp; Maxwell 2015), the learned authors state (at paras 4-095 to 4-096):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The cases show that in the absence of the clearest wording, the defects liability obligations in modern standard forms will not normally be interpreted as creating an exclusive remedy which displaces the Employer’s common law right to damages for defective work.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Thus failure to give notice under the clause or carrying out repairs by another Contractor will not prevent a claim for damages.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">However, the existence of a defects liability clause may make it reasonable for an Employer to mitigate its loss by notifying the Contractor of the defects so that they are repaired by the Contractor. Thus, where the Employer does not provide the Contractor with a contractual opportunity to rectify defects during the defects liability period, the Employer can still recover the cost of repairing the defects, but the sum that the Employer can recover may be limited to how much it would have cost the Contractor to rectify the defects.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">117 In the present case, cl 17 of the SPA does not contain clear words to exclude the plaintiff’s right to claim damages at common law. Thus, for the foregoing reasons, I find that notwithstanding the plaintiff’s breach of cl 17, the plaintiff has a right to claim damages at common law against the defendant for the defects in the Property. As for the precise manner and extent in which the plaintiff’s breach of cl 17 reduces the damages he is entitled to, this will be determined after the second tranche of the trial, when the taking of evidence in respect of all of the defects has been completed. I note for the time-being that the defendant has claimed that since it would have cost the defendant nothing at all to rectify the said defects (given that YTL was allegedly obligated to rectify the defects at no cost to the defendant), the plaintiff cannot claim for any damages in respect of the rectification works even on an application of the <span class="font-italic">Pearce</span> approach.

The defendant was contractually obliged to ensure that the car lift met the applicable regulatory standards and the onus was on them to deal with the inconsistencies in the information conveyed by the BCA. In any event, from a review of the chain of correspondence as summarised in the preceding paragraph, it should have been clear to the defendant that there was a possibility that BCA may have been operating under the impression, in its assessment of the waiver application, that the car lift was not intended to carry passengers when in fact it was. The correspondence from the BCA in 2014 seemed to suggest this as well. In a letter dated 5 June 2014 sent to another homeowner on Sandy Island, the BCA stated:

There were also other factors supporting such a conclusion. Firstly, BCA’s letter in 2014 to another homeowner on Sandy Island (see [124] above) stated that it required the car lifts on Sandy Island to be “regularised” to meet an acceptable standard, which suggested that prior to the modifications, the car lifts did not meet the applicable standard.

</div> Secondly, as the plaintiff submitted, it was illogical for the car lift to be certified in accordance with the Workplace Safety Regulations as the regulation was intended to apply to lifting equipment “used in a workplace” (such as a factory) while the car lift was meant to be used in a residential home. This was a point which appeared to be acknowledged by the defendant’s own lift expert.

</div>
</div>  I said it is a curious point because not only did the plaintiff not plead that the Statements do not refer to the defendant but to another entity called YTL, the plaintiff in fact admitted to meaning (b) in his Defence to Counterclaim. Meaning (b) expressly states that it was the defendant who had constructed a property with serious defects and flaws. Furthermore, the denials in relation to meaning (a) and meaning (c) pertained to the substance and not the target of the allegations. Had this been pleaded by the plaintiff, and therefore put in issue at the outset, the defendant would have had an opportunity to adduce evidence that the reference to “YTL” was understood to refer to the defendant. It is therefore not possible for the plaintiff to make such a submission after the trial on liability is over.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">137 In respect of meaning (a), I am unable to find that the words, in their natural and ordinary meaning read in the context of the entire passage cited, bore the meaning that the defendant had misrepresented to the plaintiff regarding the quality of the house. For a representation to constitute a misrepresentation, which connotes untruthfulness and dishonesty, the person making it must be aware, or is of the belief, that it is not true. The words “I was told by the salesman that it was of top quality and it was a nice development” followed by “What I discovered is that it was not so” and “I was surprised and have never seen anything like this in terms of the scale and extent of the defects. I’m more aggrieved by the substantial defects such as the water ingress and bathroom doors” do not, in the context of the entire article, suggest to the ordinary reader that when the salesman made those statements, he knew that the Property was not of top quality or that it was not a nice development. Moreover, the context of the article indicates that it is a newly-built property and that the plaintiff had purchased it before it was built. An ordinary reader of the article would not impute the salesman with knowledge of what will happen upon completion of the Property at a future date. While the representation might have eventually turned out to be untrue, it would not be reasonable to impute any dishonesty in his sales pitch.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">138 As for meaning (c), I find that it is made out, particularly by the words “YTL wants to do the repairs but if they use the same people, same materials and same methods, the problems will reappear”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">139 I find that meanings (b) and (c) would lower the estimation of the defendant in the minds of right-thinking members of the community.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">140 The plaintiff pleaded the defences of justification and fair comment.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">141 In relation to the defence of justification, based on the findings I have made in the trial, I hold that the plaintiff has proved the truth of meaning (b), <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the defendant had constructed a property with serious defects and flaws. Specifically, the extent of the defects which have been admitted by the defendant in the trial was sufficient for me to make such a finding. However, the plaintiff has not proven the truth of meaning (c). The defendant was not given the opportunity to rectify the defects and there was no other evidence that showed it was not capable of undertaking the repair works satisfactorily. The plaintiff claims that his statement that if the defendant “uses the same people, same materials and same methods, the problems will reappear” was made after ineffective methods had been employed by the defendant including (a) applying sealant to water leakage areas in the roof terrace and master lounge window; (b) applying sealant to the external façade of the building; and (c) cutting a groove in the flooring to rectify water ponding in the courtyard.

</div> These works were at the most part of the original defective works by the defendant’s contractors. Therefore, the defence of justification succeeds in respect of meaning (b) and fails for meaning (c).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">142 I turn to the defence of fair comment. To succeed, the plaintiff must show that the statement is a comment based on facts that a fair-minded person can honestly make on the facts proved. The comment must be on a matter of public interest and the plaintiff must not be motivated by malice.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">143 In relation to meaning (b), as I have found that the defence of justification succeeds, it is not necessary to consider the defence of fair comment. In any event my finding on malice below would apply and prevent the plaintiff from successfully relying on the defence of fair comment.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">144 In respect of meaning (c), it is capable of being construed as a comment as the meaning is derived from the words “if they use the same people, same materials and same methods, the problems will reappear”. I find this to be a comment that can be made by a fair-minded person in the circumstances of this case. Although the defendant submitted that this subject was not a matter of public interest contemplated in the law of libel, I am of the opposite view. The defendant was a developer of properties for sale to the public at large. It does not matter that the market it was in was at the ultra-high end. It is in the public interest to be informed of the quality of the properties purveyed by a developer to the public at large. I therefore hold that this pertained to a matter of public interest.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">145 However, I find that the plaintiff was actuated by malice. The plaintiff had threatened to subject the defendant to negative publicity if the defendant did not resolve the matter to his satisfaction.

</div> His motive in doing this was clearly for that purpose. Therefore, the defence of fair comment in relation to meaning (c) also fails. To the extent that meaning (b) can amount to fair comment, the presence of malice would also defeat this defence. Therefore, the defendant succeeds in proving that the plaintiff had defamed it, on meaning (c).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">146 I turn to the issue of damages. The defendant is a commercial corporate entity. Damages recoverable in defamation would be in terms of the injury to its trading reputation, without any notion of injury to a claimant’s feelings available to a natural person. In <span class="font-italic">Qingdao </span><span class="font-italic">Bohai Construction Group Co, Ltd and others v Goh Teck Beng and another </span>[2016] 4 SLR 977, Belinda Ang J stated that “[u]nlike individuals, a corporate plaintiff is not presumed to have a reputation; it must prove that it has a reputation that is capable of being injured by the alleged libel” (at [50]). Although the plaintiff submitted that the defendant had not adduced any evidence of its reputation,

</div> there is evidence in the trial of the defendant’s activities as the developer of the properties on Sandy Island in Sentosa and it can be inferred from the nature of the properties successfully marketed by the defendant that it has acquired some degree of reputation. However, the plaintiff submitted that the defendant was “a one-ship company that was incorporated for the development of Sandy Island on Sentosa”. Again, from the evidence, this appears to be the case, a point that the defendant did not specifically counter in its submissions. Indeed the defendant confirmed that it was the developer of Sandy Island but added, somewhat enigmatically, that the plaintiff’s defamatory words “would certainly damage it in the way of its business, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, property development.”
