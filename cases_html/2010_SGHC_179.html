<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       This is an appeal against the decision of the
                    district judge in [2009] SGDC 511 convicting the appellant of one
                    charge of consuming a controlled drug, <em>viz</em>
                    norketamine, in contravention of s 8(b)(i) of the Misuse of Drugs Act
                    (Cap 185, 2008 Rev Ed) (“the Act”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       In the course of this appeal, the parties had
                    initially raised a number of points of law of general importance which had
                    hitherto not been considered in a reported decision of our courts. First,
                    whether the testing of the appellant’s urine samples, as described in the
                    trial below, complied with the requirements laid down in s 31(4)(b) of the
                    Act, so as to give rise to the presumption of consumption in s 22. Second,
                    whether the presumption in s 16 relating to analysts’ certificates
                    could apply to prove that the appellant’s urine samples contained
                    norketamine if the s 22 presumption did not apply (because the
                    s 31(4)(b) requirements were not complied with). Third, whether the
                    appellant’s confession <em>per se</em> was of any
                    evidential value in deciding whether he <em>in fact</em>
                    took norketamine.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       In light of the prosecution’s confinement
                    of its case, which I will elaborate upon below, it has become unnecessary for me
                    to make findings on all these issues. However, it is plain that the above issues
                    are pertinent to the proper administration of our drug laws and the
                    investigation of drug offences. I would therefore deal fully with all the points
                    of law which have been raised, in addition to making the findings necessary to
                    dispose of this appeal.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Background</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       The appellant, Mr Lim Boon Keong, claimed
                    trial to the following charge:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">You, LIM BOON KEONG, MALE / 25 YRS DOB: 07.09.1983 NRIC No. S8330833H
                        are charged that you, on or about the 4th day of February 2008, in
                        Singapore, did consume a Specified Drug listed in the Fourth Schedule to the
                        Misuse of Drugs Act, Chapter 185, to wit, norketamine, without authorisation
                        under the said Act or the Regulations made thereunder and you have thereby
                        committed an offence under Section 8(b)(ii) of the Misuse of Drugs Act,
                        Chapter 185.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       On 4 February 2008, at about 11.50 am, the
                    appellant was arrested at No 4 Lorong 22 Geylang in the course of a raid by
                    a group of officers from the Criminal Investigations Department of the Singapore
                    Police Force. He was brought to the Police Cantonment Complex for further
                    investigations, and a specimen of urine was taken from him, which was divided
                    into three bottles. The urine in one of the bottles was tested by the Instant
                    Urine Test Machine. The other two bottles were sealed in the presence of the
                    appellant and sent to the Health Sciences Authority (“HSA”) for
                    further testing. After the testing and further investigations, the above charge
                    was preferred against the appellant on 20 March 2008.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       At the trial below, the prosecution produced two
                    certificates purported to be signed by two analysts from the HSA. The first
                    certificate was dated 25 February 2008 and was purported to be signed by
                    one Kuan Soo Yan (“Ms Kuan”). It stated that, on analysis,
                    the urine sample of the appellant was found to contain norketamine at a
                    concentration of 7640 nanograms per millilitre. The second certificate was dated
                    27 February 2008 and was signed by one Tan Joo Chin
                    (“Ms Tan”). It stated that, on analysis, the urine sample of
                    the appellant was found to contain norketamine at a concentration of 6630
                    nanograms per millilitre. Both Ms Kuan and Ms Tan were analysts with
                    the Illicit Drugs and Toxicology Division of the HSA at the material time. A
                    large part of the trial concerned whether the appellant’s urine samples
                    were tested in accordance with s 31(4)(b) of the Act. In this connection,
                    the prosecution called Ms Tan to testify; it was unable to call
                    Ms Kuan because she had emigrated to the United Kingdom. The prosecution
                    also called Dr Lui Chi Pang (“Dr Lui”), the director of
                    the Illicit Drugs and Toxicology Division, to testify generally on the urine
                    testing procedures employed by the HSA. I note here that the certificates used
                    “sample” while s 31(4) refers to “specimen”.
                    Nothing turns on the difference in wording, but for convenience I will use
                    sample since this was the term used by the witnesses in giving
                evidence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       The prosecution also produced the statement made
                    by the appellant on 20 March 2008 after the notice required by s 122(6) of
                    the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 1985 Rev Ed) was served on him.
                    The appellant’s cautioned statement read in its entirety as
                    follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I admit to my guilt and hope for a lighter sentence. I am married with 3
                        kids and I hope that I can be given a chance. I also have aged parents whom
                        I visit often because my mother has difficulty walking.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The caution was made and the cautioned statement recorded by Sergeant
                    Amos Yap Hon Chian (“Sgt Yap”), the investigating officer for
                    the appellant’s case, who was called as a prosecution witness. It was not
                    in dispute that, prior to recording the appellant’s cautioned statement,
                    Sgt Yap had recorded a “long statement” from the appellant
                    pursuant to s 121 of the Criminal Procedure Code. It was also not in
                    dispute that the long statement recorded the appellant’s purported
                    explanation that the norketamine was found in his urine because he mistakenly
                    took some sips of a drink from a glass placed on the table at the Geylang
                    premises where he was arrested. The appellant’s counsel, Mr S K
                    Kumar (“Mr Kumar”), applied for the long statement but the
                    district judge ruled that the appellant was not entitled to it. The district
                    judge also ruled after a <em>voir dire</em> that the
                    appellant’s cautioned statement, quoted above, was
                admissible.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       When called upon by the district judge to enter
                    his defence at the close of the prosecution’s case, the appellant elected
                    to remain silent and did not call any witness in his defence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       After considering the evidence, the district
                    judge determined that norketamine was found in the appellant’s urine as a
                    result of both urine tests conducted under s 31(4)(b) of the Act, thus
                    giving rise to the presumption under s 22 that the appellant had consumed
                    the norketamine in contravention of s 8(b). In the alternative, the
                    district judge admitted Ms Kuan’s certificate as proof of its
                    contents, <em>ie</em> that the appellant’s urine
                    sample contained norketamine, via s 16 of the Act. Separately, the district
                    judge found that appellant’s refusal to give evidence in his defence gave
                    rise to an adverse inference that the confession in the appellant’s
                    cautioned statement was true and reliable. In the circumstances, the district
                    judge found the appellant guilty of the charge and convicted him accordingly. As
                    the appellant had a previous conviction under s 8(b)(i) of the Act, he was
                    liable for enhanced punishment under s 33(4), and the district judge
                    accordingly sentenced him to the minimum three years’
                imprisonment.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     Specifically, the district judge found that
                    the tests of the appellant’s urine samples complied with s 31(4)(b)
                    because:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_10-p2_a"></a>(a)     Both Ms Tan and Ms Kuan
                        had independently reviewed and certified the test results for each of the
                        appellant’s urine samples. They were also personally responsible for
                        their respective certificates. They can therefore be said to have had
                        conduct of the test of the respective urine samples of the
                    appellant.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_10-p2_b"></a>(b)     Regulation 5(2) of the Misuse of Drugs (Urine Specimens and Urine Tests)
                        Regulations (Cap 185, Rg 6, 1999 Rev Ed) (“the
                        Regulations”) has been satisfied because the two urine samples of the
                        appellant were tested by different laboratory officers.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_10-p2_c"></a>(c)     It was immaterial that analysts and
                        laboratory officers, including Ms Tan and Ms Kuan, had supervised
                        the testing of the two urine samples interchangeably. Section 31(4)(b)
                        only required an independent review of the results, and this was satisfied
                        here.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     In the same proceedings, the appellant also
                    pleaded guilty to a charge under s 7 of the Common Gaming Houses Act
                    (Cap 49, 1985 Rev Ed), and a charge under s 267B of the Penal
                    Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed). Mr Kumar informed me that fines were
                    imposed in respect of these charges and have since been paid.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Issues on appeal</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     Before going into the substance, it is first
                    necessary to set out in some detail the rather curious course which this appeal
                    has taken.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     When this appeal first came before me, the
                    following issues were presented for decision:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_13-p2_a"></a>(a)     Whether norketamine was found in the
                        appellant’s urine samples as a result of both urine tests conducted
                        under section 31(4)(b) of the Act, thus giving rise to the presumption in
                        s 22;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_13-p2_b"></a>(b)     If
                        s 22 does not apply, whether the presumption in s 16 can be relied
                        upon to prove that the appellant’s urine contained
                    norketamine;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_13-p2_c"></a>(c)     Whether the appellant can be convicted on the basis of his confession
                        and/or the drawing of an adverse inference from his silence at
                    trial.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">As can readily be seen, this involved a
                    reconsideration of all aspects of the district judge’s
                judgment.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     After hearing the parties’ oral
                    submissions on 12 March 2010, I directed the parties to address me on four
                    specific points:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_14-p2_a"></a>(a)     Whether reg 5(2) of the
                        Regulations is <em>ultra vires s </em>31(4)(b) of
                        the Act;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_14-p2_b"></a>(b)     Whether the presumption under s 16 can arise if the presumption under
                        s 22 does not arise as a result of non-compliance with s 31(4)(b)
                        (this was an issue from the beginning but in my view the parties had not
                        addressed it satisfactorily);</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_14-p2_c"></a>(c)     Whether there exist precedents where an accused person
                        had been convicted of an offence of consumption solely on the strength of
                        his confession (and in particular without any certification by a HSA
                        analyst);</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_14-p2_d"></a>(d)     The
                        differences in qualification between a HSA analyst and a HSA laboratory
                        officer.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     On 4 May 2010 following receipt of the
                    further submissions, I directed the parties to address me on four additional
                    points:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_15-p2_a"></a>(a)     Can a person make an admission on
                        something which he has no knowledge of or is not familiar
                    with?</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_15-p2_b"></a>(b)     Can the
                        nature of a controlled drug be proven on the basis of a bare admission
                        alone? If not, what further proof is required?</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_15-p2_c"></a>(c)     Who bears the burden of showing that an accused
                        person’s admission as to the nature of a controlled drug is not
                        sufficiently probative?</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_15-p2_d"></a>(d)     Is the appellant precluded by his stance in the
                        proceedings below (both in the <em>voir dire</em> and
                        the main trial) from arguing now that he was not familiar with the
                        controlled drug norketamine?</p>
<p class="Judg-1">I also referred the parties
                    to some cases in this area which I had identified through my own
                    research.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     The parties addressed these points fully in
                    their further oral submissions on 6 May 2010. On 10 June 2010, more
                    than a month after the parties made their further oral submissions, the Public
                    Prosecutor sent a letter to the Registry of the Supreme Court, the relevant
                    parts of which read as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Please refer to the above-captioned appeal, which was last heard by the
                        Honourable Justice Steven Chong on 6 May 2010 in the High Court.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">2    We also refer to the
                            letter from the Supreme Court Registry, dated 4 May 2010, wherein
                            his Honour directed parties to address the court on four
                        issues.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">3    We have reviewed the matter
                            further and have considered the observations that have been made by His
                            Honour. Given the nature of these observations and having regard also
                            the questions raised, the matter has been brought to the attention of
                            the Senior Management of these Chambers. The further review with Senior
                            Management has made it clear to us that the evidence adduced at trial to
                            explain the process involved in the testing of urine specimens by the
                            Health Sciences Authority (the “HSA”) was not complete. We
                            have considered making an application to adduce further evidence and if
                            necessary for the matter to be remitted to the trial judge for this
                            purpose. Such further evidence on the process would have established, in
                            our respectful view, that the process adopted in this case is in line
                            with what is internationally accepted and adequately satisfies the
                            requirement of s 31(4)(b) of the Misuse of Drugs Act
                            (Cap 185)(the “MDA”). However, in all fairness to the
                            Defence, we have come to the view that it may not be appropriate for us
                            to make such an application at this late stage. At the same time, given
                            that not all the relevant evidence was adduced, it is also our view that
                            this would not be an appropriate case for His Honour to rule on the
                            applicability of the presumption in s 22 of the MDA on the facts of
                            this case. Our principal concern is that, were such a ruling to be made,
                            it should be on the basis of all the relevant evidence being available
                            to the Court.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">4    We do apologise
                            for turning to this matter at this late stage but the questions asked
                            and the preliminary observations made by his [sic] Honour have prompted
                            our further review and this had led us to the conclusions summarised
                            above. Given the above circumstances, the Prosecution has decided that
                            it will not rely (in this appeal) on the presumption contained in
                            section 22 of the MDA to establish the appellant’s guilt beyond a
                            reasonable doubt. Accordingly, the Court will not have to rule on the
                            question of whether or not the testing of urine samples in this case did
                            or did not comply with s 31(4)(b) of the MDA; nor on the
                            applicability of the relevant statutory presumptions. As explained above
                            while the Prosecution firmly believes that the processes do comply with
                            the statutory requirements, yet, nevertheless, given that not all the
                            relevant evidence has been tendered, and having regard to the late stage
                            of the proceedings, the Prosecution believes that the most appropriate
                            course of action for it to take is not to rely on the presumptions in
                            this case at all, thus rendering it unnecessary for the Court to rule on
                            that issue. Instead, the Prosecution will solely rely on the
                            following:</p>

                                urine specimen was tested positive for norketamine to establish the
                                    <em>actus reus</em> of

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     On receipt of the Public Prosecutor’s
                    letter, I directed the parties to appear before me to seek further
                    clarifications arising from the letter. On 15 June 2010, I heard the
                    parties during which the prosecution clarified the following points:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_17-p2_a"></a>(a)     The prosecution confirmed that it
                        was withdrawing its reliance on the presumptions because the evidence
                        adduced below for this case was insufficient for the presumptions to
                        apply.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_17-p2_b"></a>(b)     The
                        withdrawal applies to both presumptions under s 16 and s 22 which
                        were relied on by the prosecution and accepted by the district judge
                        below.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_17-p2_c"></a>(c)     The
                        prosecution is relying on the appellant’s confession only for the
                        purpose of establishing the <em>mens rea</em> and not
                        for the <em>actus reus</em> of
                    consumption.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_17-p2_d"></a>(d)     The
                        prosecution will not be making further arguments on the remaining live
                        issues and will rest its case on the submissions already
                made.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     I must say that this is a most extraordinary
                    turn of events. With all due respect, this is not an entirely satisfactory
                    manner of managing a case which raises points of such general importance. In any
                    case, given the prosecution’s concession that the evidence adduced below
                    was insufficient to give rise to the presumptions and the consequent withdrawal
                    of its reliance on the presumption in s 22, it is strictly unnecessary for
                    me to make specific findings as to whether the appellant’s urine samples
                    were tested in accordance with s 31(4)(b). For obvious reasons,
                    Mr Kumar confirmed that the appellant had no objection to the
                    prosecution’s change of position.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     For the avoidance of doubt, in the light of
                    this development, the district judge’s decision is not to be regarded as
                    authority for the proposition that the HSA’s urine testing methodology, as
                    described in the trial below, is in compliance with s 31(4)(b). The point
                    is to be regarded as undecided.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     However, since the parties had fully argued
                    the relevant points of law, which are of general importance, I shall express my
                    views on them, in addition to addressing the issues necessary to dispose of this
                    appeal, as they stand after the letter from the Public Prosecutor and the
                    clarifications made on 15 June 2010.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The urine testing procedure in s 31(4)(b) and the presumption in
                ss 16 and 22</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The requirements of s 31(4)(b)</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     I first consider the urine testing procedure
                    in s 31(4)(b) and the presumption in s 22 which it is related to.
                    Section 22 of the Act provides that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>Presumption relating to urine test</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">22. If any controlled drug is found in the urine of a person as a result
                        of both urine tests conducted under section 31(4)( b), he shall be presumed,
                        until the contrary is proved, to have consumed that controlled drug in
                        contravention of section 8(b).</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Section 31(4) of the Act provides that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>Urine tests</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">31. —</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(4) A specimen of urine provided under this section shall be divided into
                        3 parts and dealt with, in such manner and in accordance with such procedure
                        as may be prescribed, as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(a) a preliminary urine test shall be conducted on one part of the urine
                        specimen; and</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(b) each of the remaining 2 parts of the urine specimen shall be marked
                        and sealed and a urine test shall be conducted on each part by a different
                        person, being either an analyst employed by the Health Sciences Authority or
                        any person as the Minister may, by notification in the Gazette, appoint for
                        such purpose.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     In order to understand the requirements of
                    s 31(4)(b) and its relation to s 22, it is essential to examine the
                    relevant history of the Act. For convenience, I will refer to the various Misuse
                    of Drugs (Amendment) Acts simply by their Act number and year.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     There was no presumption of consumption or
                    prescribed urine testing procedure when the Act was first enacted as Act 5 of
                    1973. The presumption of consumption was first introduced as s 19A by Act
                    49 of 1975. Section 19A, which is the progenitor of s 22, provided as
                    follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>Presumption relating to urine test</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">19A. If any controlled drug is found in the urine of a person as a result
                        of a urine test, he shall be presumed, until the contrary is proved, to have
                        consumed that controlled drug.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     While s 19A referred to a urine test,
                    there was no procedure prescribed in the Act on how such a test was to be
                    carried out. A procedure was first introduced later, as new subsections (4) and
                    (5) to s 28, by Act 12 of 1977. Those subsections provided as
                    follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>Urine tests</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">28. —</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(4) Any person who has been required to provide a specimen of his urine
                        for a urine test under subsection (1) of this section may, within such time
                        and in such manner as may be prescribed, apply for a second test of the
                        specimen of his urine which is kept for that purpose in accordance with any
                        regulations made under this Act…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(5) If as a result of any second test which has been conducted on the
                        application of any person under subsection (4) of this section it is found
                        that there is no controlled drug in the specimen of his urine, he shall be
                        immediately discharged from any approved institution in which he is
                        detained.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     It is pertinent to note that s 28(4) and
                    (5) were amendments introduced by the Minister at the committee stage of the
                    Bill, as a result of “a further study of the Bill [which] was made with a
                    view to providing safeguards for any possible abuse or errors by enforcement and
                    other officers in the taking and handling of urine samples and in their
                    analysis”. Specifically, s 28(4) and (5) were introduced to
                        (<em>Singapore Parliamentary Debates</em>, <em>Official Report</em> (9 November 1997) vol 37 at
                    col 171):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">enable any person whose urine specimen is found to contain a controlled
                        drug and who is dissatisfied with the result the right to apply for a second
                        test of the specimen which will be stored for the purpose. This is to give
                        the person a recourse if there is a mixup of his urine specimen in the
                        course of its taking, transportation and testing.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">It should be emphasised that, under the 1977 amendments, the second
                    test is <em>optional</em>, and need not be performed by a
                        <em>different</em> person.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     The safeguards provided by s 28(4) and
                    (5) were substantially fortified by Act 38 of 1989, which deleted the
                    subsections (by then renumbered as s 31(4) and (5) in the 1985 Reprint) as
                    they were enacted in 1977 and replaced them with an entirely new procedure, as
                    follows:</p>

                        accordance with such procedure as may be prescribed.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(5) A urine test shall be conducted by a Government chemist on one part of
                        a specimen of urine provided under this section and, at the same time or
                        soon thereafter, a second urine test shall be conducted on the other part of
                        the specimen of urine by <em>another Government
                            chemist</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The explanatory statement to the Bill explained that the new

                        be divided into two separate parts. A urine test will be conducted on each
                        part of the specimen by a different Government chemist. With this amendment,
                        it is not necessary for a suspected person to request for a second urine
                        test since <em>two independent urine tests will be made
                            mandatory</em>.</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     In the Second Reading of the Bill, the

                    that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Drug suspects are now required to provide two urine samples. One to be

                        addict. The suspected addict is detained in a DRC [<em>ie</em> a Drug Rehabilitation Centre] if the first specimen is
                        tested positive for controlled drugs. He can then apply for a second sample
                        to be tested. If the second test is negative, he will be released from the
                        DRC. But by then he might have been detained for as long as six or seven
                        weeks. With the availability now of more advanced urine testing equipment,
                        it is now practicable to analyse the second urine sample immediately if the
                        first sample is tested positive. Both samples will be tested by <em>different chemists</em> with the necessary
                        safeguards.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     It is apparent that the 1989 procedure
                    introduced for the first time:</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(a)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">a <em>mandatory</em> second
                            testing, which was</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(b)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">to be performed <em>independently</em> by a <em>different</em> chemist.</div>
<p class="Judg-1">It is also pertinent to note that, as a result of this new regime, a
                    consequential amendment was made to the presumption of consumption in s 19A
                    (renumbered as s 22 in the 1985 Reprint). The amended presumption read as
                    follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>Presumption relating to urine test</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">22. If any controlled drug is found in the urine of a person as a result
                        of <em>both urine tests conducted under section
                        31</em>, he shall be presumed, until the contrary is proved, to have
                        consumed that controlled drug.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     The 1989 procedure was further augmented by
                    Act 2 of 2006 which introduced the preliminary urine test in s 31(4)(a) in
                    addition to the two substantive tests already required. The preliminary urine
                    test does not by itself trigger any legal consequences, and nothing more need be
                    said about it. After the enactment of the 2006 amendments, s 31(4) attained
                    its present form.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     It is clear from this survey of legislative
                    history that Parliament had, since 1977, laid down specific criteria in relation
                    to the testing of urine samples for controlled drugs with the intention that
                    they should operate as safeguards against error. It was in furtherance of this
                    policy that the 1989 amendments, prescribing an approach where urine samples
                    will be independently tested by two different chemists, were enacted. The
                    importance of the safeguards introduced by the 1989 amendments is reflected in
                    the fact that the bar for triggering the presumption of consumption in s 22
                    was amended to peg it to the new procedure. If I may say so, the safeguards
                    which have been continually reinforced by Parliament are a very necessary part
                    of the Act, given the serious consequences which follow from positive urine
                    tests done in accordance with s 31(4)(b). In this regard, it is to be
                    pointed out that positive tests not only trigger the s 22 presumption of
                    consumption; separately, they also empower the Director of the Central Narcotics
                    Bureau to detain the person supplying the urine specimen at an approved
                    institution for treatment and/or rehabilitation, without first having to obtain
                    a court order: see s 34 of the Act. It is also pertinent to refer to
                    Mr Amarjit Singh’s note “Legal Aspects Of Substance
                    Abuse” [1989] 1 SAcLJ 36, reproducing his talk by the same
                    title at the Medico Legal Seminar on Scientific Evidence in Drugs and other
                    Substances of Abuse. Mr Singh pointed out some of the documented errors in
                    urine testing, including:</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     The source cited by Mr Singh for these
                    errors was dated at the time of his note, and Mr Singh’s note is
                    itself dated. But the safeguards introduced in 1989 remain the basis of
                    today’s s 31(4)(b) in an area where the law is frequently updated.
                    This no doubt reflects Parliament’s view that they remain vital and
                    necessary. It is in this light that s 31(4)(b) must be
                interpreted.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     It is next necessary to examine the
                    legislative history of the Act to understand how Parliament identifies the
                    persons it considers qualified to conduct the urine tests.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     The 1989 procedure, quoted above, required the
                    urine tests to be conducted by “Government chemists”. That
                    designation was changed to “a Scientific Officer in the Department of
                    Scientific Services (including the Director and Deputy Director of Scientific
                    Services)” by Act 20 of 1998. The explanatory statement to the Bill
                    describes the change as a “technical amendment” to reflect the
                    changed titles of Government chemists. In order to emphasise the technical
                    nature of the amendment, s 26(2) of Act 20 of 1998 provided that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>Saving</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">26. —</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(2) Any act done by a Government chemist before the commencement of
                        this Act shall have the same effect as if it were done by a Scientific
                        Officer in the Department of Scientific Services under the corresponding
                        provision of the principal Act.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     The designation of Scientific Officer in the
                    Department of Scientific Services was in turn replaced with “an analyst
                    employed by the Health Sciences Authority” as a result of consequential
                    amendments made when the Health Sciences Authority Act (Act 4 of 2001; now
                    Cap 122C, 2002 Rev Ed) was enacted. As the Minister for Health
                    explained in the Second Reading of the Bill, the purpose of the Heath Sciences
                    Authority Act was to integrate a number of departments in the Ministry of Health
                    which provide various health sciences expertise and services. The integrated
                    departments included the Forensic Science Division of the Department of
                    Scientific Services (in turn part of the Institute of Science and Forensic
                    Management), which provided a range of scientific expertise to the police for
                    the investigation of crimes, <em>eg</em> toxicology. See
                        <em>Singapore Parliamentary Debates</em>, <em>Official Report</em> (22 February 2001) vol 72 at cols
                    1487-1488. The technical nature of the re-designation was again emphasised by a
                    savings clause, <em>viz s </em>42 of the Health
                    Sciences Authority Act:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>Savings</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">42. In so far as it is necessary to preserve the effect of any document
                        issued by or relating to any of the departments specified in the Schedule,
                        any reference in such document to any such department shall be construed as
                        a reference to the Authority.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     Finally, Act 2 of 2006 further amended
                    s 31(4)(b) to provide that, in addition to an analyst of the HSA, the urine
                    tests may be conducted by any other person as the Minister may, by notification
                    in the <em>Gazette</em>, appoint for such purpose. The
                    Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Home Affairs explained in the Second
                    Reading of the Bill that this amendment was to give the Central Narcotics Bureau
                    the option of utilising laboratories other than the Health Sciences Authority
                    for drug analyses: <em>Singapore Parliamentary
                    Debates</em>, <em>Official Report</em>
                    (16 January 2006) vol 80 at cols 2100-2101.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     It seems, therefore, that the Act has
                    consistently referred to the titles and designations of the relevant government
                    chemists, as they were known from time to time, in describing the person
                    authorised to perform the urine tests for the purpose of s 31(4)(b) and its
                    predecessors.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     In light of the foregoing survey of the
                    legislative history, and also in light of the actual wording of s 31(4)(b),
                    the following requirements must in my judgment be satisfied before it can be
                    presumed that a controlled drug is found in the urine of an accused person as a
                    result of both urine tests conducted under s 31(4)(b).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     
          <em>First</em>, both
                    urine tests must be conducted by persons authorised by the Act, ie HSA analysts
                    or gazetted persons. Tests conducted by any other person will not give rise to
                    the s 22 presumption. For convenience I will express the following
                    requirements with respect to the conduct of the tests by a HSA analyst, but the
                    same requirements would apply to any person gazetted by the Minister for the
                    purpose of s 31(4)(b).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     
          <em>Secondly</em>, both
                    urine tests must be conducted by the HSA analysts who eventually certify the
                    presence of the controlled drug. It is obvious that, if the HSA analyst did not
                    conduct the urine test which found the controlled drug, he or she cannot certify
                    its presence. This requirement was not disputed by the parties; however, they
                    disputed the meaning of the word “conduct”. On this point I am in
                    general agreement with the district judge that it is both necessary and
                    sufficient for the analyst to supervise the testing process. It is strictly not
                    necessary for the analyst to physically conduct the actual tests. After some
                    argument Mr Kumar also conceded this point. However, I cannot agree with
                    the district judge’s holding that an analyst can be said to have conduct
                    of the test if he or she only reviews the test results, as opposed to actually
                    supervising the test process. The district judge appears to have reached this
                    view after referring to the definition of the word “conduct” in
                    the Reader’s Digest publication, <em>Use The Right Word:
                        Modern Guide To Synonyms And Related Words</em> (1979) at p 428,
                    as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">“stresses direction, leadership or supervision: to <em>conduct</em> an experiment; to <em>conduct</em> a survey. In a specific sense, with reference to
                        music, it is used of a single person and means to direct the performance of
                        a work: to <em>conduct</em> an opera.”</p>
<p class="Judg-1">With respect, there seems nothing in this definition that supports the
                    district judge’s finding that review qualifies as conduct. In any event
                    there is in my view a vital difference between review and supervision. In
                    reviewing the test results and related documentation, the analyst does not
                    directly perform the tests, or even observe the performance of the tests. He or
                    she is wholly dependent on what is recorded by the persons who actually
                    performed or supervised the testing process. He or she is therefore unable to
                    detect any error which is not recorded or which cannot be detected from such
                    records. This, in my view, would be plainly insufficient to constitute
                    compliance with s 31(4)(b), in light of its purpose as a safeguard against
                    error. The analyst must actually supervise the test process before he or she can
                    be said to have conducted it. I would add that, as a general rule, the degree of
                    supervision must be such that the analyst is able to claim responsibility for
                    the whole testing process and authorship of the certificate consequently issued.
                    In more practical terms, I would say that, at the minimum, the parts of the
                    testing process which are currently supervised ought to be supervised by an
                    analyst, and in particular the analyst who eventually certifies the presence of
                    the controlled drug.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     
          <em>Thirdly</em>, the
                    entire conduct of both urine tests must be done independently of each other.
                    This means that the personnel involved in the testing of one urine sample cannot
                    be involved in any way at all in the testing of the other urine sample. This
                    applies equally to the actual physical testing as well as to supervision and
                    review. I should emphasise that in applying this requirement the court will not
                    be concerned with nice arguments about whether the personnel involved in the
                    testing of one sample actually relied upon or were influenced by the personnel
                    involved in the testing of the other sample – as amply shown by the survey
                    of the legislative history, the absolute independence of the two tests from each
                    other is the cornerstone of the regime in s 31(4)(b). Separately, I should
                    refer to reg 5 of the Regulations:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>Urine test</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">5. — (1) Urine tests shall be carried out in accordance
                        with paragraph (2).</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(2) The Chief Executive of the Health Sciences Authority shall arrange for
                        each of the 2 urine specimens to be tested by a different officer and the
                        results of the 2 urine tests shall be sent to the enforcement officer in
                        charge of the case.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">I would observe that reg 5(2) refers to “officer”
                    and not “analyst”, which is the designation referred to in
                    s 31(4)(b). As mentioned, I invited submissions from the parties whether
                    reg 5(2) was <em>ultra vires s </em>31(4)(b) of
                    the Act. In this regard, I agreed with Mr David Khoo
                    (“Mr Khoo”) for the prosecution that the status of
                    reg 5(2) is immaterial if ultimately s 31(4)(b) is complied with.
                    However, I would point out that, to the extent that “officer” is
                    not the same as “analyst”, compliance with reg 5(2) will not
                    necessarily translate into compliance with s 31(4)(b). The choice of the
                    word “officer” in reg 5(2) is unfortunate as it may lead to
                    confusion as to the correct designation that is authorised under the Act to
                    conduct the tests. In the course of hearing the appeal, I requested the parties
                    to find out the qualifications of an analyst and a laboratory officer. They
                    informed me that the current entry requirement for an analyst is a Bachelor of
                    Science degree in chemistry, biochemistry or related fields, with Second Class
                    (Upper Division) Honours. A laboratory officer would need to have a diploma in
                    chemical process technology or equivalent. The material difference in the entry
                    qualification of an analyst as compared to that of a laboratory officer is
                    consistent with Parliament’s objective in assigning the task for the
                    conducting of the urine tests only to analysts or other persons gazetted for
                    such purpose.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     I take note of Mr Khoo’s submission
                    that there are only nine analysts and eighteen laboratory officers in Illicit
                    Drugs and Toxicology Division of the HSA. I have no doubt that they perform an
                    important, demanding and quite possibly thankless role in the war against drugs.
                    However, in the final analysis the court’s role is to apply the
                    requirements of s 31(4)(b) strictly, and in this it cannot and will not be
                    deflected by considerations of what is convenient or expedient. Those
                    considerations can only be addressed by the Legislature or the Executive –
                    the Minister may, for example, gazette other qualified persons, in addition to
                    HSA analysts, to conduct the testing of urine samples.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     I should also remark that the HSA is not only
                    a scientific agency; it is a statutory body with legal responsibilities, and in
                    particular its expert opinion is intended by Parliament to carry weight in a
                    court of law. In light of its statutory responsibilities, the HSA should
                    continually review its procedures, in particular the protocol set out in
                    its Narcotics II Laboratory Quality Manual (the “HSA manual”),
                    parts of which were placed in evidence in the trial below, to ensure that they
                    accurately reflect the legal regime under which it operates. It cannot be
                    over-emphasised that whether the appellant’s urine samples are tested in
                    accordance with s 31(4)(b) is to be determined with reference to the
                    language, purpose and history of the subsection, and <em>not</em> with reference to the HSA manual. Similarly, the fact that
                    HSA’s testing protocols comply with international scientific standards, a
                    point which was raised by the prosecution both here and below, does not mean
                    that they comply with s 31(4)(b).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     I would reiterate that nothing which I have
                    said is to be taken as deciding whether or not the HSA’s urine testing
                    methodology, as described in the court below, complies with
                    s 31(4)(b).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Whether section 16 can be relied upon to prove that the
                appellant’s urine contained norketamine</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     I turn next to consider the issue of whether,
                    in cases where the procedure in s 31(4)(b) has been shown (or, as here,
                    conceded) not to have been complied with, the presumption in s 16 can
                    nonetheless apply to prove that a controlled drug is found in the urine samples
                    of an accused person.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     I would reject at the outset
                    Mr Khoo’s submission that s 16 is a provision on admissibility
                    only. This is plainly incorrect. Section 16, besides providing for the
                    admissibility of the certificate of the HSA analyst, further goes on to say that
                    such a certificate, “on its production by the prosecution and without
                    proof of signature and, <em>until the contrary is proved, shall
                        be proof of all matters contained therein</em>.”</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     Mr Khoo further submitted that there was
                    no inconsistency between the s 16 and s 22 presumptions because they
                    relate to separate matters. Section 22 creates a presumption that the
                    accused person consumed the controlled drug found in his urine in contravention
                    of s 8(b). This presumption extends to the fact of consumption, and the
                    mental element of intention to consume. Section 16 only creates a
                    presumption as to the truth of the contents of the analyst’s certificate,
                    and does not expressly touch on whether the accused person consumed the
                    controlled drug found in his urine, or did so intentionally.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     This is a nice argument but must ultimately
                    fail. The presumptions in ss 16 and 22 are admittedly different in scope.
                    However, they overlap substantially with each other in the sense that they are
                    both capable of leading to the conclusion that an accused person committed the
                        <em>actus reus</em> of consuming the controlled drug
                    found in his urine. Section 22 does so by directly presuming the commission
                    of the offence of consumption. Section 16 does not presume any element of
                    the offence but comes very close to doing so, in the sense that a presumption
                    that a controlled drug is found in the urine sample of an accused person would,
                    bar cases of alleged contamination or tampering, almost inescapably lead to an
                    inference that the <em>actus reus</em> of consumption is
                    made out. At the same time, the conditions triggering the presumption contained
                    in each section are quite different: s 22 requires the controlled drug to
                    be found as a result of both urine tests conducted under s 31(4)(b), while
                    s 16 only requires an analyst’s certificate that a controlled drug is
                    found in the accused person’s urine. Given this functional overlap between
                    the two presumptions, if the court accepts that the presence of a controlled
                    drug in a urine sample can be <em>prima facie</em> proven
                    by a s 16 certificate in circumstances where s 31(4)(b) had not been
                    complied with, the safeguards in the latter provision will be altogether
                    obviated. Given that (as Mr Khoo has acknowledged) there are other
                    applications of s 16 outside of urine testing, I am therefore of the view
                    that a court should not accept a s 16 certificate as presumptive proof that
                    a controlled drug is found in an accused person’s urine if the urine tests
                    were not carried out in compliance with s 31(4)(b).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     Before moving on, I should reiterate that, in
                    this case, there was evidence led as to whether s 31(4)(b) was complied
                    with, and in the end the prosecution conceded that the evidence led was
                    insufficient to prove compliance. In the circumstances, there was quite
                    naturally no arguments made as to whether, in the absence of any actual proof
                    either way, s 16 can be used to certify compliance with s 31(4)(b) and
                    thereby trigger the presumption in s 22. There are arguments for and
                    against such an interpretation. It could be argued that, if an analyst’s
                    certificate can prove the presence of a controlled drug in a urine sample, it
                    must also be able to prove the method by which the controlled drug is found. On
                    the other hand, there is the judicial reluctance to read presumptions
                    cumulatively in criminal cases. Given that the issue was not raised before me,
                    it would be inappropriate for me to express my views on the matter, save to note
                    that this is an issue which remains to be resolved, either in a future case or
                    by Act of Parliament.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Whether there was scientific evidence that the appellant’s
                urine contained norketamine</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     I turn now to consider the remaining live
                    issues after the prosecution’s withdrawal of its reliance on the
                    presumptions in ss 16 and 22. The non-applicability of the presumptions
                    does not <em>ipso facto</em> mean that the offence has not
                    been proven – it is still open to the prosecution to rely on other
                    evidence led at trial to show that norketamine was found in the
                    appellant’s urine sample as a result of a process that is scientifically
                    reliable. Of course, since the prosecution does not rely on any presumption, it
                    will have to prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt. Although strictly
                    speaking such a route to secure conviction is possible, I was informed by the
                    prosecution that there is no known case to the best of their knowledge of an
                    accused person being convicted for a consumption charge in the absence of
                    certificates issued by analysts from the HSA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     On the facts, not much evidence appears to
                    have been adduced as to the presence of norketamine in the appellant’s
                    urine sample other than the two certificates issued by the two analysts. The
                    testimony of Ms Tan, the only witness before the court who actually
                    involved in the testing of the appellant’s urine, was focussed on
                    clarifying the urine testing methodology employed by the HSA generally and in
                    this case specifically. There was no testimony as to how the methodology
                        <em>led to a conclusion that the appellant’s urine
                        samples contained norketamine</em>, which is the fact the prosecution
                    needed to prove. This was perhaps unsurprising since the focus on the trial was
                    on the applicability of the presumptions. The only scientific evidence apart
                    from that led in connection with the presumptions was two reports entitled
                    “NARCOTICS II LABORATORY, Quantitation of KETAMINE in
                        urine”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> These reports were produced before the district
                    judge in the course of Dr Lui’s re-examination,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span> but their
                    contents were not explained by Dr Lui, who was in any case not in a
                    position to do so since they were not prepared by him. At that point,
                    Ms Tan had already been released as a witness, having completed her
                    evidence. The reports formed part of the record which was transmitted to me on
                    appeal, but they are highly technical in nature and I am unable, without expert
                    assistance, to derive any assistance from them. During the hearing of the
                    appeal, I sought clarification from the prosecution on the reports because
                    counsel for the appellant had accepted their authenticity and accuracy in the
                    court below. Before me, Mr Khoo confirmed, very properly in the
                    circumstances, that the prosecution was not relying on the two reports as proof
                    that the appellant had consumed norketamine. This position was impliedly
                    reaffirmed in para 4(a) of the Public Prosecutor’s letter, which only
                    referred to the evidence of Ms Tan and Dr Lui in support of its case
                    on the <em>actus reus</em> of the charge.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     I am therefore unable to say that there was
                    scientific evidence which proved beyond a reasonable doubt that norketamine was
                    found in the appellant’s urine samples. Given that the prosecution had
                    decided to confine its case on the <em>actus reus</em> of
                    the charge to the scientific evidence, this would mean that it has failed to
                    make out an essential element of the charge.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The appellant’s confession and his silence at trial</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     For completeness, I would also say that the
                    prosecution would have failed to make out the <em>actus
                        reus</em> even if it had maintained its original reliance on the
                    confession in the appellant’s cautioned statement and his silence at trial
                    to prove that he had in fact consumed norketamine. For convenience I set out the
                    very short confession again:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I admit to my guilt and hope for a lighter sentence. I am married with 3
                        kids and I hope that I can be given a chance. I also have aged parents whom
                        I visit often because my mother has difficulty walking.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">As mentioned, the district judge had ruled that the prosecution need
                    not produce the appellant’s long statement. This ruling was not challenged
                    before me.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     In assessing the evidential value of the
                    appellant’s confession, I begin with the statement in <em>Ratanlal &amp; Dhirajlal‘s The Law of Evidence</em> (Wadhwa and
                    Co, 22<sup>nd</sup> Ed, 2006) at p 322 that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">An admission is of evidentiary value only to the extent that its maker has
                        personal knowledge of the matters it contains…If a man admits
                        something of which he knows nothing, its is of no real evidential
                        value.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     In support of this proposition, the learned
                    authors referred to <em>Comptroller of Customs v Western Lectric
                        Co Ltd</em> [1966] AC 367, where the Privy Council held that
                    an admission as to the origin of certain goods, made upon reading of marks and
                    labels on those goods, was of no more evidential value than those marks and
                    labels themselves.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     More on point with the present facts is
                        <em>R v Chatwood</em> [1980]
                    1 WLR 874, a decision of the English Court of Appeal. In <em>Chatwood</em> the accused persons were convicted for
                    possessing controlled drugs when the only evidence as to the accused
                    persons’ consumption of heroin was their admission after caution to that
                    effect. They appealed on the ground that this did not constitute sufficient
                        <em>prima facie</em> evidence of the nature of the
                    substances involved, and therefore should not have been sent to the jury. The
                    judgment of the court referred to <em>R v Wells</em>
                    [1976] Crim LR 518, a decision of the English Court of Appeal, and
                        <em>Bird v Adams</em> [1972] Crim LR 174, a
                    decision of the Queen’s Bench Divisional Court. The actual judgments are
                    not reported and the original transcripts are no longer available. I am also
                    unwilling to rely on the summaries in the Criminal Law Review, especially
                    since it was pointed out in <em>Chatwood</em> itself that
                    some of these summaries were inaccurate. But the court in <em>Chatwood</em> appears to have had access to the relevant transcripts,
                    and I think it is useful to refer to some of the passages quoted in that case.
                    The first passage I would refer to is that by Ormrod LJ in <em>R v Wells</em>, quoted in <em>Chatwood</em> at 879:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">What is said is that the prosecution in a drug case must identify the
                        drugs in question positively by scientific evidence before a court can
                        accept a plea of guilty to possession. One has only got to state the
                        proposition in those terms to see how absurd it must be. If one needs to
                        take it to its logical conclusion, it is necessary to point out it is no
                        answer to say [the accused person] was convicted on her own expression of
                        opinion. In the last analysis all the evidence as to the nature of the
                        substance is an expression of opinion. Scientists perhaps express more
                        reliable opinions than people who have not got the advantages of scientific
                        techniques of identifying substances. But in the last analysis, everybody is
                        expressing an opinion.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     The second passage is from <em>Bird v Adams</em>. According to the court in <em>Chatwood</em> (at 877), the appellant in that case had been charged
                    with unlawful possession of a controlled drug. The only evidence as to the
                    nature of the substance which he was found to possess was his own admission that
                    it was LSD. The court in <em>Chatwood</em> quoted (at
                    877–878) and approved (at 879) the following passage from the judgment of
                    Lord Widgery CJ in <em>Bird v Adams</em>:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Now when the case was heard before the justices, at the conclusion of the
                        prosecution case, which really consisted of nothing more than the evidence
                        of the police officer to which I have referred, there was a submission of no
                        case to answer, and the basis of the submission was this, that although the
                        appellant had admitted possession of what he thought to be LSD, there was no
                        independent proof that the drug was in fact LSD, and that it might have been
                        some innocuous substance sold to the appellant under a fraudulent
                        description, and so it was submitted that there was no case to answer
                        because the vital element of the prosecution case, namely, that the drug was
                        a prohibited drug, had not been established by an admission of the appellant
                        who himself could not know whether that which he carried was or was not the
                        genuine drug. Now the justices rejected that suggestion, at least they were
                        not influenced by it. They held there was a case to answer and on the case
                        proceeding the appellant gave no evidence and he was duly convicted.
                        Mr. Reney-Davies before us today returns to the original submission in
                        the case and says that the justices should have upheld the submission of no
                        case because the admission of the appellant in the circumstances of this
                        case was of no evidential value at all. Now it is clear from the authorities
                        which have been put before us that there are many instances where an
                        admission made by an accused person on a matter of law in respect of which
                        he is not an expert is really no admission at all. There are bigamy cases
                        where a man has admitted a ceremony of marriage in circumstances in which he
                        could not possibly have known whether in truth he had been married or not
                        because he was no expert on the marriage ceremonial appropriate in the
                        particular place. It is quite clear that there are cases of that kind where
                        the person making the admission lacks the necessary background knowledge to
                        be able to make the admission at all. Again we have been referred to the
                        Comptroller of Customs v. Western Lectric Co. Ltd. [1966] A.C. 367, where a
                        man made an admission in regard to the country of origin of certain goods
                        when he had no idea at all where the goods had come from. Again it was held
                        that this admission was worthless because it was an admission of a fact as
                        to which he had no knowledge at all, and in respect of which no valid
                        admission can be made. Mr. Reney-Davies submitted that the present case
                        is a like case with that, but in my judgment this is not so. <em>If a man admits possession of a substance which he says is a
                            dangerous drug, if he admits it in circumstances like the present where
                            he also admits that he has been peddling the drug, it is of course
                            possible that the item in question was not a specific drug at all but
                            the admission in those circumstances is not an admission of some fact
                            about which the admitter knows nothing. This is the kind of case in
                            which the appellant had certainly sufficient knowledge of the
                            circumstances of his conduct to make his admission at least prima facie
                            evidence of its truth and that was all that was required at the stage of
                            the proceedings at which the submission to the justices was
                            made</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     On the facts (which were not discussed at
                    length), the court in <em>Chatwood</em> found (at 879) that
                    the accused persons “were expressing an opinion, and <em>an informed opinion</em>, that, having used the substance which they
                    did use, it was indeed heroin, because <em>they were experienced
                        in the effects of heroin</em>” (emphasis added). It then held
                    that (at 880) that the statements of the accused persons were sufficient
                        <em>prima facie</em> evidence of the identity of the
                    substances involved, and accordingly their convictions were
                upheld.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a>58     The facts in the above cases can be contrasted
                    to those in <em>R v Dillon</em> (1983) 2 Qd
                    R 627, a decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal of Queensland. In that
                    case, there were admissions made to a police officer and evidence given at trial
                    which showed that the accused person was supplying what he thought to be
                    marijuana (spelt as marihuana in the judgment), but evidence was not led to show
                    the degree of familiarity which he might have had with the drug. Matthews J
                    (with whom Kneipp and Derrington JJ concurred) approved the test laid down
                    by Neasey J in the unreported case of <em>Harris v
                        Pandava</em> (10 June 1975):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The question was whether the evidence was capable of showing that the
                        respondent had sufficient knowledge of and familiarity with cannabis as to
                        be able to identify the substance to which his admission related, so as to
                        make his admission that he had smoked cannabis sufficiently persuasive of
                        that fact.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Applying this test, Matthews J found that there was simply no
                    evidence to support a finding that the accused person was sufficiently familiar
                    with marijuana to enable him (and a witness) to say to the required satisfaction
                    of the magistrate below that indeed he had been dealing with marijuana.
                    Accordingly his conviction was set aside.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a>59     In addition to these cases, there are also a
                    handful of Commonwealth authorities which are helpfully referred to in the
                    judgment of Phillip J, sitting in the Court of Criminal Appeal of Victoria, in
                        <em>Reardon v Baker</em> [1987] VR 887 at
                    892–893. They include <em>Anglim and Cooke v
                        Thomas</em> [1974] VR 363; <em>Police v
                        Coward</em> [1976] 2 NZLR 86; and <em>Parks v
                        Bullock</em> [1982] VR 258. The facts are various but the
                    underlying principle is the same. The nature of a substance can in principle be
                    proved by the admission of the accused person, even though he is not an expert
                    as such. However, before an accused person’s admission as to the nature of
                    a substance can be of evidential value, it must be shown that the accused person
                    has sufficient knowledge of or familiarity with the substance which he claims to
                    identify. Absent such proof, the admission would be worthless. This general
                    proposition was not challenged by Mr Khoo.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a>60     A stricter approach seems to have been taken
                    in <em>R v Lang and Evans (Inspector of Police)</em>
                    [1977] Crim LR 286. According to the summary in the Criminal
                    Law Review (at 287), Judge Robin David QC held in that case that “In
                    future it will now only be possible to secure a conviction for possessing
                    cannabis by an analyst’s report.” In the absence of any report of
                    the learned judge’s actual reasoning, I am with respect unable to treat
                    the case as persuasive authority. The holding of the learned judge, as stated in
                    the Criminal Law Review, also goes against the authorities I have just
                    reviewed, and in principle I cannot see why the nature of a drug cannot be
                    proved by the admission of an accused person who is proven to have sufficient
                    knowledge of or familiarity with the drug. Of course, whether there is
                    sufficient knowledge or familiarity is a question of fact to be decided with
                    reference to the particular accused person and controlled drug in
                    question.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a>61     It is also clear to me that the prosecution
                    bears the legal burden of proving that the accused person in making the
                    admission had the requisite personal knowledge or familiarity with the drug in
                    question. This is entirely in line with the prosecution’s burden to prove
                    its case beyond any reasonable doubt.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_62"></a>62     On the facts, I can readily accept that the
                    appellant’s confession, together with his refusal to give evidence in his
                    own defence, may prove a number of things that can ordinarily be expected to be
                    within his knowledge. It may prove that the appellant accepted a substance
                    called norketamine. It may prove that the appellant did not doubt that the
                    substance is norketamine. It may prove that the appellant intentionally consumed
                    the substance thinking it was norketamine. All this would go a long way, if not
                    the full distance, towards proving the <em>mens rea</em>
                    for s 8(b).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_63"></a>63     However, there are considerable difficulties
                    in saying that the appellant’s confession and his silence at trial proved
                    beyond all reasonable doubt that the substance consumed by him was, <em>in fact</em>, norketamine. There was no evidence whatsoever
                    that the appellant was capable of identifying norketamine, an ability which
                    thankfully is not so ordinary that it can be assumed without specific proof. His
                    previous convictions related to ketamine or nimetazepam, not norketamine, and no
                    evidence was led by the prosecution that ketamine and nimetazepan are similar to
                    norketamine. Moreover, it is not disputed that, during the taking of his long
                    statement, the appellant had stated that he mistakenly took a few sips of water
                    from a glass on the table in the Geylang premises where he was arrested. The
                    appellant only confessed when the investigating officer, Sgt Yap, informed
                    him that norketamine had been found in his urine after tests by the HSA. Here I
                    refer to Sgt Yap’s cross-examination:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">Q:</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">When you commenced PS2 [the appellant’s
                            cautioned statement], did you tell him that he can state his
                            defence?</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">A:</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">Yes Your Honour.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">Q:</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">What did you tell him?</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">A:</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">I told him if there are any explanations as to why
                            his urine is positive for controlled drugs, he can let me know and then
                            I will write it down.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1">It is clear from this exchange that Sgt Yap must have at some
                    point prior to the taking of the cautioned statement showed the appellant his
                    positive urine test results, and reiterated the fact when taking the cautioned
                    statement. I also find it curious that the appellant confessed his guilt in the
                    course of being cautioned, the whole purpose of which is for him to state any
                    defence he might have. In these circumstances, I do not think that an adverse
                    inference as to the appellant’s knowledge of or familiarity with
                    norketamine can safely be drawn from his silence at trial, and more generally I
                    am not able to say that the appellant had sufficient knowledge of and
                    familiarity with norketamine such that his confession is proof beyond reasonable
                    doubt that he had <em>in fact</em> consumed norketamine.
                    Here I note that, in abandoning its original reliance on the confession as proof
                    of the <em>actus reus</em>, the prosecution appears to have
                    arrived at the same conclusion.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_64"></a>64     Mr Khoo had argued that if an accused
                    person could plead guilty to the offence he could equally confess to it. The
                    short answer to this argument is that it places the cart before the horse
                    – the court would not accept a plea of guilty if it was not sure that the
                    accused person was capable of knowing what he was pleading to.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_65"></a>65     Before concluding I should say that, while it
                    is in principle possible for the nature of a drug to be proven by admission
                    alone, it is prudent in my view for the prosecution of a consumption offence to
                    always be supported by expert evidence or certification, since an expert opinion
                    would be the best evidence of the nature of the substance involved, and would
                    obviate the need for an extended inquiry into the accused person’s
                    knowledge of or familiarity with the relevant drug. Therefore, if the adduction
                    of expert evidence or certification is already the practice – and to the
                    credit of the prosecution and the police this appears to be the case – it
                    is most desirable that it should continue to be so. Of course, there is the
                    all-important proviso that any certification must be in strict compliance with
                    the requirements imposed by the Act.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_66"></a>66     For all these reasons, I would allow the
                    appeal and set aside the appellant’s conviction under s 8(b)(i) of
                    the Act. Notwithstanding the late change of position by the prosecution, I
                    should record that I derived considerable assistance from the able submissions
                    made by Mr Khoo and Mr Kumar. I am especially grateful that they
                    confined themselves to the crux of the dispute and did not pursue frivolous
                    points.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_67"></a>67     Given that the prosecution’s conduct of
                    this case has been less than perfect, some might take the view that the
                    appellant was “in fact” guilty but has “escaped” on
                    “technicalities”. In response to those who might hold such views,
                    I can do no better than to repeat what was said by V K Rajah JA in <em>XP v Public Prosecutor</em> [2008] 4 SLR(R) 686 at
                    [98]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The question for the court in every case is not whether it suspects the
                        accused has committed the crime but whether the Prosecution has proved
                        beyond any reasonable doubt that he has indeed committed it. It is trite
                        that courts can never convict on the basis of suspicion and/or intuition.
                        Such is the conclusion demanded by and enshrined in that cardinal principle,
                        the presumption of innocence, upon which is founded the most elemental rule
                        of the criminal justice system: that the Prosecution must establish guilt
                        beyond any reasonable doubt. Objective and not subjective belief is the
                        essential touchstone of guilt, and there is simply no place for subsequent
                        speculation or implication that an acquitted accused may be "factually
                        guilty". Who makes that determination? The adversarial system that we have
                        adopted requires the Prosecution to conscientiously and irrefutably ensure
                        that an unbreakable and credible chain of evidence secures the guilt of the
                        accused. It is not flawless in that perfectly proper prosecutions may
                        sometimes fail because of unexpected frailties in the evidential links. Our
                        system is, however, an eminently credible, pragmatic and effective one that
                        tempers idealism with a healthy dose of realism. The rules are clear and
                        precise, and neither the Prosecution nor the Defence can or should complain
                        if they fail by them. By rigorously demanding and upholding exacting
                        standards from both the Prosecution and the Defence alike, the courts are
                        able to ensure that public confidence in our legal system does not
                        falter.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">While Rajah JA was writing in a context where no presumptions were
                    applicable, his observations apply with equal force to cases where the
                    prosecution either fails to prove the conditions precedent for the presumptions
                    on which it could have relied, or where, as here, it elects to withdraw its
                    reliance on such presumptions altogether.</p>
