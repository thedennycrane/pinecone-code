18 January 2021 included interest. I had inadvertently omitted to award the plaintiff interest on the judgment sum. I see no reason to depart from the default interest rate of 5.33% <span class="font-italic">per </span><span class="font-italic">annum</span>, which is prescribed by para 77 of the Supreme Court Practice Directions.

This was a misuse of the court’s judicial resources and would result in a great loss to the plaintiff if the plaintiff is not awarded indemnity costs.

</div> In the defendant’s counterclaim in unlawful means conspiracy, he made serious allegations of fraud against the plaintiff and the first third party as well as against other professionals involved in the Project, such as CCA, F+G and RTO Leong. However, despite the gravity of such claims, he was unable to provide even a shred of evidence to support them (see [78] of the Judgment). This speculative and exaggerated conduct extended also to the defendant’s testimony in court. As I observed at [80] of the Judgment, the defendant had a propensity to make reckless and speculative allegations against the plaintiff, the third parties, and others. One such allegation was the Bribery Allegation, which the defendant continued to maintain despite the absence of any evidence to support it (see [82] of the Judgment). Another spurious allegation made by the defendant was that the Consultants, apart from Web, were also parties to the conspiracy to injure him (see [83] of the Judgment). A non-exhaustive list of the speculative allegations made by the defendant may be found at [85] of the Judgment. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">17 Second, the claims made by the defendant against the plaintiff and the first third party were highly unreasonable and exaggerated (see [136]–[148] of the Judgment). The quantum of the defendant’s claims was excessive, the defendant unreasonably refused to mitigate his losses, and he unreasonably insisted on total and absolute rectification of all the alleged defects. This resulted in the claiming of sums that were completely out of proportion to the nature and extent of the alleged defects. I also note that some of these claims were relatively trivial (see [416] of the Judgment).

</div> Although the defendant succeeded in certain aspects of his counterclaim against the plaintiff and was awarded damages in the sum of $47,496.82, this must be seen in the context of his numerous other unmeritorious claims. Out of the $47,496.82 awarded to the defendant, $18,871.60, which relates to the screed, the grouting and the intumescent paint, was conceded by the plaintiff’s witnesses. As regards the remaining sum of $28,625.22, which relates to the missing trellis beam and the utility fees, the plaintiff had agreed in the course of the proceedings to pay such sum to the defendant.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">18 Third, in the course of the trial, the defendant raised new evidence and new allegations that had not been set out in his pleadings or in his AEICs.

</div> On both occasions, this was done weeks after that particular tranche of hearings had commenced.

He claimed that the conspiracy between the plaintiff and the first third party had started from the tender process of the Project (see [10] of the Judgment).

In many instances, the defendant’s allegations were speculative, devoid of evidential proof and clearly without basis. His conduct in the course of the proceedings was reckless and improper. This ultimately resulted in the incurring of tremendous amounts of time and costs that were completely out of proportion to the claims involved.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">21 In <span class="font-italic">SBS Transit Ltd </span><span class="font-italic">(formerly known as Singapore Bus Services Limited) v Koh Swee Ann </span>[2004] 3 SLR(R) 365 (“<span class="font-italic">SBS Transit</span>”), the Court of Appeal observed at [22] that O 22A r 1 is “precise on the form that an [offer to settle] must take” and “the use of the prescribed form is obligatory”. In this case, the offers to settle were not made in accordance with Form 33 of Appendix A to the ROC (as required under O 22A r 1 of the ROC). Thus, they do not fall within the statutory regime of offers to settle under O 22A of the ROC. However, these offers to settle are nevertheless valid and fulfil the same purpose and intent as those issued under O 22A of the ROC.<span class="font-weight-bold"> </span>As Lee Seiu Kin J explained in <span class="font-italic">Ong &amp; Ong Pte Ltd v Fairview Developments Pte Ltd </span>[2014] 2 SLR 1285 (“<span class="font-italic">Ong &amp; Ong</span>”) at [31]–[34], the Calderbank letter was developed by the courts as “an extra-statutory inducement for parties to settle through the exercise of its discretionary powers to order costs”. Specifically, the practice of writing Calderbank letters arose from the English Court of Appeal’s decision in <span class="font-italic">Calderbank</span><span class="font-italic"> v Calderbank </span>[1976] Fam 93, where “Cairns LJ suggested that it was possible for a party to make an offer which was without prejudice to the issue of damages but with the right to be used on the question of costs”. This resulted in the development of what is now known as a Calderbank letter – “a letter marked ‘without prejudice save as to costs’ from one party involved in a claim to another setting out the terms of an offer to settle that claim” (see <span class="font-italic">SBS Transit </span>at [16]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">22 Lee J further explained in <span class="font-italic">Ong &amp; Ong</span> (at [35] and [37]) the effect of such Calderbank letters on the court’s discretion to order costs, as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">35 However, a Calderbank offer, unlike the statutory regime under O 22 and O 22A of the ROC, does not bind the court to award costs in any particular manner but is one factor that the court will take into consideration in the exercise of its discretion to award costs: see <span class="font-italic">SBS Transit Ltd v Koh Swee Ann </span>[2004] 3 SLR(R) 365 (‘<span class="font-italic">SBS Transit</span>’) at [21] and [24]. …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">37 As can be seen from the foregoing, the court has broad discretion as to costs in assessing Calderbank offers. Generally, the court’s consideration will bear on reasonableness or otherwise of an offeree’s refusal to accept the Calderbank offer … This will … turn upon the terms of the Calderbank offer and the specific circumstances surrounding it. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">23 Thus, although Calderbank letters may not be offers to settle falling within O 22A of the ROC, the court may still take into account such letters in exercising its discretion to award costs. Indeed, the third parties have expressly clarified that they are not relying on O 22A of the ROC, but on the court’s general discretion to award costs.

</div> However, there is no reason why the principles applicable to the court’s consideration of Calderbank letters should not apply to other offers to settle that do not fall under O 22A of the ROC. In so far as these offers represent genuine attempts by the parties to settle, the court should give such offers due recognition when it comes to the issue of costs. This is in line with the policy of encouraging parties to settle, thereby saving judicial time and costs. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 Having regard to these offers to settle, I find that it would be appropriate to order costs on a standard basis from 29 January 2014 (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the date of the third party notice to join the third parties to the Suit) to 6 March 2017 (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the deadline for the defendant to accept the 22 February 2017 Offer), with costs payable on an indemnity basis thereafter. It is pertinent that both offers to settle were much more favourable to the defendant than the outcome under the Judgment. The defendant’s claims against the third parties failed save for an award of nominal damages of $1,000 (see [749(c)(iii)] of the Judgment). This stands in stark contrast to the sums offered by the third parties in the offers to settle. Given my observation that the defendant’s claims were generally speculative and without basis, it would have been eminently reasonable for him to accept the offers to settle made by the third parties. If he had done so, significant time and costs could have been saved. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 I shall now address some of the arguments raised by the defendant. The defendant submits that the 22 February 2017 Offer and the 5 July 2019 Offer were not offers to settle under O 22A of the ROC because they had been made on a without admission of liability basis. In support of this argument, the defendant relies on <span class="font-italic">Colliers International (Singapore) Pte Ltd v </span><span class="font-italic">Senkee Logistics Pte Ltd </span>[2007] 2 SLR(R) 230 (“<span class="font-italic">Colliers</span>”), in which Lai Siu Chiu J observed at [119] that “[a]n offer to settle cannot be qualified as a non-admission of liability nor can it be an <span class="font-italic">ex gratia </span>offer”.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 This argument by the defendant misses the point. As I have observed at [21] above, the third party is not seeking indemnity costs on the basis of the statutory regime of offers to settle in O 22A. Instead, it is relying on the court’s general discretion to award costs. In any case, with the utmost respect, I am doubtful as to whether the position in <span class="font-italic">Colliers </span>is correct. In this regard, I agree with the following observations by Chua Lee Ming J in <span class="font-italic">Goh Kok Liang v GYP Properties Ltd and another </span>[2020] SGHC 53 at [25] and [26]:

</div> </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">25 No explanation was given in <span class="font-italic">Colliers </span>for the statement set out above. Counsel for GYP and SRE informed me that he did not find any other authority on this point. In my respectful view, there is no reason why an [offer to settle (“OTS”)] cannot be made without an admission of liability. While O 22A r 1 ROC states that an OTS shall be in Form 33, there is nothing in Form 33 that prohibits such a qualification. Neither does such a qualification make the OTS any less of an offer to settle the proceedings. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">26 It also bears highlighting that O 22A was introduced to ‘spur the parties to bring litigation to an expeditious end without judgment and thus to save costs and judicial time’ (see <span class="font-italic">Singapore Airlines Ltd v Tan </span><span class="font-italic">Shwu Leng </span>[2001] 3 SLR(R) 439 at [37]). Allowing an OTS to be made on a ‘without admission of liability’ basis would not be inconsistent with the objective of O 22A. Indeed, on the contrary, it might be argued that doing so could be conducive to speedy out-of-court settlements.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 The defendant also submits that the 22 February 2017 Offer cannot be relied on because it was nullified by the 5 July 2019 Offer.

</div>
</div> Again, this argument misses the point, as the paragraph relied upon was written with reference to the statutory regime of offers to settle under O 22A of the ROC. Therefore, it has little relevance to the present case given that the third party is not relying on O 22A. Furthermore, it is appropriate in this case to have reference to the timeline set out in the 22 February 2017 Offer rather than the 5 July 2019 Offer. The former is a better indication of the time from which costs could have been saved by the defendant’s acceptance of the third parties’ offer to settle. Moreover, if the court were to take into account only the latter offer to settle, this may disincentivise parties from making subsequent offers to settle as that would delay the time from which they could seek indemnity costs. This seems to me inconsistent with the policy of encouraging parties to reach expeditious settlements. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 Finally, the defendant submits that the court should not make any order for costs as between the first third party and the defendant because the first third party and the defendant have purportedly succeeded against each other and because of the first third party’s “perjury and conduct” at the trial.

</div> I cannot agree with this argument. As I observed at [24] above, the defendant has only been awarded nominal damages of $1,000, in contrast to his claim against the third parties for the sum of $10,853,718.63 (see [3] of the Judgment). Furthermore, the defendant was unsuccessful in defending the first third party’s counterclaim against him in the sum of $50,601.44 (see [749(d)] of the Judgment).

The defendant’s claims against the third parties were the same. Furthermore, the third parties were represented by the same set of counsel and adopted virtually the exact same positions throughout the proceedings. Accordingly, there would have been a significant amount of overlap in the work done by the counsel for the third parties and the costs incurred thereupon. Notably, the third parties filed only <span class="font-italic">one </span>costs schedule, with no distinction made between the costs incurred by the first third party and the costs incurred by the second third party.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 In these circumstances, I find that it would not be appropriate to order two sets of costs in respect of each of the third parties, notwithstanding that they are strictly speaking separate legal entities. Instead, the circumstances justify the order of only one set of costs in respect of all of the work done by the counsel for the third parties. This would obviate the risk of any duplication of costs while ensuring that the third parties receive an adequate and fair sum for the costs expended in these proceedings.

Finally, although I do not doubt that the matter was of great personal and professional importance to the third parties, it cannot be said that this went beyond what would usually be the case for parties personally involved in litigation. In these circumstances, I decline to grant a Certificate of Three Counsel as requested by the third parties. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Summary of findings</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 In summary, my findings are as follows:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) In light of the defendant’s extremely unreasonable conduct, it would be appropriate and just to order the defendant to pay to the plaintiff costs on a standard basis from 13 January 2014 (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the date the writ was filed)<span class="font-italic"> </span>up until the date of the commencement of the trial on 8 November 2018, with costs payable on an indemnity basis thereafter. The defendant brought a speculative action that was clearly without basis and his conduct in the course of the proceedings was reckless and improper, ultimately leading to a protracted trial and the disproportionate incurring of time and costs.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Having regard to the two letters containing offers to settle made by the third parties to the defendant, it would be appropriate to order the defendant to pay to the third parties costs on a standard basis from 29 January 2014 (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the date of the third party notice to join the third parties to the Suit) up until 6 March 2017 (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the deadline for the defendant to accept the open offer to settle), with costs payable on an indemnity basis thereafter. Both offers to settle were more favourable to the defendant than the outcome under the Judgment, and it would have been eminently reasonable for him to accept such offers. If he had done so, significant time and costs could have been saved. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) However, it would not be appropriate to order two sets of costs in respect of each of the third parties, notwithstanding that they are strictly speaking separate legal entities. There was, in reality, little distinction made between the first third party and the second third party in the course of the proceedings. Thus, only one set of costs shall be ordered in respect of all of the work done by the third parties’ counsel.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) The circumstances do not warrant the grant of a Certificate of Three Counsel. The length of the trial and the amount of documents involved did not exceed what is often the case in construction-related disputes. Neither were the factual and legal issues so profoundly complex as the third parties have suggested. Although the matter may have been of great personal and professional importance to the third party, this did not go beyond what would usually be the case for parties personally involved in litigation.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 For all of the above reasons, I order the defendant to pay to the plaintiff costs on a standard basis from 13 January 2014 (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the date the writ was filed)<span class="font-italic"> </span>up until the date of the commencement of the trial on 8 November 2018, with costs payable on an indemnity basis thereafter. I further order the defendant to pay to the third parties costs on a standard basis from 29 January 2014 (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the date of the third party notice to join the third parties to the Suit) up until 6 March 2017 (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the deadline for the defendant to accept the open offer to settle), with costs payable on an indemnity basis thereafter. If the parties cannot agree on the quantum of the costs as directed, then costs will have to be taxed.</div><table class="table table-sm table-borderless"><tbody><tr><td><div class="Judg-Sign text-left">Tan Siong Thye<br/>Judge of the High Court</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-left"></div></td></tr></tbody></table><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Thulasidas s/o Rengasamy Suppramaniam and Mendel Yap (Ling Das &amp; Partners) for the plaintiff;<br/>Chong Chi Chuin Christopher, Josh Samuel Tan Wensu, Chen Zhihui and Calvin Lee (Drew &amp; Napier LLC) for the defendant;<br/>Thio Shen Yi SC, Monisha Cheong, Md Noor E Adnaan and Uday Duggal (TSMP Law Corporation) for the third parties.</div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
