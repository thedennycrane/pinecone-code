On 14 March 2018, the defendant summarily terminated the plaintiff’s employment on the grounds of alleged breaches of client confidentiality by the plaintiff. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 The plaintiff sued for wrongful dismissal. He asserted that the summary termination of his employment was invalid, and that the defendant was in breach of contract for not giving him two months’ notice or payment in lieu thereof. The plaintiff thus claimed premature termination losses for two months’ lost earnings. But he also claimed, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, loss of bonus and aggravated and/or punitive damages.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">3 The plaintiff had a separate claim for loss of job opportunities. That claim was based on what the <span class="font-italic">p</span><span class="font-italic">laintiff</span> himself had told prospective employers. The plaintiff’s case was that the defendant had told him (in the Termination Notice) that it “had filed” a misconduct report against him (per para 59 of the Statement of Claim (“SOC”)); he then not only repeated that to three prospective employers, but also told them the category of misconduct under which the report had supposedly been filed. The plaintiff contended that this was a foreseeable repetition and republication of what the defendant had told him in the Termination Notice, for which he sought to hold the defendant liable. Thus, in addition to his claim for wrongful dismissal, the plaintiff also pleaded the following causes of action: breach of an implied term of trust and confidence, breach of a duty of care in tort, and libel.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">4 The plaintiff’s problem is this: in the Termination Notice, the defendant did not say it “<span class="font-italic">had</span> filed” a misconduct report against the plaintiff; the defendant merely said it “<span class="font-italic">will</span> also notify the Monetary Authority of Singapore regarding the cessation of [his] employment as required by law. A misconduct report <span class="font-italic">will</span> also be filed with the MAS …” [emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">5 These words plainly did not mean that a misconduct report <span class="font-italic">had</span> been filed with the MAS. To the contrary, they meant that a misconduct report <span class="font-italic">had not </span>yet been filed. When the plaintiff told prospective employers that a misconduct report <span class="font-italic">had</span> been filed against him, he was not repeating what the defendant had said; indeed, he was saying the opposite. The misinformation provided by the plaintiff to prospective employers was not republication for which the defendant was liable. Accordingly, I struck out the plaintiff’s claim for loss of job opportunities, and consequently his claims for breach of an implied term of trust and confidence, breach of a duty of care in tort, and libel.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">6 I decided to allow the plaintiff to continue with his claim for wrongful dismissal – he can continue to contend that his summary termination was not justified (and in particular, he can dispute the alleged breaches of client confidentiality, and whether these justified summary termination). He can therefore continue to claim compensatory damages for premature termination losses.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">7 However, I struck out: the plaintiff’s references to his belief that he was dismissed for certain “collateral reasons”; his claim for a bonus that he acknowledged he was not entitled to; his claim for aggravated and/or punitive damages, which was not justified in law or in fact; and his claim for declaratory relief.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">8 The plaintiff has appealed against my decision, and these are my written grounds.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Background</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">9 The defendant appealed (by way of HC/RA 90/2020) against the first instance decision dismissing its application (by way of HC/SUM 671/2020) to strike out the plaintiff’s claim.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">10 I allowed the appeal in large part.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">11 The defendant had summarily terminated the plaintiff’s employment for alleged breaches of client confidentiality.

<div class="txt-body text-left">  Para 50 of the SOC.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> For this wrongful dismissal claim, the plaintiff claimed two months’ earnings, loss of bonus (in the sum of $230,000), and aggravated and/or punitive damages.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">13 The plaintiff also claimed damages for alleged loss of job opportunities, seeking the difference between his previous salary with the defendant, and that for a new job he started in September 2018. He quantified this for the rest of his working life, totalling some $5,264,284.94. Additionally, he claimed aggravated and/or punitive damages. I note in passing that in paras 76–77 of the SOC, the plaintiff pleaded that the first two lost job opportunities would have paid him roughly the same monthly salary as he had earned with the defendant; but this was not pleaded in relation to the third lost job opportunity described at para 78 of the SOC.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">14 In addition to his wrongful dismissal claim, the plaintiff thus pleaded the following additional causes of action: (a) breach of an implied term of trust and confidence (as between employer and employee); (b) a duty of care in tort; and (c) libel. All these causes of action were based on what the plaintiff himself had told three prospective employers. The plaintiff claimed to have repeated to these prospective employers what the defendant had conveyed to him in the Termination Notice. The plaintiff asserted that this was a repetition/republication for which the defendant was liable.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">My decision</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The plaintiff can continue with his wrongful dismissal claim</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">15 I allowed the plaintiff to proceed with his wrongful dismissal claim in so far as he contends that breaches of client confidentiality were not valid reasons for his dismissal (as pleaded in para 13 of the SOC). He can continue to dispute the defendant’s position that it was entitled to summarily terminate his employment for the reasons pleaded in paras 5–15 of the Defence (and I use the term “client confidentiality” to encompass the defendant’s full position in that regard). As such, he can still contend that his employment ought not to have been terminated summarily, but only with two months’ notice or payment in lieu thereof (as pleaded in para 50 of the SOC, save for the portions that I struck out).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">16 Although I had difficulties with some aspects of the plaintiff’s factual and legal case in this regard, I did not consider that the high threshold for striking it out was reached. I thus agreed with the Assistant Registrar that whether there had been breaches of client confidentiality justifying summary termination is a matter that ought to proceed to trial.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">17 However, I did not agree with the Assistant Registrar that the remaining aspects of the plaintiff’s claim were intertwined with the claim for wrongful dismissal such that none of them could be struck out.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">It was an abuse of process for the plaintiff to plead that he believed his employment was terminated for “collateral reasons”</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">18 If the defendant establishes that it had a right to terminate the plaintiff’s employment for breaches of client confidentiality, it does not avail the plaintiff merely to prove that there were “collateral reasons” for his termination. The plaintiff would still need to show that the defendant did not have a valid basis for dismissing him, and in particular, that the alleged breaches of client confidentiality were not a valid basis (as per para 13 of the SOC). Even if the plaintiff were allowed to persist with his allegations of “collateral reasons”, he would still fail in his wrongful termination claim if the defendant established that its stated basis of breaches of client confidentiality justified termination. On the principle in <span class="font-italic">Boston Deep Sea Fishing and Ice Company v Ansell</span> (1888) 39 Ch D 339 at 352, an employer can rely on grounds justifying termination other than those relied upon at the time of termination. It goes without saying that an employer can rely on the <span class="font-italic">stated</span> ground for termination if that does justify termination.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">19 The plaintiff’s reference to “collateral reasons” did not add anything viable to his wrongful dismissal claim. Indeed, the plaintiff did not even plead that his employment <span class="font-italic">had </span>been terminated for collateral reasons. What he pleaded (in para 14 of the SOC) was that he had “<span class="font-italic">strong reasons to believe</span> the [d]efendant terminated his employment not for the reasons stated by the [d]efendant, but for collateral reasons” [emphasis added]. Whatever the plaintiff believed, and whatever the reasons for that belief, his wrongful dismissal claim would still fail if the defendant could justify summary termination. I agreed with the defendant that the pleaded references to the plaintiff’s belief about collateral reasons were scandalous, frivolous and vexatious, embarrassing, and would tend unnecessarily to expand the dispute and add to the time and costs of litigation. It was an abuse of process for the plaintiff to have pleaded this, and as such I decided to strike out these references.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">20 Submissions were made as to whether the law might recognise an implied term that a right to terminate employment can only be exercised in good faith, but that has not been pleaded (and the plaintiff’s counsel accepted that in his submissions). Indeed, such a restriction on the defendant’s right to terminate the plaintiff’s employment would run counter to the plaintiff’s case as pleaded, which is that the defendant ought to have given him two months’ notice or salary in lieu thereof, as pleaded in para 50 of the SOC. His claim was that the defendant breached the obligation to give him notice or salary in lieu thereof, by summarily terminating his employment without valid reasons. Put another way, he was arguing that if the defendant wished to terminate his employment, the defendant was obliged to (and entitled to) do so by notice or payment in lieu. That would be irrespective of whether the defendant did so in good faith. The plaintiff’s “collateral reasons” complaint amounted to no more than this: he had reasons to believe that the defendant had terminated his employment for collateral reasons; those collateral reasons were not valid reasons for summary dismissal, and so he ought instead to have been terminated with two months’ notice or payment in lieu thereof. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">21 In any event, I doubt whether such a “good faith” term can be implied where the termination is summary dismissal for misconduct, and even more so if there is an express contractual right to terminate on that basis.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">22 More fundamentally, such a claim would add nothing of substance to the plaintiff’s present claim that the defendant could only terminate with notice or payment in lieu thereof, as pleaded in para 50 of the SOC, with damages being what he has lost for being denied two months’ notice or payment in lieu.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The plaintiff did not have a viable claim for bonus </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">23 The plaintiff’s claim for loss of bonus in para 50 of the SOC was pleaded on a contractual basis, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, as part of the plaintiff’s claim that the defendant had breached an express obligation to give notice or pay salary in lieu. However, counsel for the defendant pointed out that whether the plaintiff were terminated summarily, or with notice or payment in lieu, he was not entitled to bonus. In turn, counsel for the plaintiff conceded that the plaintiff could not maintain his bonus claim as a contractual claim. Instead, he asked for leave to amend so that the plaintiff could still claim the bonus as part of damages to be assessed for other claims. However, I decided that his other claims should be struck out. In any event, as it was common ground that the plaintiff was not entitled to any bonus, whether he were terminated summarily or with notice or payment in lieu, I did not see how he could still maintain a claim to bonus just by housing it under some non-contractual cause of action.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The plaintiff did not have a viable claim for aggravated and/or punitive damages</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 Nothing in the pleadings justified a claim for aggravated or punitive damages for wrongful dismissal (and specifically for failure to give notice or payment in lieu). This is especially so bearing in mind the Court of Appeal’s observations in <span class="font-italic">PH Hydraulics &amp; Engineering Pte Ltd v </span><span class="font-italic">Airtrust (Hong Kong) Ltd and another appeal</span> [2017] 2 SLR 129 on punitive damages, as well as in <span class="font-italic">Alexander Proudfoot Productivity Services Co </span><span class="font-italic">S’pore Pte Ltd v Sim Hua Ngee Alvin and another appeal</span> [1992] 3 SLR(R) 933 at [13] and <span class="font-italic">Wee Kim San Lawrence Bernard v Robinson &amp; Co (Singapore) Pte Ltd</span> [2014] 4 SLR 357 (“<span class="font-italic">Wee Kim San</span>”)<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [25], on the normal measure of damages for wrongful dismissal being the amount the employee would have earned under the contract for the period until the employer could lawfully have terminated it, less the amount he could reasonably be expected to earn in other employment; in this case, ordinarily two months’ earnings for failure to give two months’ notice or payment in lieu thereof. This was implicitly recognised in para 50 of the SOC, save that the plaintiff went further in alluding to aggravated and/or punitive damages.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 In <span class="font-italic">Wee Kim San</span>, the Court of Appeal stated at [38]: “… if the parties have agreed that the employer has a right to terminate the employment contract upon notice or payment of salary in lieu of notice, it would be inconsistent with that contractual right to say that the employer nevertheless has to pay an employee who has been wrongfully dismissed damages that extend beyond the amount of salary payable for the contractual notice period”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 The plaintiff’s claim for aggravated and/or punitive damages on top of two months’ lost earnings was thus obviously unsustainable and I struck it out.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The plaintiff did not have a viable claim for loss of job opportunities</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 The plaintiff’s other causes of action related to his telling three prospective employers that the defendant <span class="font-italic">had</span> filed a misconduct report with the MAS on a certain basis. The context to these pleadings is that the defendant is a financial institution regulated by the MAS, and the MAS had to be satisfied that the plaintiff in his role with the defendant was a “fit and proper” person, having regard to the MAS Guidelines on Fit and Proper Criteria (Guideline No: FSG-G01). Pursuant to Notice No FAA-N14 under the Financial Advisers Act (Cap 110, 2007 Rev Ed) (“FAA”) and Notice No SFA 04-N11 under the Securities and Futures Act (Cap 289, 2006 Rev Ed) (“SFA”) (collectively, the “Notices”), the defendant was required to report misconduct of persons such as the plaintiff to the MAS, if the misconduct fell within the following categories (as further described in para 4 of the Notices):</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Acts Involving Fraud, Dishonesty or Other Offences of a Similar Nature;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Acts Involving Inappropriate Advice, Misrepresentation or Inadequate Disclosure of Information (under the FAA Notice), as well as Acts Relating to Market Conduct Provisions under Part XII of the SFA (under the SFA Notice);</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Failure to Satisfy the Guidelines on Fit and Proper Criteria; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) Other Misconduct (which includes misconduct resulting in, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, “a serious breach of [the defendant’s] internal policy or code of conduct which would render [the plaintiff] liable to demotion, suspension or termination of [the plaintiff’s] employment or arrangement with [the defendant]”).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 The plaintiff’s claim for breach of an implied term of trust and confidence and/or duty of care in tort was focused on the alleged breach pleaded in para 59 of the SOC – that “the [d]efendant erroneously informed the [p]laintiff that they <span class="font-italic">had</span> filed the Misconduct Report under the category of 4(c), relating to a breach of the Fit and Proper guidelines” [emphasis added]. The plaintiff relied on the Termination Notice dated 14 March 2018 to substantiate the alleged breach as pleaded in para 59 of the SOC. In the Termination Notice, however, the defendant only said that a misconduct report “<span class="font-italic">will</span> also be filed with the MAS” [emphasis added]. The misconduct report was filed some five days later on 19 March 2018. Contrary to what the plaintiff told prospective employers, the defendant in fact filed the misconduct report under category 4(d), relating to “Other Misconduct”. The defendant was provided with a copy of the report on 15 June 2018.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 The plaintiff pleaded in para 75 of the SOC that “[a]s a result of the [d]efendant’s breach of its implied term of trust and confidence to the [p]laintiff and/or its duty of care in tort to the [p]laintiff, the [p]laintiff is to date suffering from the loss of opportunity to get hired in a similar role with a similar pay as he had whilst being employed in the capacity of Vice President of the [d]efendant”. Paragraph 75 of the SOC is particularised in paras 76–87 of the SOC. His claim for loss of job opportunities only relates to what he had misinformed three prospective employers between 14 March 2018 when he was terminated, and 15 June 2018 when he received a copy of the misconduct report.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 In line with para 59 of the SOC, the plaintiff pleaded the following:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) In his interview with Credit Suisse SG, “[a]s required by MAS policy, the [p]laintiff informed Credit Suisse that the [d]efendant had filed a Misconduct Report against him under the category of breach of the Fit and Proper guidelines”.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 I struck out the plaintiff’s claim for loss of job opportunities, for which he had asserted breach of an implied term of trust and confidence, breach of a duty of care in tort, and libel. I found that the plaintiff’s claim for loss of job opportunities was bound to fail for two key reasons. First, all that the defendant said in the Termination Notice was that it “<span class="font-italic">will</span>” file a misconduct report and not that it “<span class="font-italic">had</span>” filed such a report. Second, what the defendant said in the Termination Notice did not mean that the plaintiff was not a “fit and proper” person.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The defendant did not say it </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">had</span><span class="font-italic"> filed a misconduct report</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 I turn to the first point. The fundamental flaw in the plaintiff’s case is this: contrary to what was pleaded in para 59 of the SOC, the defendant did not say in the Termination Notice that it <span class="font-italic">had</span> filed a misconduct report. What the Termination Notice stated was: “Nomura <span class="font-italic">will</span> also notify the Monetary Authority of Singapore regarding the cessation of your employment as required by law. A misconduct report <span class="font-italic">will</span> also be filed with the MAS in accordance to the MAS Fit &amp; Proper Guidelines.” [emphasis added] In saying to the plaintiff that “a misconduct report <span class="font-italic">will</span> also be filed with the MAS” [emphasis added], far from saying that a misconduct report had been filed, the defendant was in fact saying that a misconduct report had <span class="font-italic">not </span>been filed yet. That is reinforced by the earlier part of the same statement, that the defendant “<span class="font-italic">will</span> also notify the Monetary Authority of Singapore regarding the cessation of your employment” [emphasis added].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33  Besides the inaccuracy in para 59 of the SOC, para 60 of the SOC also misquotes the Termination Notice: that the defendant would “be notifying” was not the language used in the Termination Notice, which was “will also notify”. Ironically, para 60 of the SOC accurately quotes that “[a] misconduct report <span class="font-italic">will</span> also be filed …” [emphasis added], which contrasts sharply with “<span class="font-italic">had</span> filed” in para 59 of the SOC.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 The actual language used in the Termination Notice thus does not support what was asserted in para 59 of the SOC. Neither does it support what the plaintiff told prospective employers that the defendant <span class="font-italic">had</span> done.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 When the plaintiff informed prospective employers as pleaded in paras 76–78 of the SOC about the misconduct report that the defendant supposedly had filed, or had claimed that it had filed, or about the filing thereof, he was not repeating what the defendant had said in the Termination Notice. He was saying something else altogether – indeed, the very opposite. Moreover, at the time of the events pleaded in paras 76–78 of the SOC, the plaintiff did not even know whether the misconduct report had been filed – he only received a copy of it on 15 June 2018 (as acknowledged in para 63 of the SOC) – yet he had already told prospective employers that the misconduct report had been filed, and even that it had been filed under category 4(c). He then sued the defendant for the loss of job opportunities that his own statements had supposedly caused him.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 In para 5 of his submissions, the plaintiff clarified that he was not claiming in respect of jobs allegedly lost after he became aware of the actual category under which the Misconduct Report was filed, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the relevant job losses were only those in paras 76–78 of the SOC. The plaintiff did not mount a claim based on the Misconduct Report that was actually filed under category 4(d) of “Other Misconduct” (as acknowledged in para 63 of the SOC), but only for what he had told prospective employers.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 In the course of submissions, the plaintiff asked to make certain amendments to the SOC. I will return to this later.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 As things stood, the pleading as to the alleged breach (at para 59 of the SOC) and the alleged loss suffered as a result thereof (at para 75 of the SOC) was defective. The same flaws permeated the libel claim, which was based on it being “foreseeable and the natural, ordinary and probable consequence of the publication of the Words in the [d]efendant’s Termination Notice, that the Words would be repeated by the [p]laintiff in future interviews”.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 What the plaintiff said to prospective employers as pleaded in paras 76–78 of the SOC was relied upon as actionable republication for which the plaintiff sought to hold the defendant liable. The allegedly defamatory “Words” are defined in para 88 of the SOC as “the false statement made by the [d]efendant in its Termination Notice that ‘a report would be filed in accordance to the Fit and Proper Guidelines’ (the “Words”)” [emphasis in original omitted].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 The quote in para 88 of the SOC, purportedly from the Termination Notice, is however inaccurate. The defendant said that a misconduct report “will also be filed”, and not that it “would be filed”, in accordance to the Fit and Proper guidelines. But even the inaccurate quote in para 88 of the SOC (that a report “would” be filed) does not support the meaning that the defendant <span class="font-italic">had</span> filed a misconduct report, let alone under a particular category, which was what the plaintiff told prospective employers as pleaded in paras 76–78 of the SOC.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 The words used in the Misconduct Report were: “A misconduct report will also be filed with the MAS in accordance to the MAS Fit &amp; Proper Guidelines.” The plaintiff argued that this was a reference to category 4(c) in the reporting framework, for “Failure to Satisfy the Guidelines on Fit and Proper Criteria”;

</div> the defendant disputed this. But even if it <span class="font-italic">were</span> a reference to category 4(c), it would merely be a statement of <span class="font-italic">intent</span>. The defendant could still decide to file the report under a different category (in the event, the report was filed under category 4(d)). Unless the defendant told the plaintiff that it had filed a category 4(c) report, or the plaintiff otherwise ascertained this, he should not have told prospective employers that the defendant had filed a category 4(c) report against him, and then sued the defendant for the loss supposedly caused by those statements of his. What the plaintiff told prospective employers was not a repetition of what the defendant had said in the Termination Notice, and it was not republication for which the defendant could be liable.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 The supposed error and falsity of what the defendant said in the Termination Notice (per paras 59 and 88 of the SOC) were based on the same false premise. If paras 59, 60 and 88 of the SOC were corrected, there would then be nothing “false” in the defendant saying in the Termination Notice of 14 March 2018 that “[a] misconduct report will also be filed”, and then making the Misconduct Report in the terms it did on 19 March 2018.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 I also had difficulty understanding the plaintiff’s references in paras 76–77 of the SOC to his being “required” by some MAS policy or guidelines to inform prospective employers that the defendant had filed a misconduct report against him under a particular category – the MAS Guidelines on Fit and Proper Criteria (Guideline No FSG-G01) do not appear to have required that of him, nor did the Notices. In any event, at the time of the Termination Notice no misconduct report had been filed, nor did the defendant say that it <span class="font-italic">had</span> filed one.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The defendant did not say that the plaintiff was not a “fit and proper” person</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 I now address the second critical flaw in the plaintiff’s claim for lost job opportunities. The plaintiff asserted in para 89 of the SOC that the Words meant and/or were understood to mean that he was not a “fit and proper” person. The misquoting of the Words aside, that is not what the Words mean. Their natural and ordinary meaning in the context of the Termination Notice was simply: dismissal of the plaintiff for breaches of confidentiality had to be reported to the MAS, and was a matter which the MAS could take into account in assessing if the plaintiff was still a “fit and proper” person.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 Under the Fit and Proper guidelines, the MAS (and not the defendant) is the party that is to be satisfied that relevant persons are “fit and proper”.

</div>
</div> The defendant’s stated intention to file a misconduct report to the MAS was not a statement by the defendant that the plaintiff was not a “fit and proper” person; this was an assessment that only the MAS could make and that the MAS had yet to make (because the plaintiff’s dismissal and the grounds thereof had yet to be reported by the defendant). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 The MAS might still be satisfied that the plaintiff was a “fit and proper” person despite his dismissal for alleged breaches of confidentiality.

<div class="txt-body text-left">  Para 35(b) of the Defence; Carli Ho-Yee Yung’s affidavit dated 12 February 2020, at para 34. </div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> The defendant never said that the plaintiff was not a “fit and proper” person. If that was what the plaintiff conveyed to prospective employers, he has only himself to blame.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 Indeed, even if the defendant had filed a misconduct report under category 4(c), it would only be saying thereby that the plaintiff had failed to satisfy the Fit and Proper guidelines, and<span class="font-italic"> not</span> that he was not a “fit and proper” person.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 It is telling that the plaintiff’s claim for loss of job opportunities was based solely on what he had misinformed prospective employers in the period of some three months before he found out that the Misconduct Report had been filed and the contents thereof. He was not claiming based on what was actually said in the Misconduct Report, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, under category 4(d) of “Other Misconduct”, regarding breaches of confidentiality leading to dismissal. This was despite such misconduct (and indeed all of the categories of misconduct for which a misconduct report is required) being relevant to the MAS’ assessment of whether a person is “fit and proper”. Put another way, the plaintiff was not claiming for loss of job opportunities on account of the defendant’s summary dismissal of him for breaches of confidentiality and the defendant’s then informing the MAS of that.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 I considered whether the plaintiff should be afforded an opportunity to amend his claim for loss of job opportunities, but concluded that the claim could not be saved by amendment. If the plaintiff now sought to amend paras 59 and 60 of the SOC to accurately describe and quote what was said in the Termination Notice, there would still be an inconsistency between that and what he had told prospective employers as pleaded in paras 76–78 of the SOC. Adopting the language of para 91 of the SOC, it was <span class="font-italic">not</span> foreseeable, and it was <span class="font-italic">not</span> the natural, ordinary and probable consequence of the Termination Notice, that the plaintiff would tell prospective employers that the defendant <span class="font-italic">had</span> filed a misconduct report under a particular category, when what the Termination Notice said was that the defendant <span class="font-italic">will</span> notify the MAS regarding the cessation of the plaintiff’s employment and that a misconduct report <span class="font-italic">will</span> also be filed.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 The inconsistency between the meaning of what the defendant had conveyed to the plaintiff in the Termination Notice, on the one hand, and what the plaintiff then told prospective employers, on the other hand, could not be cured by amendment.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The plaintiff did not have a viable claim to declaratory relief</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 Finally, prayer 4 of the relief sought in the SOC was: “A declaration that the [p]laintiff’s employment was not terminated by the [d]efendant pursuant to a breach of the Fit and Proper guidelines that are ‘<span class="font-italic">applicable to all relevant persons in relation to the carrying out of any activity regulated by the MAS under any written law</span>’ as stated in MAS Guideline No. FSG-G01”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 It was however never the defendant’s case that the plaintiff’s employment was terminated “pursuant to a breach of the Fit and Proper guidelines”. What the defendant stated in its Termination Notice, and in the Misconduct Report, was that the plaintiff’s employment was terminated for breaches of client confidentiality (as the plaintiff acknowledges in paras 9–13 of the SOC). Moreover, it is inappropriate to speak of a <span class="font-italic">breach</span> of the “Fit and Proper” guidelines: they are merely a list of non-exhaustive criteria which the MAS will consider in determining whether relevant persons are “fit and proper”.
