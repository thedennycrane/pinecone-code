At the outset, we note that this appears to be the first time that this issue is squarely before us. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 The facts can be stated briefly. The respondent, the Singapore Rifle Association (“SRA”), is a member of the Singapore Shooting Association (“SSA”). The appellant, Mr Michael Vaz Lorrain (“Mr Vaz”), is the president of SSA’s council. On 8 February 2017, SRA commenced HC/S 109/2017 (“Suit 109”) against Mr Vaz, alleging that he had breached a mediation agreement and/or a duty of confidence. Mr Vaz did not dispute liability. Accordingly, interlocutory judgment for damages to be assessed was entered against Mr Vaz on 23 May 2017. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">3 In due course, damages were assessed and on 25 February 2019, the High Court judge (“the Judge”) awarded damages in favour of SRA in the sum of $8,100 along with interest and costs. Subsequently, he also held that O 22A r 9(3) of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2014 Rev Ed) did not apply to an offer to settle made by Mr Vaz on 3 April 2017 (“the OTS”) as it was not more favourable than the judgment sum obtained by SRA and the costs it had incurred up to the date of the OTS. The terms of the OTS are as follows:

</div>
</div> The parties accepted that CA 60 should be withdrawn but consent to a withdrawal was not forthcoming because of costs. Pursuant to O 57 r 11(3)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the Rules of Court, this court was asked to determine whether the OTS provided for costs. The dispute was on whether O 22A r 9(2) of the Rules of Court applied to the OTS. Order 22A r 9(2) provides for certain costs consequences where “an accepted offer to settle does not provide for costs”. Mr Vaz contended that the OTS did not provide for costs, while SRA took the contrary position. The parties were thus directed to file submissions in respect of that issue. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">5 In the course of reviewing the parties’ costs submissions, we noted that the OTS contained a term requiring SRA to file a “Notice of Discontinuance of Claim” within three working days of the receipt of the sum of $25,000 (see [3] above). We also noted that SRA had prepared its Notice of Discontinuance in readiness for filing after accepting the OTS. In context, the term requiring SRA to file its “Notice of Discontinuance of Claim” in the OTS meant that the action had to be discontinued, apparently despite the fact that judgment had already been given in the High Court. We therefore directed the parties to file further submissions on the following preliminary issue:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The court would like the parties to address it on the preliminary point as to whether the [OTS] could be validly accepted in law in the first instance after a judgment on the merits. In considering this question, the parties are to have regard to the terms of the OTS which have to be complied with upon acceptance of the OTS. In this case, the Acceptance of Offer is dated 5 May 2020 and the OTS requires discontinuance of the claim. Can the OTS be validly accepted if the term requiring discontinuance of the claim is not capable of compliance after judgment on the merits? </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">6 For convenience, we refer to a term that requires the action to be discontinued as a “Discontinuance Term”. In addition, unless otherwise stated, a “judgment” refers to a first instance judgment that completely disposes of the cause of action or matter (both with regard to liability and damages). </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The parties’ further submissions</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">7 We summarise the parties’ further submissions before turning to our analysis of the preliminary issue. The outcome of our decision on the preliminary issue could well dispose of the initial issue that the parties had sought directions on, namely, whether the OTS provided for costs.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">8 Mr Vaz advances the following submissions:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Mr Vaz acknowledges that he had previously taken the position that the OTS was capable of acceptance by SRA. He considered that the Discontinuance Term did not prevent SRA from accepting the OTS, relying on the decision of this court in <span class="font-italic">NTUC Foodfare Co-operative Ltd v SIA Engineering Co Ltd and another </span>[2018] 2 SLR 1043 (“<span class="font-italic">NTUC Foodfare</span>”). There, the offer to settle likewise contained a Discontinuance Term.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Notwithstanding his previous position, Mr Vaz now submits that the OTS could not be validly accepted by SRA. Distinguishing <span class="font-italic">NTUC Foodfare</span>, he argues that once the High Court had delivered judgment, the Discontinuance Term could not be complied with. Hence, the OTS lapsed and ceased to be open for acceptance.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">9 We turn to SRA’s submissions: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) SRA notes that the OTS did not state a time for acceptance. <br/>Order 22A r 3(5) of the Rules of Court provides that “[w]here an offer to settle does not specify a time for acceptance, it may be accepted at any time before the Court disposes of the matter in respect of which it is made”. It was held in <span class="font-italic">NTUC Foodfare </span>that the matter is disposed of only when the appellate court renders its decision on the merits (at [17]).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) SRA argues that the fact that the OTS contained a Discontinuance Term did not mean it was incapable of being accepted. In this connection, SRA refers to <span class="font-italic">NTUC Foodfare </span>and another previous decision of this court, <span class="font-italic">Ong &amp; Ong Pte Ltd v Fairview Developments Pte Ltd </span>[2015] 2 SLR 470 (“<span class="font-italic">Ong &amp; Ong</span>”). The offers to settle in both cases contained a Discontinuance Term. Nonetheless, SRA accepts that a “Notice of Discontinuance … is typically filed before a first instance judgment is rendered”.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Whether the OTS which contained a Discontinuance Term could be accepted after judgment </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">10 We turn to our analysis of the preliminary issue. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">11 In construing an offer to settle, the law should focus on the intentions of the offeror as determined objectively. This is no different from a normal contractual offer (see, for example, <span class="font-italic">Norwest Holdings Pte Ltd (in liquidation) v Newport Mining Ltd </span>[2010] 3 SLR 956 at [34]). The Discontinuance Term in the OTS is unambiguous and an offer to settle with such a term clearly suggests that, objectively construed, the offeror only intended for the offer to settle to be capable of acceptance before judgment was obtained. In our view, the Discontinuance Term contemplates the existence of an outstanding cause or matter not disposed of which is within the scope of the offer to settle, and it is in such an unchanged circumstance that the offer to settle remains open for acceptance. Accordingly, if the Discontinuance Term is not capable of compliance because there is already a judgment on the merits, it would follow that an offer to settle that <span class="font-italic">requires</span> discontinuance is an impotent offer under O 22A that is incapable of acceptance once judgment has been obtained. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">12 In the present case, the OTS was served on 3 April 2017, approximately one month after Mr Vaz filed and served his defence admitting liability but not damages. At the hearing of SRA’s application for summary judgment on 23 May 2017, Mr Vaz consented to interlocutory judgment on liability and damages were to be assessed. On the issue of costs after assessment of damages, on 14 March 2019, the Judge, who was apprised of the OTS, fixed costs. He also ruled that O 22A r 9(3) did not apply to Mr Vaz’s OTS as the offered settlement sum was not more favourable than the damages obtained by SRA and the costs it had incurred up to the date of the OTS. It is clear that Suit 109 had concluded by 14 March 2019.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">13 In the circumstances, the anterior question in relation to whether the OTS could be accepted after judgment is whether an action can be discontinued after judgment. For the reasons that follow, we are satisfied that the question must be answered in the negative as a matter of principle and coherence. We then explain why the cases cited by SRA, namely, <span class="font-italic">NTUC Foodfare </span>and <span class="font-italic">Ong &amp; Ong</span>, can be distinguished for present purposes. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">An action can only be discontinued before judgment</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">14 We begin by considering the well-established doctrine of merger. Pursuant to this doctrine, once a judgment has been given on a cause of action, the cause of action <span class="font-italic">merges </span>with the judgment of the court and ceases to exist as an independent entity. There is no doubt that the doctrine is part of Singapore law (see the decision of this court in <span class="font-italic">Chiam Heng Hsien (on his own behalf and as partner of Mitre Hotel Proprietors) v Chiam Heng Chow (executor of the </span><span class="font-italic">estate of Chiam Toh Say, deceased) and others </span>[2015] 4 SLR 180 at [155]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">15 In <span class="font-italic">Salijah bte Ab Latef v Mohd Irwan bin Abdullah Teo </span>[1995] 3 SLR(R) 233 at [23], the High Court, citing George Spencer Bower and Alexander Kingcome Turner, <span class="font-italic">The Doctrine of Res Judicata </span>(Butterworths, 2nd Ed, 1969) at para 427, referred to the doctrine of merger as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… the merger doctrine, is ‘that any cause of action which results in a judgment of [a] … judicial tribunal, whereby relief is granted to the plaintiff, or other “actor” in the proceedings, is in contemplation of law merged in the judgment, as soon as it is pronounced, and thereby loses its individual vitality and disappears as an independent entity, any … judgment even of the lowest degree being regarded as of a higher nature than any, even the most important, cause of action’ …</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">The High Court’s application of the doctrine of merger was endorsed by this court on appeal (see <span class="font-italic">Salijah bte Ab Latef v Mohd Irwan bin Abdullah Teo </span>[1996] 2 SLR(R) 80 at [76]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">16 Clearly, as a matter of principle, there is simply nothing for the parties to “discontinue” once a judgment has been obtained. Upon judgment, the cause of action merges<span class="font-italic"> </span>with the judgment and the doctrine of <span class="font-italic">res judicata </span>applies. Accordingly, <span class="font-italic">as a matter of law</span>, an action can only be discontinued before judgment. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">17 Indeed, we note that there are Canadian authorities which have similarly taken the position that an action cannot be discontinued after judgment (see, for instance, <span class="font-italic">Karaha Bodas Co LLC v Negara</span> [2011] AJ No 1064 at [3], where the Court of Appeal of Alberta observed that “a discontinuance after judgment is inappropriate”). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">18 The conclusion we have reached is also consistent with O 21 r 4 of the Rules of Court, which sets out the effect of a discontinuance before judgment on the merits:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Subject to any terms imposed by the Court in granting leave under Rule 3, the fact that a party has discontinued or is deemed to have discontinued an action or counterclaim or withdrawn a particular claim made by him therein <span class="font-italic">shall not be a defence to a subsequent action for the same, or substantially the same, cause of action</span>. [emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">19 In our view, O 21 r 4 contemplates a scenario where the cause of action has yet to merge with the judgment of the court and is therefore not extinguished or superseded. This explains why O 21 r 4 refers to a “subsequent action for the same, or substantially the same <span class="font-italic">cause of action</span>” [emphasis added], and provides that a discontinuance shall not operate as a defence to that cause of action being litigated in the future. This supports the principle that an action can only be discontinued before judgment, since the “cause of action” referred to in O 21 r 4 would have merged with the judgment of the court if one had been obtained. In that scenario, the doctrine of <span class="font-italic">res judicata </span>would apply to bar that cause of action from being re-litigated. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">20 We note that in <span class="font-italic">Singapore Civil Procedure 2020 </span>vol 1 (Chua Lee Ming gen ed) (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 10th Ed, 2020), it is suggested at para 21/5/28 that it may be possible (albeit rare) for an action to be discontinued after judgment:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… <span class="font-italic">After judgment</span> — Generally, discontinuance is not permitted after judgment, especially where the plaintiff is not wholly dominus litis; and similarly, after verdict (<span class="font-italic">Stahlschmidt v. Walford</span> (1879) 4 Q.B.D. 217).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">21 However, in our view, the authority cited, <span class="font-italic">Stahlschmidt v Walford </span>(1879) 4 QBD 217, does not suggest that an action can be discontinued after judgment. In short, there was <span class="font-italic">no judgment </span>in that case. There, an action was referred to an arbitrator, and the arbitrator made findings of fact in favour of the defendant. The plaintiff then applied for leave to discontinue the action and Field J granted leave. The defendant appealed against Field J’s decision to allow the discontinuance, precisely because he sought to have a <span class="font-italic">judgment</span> that will have the effect of an estoppel<span class="font-italic"> </span>(at 218). On appeal, Cockburn CJ and Mellor J held that the discontinuance ought not to be allowed, and Cockburn CJ reasoned as follows (at 219):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">It appears to</span> me that the hearing before the arbitrator, and his finding, were substantially equivalent to a trial at Nisi Prius and the verdict of a jury. The defendant, as it seems to me, is in justice entitled to the fruits of these proceedings, and we ought not to interfere to deprive him of them. Admitting that it is a matter of discretion under Order XXIII., rule 1, whether the plaintiff shall be allowed to discontinue, under the circumstances of this case I think, as a matter of discretion, that the plaintiff ought not to be allowed to discontinue.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Coherence with the law on automatic discontinuance</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">22 In reaching the conclusion that an action cannot be discontinued after judgment, we also have regard to our procedural law on automatic discontinuance, whereby it is established that an action is not subject to automatic discontinuance after final judgment is obtained.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">23 Order 21 r 2(6) of the Rules of Court states:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(6) Subject to paragraph (6A), if no party to an action or a cause or matter has, for more than one year (or such extended period as the Court may allow under paragraph (6B)), taken any step or proceeding in the action, cause or matter that appears from records maintained by the Court, the action, cause or matter is deemed to have been discontinued.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(6A) Paragraph (6) shall not apply where the action, cause or matter has been stayed pursuant to an order of court.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 In <span class="font-italic">Tan Kim Seng v Ibrahim Victor Adam</span> [2004] 1 SLR(R) 181 (“<span class="font-italic">Tan Kim Seng</span>”), this court considered whether O 21 r 2(6) applied to <span class="font-italic">interlocutory judgments</span>. The question was answered in the affirmative and it was held that “O 21 r 2(6) would apply to any case where steps are still required to be taken to obtain a judgment which is enforceable” (at [26]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 The corollary that follows from <span class="font-italic">Tan Kim Seng </span>is that O 21 r 2(6) does not apply once a final judgment has been obtained. After all, O 21 r 2(6) is a case management rule to ensure that a litigant pursues a case throughout the course of proceedings in a timely manner. A dilatory litigant faces the prospect of proceedings being automatically discontinued for want of prosecution of a case for more than a year after the last step in the proceedings. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 Accordingly, our holding that an action cannot be discontinued after judgment, which we have defined to exclude interlocutory judgments (see [6] above), would promote coherence in the law.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The cases cited by SRA can be distinguished</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 In contending that the OTS was validly accepted, SRA relies on two decisions of this court, <span class="font-italic">NTUC Foodfare </span>([8(a)] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>)<span class="font-italic"> </span>and <span class="font-italic">Ong &amp; Ong </span>([9(b)] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>). The offers to settle in both cases contained a Discontinuance Term. In our judgment, these two decisions do not affect the analysis we have set out above. In both cases, this court did not squarely address the preliminary issue – whether an offer to settle which contains a Discontinuance Term can be validly accepted after judgment. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 Further, both decisions can also be distinguished on other bases. In <span class="font-italic">Ong &amp; Ong</span>, the matter was bifurcated and the facts may be summarised as follows: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The plaintiff commenced an action against the defendant, and the defendant responded with a counterclaim (at [3] and [4]).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Thereafter, the plaintiff served on the defendant an offer to settle which contained a Discontinuance Term (at [5]). </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) The trial was bifurcated. The High Court granted interlocutory judgment for the plaintiff in respect of one claim, but dismissed the other. The High Court dismissed the defendant’s counterclaim. Damages were ordered to be assessed (at [6]).  </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) Both parties appealed against the High Court’s interlocutory judgment. The defendant did not appeal against the dismissal of the counterclaim (at [8]). </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) On appeal, the plaintiff’s appeal was allowed and the defendant’s appeal was dismissed. On the same day, the defendant accepted the plaintiff’s offer to settle (at [10]). The plaintiff replied that the counterclaim had been determined when the defendant did not appeal against the High Court’s dismissal of the counterclaim. Accordingly, the court had disposed of the matter in respect of which the offer to settle was made, and it was no longer capable of acceptance (at [11]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 The issue in <span class="font-italic">Ong &amp; Ong </span>was thus whether an offer to settle can be accepted if the court has disposed of <span class="font-italic">part </span>of the matter (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the counterclaim in <span class="font-italic">Ong &amp; Ong</span>). This court held that “so long as there is an outstanding matter not disposed of which is within the scope of the offer to settle, the offer to settle remains open for acceptance” (at [54] and [55]). Since damages had to be assessed for the plaintiff’s claims, there were outstanding matters which had not been disposed of. Consequently, the offer to settle remained open for acceptance. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 The scenario is materially different in the present case. Here, the Judge had decided <span class="font-italic">both</span> the issue of liability and damages and there was simply nothing left in the concluded action for SRA to “discontinue”. As explained at [11] above, the Discontinuance Term is an indication that the offer to settle was not intended to survive beyond the conclusion of the action. Indeed, the emphasis placed by this court in <span class="font-italic">Ong &amp; Ong </span>on the fact that there had been an outstanding matter not yet disposed of fortifies the conclusion we have reached. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 We turn to <span class="font-italic">NTUC Foodfare </span>([8(a)] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>). There, the plaintiff commenced an action against the defendants. Eleven days before the trial, the defendants served an offer to settle that was <span class="font-italic">never accepted </span>by the plaintiff. The offer to settle contained a Discontinuance Term (at [3], [4] and [7]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 The High Court dismissed the plaintiff’s claims. However, this court allowed the plaintiff’s appeal. On the issue of costs, an issue which arose was whether O 22A r 9(3) applied. Order 22A r 9(3) reads:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Costs (O. 22A, r. 9)</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(3) Where an offer to settle made by a defendant —</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) <span class="font-italic">is not withdrawn and has not expired before the disposal of the claim in respect of which the offer to settle is made</span>; and</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) is not accepted by the plaintiff, and the plaintiff obtains judgment not more favourable than the terms of the offer to settle, </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">the plaintiff is entitled to costs on the standard basis to the date the offer was served and the defendant is entitled to costs on the indemnity basis from that date, unless the Court orders otherwise.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33  The plaintiff argued that the offer to settle was <span class="font-italic">not</span> open for acceptance after the trial ended. To the contrary, the defendants submitted that the offer to settle was open for acceptance until the disposal of the appeal (at [9] and [10]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 This court agreed with the defendants and reasoned as follows at [16] and [17]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">16 It is not in dispute that the respondents did not withdraw the OTS at any time. However, NTUC Foodfare claims that the OTS expired upon the conclusion of the trial. We disagree. Here, the OTS did not specify a time for acceptance. Order 22A r 3(5), which provides for this scenario, states:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(5) Where an offer to settle <span class="font-italic">does not specify a time for acceptance</span>, it may be accepted <span class="font-italic">at any time before the Court disposes of the matter</span> in respect of which it is made. …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">17 Under O 22A r 3(5), the OTS remained open for acceptance ‘at any time before the Court <span class="font-italic">dispose[d] of the matter</span> in respect of which it [was] made’ … It is settled law that for the purposes of O 22A r 9(3)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>), ‘the disposal of the claim’ refers to the final disposal of the claim on appeal if an appeal is filed: see <span class="font-italic">Man B&amp;W Diesel S E Asia Pte Ltd v PT Bumi International Tankers </span>[2004] 3 SLR(R) 267 at [20] and <span class="font-italic">Ram Das V N P v SIA Engineering Co Ltd</span> [2015] 3 SLR 267 at [73]. In our judgment, the phrase ‘dispos[al] of the matter’ in O 22A r 3(5) must be interpreted consistently with O 22A r 9(3)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) to refer to the final disposal of the claim on appeal where there is an appeal. We therefore conclude that under O 22A r 3(5), the OTS remained open for acceptance until 19 July 2018, when we issued the Judgment … which finally disposed of the claim. Hence, the Validity Requirement is satisfied.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[Court of Appeal’s emphasis in <span class="font-italic">NTUC Foodfare </span>in italics]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 As stated at [27] above, <span class="font-italic">NTUC Foodfare </span>may be distinguished on the basis that the preliminary issue considered in this case was not an issue there, and was therefore not addressed. The defendants’ offer to settle was in any event never accepted by the plaintiff. Furthermore, the question of whether there could be compliance with the requirement of discontinuance after judgment was not an issue before the court. With regard to the general proposition that an offer to settle may be accepted after judgment, we provide some preliminary observations below.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Decision on preliminary issue</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 In sum, an action can only be discontinued <span class="font-italic">before </span>judgment and we reach this conclusion for reasons of principle and coherence. Since the OTS in question required discontinuance of a concluded action that is no longer legally possible, the OTS is impotent and incapable of valid acceptance. It should be construed as being capable of acceptance only before judgment was obtained. Thus, SRA’s purported acceptance of the OTS on 5 May 2020 was <span class="font-italic">not</span> valid. In the circumstances, it is no longer necessary for us to consider the initial issue that the parties had sought directions on, namely, whether the OTS provided for costs (see [4] above). </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Preliminary observations on whether an offer to settle can be accepted after judgment regardless of whether it contains a discontinuance term</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 We turn to make some preliminary observations on whether an offer to settle can be accepted after judgment, <span class="font-italic">regardless of whether it contains a Discontinuance Term</span>. To be clear, because of the analysis set out above, it is unnecessary for us to reach a conclusive view on this broader issue. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 We begin with statutory interpretation. The relevant provision in this regard is O 22A r 3(5) of the Rules of Court: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">5) Where an offer to settle does not specify a time for acceptance, it may be accepted at any time before the <span class="font-italic">Court</span> disposes of the matter in respect of which it is made. [emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 It should be noted that the Rules of Court contains a specific definition of “Court”, as defined in O 1 r 4(2):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(2) In these Rules, unless the context otherwise requires, <span class="font-italic">‘Court’</span><span class="font-italic"> means the High Court or a District Court</span>, or a judge of the High Court or District Judge, whether sitting in Court or in Chambers, and includes, in cases where he is empowered to act, a Magistrate or the Registrar; but the foregoing provision shall not be taken as affecting any provision of these Rules and, in particular, Order 32, Rule 9, by virtue of which the authority and jurisdiction of the Registrar is defined and regulated. [emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 Order 22A r 3(5) can be contrasted with other provisions in the Rules of Court which make explicit reference to the Court of Appeal:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Extension, etc., of time (O. 3, r. 4)</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">...</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(4) In this Rule, references to the Court shall be construed as including references to the Court of Appeal.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Notice of change of solicitor (O. 64, r. 1)</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">1.—(1) A party to any cause or matter who sues or defends by a solicitor may change his solicitor without an order for that purpose but, until notice of the change is filed and served in accordance with this Rule, the former solicitor shall, subject to Rules 4 and 5, be considered the solicitor of the party until the final conclusion of the cause or matter, whether in the Court or the Court of Appeal.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Leave to appeal to Court of Appeal (O. 69, r. 8)</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">8.

It should be noted that the offer to settle regimes in a number of Canadian and Australian states formed the background against which O 22A was included in Singapore’s civil procedure rules (see <span class="font-italic">Ram Das V N P v SIA Engineering Co Ltd </span>[2015] 3 SLR 267 at [36] and <span class="font-italic">Ong &amp; Ong</span> at [15]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 The relevant case from Ontario<span class="font-italic"> </span>is <span class="font-italic">Grass</span><span class="font-italic"> (Litigation guardian of) v Women’s College Hospital </span>[2004] OJ No 1519. There, the first trial was held in 1998 and judgment was rendered in 1999. A new trial was then ordered by the Court of Appeal in 2001 and the second trial was held in 2003. The plaintiff had made an offer to settle before the first trial, and argued that the offer to settle was “resurrected” when the Court of Appeal overturned the first trial disposition. The Ontario Superior Court of Justice dismissed this argument, but in so doing, also observed that both parties had agreed that the offer to settle was not open for acceptance after the first trial judge rendered judgment (at [21]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-italic">Both sides agree that the offer to settle was not open for acceptance once the first trial judge rendered judgment. Rule 49.04(4) [of Ontario’s Rules of Civil Procedure O Reg 575/07, s 6(1)] provides: ‘An offer may not be accepted after the court disposes of the claim in respect of which the offer is made.’</span> It is the plaintiffs’ position,<span class="font-weight-bold font-italic"> </span>however, that the rule only prevents acceptance of the offer after disposition, but does not cause<span class="font-weight-bold font-italic"> </span>the offer to expire. Hence, they argue, their offer to settle was resurrected and continued in force<span class="font-weight-bold font-italic"> </span>after the Court of Appeal overturned the first trial disposition. I disagree. Such an interpretation<span class="font-weight-bold font-italic"> </span>is inconsistent with the plain reading and purpose of Rule 49.04(4). Further, such an<span class="font-weight-bold font-italic"> </span>interpretation has the potential to cause mischief, particularly when further proceedings have<span class="font-weight-bold font-italic"> </span>added to the cost of the litigation. In addition, parties may have changed counsel for the purpose<span class="font-weight-bold font-italic"> </span>of the appeal or for a second trial. In this case, the parties apparently conducted the ongoing<span class="font-weight-bold font-italic"> </span>litigation as though the offer had expired. Five years elapsed between the offer and the<span class="font-weight-bold font-italic"> </span>commencement of the second trial. None of the parties had a reasonable expectation that the offer continued to be open for acceptance. The plaintiffs’ costs of the first and second trial will be consequently awarded on a partial-indemnity basis. [emphasis in original omitted; emphasis added in italics]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 Finally, in our view, there are also sound policy reasons why an offer to settle should not be open for acceptance after judgment. In <span class="font-italic">Singapore Airlines Ltd v Tan Shwu Leng </span>[2001] 3 SLR(R) 439 at [37], this court noted that “the whole object of O 22A is to spur the parties to bring litigation to an expeditious end <span class="font-italic">without judgment</span>, and thus to save costs and judicial time” [emphasis added]. The purpose of O 22A is thus promoted by holding that an offer to settle can only be accepted before judgment. Conversely, if an offer to settle can be accepted after judgment, this may encourage offerees to adopt a “wait and see” approach. Offerees may be incentivised to wait for the judgment and to then accept the offer to settle only if it is more favourable than the judgment. Taken to its logical conclusion, if an offer to settle can be accepted at any time before the appellate court disposes of the matter, it also means that it can even be accepted after the hearing of the appeal, let alone after the first instance judgment. This, in our preliminary view, does not further the purpose of the <br/>O 22A regime. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 We acknowledge that our preliminary observations may appear to contradict <span class="font-italic">NTUC Foodfare </span>([8(a)] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) at [17]. Nonetheless, as we have explained, it is not necessary for us to reach a conclusive view on whether an offer to settle can be accepted after judgment. We therefore leave this issue for detailed consideration on a future occasion, where the parties may make their submissions with the benefit of our foregoing observations.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 For the above reasons, we answer the preliminary issue in the negative. SRA’s acceptance of the OTS on 5 May 2020 was not valid. The Registry will convey to the parties the relevant directions concerning the reinstatement of the hearing date of the appeal. The issue of costs is reserved to the main appeal. </div><div class="Judg-Sign text-left">Andrew Phang Boon Leong                               Belinda Ang Saw Ean<br/>Judge of Appeal                               Judge</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Lee Hwee Khiam Anthony and Huineng Clement Chen (Bih Li &amp; Lee LLP) for the appellant;</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Wong Hin Pkin Wendell, Chen Jie’an Jared, Wong Zi Qiang, Bryan and Andrew Chua Ruiming (Drew &amp; Napier LLC) for the respondent.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
