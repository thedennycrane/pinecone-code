</div> The Assistant Registrar then rejected the Defendants’ argument that Mr Plekhanov had no authority to enter into the debt assignment agreement, finding instead that there was no basis for the Defendants to contend otherwise. Further, any procedural issues associated with the signing of the debt assignment agreement were not such as to preclude its effectiveness.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">17 It was also argued that there was a prohibition of such an assignment, and that Mr Plekhanov had an interest in the Plaintiff. A further argument raised was that there was a conflict of interest on the part of the solicitors acting for the Plaintiff because of their prior involvement in this dispute. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Summary of the Respondent’s Arguments</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">18 The Plaintiff (the respondent in RA 315) maintained that it had made out a <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> case, based on the evidence it had adduced through its affidavits and documents, that the sum of US$ 2,592,000 was due and owed by the Defendants. The payment-creating obligation in the Settlement Agreement was pointed to, as was the clause assigning OMS’s rights to the Plaintiff in the debt assignment agreement. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">19 It was further asserted that no triable issues were made out. First, no settlement had been reached between OMS and the Defendants which extinguished the debt created by the Settlement Agreement. Second, there is no evidence that Mr Plekhanov had no authority to execute the debt assignment on behalf of OMS. Third, the Settlement Agreement did not prevent or prohibit any such assignment. Fourth, there was no conflict of interest on the part of the solicitors acting for the plaintiff. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">20 In addition, no triable issue arose as to the allegation, raised only on appeal, that the debt assignment agreement was executed only in January 2019. This assertion was raised in the context of further arguments by the Defendants that Mr Plekhanov may not have been the beneficial owner of OMS, that he had a personal interest in the Plaintiff’s claim, and that he was, even as late as in December, continuing to negotiate with Ms Ling Li. Whether or not Plekhanov was the beneficial owner of OMS was immaterial, and was not supported by the evidence in any event. Similarly, any interest that Plekhanov had in the Plaintiff’s claim was irrelevant and unfounded. The allegation that the debt assignment could only have been signed after January 2020 was not supported either.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The Decision</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">21 I was satisfied that no real or <span class="font-italic">bona fide</span> defence was raised.

The Court of Appeal also referred to the formulation in <span class="font-italic">Goh Chok Tong v Chee Soon Juan</span> [2003] 3 SLR(R) 32 at [25] that leave would not be granted where the court could not find that there was a reasonable probability that the defendant had a real or <span class="font-italic">bona fide</span> defence. At [41] of <span class="font-italic">Akfel Commodities</span>, the Court of Appeal synthesised the approach as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… If the judge is satisfied that the plaintiff has shown a <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> case for judgment but is also satisfied that the defendant has demonstrated a fair probability of a <span class="font-italic">bona fide</span> defence, unconditional leave to defend should be granted. In determining whether such a demonstration has been made by the defendant, factual assertions made by the plaintiff and not disputed by the defendant may be taken into account by the court. But where what the defendant has shown does not amount to a fair probability of a <span class="font-italic">bona fide</span> defence, but only that the defence raised is not hopeless, it is warranted for the court to impose conditional leave to defend.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 It is not sufficient for the Defendant to throw up factual assertions without more.

Clause 2 of the Settlement Agreement (set out above at [3]) unequivocally creates an obligation on the part of the Defendants to pay the sum of US$ 2,592,000 to OMS. Similarly, cl 1.1 of the debt assignment agreement expressly provides that: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[OMS] hereby assigns, transfers and sets over unto [the Plaintiff] the Debt together with all advantage and benefit to be derived therefrom including the right to claim the Debt from the [Defendants] by all applicable means.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">As found by the Assistant Registrar, the Debt Assignment Agreement is sufficient evidence that the money owed by the Defendants to OMS had been, on the face of it, assigned to the Plaintiff. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 The Defendants did not seriously take issue with the Plaintiff’s case in this regard: there was no assertion that the debt assignment agreement did not exist; rather, the primary controversy was that it did not have any legal effect because of Mr Plekhanov’s lack of authority of to execute that document at the relevant time. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Mr Plekhanov’s authority to enter into the debt assignment agreement</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 One central pillar of the Defendants’ case is that Mr Plekhanov lacked the authority to enter into the debt assignment agreement. This runs into the clear and obvious difficulty that a power of attorney was in fact issued by OMS in Mr Plekhanov’s favour on 20 December 2018.

</div> In other words, therefore, Ms Ling Li was alleging that those two powers of attorney were forgeries. However, this runs into clearly insurmountable difficulties: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) First, one would have expected her to have raised some alarm about the potential forgery or improper procurement of the powers of attorney. Instead, Ms Ling Li appears to have been remarkably blasé about forgeries being made in her name. All she did was to send a letter dated 7 January 2019 to “revoke” the two powers of attorney.

This flat contradiction is inexplicable, and I did not accept the Defendants’ attempted rationalisation that the powers of attorney had been properly signed, but had been procured by misrepresentations from Mr Plekhanov. After all, Ms Ling Li had categorically stated that she had “<span class="font-italic">never</span>” signed “<span class="font-italic">any</span>” powers of attorney after 28 May 2018 (emphasis original). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">Given what I can only describe as a somewhat cavalier relationship with the truth illustrated by these issues, the argument that Ms Ling Li or OMS did not issue a power of attorney on 20 Dec 2018 is totally incapable of belief. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 Accordingly, I rejected the Defendants’ submission that Mr Plekhanov lacked the authority to enter into the debt assignment agreement because the power of attorney dated 20 December 2018 was forged.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The date of execution of the debt assignment agreement</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 A further tier of the Defendants’ case is an argument that the debt assignment agreement was executed on or after 7 January 2019. This is significant because by that time, the power of attorney granted by OMS to Mr Plekhanov would have been revoked, pursuant to a letter of revocation dated 7 January 2019 from Ms Ling Li. In the alternative, the Defendants argue that the debt assignment agreement was not executed at all. The Defendants’ argument is that there was a delay in the Plaintiff issuing its notice of assignment, and that Mr Plekhanov had in fact continued to negotiate with Ms Ling Li about reissuing the requisite power of attorney and transferring the ownership of OMS to him in December. The crux of the Defendants’ reasoning here is that, given that the assignment had supposedly occurred on 28 December 2018 (the date the debt assignment agreement was signed), it was odd that the Plaintiff only gave notice to the Defendants of the assignment of the debt in February 2019.

</div> Accordingly, the Defendants asserted that the debt assignment agreement must only have been executed sometime in January 2019, closer to when the Plaintiff started demanding payment. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 However, this contention was not supported by anything concrete, and was founded really on speculation as regards Mr Plekhanov’s supposed power and authority at the time. This was not substantiated on the documentary evidence and did not, to my mind, raise any triable issue.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 Quite simply, and somewhat unsurprisingly, the Plaintiff pointed to the fact that the debt assignment agreement was signed by Mr Plekhanov for OMS and the Plaintiff, and that such signing was dated 28 December 2018. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 I accept the Plaintiff’s arguments that any lapse of time or delay in issuing the notice of assignment did not assist the Defendants in raising a triable issue.  There are many possible reasons for a delay of that nature, and it is within the rights of the Plaintiff to issue the notice of assignment when it deems fit: it takes its risks of a late notice. A two-month gap is not the sort of delay that would trigger alarm bells; it may not be prompt, but it was not dilatory. I did not see that delay as in any way indicative of the assertion which the Defendants had made. In any event, the tenuous inference the Defendants invited me to draw was simply inadequate when contrasted with the fact that the debt assignment agreement was signed and dated 28 December 2018.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 The Plaintiff put forward the explanation for the two-month delay that the time was taken to ensure that the risk of Ms Ling Li disrupting the transaction would be minimised, particularly as she had revoked a number of powers of attorney given to Mr Plekhanov, and made allegations that the dispute had been settled between OMS and the Defendants.

</div>
</div> Put simply, the time was given for Mr Plekhanov to try to resolve the matters and disputes he had with Ms Ling Li concerning her compensation and payment. As this was not, however, achieved by February, the Plaintiff declined to wait any further and decided to issue the notice then.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 The explanation put forward by the Plaintiff appears to be reasonable, and when take against the backdrop of the point considered above – that any lapse in the giving of the notice was not dilatory – any inference that the assignment was not in fact signed on the date stated is very weak. The inference could not support the Defendants’ contentions and the Defendants had no substantive evidence in support at all. I did not see even the fair probability of a <span class="font-italic">bona fide</span> defence or triable issue being raised. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 Aside from the signed document, there was also the affidavit evidence of Ms Larisa Ershova (“Ms Ershova”) for the Plaintiff, which was not really disputed. Ms Ershova’s evidence was that, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, pursuant to a personal dispute between Ms Ling Li and Mr Plekhanov, Ms Ling Li had resigned as trustee over Mr Plekhanov’s shares in OMS. However, she had taken no steps to vest legal ownership of the shares in OMS back to Mr Plekhanov or step down as a director of OMS, and this formed the substantive background against which the dispute between Mr Plekhanov and Ms Ling Li arose.

</div> I cannot see that there can be any issue here.  Furthermore, whether the discontinuance occurred is a matter of record and need not be proven. I did not see any contradiction between [15] of the Reply and the Plaintiff’s claim that Suit 486 was discontinued after the debt assignment agreement had been entered into. All that [15] of the Reply indicates is that sometime after 8 January 2019 and the receipt of a letter directing that Oon &amp; Bazul LLP discontinue Suit 486, Mr Plekhanov had also instructed Oon &amp; Bazul LLP to discontinue that Suit. There was no suggestion that Mr Plekhanov’s instruction did not stem from the assignment of the debt, nor was there anything which indicated that Mr Plekhanov’s instructions were influenced by or pursuant to the receipt of the earlier letter. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 The allegations that the debt assignment agreement was backdated or had not been signed at all were not supported by any evidence before me, and therefore did not establish any valid defence that would have called for a trial. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Mr Plekhanov’s ownership of OMS</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 The Defendants also claimed that Mr Plekhanov lacked authority to enter into the debt assignment agreement because he was not the beneficial owner of OMS.

</div> This was, as argued by the Defendants, a distinct ground of defence from that considered above. This present ground goes towards Mr Plekhanov’s overall beneficial ownership of OMS, as compared to whether or not his signing the debt assignment agreement was covered by the power of attorney granted to him by OMS on 20 December 2018.   </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 I had considerable difficulty with this submission by the Defendants. Mr Plekhanov’s beneficial interest in OMS was not, after all, seriously challenged by Ms Ling Li. As pointed out by the Plaintiff, there did not appear to be any direct evidence form Ms Ling Li asserting ownership displacing or in place of Mr Plekhanov. Instead, Ms Ling Li accepted that the shares of OMS belonged to Mr Plekhanov, and that she held these on trust for him. She expressly states that “there was a point in time where the shares in OMS were held by [her] on trust for Mr Plekhanov pursuant to a declaration of trust dated 18 February 2016”.

Indeed, as argued by the Plaintiff, Ms Ling Li accepted that she held the shares on trust for Mr Plekhanov. In fact, the dispute between Ms Ling Li and Ms Plekhanov appears to have been focused on the proper compensation and benefits due to Ms Ling Li, and what should be given to her before she transferred legal title to the shares back to Mr Plekhanov.

</div>
</div> There was no allegation that the shares did not belong to Mr Plekhanov, or that they belonged to her entirely, or that there was someone else who held ownership.   </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 None of the various factual matters raised by the Defendants pointed to any difficulties with Mr Plekhanov’s ownership as such, including the fresh evidence raised on appeal. Neither the correspondence relating to Ms Ling Li’s unwillingness to sign off on various documents, nor the fact that OMS’s solicitors had dealings with her, could be said to be decisive or even indicative of Ms Ling Li’s beneficial ownership of OMS. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 In comparison, the documentary evidence that Mr Plekhanov is the beneficial owner of OMS is very strong. While the Defendants argued that there were emails showing that Plekhanov was trying to buy OMS from Ms Ling Li, that is a clear misreading of the emails. Rather, those emails were clearly concerned with the question of Ms Ling Li’s trusteeship, and this dovetails with the fact that Ms Ling Li herself accepted that she held the shares on trust until her unilateral resignation as trustee on 28 May 2018. This account then ties into Ms Ershova’s account (see [37] above) of Mr Plekhanov trying to get Ms Ling Li to transfer those shares back. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 The Plaintiff has also correctly argued that a fresh defence that is not pleaded cannot be relied upon: <span class="font-italic">Olivine Capital Pte Ltd </span><span class="font-italic">and another v Chia Chin Yan and another matter</span> [2014] 2 SLR 1371 at [43].

The fresh defence does not strike at the heart of the Court’s powers, and the Defendants in fact voiced no objection, all the way until their more recent written submissions, to the claim that Mr Plekhanov beneficially owned OMS.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 In sum on this point, no substantial defence could be raised by the Defendants on the back of the dispute between Ms Ling Li and Mr Plekhanov. It was not at all tenable for the Defendants to seek to impugn Mr Plekhanov’s beneficial ownership of OMS given Ms Ling Li’s admissions on affidavit, the signed declaration of trust dated 18 February 2016 (see above at [43]), and the fact that the Defendants had not even pleaded that Mr Plekhanov did not beneficially own OMS. In any event, these contentions ultimately did not assist the Defendants at all since the basis of the assignment of the US$ 2,592,000 to the Plaintiff – the power of attorney dated 20 December 2018 – was not at all impugned or undermined by these arguments, which went instead towards Mr Plekhanov’s beneficial ownership of OMS. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Mr Plekhanov’ s interest in the Plaintiff</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 The Defendants took issue with Mr Plekhanov having an interest in the Plaintiff as a further argument for resisting summary judgment.

However, nothing of that nature was found in the evidence.

Further, the Defendants had no qualms disclosing details of its settlement in Suit 486 in its pleaded defence.

But even setting that issue aside, I did not see how any alleged impropriety on the part of the Plaintiff’s solicitors affected the viability or <span class="font-italic">bona fides</span> of the Defendants’ pleaded defences. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 In sum, the Defendants’ pleaded defences were wholly untenable, and several of them were propped up solely by bare and unfounded assertions. Where there were contemporaneous documentary records, they spoke with one voice against the Defendants’ case. Even the affidavits relied upon by the Defendants were riven with blatant contradictions that, try as they might, could not be explained away. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 For the above reasons, I dismissed RA 315.</div><div class="Judg-Sign text-left">Aedit Abdullah<br/>Judge</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Bazul Ashhab bin Abdul Kader, Ashvin Shanmugaraj Thevar, and Chan Cong Yen, Lionel (Chen Congren) (Oon &amp; Bazul LLP) for the plaintiff;</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Vasantha Kumar s/o N K Perumal (Vas Kumar &amp; Co) for the defendants.</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right"></div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
