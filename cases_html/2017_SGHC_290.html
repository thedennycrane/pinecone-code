The first accused person, Ramesh a/l Perumal (“Ramesh”), was a passenger in the said lorry. When in Singapore, the accused persons parted ways.

As for Chander, he argues that he did not know that the nine bundles of diamorphine that are the subject of his charges contained diamorphine; rather, he thought that the bundles contained betel nuts. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">4 At the end of the joint trial, I reserved judgment.

After entering Singapore, Chander drove to a location along Woodlands Road, Singapore, where another delivery lorry bearing registration number JMG 7398 (“the second lorry”) was parked.

Harun approached the first lorry and opened the door of the front passenger side of the lorry. Chander informed Harun that his items were on the passenger’s side of the lorry. Harun then retrieved a white plastic bag (“E1”), which contained three bundles wrapped in black tape (“E1A”, “E1B” and “E1C”; collectively, “the E bundles”), from the floor of the passenger’s side of the first lorry, placed an envelope and a stack of cash on the passenger seat, and left. Chander then drove off from the location.

He also claimed that this was the first time that Chander had ever told him to hold onto a bag.

</div> On 26 June 2013, at about 5.30am, he hitched a motorcycle ride from his friend, one Murugan, who was an old friend from another transport company that he used to work for, to his office. According to Ramesh, although he usually does not hitch a ride from Murugan, he decided to do so on that day as he “was afraid [that Chander] might be late for work”. However, in the same breath, Ramesh also said that “[Chander] is habitually late for work”. Ramesh reached his office at 5.40am, while Chander arrived ten minutes after. They set off for Woodlands Checkpoint at about 6.15am, and arrived at about 7.20am.

Ramesh claimed that he was confused as he “did not know why he would want to give [him] his bag”. According to Ramesh, he only saw D1 when Chander wanted to pass it to him. Ramesh asked Chander why he gave him D1. In response, Chander told him “to help him keep the bag as it contained some office documents”. Ramesh felt that D1 was heavy and hence again asked Chander what was in D1. Chander again replied that it contained office documents. After Chander drove off in the first lorry, Ramesh opened the door of the second lorry and “threw the bag onto the space beside the driver seat”. Ramesh then drove off at about 8am.

The material portions are summarised as follows:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) About four months before his arrest, Chander was first approached by one Roy, a Malaysian Indian man living in his estate, to deliver undeclared betel nuts (also known as “pakku” in Tamil and “pinang” in Malay). Chander agreed to do so and hence in May 2013, he helped to deliver one bundle of betel nuts to Harun. Harun passed Chander an envelope containing money in exchange, which Chander in turn passed to Roy at a coffee shop near his office. Roy counted the money in the envelope in front of Chander. Chander was paid RM250 for the delivery.

Roy stated that Chander was to deliver “3 small bundles to one person, 4 small bundles to another person, and 2 small bundles to another person”. Specifically, the first three bundles were meant for delivery at Woodlands, the next four bundles were meant for delivery at Bedok, and he would be told where to deliver the last two bundles subsequently. Chander was initially reluctant, but eventually agreed. Chander enlisted Ramesh to help with the delivery of the set of four bundles. Likewise, Ramesh was initially reluctant, but eventually agreed. Chander assumed that Roy agreed to place the bundles in the basket of Chander’s motorcycle.

At that time, Chander observed that the nine bundles had already been neatly separated into three separate plastic bags of four bundles, three bundles and two bundles respectively, and stacked in the motorcycle basket. Chander gave Ramesh a lift to their office on his motorcycle. While Ramesh helped to park Chander’s motorcycle, Chander pulled open the cover of the dashboard at the front of the first lorry and placed the plastic bags containing all nine bundles inside the compartment. At that time, Ramesh did not see where Chander had kept the bundles. However, Chandra told Ramesh where the bundles were kept while they were on the causeway, having passed the Malaysia customs.

There, Chander “told Ramesh to open the dashboard and take the 4 bundles that were meant for him”. Ramesh asked Chander how he should keep the four bundles.

A few minutes later, Chander received a call from a Singaporean number. The caller, who spoke in Malay, arranged to meet Chander at the market at 20 Marsiling Lane.

There, Harun, who was waiting alongside Tang, opened the passenger door of the lorry, collected the E bundles from the floor of the passenger’s side of the lorry, placed an envelope containing a stack of cash and a separate bundle of notes tied with a rubber band on the passenger seat, and left. Chander then drove off from the location. While driving, he received a call from Roy’s friend, who asked if he had taken the money and instructed him to count the money. Chander then counted the money while he was driving, and realised that it came up to S$7,000. Chander wondered to himself “how can ‘pinang’ cost so much”, and also expressed this concern to Roy’s friend, who had called again. Roy’s friend claimed that the money was debt for a previous shipment. After counting the money, Chander tied all the notes up with the same rubber band and placed them, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, C1, in the compartment above the driver’s seat. Roy’s friend also informed Chander that the remaining two bundles, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the AB bundles, were to be delivered to someone riding a black motorcycle and wearing a red shirt.

This presumption is rebutted if the accused is able to prove, on a balance of probabilities, that he did not have the drugs in his possession. The clearest way in which the accused can accomplish this is by establishing that he did not know that the thing in issue contained the drug in question (<span class="font-italic">eg</span>, the drug was slipped into his bag without his knowledge). If the presumption under s 18(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) has been successfully rebutted by the accused, the Prosecution would have failed to prove that the accused was in possession of the drug.

This presumption is rebutted if the accused is able to prove, on a balance of probabilities, that he did not have knowledge of the nature of the controlled drug, which refers to the specific controlled drug found in his possession. The accused can do so by showing that he did not know or could not reasonably be expected to have known the nature of the controlled drug. Practically speaking, this entails the accused explaining what he thought or believed he was carrying, which could either be something innocuous or a controlled drug other than the one found on him. The court will assess the credibility and veracity of the accused’s account against the objective facts, in the light of the item that the accused thought he was carrying. It would not be possible for the accused to rebut the presumption where the Prosecution is able to prove that the accused was acting with actual knowledge or wilful blindness (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, where the accused had the appropriate level of suspicion but deliberately refused to inquire into the facts to investigate further).

Chander’s evidence – that Ramesh had placed the D bundles into D1 and left the first lorry with D1 – directly proves Ramesh’s possession of the D bundles. Alternatively, the Prosecution relies on the presumption of possession under s 18(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the MDA, which arises by virtue of Ramesh’s own admission that Chander had passed D1 to him and that D1 was in his possession.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Second, knowledge of the nature of the drugs is satisfied. In this respect, the Prosecution relies on the presumption of knowledge under s 18(2) of the MDA and argues that given that Ramesh has been proven or presumed to have had in his possession the D bundles, Ramesh is presumed to have known that the D bundles contained diamorphine.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Third, the requirement for the possession of the drugs to be “for the purpose of trafficking” is made out by Chander’s evidence that Ramesh was supposed to deliver the D bundles to a recipient in Bedok. Alternatively, Ramesh’s own admission that he was going to return D1 and its contents to Chander would also satisfy the definition of “traffic” under s 2 of the MDA.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 In response, Ramesh essentially asserts that although Chander had indeed passed D1 to him, he did not know that there were controlled drugs found inside D1. He had asked Chander what was inside D1, and Chander replied by stating that D1 merely contained office documents. This directly contradicts Chander’s evidence that Chander had told him to put the D bundles into D1.

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> With respect, I find this submission to be misguided. I think the evidence adduced by Ramesh goes towards showing that possession under s 5(2) of the MDA is not made out, by introducing a reasonable doubt as to his possession of diamorphine, and also by rebutting the s 18(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) presumption of possession. If Ramesh succeeds in that regard, then the knowledge element would also not be satisfied because if possession can be neither proved nor presumed, the Prosecution may not invoke the presumption of knowledge under s 18(2). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 In my view, the Prosecution has managed to establish beyond reasonable doubt all three elements of the single charge against Ramesh. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Whether Ramesh was in possession of the D bundles</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 It is evident from Ramesh’s case that whether Ramesh was in possession of the D bundles is the main issue in contention (see [33] above). I accept the Prosecution’s submission that Ramesh was in possession of the D bundles.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(1) Positive proof of possession</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 While there was no doubt that Ramesh was physically in possession of D1, and accordingly, the D bundles, Ramesh submitted that he did not know that the D bundles were in D1. In my view, the Prosecution is able to positively prove beyond reasonable doubt that Ramesh was in possession of the D bundles because the evidence given by Chander shows that Ramesh knew that the D bundles were in D1. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 At trial, Chander testified that he had specifically told Ramesh how he had kept all nine bundles, which had been neatly packed into three separate plastic bags, in the dashboard compartment at the front of the first lorry. Chander also gave evidence that after they had arrived at the location where the second lorry was parked, Chander had instructed Ramesh to open the dashboard and retrieve the four bundles that were meant for him to deliver, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the D bundles. When Ramesh asked Chander how he should keep the four bundles, Chander further instructed Ramesh to place the D bundles into D1. During examination-in-chief by his counsel, Chander testified as follows:

</div> This supports Chander’s description of how it was Ramesh who had placed the D bundles into D1. The logical inference to draw from this is that Ramesh’s DNA could have accidentally been transferred onto the adhesive sides of the tape wrapping D1A2 when Ramesh was checking to see which of the three plastic bags hidden in the dashboard compartment was the plastic bag containing the D bundles. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 I accept the Prosecution’s submission that Ramesh’s DNA could not have been transferred onto D1A2 due to events occurring <span class="font-italic">after</span> Ramesh’s arrest.

Ramesh offered this explanation only when recording P104, which was a long statement recorded on 24 April 2014, after he had been confronted with the HSA test results (see [19] above). I also found Ramesh’s explanation to be inherently incredible. In this regard, I accepted the evidence of the HSA analyst Tang Sheau Wei June, who testified that if a person had merely touched the outside of a plastic bag, it would theoretically not be possible for his DNA to be found on the adhesive side of the bundles <span class="font-italic">inside</span> that plastic bag.

Chander also explained that Ramesh’s share of the drugs was in Chander’s lorry, and was only subsequently handed over by Chander to Ramesh, because Chander was giving Ramesh a lift from Johor Bahru to his lorry parked in Singapore (see [21] above).

</div> It is evident that P96 contains admissions by Chander that affect both himself and Ramesh and that, if found to be capable of being taken into consideration as against Ramesh, would be gravely detrimental, even fatal, to his defence.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 I reject the Prosecution’s attempt to use P96 against Ramesh pursuant to s 258(5) of the CPC, and find its submissions in this regard to be misconceived in law. Section 258(5) states thus:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(5) When more persons than one are being tried jointly for the same offence, and a confession made by one of such persons affecting himself and some other of such persons is proved, the court may take into consideration the confession as against the other person as well as against the person who makes the confession.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-italic">Explanation</span> — “Offence” as used in this section includes the abetment of or attempt to commit the offence.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-center"><span class="font-italic">Illustrations</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) <span class="font-italic">A </span>and <span class="font-italic">B </span>are jointly tried for the murder of C. It is proved that <span class="font-italic">A </span>said “<span class="font-italic">B </span>and I murdered <span class="font-italic">C</span>”. The court may consider the effect of this confession as against <span class="font-italic">B</span>.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">Leaving aside the analysis of whether P96 fulfils the s 258(7) definition of a “confession” in the first place (which will, in any case, be addressed below at [69]–[73]), the Prosecution cannot rely on s 258(5) to submit that P96 should be taken into consideration against Ramesh. P96 is a cautioned statement recorded in respect of the charge against Chander under s 5(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the MDA for trafficking diamorphine by <span class="font-italic">giving the D bundles</span> <span class="font-italic">to Ramesh</span>. On the other hand, Ramesh faces one charge under s 5(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) read with s 5(2) for <span class="font-italic">being in </span><span class="font-italic">possession of the D bundles for the purpose of trafficking</span>. In my view, although Chander and Ramesh were jointly tried for trafficking the exact same bundles of diamorphine, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the D bundles, they were not being tried jointly “for the same offence”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 This is evident from a plain and literal reading of the language of s 258(5) of the CPC as well as the accompanying Explanation and Illustrations. First, assuming that there are two co-accused persons, I take the view that the Explanation to s 258(5) suggests that s 258(5) should only apply if: (a) both co-accused persons face the exact same charges for identical crimes, or (b) one of the co-accused persons is charged with (i) abetting the other in the commission of the offence with which the other is charged, or (ii) attempting to commit the exact same offence as the other. None of these scenarios presents itself in the present case. Second, Illustration (<span class="font-italic">a</span>) to s 258(5) also shows that Ramesh and Chander cannot be considered to be tried jointly for the same offence. Illustration (<span class="font-italic">a</span>) provides that where <span class="font-italic">A </span>and <span class="font-italic">B </span>are jointly tried for the murder of <span class="font-italic">C</span>, <span class="font-italic">A</span>’s confession that both <span class="font-italic">B </span>and he murdered <span class="font-italic">C</span> can be taken into consideration against <span class="font-italic">B</span>. While <span class="font-italic">A </span>and <span class="font-italic">B </span>are being tried jointly for the <span class="font-italic">same incident</span> in the Illustration (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the murder of <span class="font-italic">C</span>), Ramesh and Chander were tried jointly for <span class="font-italic">different drug trafficking incidents</span>.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 This reading of s 258(5) of the CPC also finds support in existing case law. In <span class="font-italic">Lee Yuan Kwang and others v Public Prosecutor </span>[1995] 1 SLR(R) 778 (“<span class="font-italic">Lee Yuan Kwang</span>”), there were four appellants who were jointly tried for drug trafficking. The two key parties for our purposes are the third appellant, Choo, and the fourth appellant, Yakoob. Choo faced two charges of trafficking, one of which was for trafficking in 166.3g of diamorphine contained in two packets by delivering the two packets to Yakoob. Yakoob faced one charge of trafficking in 166.3g of diamorphine contained in the exact same two packets by virtue of his possession of those two packets for the purpose of trafficking. Those two packets of diamorphine were the very ones which Choo was accused of having delivered to Yakoob. During investigations, the CNB officers had recorded an oral statement from Choo, which contained a confession from Choo that implicated both himself and Yakoob. The trial judge held that the oral statement from Choo could be used as “independent evidence” to sustain the conviction of Yakoob: see <span class="font-italic">Lee Yuan Kwang </span>at [52]. When the matter came on appeal before the Court of Appeal, Yong Pung How CJ (delivering the judgment of the court) disagreed. In interpreting s 30 of the Evidence Act (Cap 97, 1990 Rev Ed), which was <span class="font-italic">in pari materia </span>with the present s 258(5) of the CPC, Yong CJ stated thus (at [53]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… The trial judge’s comments suggested that he did not see a distinction between those cases which interpret s 30 of the Evidence Act and the present case. The crucial distinction is that s 30 of the Evidence Act covers co-accused who are “being tried jointly for the same offence”. We would therefore agree with counsel that <span class="font-italic">the</span><span class="font-italic"> situation at present, as far as Yakoob was concerned, did not fall within the s 30 scenario</span>. While the judge had ruled that all the offences were “committed in the same transaction” as to come within s 176 of the [Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 1985 Rev Ed)], <span class="font-italic">the charges before him (at least in respect of Choo and Yakoob) clearly did not constitute “the same offence”. Rather, Yakoob faced an independent charge which was quite unconnected with the two charges against Choo</span>. …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">As is evident from the foregoing discussion, <span class="font-italic">Lee Yuan Kwang</span> is a decision that features facts that are strikingly similar to those of the present case. Ramesh, like Yakoob in <span class="font-italic">Lee Yuan Kwang</span>, faces “an independent charge which [is] quite unconnected with the … charges against” his co-accused, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, Chander. In other words, they have been tried for distinct and independent offences such that they cannot be considered to be tried jointly “for the same offence”. It is thus clear that s 258(5) of the CPC may not apply in the present context to assist the Prosecution in the manner that they have sought. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 Having said that, even without relying on Chander’s evidence in P96, I am still satisfied that the evidence provided by Chander at trial as well as the other corroborative evidence discussed above, is sufficient for the Prosecution to prove beyond reasonable doubt that Ramesh was in possession of the D bundles.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(2) Presumption of possession under s 18(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the MDA</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 Even if the evidence highlighted by the Prosecution is considered insufficient to positively prove that Ramesh was in possession of the D bundles, I find that the Prosecution is able to invoke the presumption under s 18(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the MDA that Ramesh was in possession of the D bundles. I also find that Ramesh is unable to rebut this presumption on the balance of probabilities. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 The Prosecution is clearly able to rely on the s 18(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) presumption of possession because there is no dispute that Ramesh had possession of D1. Indeed, Ramesh admits in all his statements that Chander passed D1 to him and that D1 was in his possession (see [15]–[17] above).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 The central question then is whether Ramesh is able to rebut the presumption of possession on the balance of probabilities. In my judgment, Ramesh is unable to do so. Although Ramesh claims that he did not check D1’s contents because he honestly believed that D1 merely contained office documents, I am not persuaded that Ramesh did not know that D1 contained the D bundles.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 First, I do not accept Ramesh’s explanation that Chander had told him that D1 contained office documents and had instructed him to help safekeep D1 until they were done with their deliveries at about 1pm for the following two reasons: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Earlier, I have already explained why I considered Chander’s evidence that he had instructed Ramesh to put the D bundles into D1 to be convincing and reliable (see [38]–[44] above). This naturally directly contradicts Ramesh’s account that he was told that D1 contained office documents. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Next, putting aside Chander’s account of the events, I also do not think that Ramesh’s account is supported by the evidence. Ramesh stated both in P98

In determining whether a statement is a confession, the test enunciated in the decision of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in <span class="font-italic">Jayalal </span><span class="font-italic">Anandagoda v The Queen </span>[1962] 1 WLR 817 (“<span class="font-italic">Anandagoda</span>”) is instructive. Lord Guest, delivering the judgment of the court, held as follows (at 823–824):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The test whether a statement is a confession is an objective one, whether to the mind of a reasonable person reading the statement at the time and in the circumstance in which it was made it can be said to amount to a statement that the accused committed the offence or which suggested the inference that he committed the offence. The statement must be looked at as a whole and it must be considered on its own terms without reference to extrinsic facts. … It is not permissible in judging whether the statement is a confession to look at other facts which may not be known at the time or which may emerge in evidence at the trial. But equally it is irrelevant to consider whether the accused intended to make a confession. If the facts in the statement added together suggest the inference that the accused is guilty of the offence then it is nonetheless a confession even although the accused at the same time protests his innocence. … The appropriate test in deciding whether a particular statement is a confession is whether the words of admission in the context expressly or substantially admit guilt or do they taken together in the context inferentially admit guilt?</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">This test has been repeatedly endorsed by the Court of Appeal: see <span class="font-italic">eg</span>, <span class="font-italic">Nguyen Tuong Van v Public Prosecutor</span> [2005] 1 SLR(R) 103 at [21]. It bears emphasis that the Court of Appeal has notably also held that “for a statement to amount to a confession, it need not be of a plenary or unqualified nature; it can also be of a non-plenary nature so long as the statement connected the accused in some way with the offence”: <span class="font-italic">Chai Chien Wei Kelvin v Public Prosecutor </span>[1998] 3 SLR(R) 619 at [48], citing <span class="font-italic">Tong Chee Kong </span><span class="font-italic">and another v Public Prosecutor </span>[1998] 1 SLR(R) 591 at [18].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">71 In my view, Chander’s three cautioned statements all qualify as confessions. Looking at P94, P95 and P96 objectively, I find that they indisputably amount to statements that Chander had committed the offences he has been charged with. This is abundantly clear from the fact that Chander begins each cautioned statement with the same explicit recital: “I admit to the charge” (see [21] above). These unqualified statements amounted to express admissions of guilt without requiring any inference on my part. It is also clear to me that the cautioned statements all unequivocally connected Chander to each of the three offences that he has been charged with. This is because all three cautioned statements were only recorded after the charges were explained and interpreted to Chander, who confirmed that he understood the relevant charges and notices of warning administered.

</div> In any case, even assuming that Chander indeed felt anxious, I do not think that this detracts from my finding that the cautioned statements unequivocally connect Chander to the drug trafficking charges that he is facing. First, if Chander were indeed anxious about the fact that he was being charged with offences that carry the death penalty, it would have been more logical for Chander to <span class="font-italic">deny</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>his guilt, rather than confess to the charges immediately. Moreover, it has been noted above that “it is irrelevant to consider whether the accused <span class="font-italic">intended</span> to make a confession” [emphasis added]: <span class="font-italic">Anandagoda </span>at 823. Hence, insofar as Chander’s explanations in court suggest that he had accidentally admitted to the charges when his cautioned statements were being recorded, they are of no account. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">73 Chander also submits that P96 in particularly should not amount to a confession because PW41 mistranslated his oral statement given in Tamil. According to him, he had used the word “jamma”, which means “thing” in Tamil, and did not use the words “bothai porul”, which mean “drugs” in Tamil.

</div>
</div> I reject this argument and find this to be a mere disingenuous attempt to retract his confession. I accept PW41’s evidence that Chander could not have used the word “jamma” when giving his statement for P96 because if he had done so, PW41 would then have, in accordance with his job as a translator, mentioned it to the CNB officer conducting the interview and then interpreted it.

</div>
</div> it was unlikely that he had made a mistake in translating “jamma”. It was also equally, if not more, unlikely for PW41 to deliberately misinterpret “jamma” as “drugs”, given that there was clearly no reason for him to do so. In the circumstances, I maintain my view that P96 was indeed a confession. Although Chander subsequently denied knowledge of the drugs, it is settled law that an accused person who retracts during his trial a confession he made earlier on can still be convicted on the basis of the confession as long as the court is satisfied that the confession was made voluntarily and that it is true and reliable: <span class="font-italic">Lim Thian Lai v Public Prosecutor </span>[2006] 1 SLR(R) 319 at [43]; <span class="font-italic">Syed Abdul </span><span class="font-italic">Mutalip bin Syed Sidek and another v Public Prosecutor </span>[2002] 1 SLR(R) 1166 at [21]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">74 Since I have established that P94, P95 and P96 are all confessions within the meaning of s 258(7) of the CPC, they are accordingly all admissible unless the statements appear not to have been voluntarily made pursuant to s 258(3) of the CPC. However, I note that Chander did not, at any point in time during the trial, challenge the voluntariness of any of his statements recorded (see [14] above). There was no suggestion that any of Chander’s statements had been obtained by any inducement, threat or promise from any person in authority, or that such inducement, threat or promise, if made, had operated on Chander’s mind.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">75 In the light of my finding that all of Chander’s cautioned statements amount to admissible confessions that should not be excluded for lack of voluntariness, it necessarily follows that there is sufficient basis for me to convict Chander on all three of his drug trafficking charges. Having said that, out of an abundance of caution, I shall proceed to consider whether there is sufficient evidence to make out the individual elements of Chander’s three charges, even without Chander’s confessions in P94, P95 and P96.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-justify font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Whether Chander’s offences may be proved without his confessions in P94, P95 and P96</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">76 In my view, even if Chander’s confessions are disregarded, there is still sufficient evidence for the Prosecution to establish Chander’s guilt for all three charges beyond reasonable doubt.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(1) Acts of trafficking</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">77 Although Chander does not dispute the fact that he had in his possession the AB bundles with the intention to deliver them to another recipient, or that he had given the D bundles to Ramesh and delivered the E bundles to Harun, I will nevertheless briefly address whether the elements of these charges have been made out by the Prosecution. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">78 In respect of the two charges for trafficking under s 5(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the MDA by giving the D bundles to Ramesh and delivering the E bundles to Harun, I find that Chander admitted in his contemporaneous statements and long statements that he gave the D bundles in D1 to Ramesh and delivered the E bundles in E1 to Harun (see [20], [22(d)] and [22(g)] above). It was thus incontrovertible that Chander had committed the acts of trafficking for these two charges.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">79 As for the single charge for being in possession of the AB bundles for the purpose of trafficking under s 5(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) read with s 5(2) of the MDA, I find that Chander had admitted in his contemporaneous statements and long statements that the AB bundles were meant to be delivered to a recipient he was supposed to meet before he got arrested (see [20], [22(b)], [22(g)]–[22(h)] above). It was therefore clear that Chander was in possession of the AB bundles for the purpose of trafficking. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(2) Presumption of knowledge under s 18(2) of the MDA</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">80 Regarding the requirement that Chander must have had knowledge of the nature of the controlled drug that he is being charged for trafficking, the key question is whether Chander is able to rebut the presumption of knowledge of the nature of the drug under s 18(2) of the MDA. The Prosecution is able to invoke this presumption by dint of the fact that Chander has been proven to have had the bundles in his possession (see [28] above). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">81 Chander argues that he did not know that all the bundles contained diamorphine because he believed that the bundles all contained betel nuts and had no reason to suspect otherwise (“betel nut defence”). In my judgment, Chander is unable to rebut the s 18(2) presumption that he knew that all nine bundles contained diamorphine. I briefly set out three reasons for this finding as follows.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">82 First, I do not find the betel nut defence to be a credible account of the events. Chander failed to mention the betel nut defence in his contemporaneous statements recorded shortly after his arrest, as well as in his cautioned statements, which were recorded just after midnight of the day after his arrest. When those statements were being recorded, Chander clearly had ample opportunity to explain what he thought he was transporting on behalf of Roy, but failed to do so. From the fact that Chander only mentioned the betel nut defence for the first time on 29 June 2013 when his first long statement was being recorded, which was some two days after his arrest, I draw the irresistible inference that the betel nut defence is a mere afterthought that should be dismissed. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">83 Second, assuming <span class="font-italic">arguendo</span> that Chander was indeed told by Roy that he was helping to deliver betel nuts, I find that Chander was wilfully blind to the fact that the bundles did not contain betel nuts. Chander claimed to have previously delivered one bundle supposedly containing betel nuts to Harun on behalf of Roy in May 2013. This was not supported by Harun’s evidence, which was that the bundle in May 2013 contained diamorphine, and not betel nuts.

</div> During that delivery, Harun had passed Chander an envelope containing money in exchange. Chander then handed the envelope over to Roy at a coffee shop back in Malaysia. Roy then counted the money in the envelope in front of Chander. In return, Roy paid Chander RM250 for the delivery (see [22(a)] above).

</div> In my view, Chander thus would have become suspicious, from the large sums of money involved in the prior delivery, that he was not in fact delivering betel nuts for Roy. The fact that he refused to act upon his suspicions by inquiring into the contents of the bundles that Roy had passed to him for delivery for the present charges shows that he was wilfully blind to the contents of the bundles. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">84 Third, I find Chander to be a witness unworthy of credit. This was evident from Chander’s evasiveness when answering questions that could potentially imperil his defence. I cite just one example to illustrate this point. At trial, when Chander was being cross-examined by the DPP on the frequency of his interactions with Harun, Chander adamantly insisted that prior to delivering to Harun the E bundles, he had only spoken to Harun once, which was during his first delivery in May 2013.
