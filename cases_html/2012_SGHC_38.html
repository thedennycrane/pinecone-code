<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       The parties divorced after 20 years of marriage,
                    and the matrimonial ancillary matters came before me for determination. These
                    include the division of the matrimonial assets, the issue of custody, care and
                    control for the children of the marriage, and the issue of maintenance.
                    Following the hearing of the ancillary matters over several intermittent days
                    between 11 July 2010 and 27 June 2011, I made the following orders on
                    27 June 2011:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_1-p2_a"></a>(a)     The matrimonial home known as
                        [Property 1] shall be sold in the open market and the net sale proceeds
                            (<em>ie</em>, after deducting payment of
                        outstanding mortgage, CPF withdrawal plus accrued interest and payment of
                        the costs and expenses of sale including legal costs) be divided between the
                        plaintiff, AYB, (“the Wife”) and the defendant, AYC,
                        (“the Husband”)( “the parties”) as
                        follows:-</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_1-p2_a-p3_a"></a>(a)       60% to the Husband;
                            and</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_1-p2_a-p3_b"></a>(b)       40%
                            to the Wife.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_1-p2_b"></a>(b)     [Property 1] shall be sold within 6 months from the date
                        hereof, with Husband and Wife to have joint conduct of the sale of [Property
                        1] at a price of $1,500,000 or higher.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_1-p2_c"></a>(c)     As for the property known as [Property 2] (in which the
                        parties jointly own together with the Husband’s brother, [K], and the
                        Wife’s sister, [P]), if [K] and [P] wish to sell [Property 2], the
                        parties shall likewise agree in principle to a sale.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_1-p2_d"></a>(d)     In the event [Property 2] is sold, upon
                        receipt of 24.35% share of the net sale proceeds (“the parties’
                        sale proceeds of [Property 2]”):-</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_1-p2_d-p3_a"></a>(a)       The Wife is to receive
                            $34,000 being her CPF contribution toward the purchase;
                        and</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_1-p2_d-p3_b"></a>(b)       Of the
                            remaining balance, 25% to the Wife and 75% to the
                    Husband.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_1-p2_e"></a>(e)     If
                        either party refuses to execute the transfer documents, the Registrar of the
                        Supreme Court is empowered to execute the said documents on his or her
                        behalf as the case may be.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_1-p2_f"></a>(f)     The Husband is to transfer to the Wife an amount
                        equivalent to 25% of the value of the Husband’s RSAF Savers Account
                        (“Savers Account”) such that the Wife’s share of the
                        Savers Account is $195,000 (based on a value of
                    $781,000).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_1-p2_g"></a>(g)     The Wife
                        is to have a 25% share of the moneys refunded into the Husband’s CPF
                        Ordinary Account following the sale of [Property 1]; and that the CPF Board
                        shall transfer a sum equivalent to 25% of the said moneys into the
                        Wife’s CPF Ordinary Account within 14 days after the date of
                        completion of the sale of the [Property 1].</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_1-p2_h"></a>(h)     Any other assets in the sole name of the parties
                        are to be retained by him or her as the case may be.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_1-p2_i"></a>(i)     The Husband is to pay monthly
                        maintenance in the total sum of $3,800, of which $1,800 is for the Wife and
                        $2,000 for their two children.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       By consent, the parties are to have joint
                    custody of their two children with care and control to the Wife. Since the
                    Husband was going to be stationed in the United States for four months from
                    1 July 2011, he was granted liberal access to his children by email or
                    telephone contact for that period. Upon his return to Singapore, the following
                    permanent access arrangement is to apply:</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       I made no order in respect of the Wife’s
                    joint accounts with her mother. However, I disallowed the Wife’s claim for
                    car rental against the Husband.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       As for costs for the ancillaries, each side was
                    ordered to bear his or her respective costs. The Husband was allowed to set off
                    the previous costs orders made against the Wife from moneys ordered to be paid
                    to the Wife.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       The Wife has appealed against my
                    decision.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The parties</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       The parties were married on 1 August 1988
                    at the Singapore Marriage Registry. The children to the marriage, [G] and [J],
                    are currently 17 and 11 years old respectively.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       The Wife is a 45 year old housewife who, at the
                    time of the hearing of the ancillaries, lives with the children of the marriage
                    at [Property 1]. The Wife has not worked since 1992. She has not had an earned
                    income since 1992.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       The Husband is 48 year old. Prior to May 2011,
                    he was a RSAF pilot who held a command appointment. Initially, the
                    Husband’s intention was to join the RSAF-SilkAir Pilot Scheme which was
                    established as a second career transition for RSAF senior pilots from age
                    43½ to 50 years.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> The Husband applied for and was
                    granted release from regular service with effect from May 2011. However, the
                    Husband, for health concerns, had to give up his plan to be a commercial pilot.
                    In June 2011, he found employment as a Flight Simulator Instructor and was to be
                    stationed at the RSAF’s Flight Simulator Centre.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span> This appointment required him to undergo four
                    months of training in America.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       In December 2007, the Wife filed a Writ for
                    Divorce against the Husband. On 12 June 2009, Interim Judgment was
                    granted.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     I should mention that the Wife had wanted the
                    Husband to vacate the matrimonial home as early as August 2007<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span>. After the Wife filed
                    for divorce in December 2007, she continued to press the Husband to move out. On
                    10 June 2008, the Wife gave the Husband one-month notice to move out in
                        writing.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span> The
                    Husband refused. As he saw it, he owned the property and was paying the mortgage
                    and outgoings. Besides, he could not afford the additional expense of setting up
                    home elsewhere.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_5" id="Ftn_5_1"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span> In July 2008, the Wife
                    unceremoniously dumped the Husband’s personal belongings outside the front
                    door before locking the Husband out of [Property 1]. Ever since then the Husband
                    has had to live in rented accommodation.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_6" id="Ftn_6_1"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span> If I were to take the
                    time the Husband said the Wife stopped washing his clothes and cooked his meals
                    in March 2008 and the time she locked him out of the matrimonial home in July
                    2008, which I was inclined to do although the Interim Judgment was granted in
                    2010, the marriage lasted for 20 years. Even if the marriage was said to have
                    lasted till the Interim Judgment, that additional two years would not have made
                    a material difference for present purposes.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Hearing of Ancillaries</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     The ancillary matters to be resolved between
                    the parties were:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_11-p2_a"></a>(a)     Division of matrimonial
                        assets;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_11-p2_b"></a>(b)     Maintenance for the Wife and children; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_11-p2_c"></a>(c)     Care and control of the
                children.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     An issue in dispute was whether the lump sum
                    benefit under the RSAF SAVER plan for in-service officers is a matrimonial asset
                    within the meaning of s 112(10) of the Women’s Charter
                    (Cap 153, Rev Ed 2009). The acronym “SAVER” stands for
                    Savings and Employee Retirement plan, and the participating officer received a
                    lump sum retirement payment after a full career with RSAF. It was, however, not
                    a legal objection that could be taken very far. I agreed with the Wife’s
                    position that the Savers Account was a matrimonial asset. Furthermore, the issue
                    of care and control was strenuously contested. However, after March 2011, there
                    was a shift in the Husband’s position, and this is explained
                below.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     At the ancillaries, the Wife was represented
                    by Mr Ahmad Nizam Abbas (“Mr Nizam”). The Husband was
                    initially represented by Mr Rajan Chettiar
                    (“Mr Chettiar”). At the adjourned hearing of 30 August
                    2010, Mr Nizam informed the court that the Wife had revised her earlier
                    position. It is a convenient juncture to set out the Wife’s revised
                    proposal:</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     At the next substantial hearing on
                    20 January 2011, the Husband was without legal representation. He appeared
                    as a litigant in person. The Husband explained that he could no longer afford
                    legal representation because he had spent a fair amount of money to defend the
                    Personal Protection Order (“PPO”) proceedings initiated by the
                    Wife who accused him of violence and mental anguish. He was terribly upset with
                    the wasted time and costs spent on what he saw as a trumped up and frivolous
                    application based on a “script”, to borrow the Husband’s
                    words, portraying him as a “monster” and the Wife as the
                    “victim”. It was a farce because it had all to do with his refusal
                    to move out of [Property 1]. In particular, after the Wife locked him out, she
                    applied for a PPO the same day and obtained an Expedited Order to keep him out
                    of his own property.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_7" id="Ftn_7_1"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span> Even though he won, the distress
                    engendered by the contested proceedings was painful and emotionally draining. He
                    was upset when he recounted the time when the Wife attempted to jeopardise his
                    career by questioning the state of his health and pointing out, at the same
                    time, the hazard and risk of allowing the Husband to fly a fighter plane or a
                    commercial plane. It was a bizarre attack seeing that the Husband’s
                    ability to pay maintenance was dependent on his job. Needless to say, the
                    divorce and PPO proceedings would also have affected the emotional well-being of
                    the Wife and children. It would have been a difficult, painful and stressful
                    time for them.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     At the conclusion of arguments on the division
                    of matrimonial assets on 28 March 2011, the parties were still unable to
                    amicably resolve the issue of the care and control of the two children. It was
                    plain to me that the parties continue to be very upset by the events surrounding
                    the PPO and the divorce, and that they both love their children dearly. Each
                    parent wanted care and control of the children. I directed that a Custody
                    Evaluation Report be submitted. Interviews were conducted on 20 April 2011
                    and 18 May 2011. The custody evaluation was subsequently aborted as the
                    parties reached an amicable agreement that gave to the Wife care and control of
                    the children. The Husband duly informed the court of his decision to give up his
                    fight for care and control in a letter dated 20 May 2011. He also requested
                    an early hearing date for the resolution of the ancillaries before his departure
                    from Singapore for training as a Flight Simulator Instructor. As stated, the
                    orders set out in <a href="#p1_1">[1]</a>-<a href="#p1_4">[4]</a> above were made on 27 June 2011.</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     Initially, the Husband denied that the Wife
                    had contributed to the purchase by way of her CPF contributions. The Wife did
                    not provide documentary proof whereas the Husband had shown that $111,964
                    (almost the entire purchase price of [Property 3]) and monthly contributions of
                    $929 were withdrawn from his CPF account.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_8" id="Ftn_8_1"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span> In relation to the
                    allegation that $40,000 to renovate [Property 3] in the form of an interest-free
                    loan came from the Wife’s mother, Mr Chettiar for the Husband
                    explained that the loan amount was $30,000, and not $40,000. Furthermore, the
                    Husband had repaid the loan to his mother-in-law.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_9" id="Ftn_9_1"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span> I noted that it was not the
                    Wife’s case that the loan was not repaid (see <a href="#p1_20">[20]</a> below).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     At subsequent hearings attended by the Husband
                    as a litigant in person, the Husband clarified and explained the efforts he had
                    made to ascertain the total amount of the Wife’s CPF contributions. Even
                    though he tried, he was unable to obtain information of the Wife’s CPF
                    contributions. However, he was prepared to accept that the Wife had contributed
                    financially towards this purchase and agreed to accept the HDB’s letter in
                    1996 which referred to the sum of $43,670.03 as the Wife’s CPF
                    contributions (which is slightly higher than the Wife’s figure in the
                    table above).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     At this juncture, I should mention that
                    whenever the Wife made references to loans from her mother, it was never her
                    case that the loans were unpaid and they remained outstanding. The loans were
                    mentioned in an attempt by the Wife to claim some credit attributable to her as
                    “contribution” to the acquisition of the property in question. I
                    did not regard this as relevant to these proceedings.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     In 1992, the Wife quit her job as a
                    Communications Officer at the Ministry of Defence and pursued various courses in
                    beauty therapy and cosmetology, and on completion of the various courses, the
                    Wife was awarded six diplomas. The Husband said he paid for the courses. This
                    was not disputed by the Wife.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     In March 1993, the Husband was posted to
                    Arizona for RSAF training. The Husband initially went alone while the Wife
                    completed her diploma course. The Wife joined the Husband in Arizona in May
                    1993.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     The parties purchased a home in Arizona for
                    $116,000 (“[Property 4]”). The Wife claimed that she contributed
                    $65,000 to the purchase of the home in the form of an interest-free loan from
                    her mother. She admitted that this loan was repaid.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_10" id="Ftn_10_1"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     The Wife did not work while in Arizona. She
                    gave birth to [G] on 24 May 1994 in Arizona. In 1995, the parties returned
                    to Singapore. [Property 4] was sold in May 1999.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_11" id="Ftn_11_1"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     Upon their return to Singapore, the parties
                    sold [Property 3] for $483,000. The completion of the sale was in January 1996
                    which was <em>after</em> [Property 1] was purchased in 1995
                    at a price of $1,080,000 with both registered as joint tenants. The significance
                    of this fact is that the sale proceeds of [Property 3] were not used to fund the
                    purchase of [Property 1]. Rather the money went towards the purchase and
                    renovation of [Property 2] which I will come to later.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     Returning to the matrimonial home which is
                    [Property 1], the Husband claimed that the Wife made no financial contributions
                    towards its acquisition. Mr Nizam for the Wife accepted this in
                    submissions. The Husband paid the 10% initial deposit of $108,000 and the legal
                    completion fee of $42,604.18 in cash, as well as $50,000 worth of
                        renovations.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_12" id="Ftn_12_1"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span> It is undisputed that
                    throughout the marriage, the Husband paid for the mortgage and all the outgoings
                    in relation to the matrimonial home. The Wife contended that her mother again
                    gave them a loan of $50,000. The Husband accepted that there was a loan but
                    maintained that it was for a sum of $40,000 and not $50,000, and that he had
                    repaid his mother-in-law’s loan.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     [Property 2] was purchased at $1,230,000 in
                    1996. It is a freehold one-storey semi-detached house registered in four names,

<p class="Judg-1">The Wife alleged that she obtained an interest-free loan of $61,000

                    The Wife also alleged that the net profits of [Property 3] were used to buy
                    [Property 2]. The Husband explained that $200,316.19 of the net sale proceeds of
                    [Property 3] was spent on [Property 2] as follows: cash contributions of
                    $90,316.19 for the initial deposit and $110,000 for renovations. The balance sum
                    of $119,891.62 went towards defraying the family expenses in Australia for four

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     It was not disputed that CPF moneys were
                    refunded to the parties’ respective CPF Accounts following the sale of
                    [Property 3] such that for [Property 2] the Wife’s direct contribution
                    from her CPF Account was the sum of $34,000 and the Husband’s the sum of

                    in [Property 2] from 1996 until 2004. The Husband’s evidence is that the
                    mortgage repayments, property tax, renovation and insurance were “jointly
                    serviced” by him and his brother, [K].<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_18" id="Ftn_18_1"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a></span> However, after the
                    parties moved out of [Property 2] to live in [Property 1], the Husband requested
                    [K] to pay the former’s portion of the mortgage repayment of about $2,000
                    from 2004 to 2008 as he could not afford to do so. From 2009 onwards, [K] had
                    difficulties paying the Husband’s share of the mortgage repayments, and
                    the Husband resumed paying his share of the mortgage repayments.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_19" id="Ftn_19_1"><sup>[note: 19]</sup></a></span> [K]’s CPF statement showed that as
                    at 27 September 2010, the total amount of CPF moneys utilised to
                    finance the purchase together with accrued interest was $572,759.72, and the
                    monthly deduction from CPF was $3,000.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_20" id="Ftn_20_1"><sup>[note: 20]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     From 1996 to 2004, [Property 1] was rented
                    out. The Wife alleged that the rentals went towards servicing the mortgage loan
                    of [Property 2].<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_21" id="Ftn_21_1"><sup>[note: 21]</sup></a></span> This was refuted by the Husband who
                    explained that it was particularly hard on him as the sole breadwinner to
                    finance the purchase of two private properties ([Property 1] and [Property 2])
                    in 1995-1996, and the financial burden was later exacerbated by the downturn in
                    the property market in 1997. He had mis-predicted the property market by
                    assuming that rental returns would continue to hold. According to the Husband,
                    [Property 1] was rented out for four years. For the first two years, the monthly
                    rental was $4,500, but for the next two years, the monthly rental was
                        $2000.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_22" id="Ftn_22_1"><sup>[note: 22]</sup></a></span> The rentals were used to cover
                    living expenses of the family since his salary was used to pay the mortgage
                    repayments. This explanation is plausible since a huge slice of the
                    Husband’s monthly salary was consumed by mortgage repayments of [Property
                    1] and [Property 2]. The total monthly mortgage cash repayments were $5,748 for
                    both properties. The Husband exhibited a copy of the Credit POSB mortgage
                    statement to show that a sum of $3,648 (for [Property 1]) and $2,000 ([Property
                    2]) were disbursed from his then salary of about $7,000.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_23" id="Ftn_23_1"><sup>[note: 23]</sup></a></span> Even when
                    his salary increased, for example, in 2000, the Husband’s evidence is that
                    on their return from Australia, his net salary was $11,458 after tax but the
                    monthly expenses such as mortgages, insurance, household and family’s
                    expenses was around $10,000 to $11,000 leaving little savings to “handle
                    exigencies” and the Husband’s grave concern was that they were
                    “living at the edge”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_24" id="Ftn_24_1"><sup>[note: 24]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     The Husband rejected as outrageous the
                    Wife’s baseless claim that he stood to make $831,744 from the sale of
                    [Property 2]. The Husband explained that if the property were to be sold at
                    $1,600,000, the Wife and her sister would recover their CPF contributions but
                    the Husband and his brother would suffer hefty losses given their larger
                    contributions.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     The Wife provided no evidence to contradict
                    the Husband’s position that it had been agreed amongst the four of them
                    that each person’s share in [Property 2] would be based on the amount of
                    contribution made by each person. So if [Property 2] is sold, the CPF principal
                    plus accrued interest would be reimbursed to the respective parties concerned
                    and the net profits would be shared in the ratio of the amount of contribution
                    made by the parties.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_25" id="Ftn_25_1"><sup>[note: 25]</sup></a></span> Thus far, [K] had contributed
                    75% of the mortgage repayments<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_26" id="Ftn_26_1"><sup>[note: 26]</sup></a></span> and the Husband
                    25%. The Husband’s estimated the contributions in percentage terms (albeit
                    not exactly 100%) as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_31-p2_a"></a>(a)     [K]: 68%;</p>

<p class="Judg-Heading-2">(b)   Shares</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     The Wife alleged that the Husband had not
                    disclosed his shares portfolio. The Husband rejected the Wife’s
                    allegation, and I accepted his overall explanation as credible.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     It appeared that the Wife’s list of
                    shares were unreliable. As the Wife accepted, the list included the names of
                    stock brokers such as Interactive Brokers, a firm of stock brokers in New York,
                    and Commonwealth Securities, a stock broking firm in Australia. In addition,
                    Computershare Investor Services Pte Ltd is a share registry firm. Lastly, on the
                    Wife’s list is Wisely 98 Ltd, the management company of [Property

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     In respect of Australian shares on the
                    Wife’s list, the Wife’s supplementary submissions stated that the
                    profits from the sale of [Property 4] were used to buy shares in Australian
                    companies. The Husband refuted the Wife’s claim stating in clear terms
                    that the sale proceeds were not used to buy shares in Australian
                        companies.<b><span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_28" id="Ftn_28_1"><sup>[note: 28]</sup></a></span></b> The
                    parties had decided to have a second child, and [Property 4] was sold to meet
                    the extra expenses of the second child (born on 5 October 2000) and the
                    family. [Property 4] was purchased with his funds and loan from his
                    mother-in-law. As the Wife had admitted, the loan had been repaid.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     As for Australian shares, the Husband said he
                    used his savings to buy some shares but they were eventually sold at a loss
                    because of the internet bubble burst. Moreover in 2008, some Australian shares
                    were liquidated for a family holiday in Australia.<b><span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_29" id="Ftn_29_1"><sup>[note: 29]</sup></a></span></b>
                    Before the adjourned hearing on 28 March 2011, the Husband said he made
                    calls overseas to check up on the Wife’s claims that there were
                    undisclosed shares in Australian companies. He confirmed that the position was
                    the same as that shown in the portfolio account statement provided to his
                    previous solicitor, Mr Chettiar, which showed nil shares in the portfolio
                    account with Commonwealth Securities Ltd.<b><span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_30" id="Ftn_30_1"><sup>[note: 30]</sup></a></span></b></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     The Husband’s investment in Sunshine
                    Empire Investment is worthless. The only shares that the Husband now holds are
                    190 SingTel shares. The Wife holds 1,360 SingTel shares. A fair solution was to
                    allow each to retain the shares in his or her name.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">(c)   Insurance policies</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     The Husband explained that most of the
                    insurance policies were term policies and as such they have no surrender
                        values.<b><span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_31" id="Ftn_31_1"><sup>[note: 31]</sup></a></span></b> The
                    hospitalisation policies were for the Wife and the children but they were not
                    transferable. There is a small education policy for [G] which I have excluded
                    from the pool of matrimonial assets. The Husband has a Prudential whole life
                    policy with a sum insured of $80,000. There is no evidence of its surrender
                    value. The Wife has two policies in her name (Prudential Prulink SuperGrowth
                    Policy Nos [xxx] and [xxx])<b><span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_32" id="Ftn_32_1"><sup>[note: 32]</sup></a></span></b>. She bought them
                    using her CPF moneys. No surrender values were provided. In any case, the sum
                    insured was relatively small. In the circumstances, to avoid further delay, a
                    pragmatic and fair solution was to allow the parties to retain the policies in
                    his or her name.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">(d)   Bank Accounts</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     The Wife declared that she has three bank
                    accounts in her sole name.<b><span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_33" id="Ftn_33_1"><sup>[note: 33]</sup></a></span></b>
                    There are two bank accounts in the Husband’s name and one in the joint
                    names of the Husband and Wife. The amounts in the bank accounts were
                    insignificant to make any meaningful division. The Wife has bank accounts in the
                    joint names of herself and her mother. The Husband was not able to refute the

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     The Husband’s motor cycle had a damaged
                    engine which was too costly to repair, and the plan was to deregister the motor

                    2008. However, he paid about $1,280.82 in order to fully redeem the car loan of
                    $52,280.82 from Citibank. In short, it was a negative asset. A pragmatic and
                    fair solution was to disregard and exclude the motor cycle and

                    court finds just and equitable. Section 112(1) states:</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     Having regard to the relevant factors listed
                    in s 112(2) of the Women’s Charter, I divided [Property 1] in the
                    proportion of 40% for the Wife and 60% for the Husband. In respect of the other
                    assets listed under (b) to (d) in <a href="#p1_40">[40]</a> above, I applied a different division, namely 25% for the
                    Wife, and 75% for the Husband. A different percentage was used for the other
                    assets for the following reasons:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_44-p2_a"></a>(a)     [Property 2] was an investment
                        property owned by the parties and two others. It was not disputed that the
                        arrangement amongst the four investors was that the investor’s stake
                        in the investment property was dependent on the amount his or her actual
                        financial contributions.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_44-p2_b"></a>(b)     The Savers Account was a retirement fund for in-service
                        staff. The RSAF is responsible for the management and investment of the
                        retirement fund. The benefits derived from the retirement fund are payable
                        to in-service staff after release from regular service.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     In respect of [Property 1], I adopted the
                    approach of a percentage division on a realisation resulting in profit. The
                    calculation of the proportion of division was based on a snap shot valuation of
                    $1,500,000 as of October 2010. The Husband had provided a valuation report dated
                    19 October 2010 and this valuation was not disputed by the Wife. Once the
                    liabilities and expenses such as outstanding mortgage of $530,000, CPF moneys
                    withdrawn and accrued interest of $585,000, agency commission and legal fee of
                    $20,000 (estimated) were deducted from the sum of $1,500,000, the net sale
                    proceeds available for division was $365,000.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     I did not adopt the approach where the Husband
                    would have to refund the CPF with moneys from his share of the sale proceeds
                    because such an approach would leave the Husband with insufficient money to
                    repay in full the CPF. To illustrate:</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     In this illustration, the Husband would have
                    to find $15,000 to top up his share of the sale proceeds in order to refund to
                    the sum of $585,000 to the CPF. It is to be noted that I had also given the Wife
                    25% of $585,000. After refund to CPF, the Husband would have $439,000 in his CPF
                    Ordinary Account but with no disposable sale proceeds in hand in respect of a
                    property which he had shouldered the full financial burden. In this connection,
                    I did not consider the Wife’s proposal (see <a href="#p1_13">[13]</a> above) to be fair. In submissions, Mr Nizam explained
                    the reason why the Wife wanted the Husband to transfer his title in [Property 1]
                    without refund of CPF moneys to the Husband’s CPF Ordinary Account. As
                    at 3 September 2009, the Husband had only $93.84 in his CPF Ordinary
                    Account, and that in the normal course the Wife would be entitled to a direct
                    share of his CPF moneys, but she was deprived of this benefit because the
                    Husband had used too much money from the CPF Ordinary Account.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_36" id="Ftn_36_1"><sup>[note: 36]</sup></a></span> Her argument is remarkably skewed and
                    has turned logic on its head. The Husband exhibited his CPF statement dated
                    10 October 2010 which showed that as at that date, his Ordinary Account is
                        nil.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_37" id="Ftn_37_1"><sup>[note: 37]</sup></a></span>
                    There was no element of sharing in the Wife’s proposal which showed that
                    she wanted to take all of $585,000 withdrawn from the CPF. The outcome of her
                    proposal would leave the Husband with (a) nil balance in his CPF Ordinary
                    Account, and (b) zero monetary return from [Property 1]. To leave the
                    Husband in this position after all that he has done for the family would not, in
                    my judgment, be fair (see <a href="#p1_57">[57]</a> below).
                    This outcome has also to be viewed together with the situation concerning
                    [Property 2].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     I now come to [Property 2]. The Wife tendered
                    an updated valuation report dated 24 March 2011 which valued [Property 2]
                    at $2,000,000. Assuming [K] and [P] were willing, and [Property 2] was sold at
                    that snap shot valuation as of 24 March 2011, the Husband said [K]’s
                    quick calculations indicated that he would still be out of pocket by $100,000 to
                    $150,000. This will affect [K]’s decision to sell the property at
                    $2,000,000. However, for present purposes, assuming the property is sold at
                    $2,000,000, the Husband calculated that after deducting the outstanding loan of
                    $520,000 and expenses relating to the sale and legal fees, the estimated net
                    sale proceeds is $1,440,000 to be shared as follows:</p>

                    sale proceeds of [Property 2], <em>ie</em> $350,000, the
                    Wife would receive the principal withdrawn from CPF namely $34,000 plus an
                    addition a sum of $79,000 being 25% share of the balance sum of $350,000.
                    Coincidentally, this sum of $113,000 is more than enough to cover her CPF
                    withdrawal of $34,000 plus accrued interest and her share of [Property 3] sale
                    proceeds. For ease of reference, the Husband had ascribed as her direct
                    financial contributions to [Property 2] the figure of $97,079.05 ($47,000 +
                        $50,079.05).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_38" id="Ftn_38_1"><sup>[note: 38]</sup></a></span> With this approach, the Wife gets the first bite
                    to take back her direct financial contributions together with some gains.
                    However, it leaves the Husband vulnerable to shortfalls. For example, unlike the
                    Wife, he does not get back in full his share of [Property 3] proceeds of sale
                        <em>ie</em>, $156,246.62 (see <a href="#p1_27">[27]</a> above). However, the money is enough to
                    refund to CPF the principal with interest in the sum of $170,252.92.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_39" id="Ftn_39_1"><sup>[note: 39]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     In summary, based on the notional sale prices,
                    the Wife’s share of the total matrimonial assets would be $600,000. With
                    this money, the Wife should be able to purchase a HBD flat.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     It was not disputed that the Husband was the
                    sole breadwinner and applied his income on family expenditure. Furthermore, it
                    was the Husband, and not the Wife, who was involved in financial matters
                    relating to the marriage. The Wife was the primary caregiver of the children and
                    had taken care of the home, husband and family wherever they resided. The
                    Husband did not dispute the Wife’s non financial contributions both as a
                    wife and mother.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     As the sole breadwinner, the Husband paid for
                    all the family’s expenses and outgoings in relation to [Property 1] which
                    was the matrimonial home. The Wife made no direct or indirect financial
                    contributions towards the purchase of [Property 1].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     Her direct financial contributions in the sum
                    of $43,670.03 were in the acquisition of [Property 3] (see <a href="#p1_19">[19]</a> above). [Property 2] was an investment with
                    two others and in that investment the Wife’s CPF contribution was $34,000.
                    Part of the net sale proceeds of [Property 3] was used to buy [Property 2]. I
                    have referred to the total amount of the Wife contributions in <a href="#p1_27">[27]</a> above taking into consideration her share of
                    [Property 3].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     In contrast, the Husband had contributed in
                    excess of $500,000 in the form of CPF moneys and cash toward the acquisition of
                    [Property 2] and [Property 3] (see <a href="#p1_27">[27]</a>, <a href="#p1_28">[28]</a> and <a href="#p1_48">[48]</a> above).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     That said, direct and indirect, financial and
                    non-financial contributions are all to be given equal weight and no single
                    factor should be determinative of the outcome. This is clear in the statutory
                    wording of Section 112 of the Women’s Charter which places no greater
                    weight to any single type of contribution. In <em>Lim Choon Lai v
                        Chew Kim Heng</em> [2001] 2 SLR(R) 260 (“<em>Lim Choon Lai</em>”) at [14(b)], the Court of Appeal
                    approved the dicta of Judith Prakash J in <em>Yow Mee
                        </em><em>Lan v Chen Kai Buan</em> [2000]
                    2 SLR(R) 659 (“<em>Yow Mee </em><em>Lan</em>”) and held that non-financial contributions
                    can be just as important as financial contributions, depending on the
                    circumstances of the case. In <em>NK v NL</em> [2010]
                    4 SLR 792 (“<em>NK v NL</em>”), the
                    Court of Appeal approved of both <em>Lim Choon Lai</em> and
                        <em>Yow Mee </em><em>Lan</em>, and
                    went a step further by acknowledging that financial contributions are just one
                    of the many factors to be taken into account, thus placing all the relevant
                    factors, financial and non-financial, on equal footing. In addition, at
                        [34] of <em>NK v
                        NL</em>, the Court held that any difficulty encountered in defining or
                    measuring non-financial contributions should not be an obstacle to a just and
                    equitable division of the assets.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     Before I discuss the Wife’s indirect
                    contributions, there is one important feature of this case which is in the
                    Husband’s favour as his indirect contributions which must not be
                    overlooked in the division of the matrimonial assets. I accepted the
                    Husband’s unchallenged evidence in respect of the financial burden he
                    faced from acquiring two private properties given his primary source and limited
                    income. Against uncertainties and risks, he weathered the bad economic climate
                    of the 1990’s. He struggled to finance two properties through the bad
                    years and, at the same time, kept afloat the family by providing for the Wife
                    and children. During that period, the Wife according to the Husband had not
                    appreciated and accepted the financial situation and was uncooperative when it
                    came to tightening unnecessary expenses.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_40" id="Ftn_40_1"><sup>[note: 40]</sup></a></span> It was because
                    of the Husband’s fortitude and sterling fund management that now more than
                    ten years on the parties still have the very same two properties available for
                    division. Therefore, it is only right that I take into account the
                    Husband’s indirect contributions in weathering the financial storm no
                    matter how much pressure it put him under, and no matter how limited liquidity
                    he had.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a>58     Over the course of this 20-year marriage, the
                    Wife’s indirect contributions were in her roles as wife and mother. In
                    1993, she followed the Husband to Arizona where he was undergoing RSAF training.
                    I was satisfied with the Husband’s explanation<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_41" id="Ftn_41_1"><sup>[note: 41]</sup></a></span> which was
                    reasonable and discounted the Wife’s claim that she sacrificed a business
                    opportunity in the form of a business plan dealing with beauty products for the
                    sake of the Husband. In August 1994, the Wife gave birth to [G]. During the
                    Husband’s training stint in Arizona, the Wife had to take care of their
                    son, housekeep and cook for the family.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a>59     I also did not think there was anything in the
                    Wife’s claim that she gave up a chance to study in Australia on account of
                    the family. In August 1996, the Husband received an RSAF scholarship to study in
                    Australia and the family went along. In April 1997, the Wife applied for a
                    degree course in interior architectural course at University of New South Wales
                    (“UNSW”). The Wife received a conditional offer which required
                    completion of a foundation year after undergoing a course in English, and to
                    pass an English proficiency test which she did. I accepted the Husband’s
                    explanation as to why the Wife did not pursue the course. Counting the
                    foundation year plus the degree course of four years, the Wife would only be
                    able to complete her studies by end 2002. It was not feasible to embark on a
                    course of studies with a much later completion date than the Husband’s
                    because by end 2000, he and the family had to return to Singapore. Besides, the
                    family’s finances would not have allowed her to stay behind.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_42" id="Ftn_42_1"><sup>[note: 42]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a>60     I accepted the Wife’s evidence that she
                    did her fair share of ferrying the children to and from school, enrichment
                    classes and tuition. When it came to the children’s education, I accepted
                    that Husband’s evidence that as between him and the Wife, it was he (with
                    his tertiary degree) rather than the Wife (with her GCE O-Level Certificate) who
                    guided the children’s education and assisted [J] when it came to his
                    studies. This version is consistent with the Husband’s repeated request
                    during the ancillaries for the Wife to give him access to the children, in
                    particular, in order to tutor and prepare [J] for Gifted Education Programme
                        exams.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_43" id="Ftn_43_1"><sup>[note: 43]</sup></a></span> Finally,
                    the access which the party had worked out and which formed part of my order gave
                    the Husband weekday access on Wednesday or Thursday from 5pm to10pm to coach [J]
                    in his studies.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a>61     As with so much else in the division of
                    matrimonial assets, there can be no hard and fast rule so long as the court has
                    properly balanced the factors in s 112 of the Woman Charter that are
                    relevant to the circumstances of the case. Ultimately, the process of division
                    of matrimonial assets is not an exact science. As <em>ZO v
                        ZP</em> and another appeal [2011] SGCA 25 makes clear, at
                        [23]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Ultimately, the court is directed to take a “broad-brush”
                        approach to the process of division of matrimonial assets by resisting the
                        “temptation to lapse into a minute scrutiny of the conduct and
                        efforts of both spouses, which may be objectionable in disadvantaging the
                        spouse whose efforts are difficult to evaluate in financial
                        terms”</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_62"></a>62     At the end of a 20 year marriage to which both
                    had made reasonable contributions in their own respective ways, one exit with
                    about 70% and the other with about 30% of the overall matrimonial assets that
                    comprised their matrimonial home, a collective share in an investment property,
                    the Husband’s CPF refund with accrued interest, and Savers Account. While
                    the division left the Husband with significantly more cash, this apparent
                    disparity is not, in my judgment, unjust and inequitable as there were good
                    reasons for doing so given the overall circumstances of the case as explained
                    earlier (see <em>eg</em>, <a href="#p1_57">[57]</a> above) and here:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_62-p2_a"></a>(a)     The Husband has housing needs such
                        as separate accommodation for himself and the children during the periods
                        they are with him including a proper place to tutor [J] once a week (see
                            s 112(2)(<em>c</em>) read with
                            s112(2)(<em>h</em>) and s 114(1)(<em>b</em>));</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_62-p2_b"></a>(b)     The welfare of the children would be promoted by the
                        Husband having a home (see section 112(2)(<em>c</em>));</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_62-p2_c"></a>(c)     The financial responsibility for the children’s tertiary
                        education was acknowledged by the Husband to be his alone to bear (see
                            s 112(2)(<em>c</em>) read with
                            s 112(2)(<em>h</em>) and s 114 of
                        subsections (1)(<em>b</em>) and (<em>f</em>)); and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_62-p2_d"></a>(d)     The realities are that with a reduced income and earning
                        capacity (non-flying career) in the future, the Husband would have to make
                        provision from his share of the matrimonial assets for the children’s
                        tertiary education (see s112(2)(<em>h</em>) read with
                        s 114(1)); and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_62-p2_e"></a>(e)     The division also took account s 112(2)(<em>f</em>) whereby the Wife excluded the Husband from the
                        matrimonial home since July 2008, and had lived there rent-free with the
                        children for over three years. The Husband complained that even after the
                        PPO and Domestic Exclusion order were set aside, the Husband’s request
                        to be allowed access into the matrimonial home was refused by the
                            Wife.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_44" id="Ftn_44_1"><sup>[note: 44]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_63"></a>63     I should elaborate on my earlier point on the
                    Husband’s housing needs and the consideration of a home where the children
                    can enjoy their contact time with him. In some cases, there is not enough to
                    provide a home for either or that there is only enough to provide for one.
                    Ordinarily, preference will be given to the party who has care and control of
                    the children. However, in the present case, the division here would enable both
                    to acquire public housing for themselves. A division which achieves such an
                    outcome is, in my view, just and equitable.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_64"></a>64     As for the future education of the children,
                    it was not disputed that the children are clever and have promising academic
                    potential. He repeatedly said that he wanted to ensure that he had enough money
                    to take care of the children’s future education, and had fought for the
                    Savers Account to be left intact, and not to be subject to division. I was
                    satisfied with the Husband’s wholehearted commitment to finance in the
                    future the children’s tertiary education. As such there was no need to
                    make an order that the Husband earmarks money from his share of the matrimonial
                    asset but to simply allow him to retain cash for this purpose, which could turn
                    out to be a fairly sizeable amount for two children. Therefore, attributing a
                    larger share of the matrimonial assets to the Husband was, in the circumstances,
                    just and equitable.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_65"></a>65     For completeness, I refer to a related
                    argument made by the Husband. He brought up the Wife’s close association
                    with [L]. The Husband claimed that [L] lived in [Property 1] and had also made
                    use of the family car before the Husband took it away. According to the Husband,
                    it was [L] who had coached the Wife to make unreasonable demands at the
                    ancillaries. I did not think that the Wife’s relationship with [L] should
                    in principle affect the quantum with which the Wife should exit this marriage
                    any more than the alleged existence of another family which the Wife had accused
                    the Husband of having should affect the Husband’s share.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Monthly maintenance</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_66"></a>66     On 24 September 2008, under a consent
                    order (“the consent order”) made by District Judge Carolyn Woo in
                    MSS 2836/2008, the Husband agreed to pay the Wife and the children monthly
                    maintenance of $4,493.30.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_45" id="Ftn_45_1"><sup>[note: 45]</sup></a></span> In MSS 5638/2008, the monthly
                    maintenance was increased to $4,797.30 by District Judge Jen Koh (“the
                    maintenance sum”).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_46" id="Ftn_46_1"><sup>[note: 46]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_67"></a>67     In the ancillaries, the Wife claimed that a
                    reasonable amount for maintenance for herself and the children would be $10,200,
                    a breakdown of which is as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_67-p2_a"></a>(a)     $4,200 for herself;
                    and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_67-p2_b"></a>(b)     $6,000 for the
                        children.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_68"></a>68     However, this sum of $10,200 was on the
                    condition that the Husband transferred his entire share in [Property 1] to the
                    Wife her without a refund to his CPF account of moneys withdrawn towards
                    purchase of [Property 1], that the Husband purchased a car for the use of the
                    Wife and children. If her conditions were met, the Wife would service the
                    outstanding mortgage repayment. The Husband saw through the Wife’s
                    conditions that came with the maintenance tag of $10,200. The figure was
                    deliberately inflated to disguise the fact that he would be indirectly paying
                    the monthly mortgage payment of about $5,000 which the Wife had agreed to take
                    over if the Husband’s share in [Property 1] was transferred to her without
                    refund of CPF moneys used to finance the purchase of [Property 1]. Furthermore,
                    the Husband pointed out, and quite rightly so, that with interim monthly
                    maintenance of $4,797.30, the Wife could afford to set aside $1,872.50 per month
                    on car rental. I noted the Husband’s point that something was wrong. As he
                    put it, “Someone must be lying outright about the maintenance required or
                    the amount of money she has”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_47" id="Ftn_47_1"><sup>[note: 47]</sup></a></span> In short, the Wife and
                    children were able to live on a monthly sum of $2,872.30.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_69"></a>69     I should also mention that the interim
                    maintenance of $4,797.30 was made when the Husband was still with the RSAF. In
                    2009, his take home salary, before income tax, was about $19,500 (rounded up).
                    There is now no prospect of a second career as a commercial pilot. Prior to his
                    release from regular service in May 2011, he was grounded for a knee injury and
                    episodes of breathlessness.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_48" id="Ftn_48_1"><sup>[note: 48]</sup></a></span> He now has a non-flying job as a
                    Flight Simulator Instructor. His earns a gross monthly salary of $12,500, which
                    is very much less than what he used to earn. His take home pay is about $10,500
                    per month before tax. It is important to bear in mind that the Husband is
                    willing to maintain the Wife; she is, to use his words, “the mother of
                    his children’. The simple point he repeatedly made was that the amount of
                    the maintenance must be within <em>his</em> means, and
                    given his current take home pay, her demand for $10,200 per month was
                    outrageous.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_70"></a>70     The Husband said that without [Property 1] his
                    monthly expenses would be about $7,000. That was still on the high side even
                    after taking into account income tax liability, rental, and mortgage repayments
                    before sale of [Property 2].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_71"></a>71     On the affidavit evidence, I saw no
                    supportable basis for the Wife’s demands for a nearly three-fold increase
                    in the maintenance sum ordered by District Judge Jen Koh in MSS 5638/2008. This
                    is especially since the Wife had consented to a sum of $4,493.30 in MSS
                    2836/2008. Above all, I found the reasons advanced by the Husband plausible, and
                    they were accepted by me.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_72"></a>72     The Wife submitted that one of the reasons for
                    the substantial increase in maintenance was that she would rather pay out of the
                    monthly maintenance for several outgoings such as electricity and other
                    services. This is because the Husband had in the past refused to pay for the
                    services, resulting in the electricity being cut off and the telephone line
                    being disconnected. In addition, she claimed that the money provided for food,
                    vitamins, books, stationery and tuition fees had proved to be
                        insufficient.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_49" id="Ftn_49_1"><sup>[note: 49]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_73"></a>73     I found that the Wife’s accusations that
                    the Husband had refused to pay bills for services to be untrue. In fact, the
                    very same accusations were disbelieved during a Maintenance Enforcement Trial
                    heard before a District Judge. I found that the Wife had refused to pass the
                    Husband his mail and bills addressed to [Property 1]. She had also prevented
                    SingPost from redirecting his mails to another address. The Husband also had to
                    call Starhub personally to settle the bills so that the TV services would be
                    available for the children. In addition, the Wife had neglected to pay for
                    Singapore Power bills despite being given $350 under the interim maintenance
                        sum.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_50" id="Ftn_50_1"><sup>[note: 50]</sup></a></span> In
                    addition, the Husband had stated that the children still approached him for
                    money on an ad hoc basis, and that he would give them some money whenever he met
                    them. On special occasions, he had voluntarily given the children extra money.
                    He gave the example of his $1,000 “hong bao” to each child for the
                    Chinese New Year even though he knew that they would give the money to their
                    mother. On the Wife’s birthday, the Husband gave the children some money
                    knowing that they would use it to get a gift for their mother.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_74"></a>74     Having considered all the circumstances, I am
                    of the opinion that, in the medium term whilst [Property 2] is not sold, a fair
                    sum of maintenance for the Wife and the children is $3,800, of which:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_74-p2_a"></a>(a)     $1,800 is for the Wife;
                    and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_74-p2_b"></a>(b)     $2,000 is for
                        the children.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Claim for car rental</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_75"></a>75     In November 2008, the Husband sold the family
                    car, a Honda Stream. The sale price was less than the outstanding loan
                        (see <a href="#p1_39">[39]</a> above).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_51" id="Ftn_51_1"><sup>[note: 51]</sup></a></span> The Wife claimed that
                    the rental of a car was necessary for her to drive the children around. The
                    monthly rental of the car came up to $1,872.50 per month.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_52" id="Ftn_52_1"><sup>[note: 52]</sup></a></span> As such, the Wife
                    claimed a sum of $56,292.50 for the rental of a car from November 2008 to June
                    2011.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_76"></a>76     The Husband submitted that the issue of
                    reimbursement of the car rental had already been brought up before the District
                    Judge Jen Koh in MSS 5638/2008. The Wife argued that the sale of the family car
                    was in breach of paragraph [5] of the
                    Consent Order dated 24 September 2008,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_53" id="Ftn_53_1"><sup>[note: 53]</sup></a></span> which stated that the
                    Husband was to:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... make payments directly for the following:-</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(1)    Car loan for vehicle number [xxx];</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(2)    Road Tax for vehicle number [xxx];
                        and</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(3)    Maintenance and sinking fund for [Property
                            1].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_77"></a>77     District Judge Jen Koh ruled that as the car
                    was still in the Husband’s name, he could do what he wanted with the car.
                    The consent order did not prohibit the Husband from selling the car. However,
                    District Judge Jen Koh on 1 September 2009 did order the Husband to pay the
                    Wife $900 per month for transport costs backdated to 28 January
                        2009.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_54" id="Ftn_54_1"><sup>[note: 54]</sup></a></span> According to the
                    Husband, this backdating was to cover the transport expenses after he took away
                    the car in November 2008. The Husband argued that the Wife therefore had no
                    valid basis to claim car rental from him. In reply to the Wife’s other
                    argument that she needed as car as [Property 1] was too far from the main road,
                    the Husband pointed out that [Property 1] was not that inaccessible. It was 500
                    metres from [xxx] Road and 900 meters from [xxx] MRT station, both places he
                    identified were within walking distance.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_55" id="Ftn_55_1"><sup>[note: 55]</sup></a></span>In my view, the $900 for
                    transport was sufficient to meet the needs of the Wife and the children. The
                    Wife could not explain why she needed to hire a Mitsubishi Grandis (2400cc)
                    which is a MPV with a bigger engine capacity compared to the family car, a Honda
                    Stream (1700cc). From the 2011 invoices, the rental car was a Nissan Presage
                    (2500cc). In the absence of an explanation, the Wife’s behaviour was
                    unreasonable. I was minded to believe that there was in effect an element of
                    tit-for-tat in the decision especially after the Husband took away and sold the
                    family car. In the circumstances, I disallowed the Wife’s claim for the
                    costs of car rental from November 2008 to June 2011.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Costs</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_78"></a>78     As for costs, I ordered each party to bear its
                    own legal costs. The Husband is allowed to set off the previous cost orders made
                    against the Wife from moneys that have been ordered to be paid to the Wife. At
                    present, the previous cost orders made against the Wife amount to
                $8,100.</p>
