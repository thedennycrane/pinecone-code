</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> This ceased after the Company was placed under liquidation.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 The defendants argued that:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The Company was ordinarily resident in the BVI because various courts including the Singapore court have found that the BVI was the Company’s centre of main interest, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, where its central administration took place.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The Company ceased to carry on business in Singapore since it was placed under liquidation.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 The claimant noted that there was no reported decision on the relevant time at which to assess residency in the context of a company under liquidation. The claimant submitted that the residency of an insolvent company had to be assessed by reference to when it was alive and flourishing. The claimant argued that otherwise, a Singapore court would never be able to find jurisdiction in a claim against an insolvent foreign company even where, at all material times prior to its insolvency, the company was resident in Singapore.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 I disagreed with the claimant. In my view, the question as to whether the Company was ordinarily resident or carrying on business in Singapore had to be determined at the time that the application for service out of jurisdiction was filed or heard. The court’s jurisdiction is primarily territorial in nature. Jurisdiction over a defendant who is outside the territory is asserted by way of service of the originating process on him. Such service is possible only with the approval of the court. Where an application for approval for service out of jurisdiction is grounded on the defendant being ordinarily resident or carrying on business in Singapore, it seemed to me that in principle, the ground relied upon ought to be satisfied at the time when the application is filed or heard.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 My conclusion finds support (at least, in part) in <span class="font-italic">Chellaram</span><span class="font-italic"> and another v Chellaram and others (No 2)</span> [2002] 3 All ER 17 (“<span class="font-italic">Chellaram</span>”). One of the issues in that case concerned the Civil Procedure Rules (UK) (“CPR”) 6.20(11). Permission may be granted under CPR 6.20(11) to serve out of the jurisdiction if:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">a claim is made for any remedy which might be obtained in proceedings to execute the trusts of a written instrument where – (a) the trusts ought to be executed according to English law, and (b) the person on whom the claim form is to be served is a trustee of the trusts.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">The English High Court decided (at [151]) that the condition that the “trusts ought to be executed according to English law” must be fulfilled when permission to serve out is sought. In <span class="font-italic">Halsbury’s Laws of Singapore – Conflict of Laws Vol 6(2)</span> (LexisNexis, 2020 Reissue) at para 75.035, relying on <span class="font-italic">Chellaram</span>, the learned author also commented that the connection of ordinary residence or carrying on business in Singapore must be established “at the time leave is sought [to serve out of jurisdiction]”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 By the time the claimant filed his application for approval to serve out of jurisdiction, the Company had been placed under liquidation. It was no longer carrying on business and the central management and control of the Company was no longer being exercised in Singapore. I concluded therefore that the ground based on the Company’s residency or carrying on of its business was not satisfied.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Whether the claim involved property situated in Singapore</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 The Liquidators had repatriated all moneys held by the Company to the BVI. The Company’s office premises in Singapore were repossessed by the landlord in October 2022. The Liquidators submitted that the Company did not have any property in Singapore.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 The claimant submitted that he was asserting a proprietary claim with respect to the DC Assets that comprised cryptoassets stored in the DC FB Workspace under a licence owned by DVPL (see [22], [24] and [26] above). DVPL was a Singapore company in which the claimant was the sole shareholder. The DC Assets also included shares and rights in the SAFEs and SAFTs but the cryptoassets constituted the majority in value of the assets. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 The question was where are cryptoassets situated? The claimant informed me that there was no reported Singapore decision on the <span class="font-italic">situs</span> of cryptoassets.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 The claimant submitted that there was a good arguable case for the principle that the presumptive owner of cryptoassets would be whoever controlled the wallet linked to the cryptoasset and that the <span class="font-italic">situs</span> of a cryptoasset would be where its owner was resident. The claimant submitted therefore that the DC Fund’s cryptoassets were situated in Singapore since DVPL (and by extension, the claimant) controlled the private key to the assets. Both DVPL and the claimant are resident in Singapore.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 The claimant relied on <span class="font-italic">Tulip Trading Ltd</span> <span class="font-italic">(a Seychelles company) v Van Der Laan</span><span class="font-italic"> and others</span> [2022] 2 All ER (Comm) 624 (“<span class="font-italic">Tulip Trading</span><span class="font-italic"> (HC)</span>”). In that case, the claimant claimed that it owned a substantial amount of digital currency assets and that its private keys were removed as a result of a computer hack. The defendants challenged the order granting permission to serve out of the jurisdiction. The English High Court set aside the order granting permission to serve out of the jurisdiction on the ground that the claimant had not established a serious issue to be tried on the merits (at [171]). However, the High Court also decided (in passing) that there was a good arguable case that the claimant was resident in the jurisdiction and that the digital assets were located in the jurisdiction (at [158]). I noted that the question of control over the digital assets did not arise in that case because the claimant’s ownership was not disputed. While the English Court of Appeal overruled the decision of<span class="font-italic"> </span>the High Court, there was no dispute in the appeal that there was a good arguable case that the claimant was resident in the jurisdiction and that the property was located in the jurisdiction: <span class="font-italic">Tulip Trading Ltd</span> <span class="font-italic">(a Seychelles company) v </span><span class="font-italic">Bitcoin Association for BSV and others </span>[2023] 2 All ER (Comm) 479 (at [7]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 The defendants submitted that the DC Fund’s cryptoassets should not be considered as being located in Singapore because there is significant uncertainty on how the location of digital assets is to be determined.

The English High Court referred to, among others, the decision in <span class="font-italic">Osbourne [2022]</span> and accepted that there was a good arguable case that two NFTs were located in the jurisdiction when they were in wallets linked to the claimant’s account with a cryptoasset management platform (at [31]–[32]). </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) In <span class="font-italic">Bybit</span><span class="font-italic"> Fintech Ltd v Ho Kai Xin and others</span> [2023] SGHC 199 (“<span class="font-italic">Bybit</span>”), the High Court decided that USDT were choses in action (at [4]). The defendants in the present case submitted that on this basis, the USDT may be treated as being located in the country where the right to redeem it could be enforced. This was consistent with the general principle that choses in action are regarded as situated where they are properly recoverable or can be enforced: <span class="font-italic">Dicey, Morris &amp; Collins</span><span class="font-italic"> on the Conflict of Laws</span> (Lord Lawrence Collins and Professor Jonathan Harris KC gen ed) (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 2022, 16th Ed) (“Dicey”) at para 23-025.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 The defendants further submitted that in the absence of a physical location, the location of the person who controls the private keys to the digital assets or the jurisdictional location of the digital assets should only be relevant when considering the enforceability of any orders made.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 I agreed with the claimant that there was a good arguable case that the DC Funds cryptoassets were situated in Singapore because the cryptoassets were controlled by DVPL and/or the claimant and both are resident in Singapore.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 It cannot be seriously disputed that cryptoassets constitute property, the proprietary rights to which may be enforced in court:<span class="font-italic"> </span><span class="font-italic">CLM v CLN and others</span> [2022] 5 SLR 273 (“<span class="font-italic">CLM</span>”) at [46];<span class="font-italic"> </span><span class="font-italic">Bybit</span> at [33] and [36]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 A cryptoasset has no physical identity and is not associated with any physical object; it exists as a record in a network of computers associated with it: <span class="font-italic">ByBit</span> at [31]; <span class="font-italic">CLM </span>at [10].  Hence, its location cannot be determined by its physical presence. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 I agreed with the claimant that the location of a cryptoasset is best determined by looking at where it is controlled. Given the fact that a cryptoasset has no physical presence and exists as a record in a network of computers, in my view, it best manifests itself through the exercise of control over it.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 It was clear that control over a cryptoasset is with the person who controls the private key to the cryptoasset linked to that key. As explained in Kelvin FK Low and Ernie GS Teo, “Bitcoins and Other Cryptocurrencies as Property?” (2017) 9(2) Law, Innovation and Technology 235 (cited with approval in <span class="font-italic">CLM </span>at [10]):</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) A holder of bitcoin possesses a public address and a private cryptographic key. The public bitcoin address serves a similar function to an account number; all that is needed to receive bitcoins is the public bitcoin address. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The private cryptographic key is mathematically linked to the public address so that it is not possible to change the private key (unlike a conventional password).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) To transfer a cryptoasset, one requires both the public address and the private key. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">The public address is also known as the “wallet” or “crypto wallet”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 The next question then was whether the location of the person who controls the private key should be determined according to his domicile or residence? I agreed with the claimant that the residence of the person who controls the private key should be treated as the <span class="font-italic">situs</span> of the cryptoasset linked to that private key. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 In my view, residence is the more appropriate test. The <span class="font-italic">situs </span>of cryptoassets is being determined based on the exercise of control over such assets. The residence of the person is a better indicator of where the control is being exercised. In addition, where the person resides is normally where he can be sued. Further, it was also suggested in Dicey that for the <span class="font-italic">situs</span> of cryptoassets, the test of residence (or place of business) may be more appropriate “given the uncertainties around identification of domicile in difficult cases” (Dicey, at para 23–050). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 As for <span class="font-italic">Bybit</span>, the question as to the <span class="font-italic">situs</span> of cryptoassets did not arise in that case. In any event, it seemed to me that treating cryptoassets as choses in action would lead the <span class="font-italic">situs</span> analysis to the person who controls the private key. As a chose in action, a cryptoasset would be properly recoverable or can be enforced where the person who controls the private key to the cryptoasset resides and can be sued. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 As the defendants pointed out, there were other cases that decided that the location of cryptoassets should be the domicile, rather than the residence, of the owner. However, I saw no reason why the differing decisions (as to whether the test should be domicile or residence) had to lead to the conclusion (as the defendants submitted) that the DC Fund’s cryptoassets should not be considered to be located in Singapore. Cryptoassets are a new type of property which have no physical presence.

In essence, the claimant’s case was that the trusts arose pursuant to the Independent Fund Arrangement. The discussions on the Independent Fund Arrangement took place in Singapore. The agreement on the Independent Fund Arrangement was reached in Singapore. The creation of the DC Sub-Accounts, the initial transfer of cryptocurrencies and fiat currencies to the DC Sub-Accounts, and the issuance of the Class Defiance Shares and Class Defiance Interests took place when the Company was headquartered and operating in Singapore. In addition, TACPL (the Company’s investment manager then) is a Singapore company and both the Company and TACPL had common directors.

The Company was placed under liquidation on 27 June 2022 by a BVI court, and the second and third defendants were its liquidators (the “Liquidators”). The claimant managed a portfolio of assets in the Company. </div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">2 The Company’s investment manager was Three Arrows Capital Pte Ltd (“TACPL”), a Singapore company, until ThreeAC Ltd (“3ACL”), a BVI company, took over as the investment manager in September 2021. The Company operated a master-feeder fund structure. The Company was the master fund. It had an offshore feeder fund, Three Arrows Fund Ltd (“TAF Ltd”), a BVI company, and an onshore feeder fund, Three Arrows Fund, LP (“TAF LP”), a Delaware limited partnership. Investors would invest in the master fund by subscribing for shares of various classes offered by TAF Ltd or limited partner interests offered by TAF LP, which would in turn invest substantially all their assets by subscribing for shares of the Company. TAF Ltd was placed into voluntary liquidation in the BVI by TACPL, its sole member on 27 January 2023. TAF Ltd, TAF LP, TACPL, and 3ACL are referred to as the “3AC Group”.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">3 The claimant was managing about US$900,000 worth of investments by November 2019 and wanted to formally set up a fund. Between November 2019 and early 2020, the claimant discussed an arrangement with the founders of TACPL, Mr Su Zhu (“SZ”) and Mr Kyle Livingston Davies (“KD”), whereby the claimant would use the assets managed by him to launch an independent and standalone fund (the “DC Fund”) on the 3AC Group platform, which would be owned and controlled by the claimant (the “Independent Fund Arrangement”). </div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">4 The Company created sub-accounts for the claimant within the Company’s main accounts on two cryptocurrency exchanges (the “DC Sub-Accounts”). TAF Ltd created a class of shares, “Class Defiance Shares”, and TAF LP created a class of interests, “Class Defiance Interests”. The claimant and the investors in the separate fund set up by the claimant (“DC Investors”) subscribed for the Class Defiance Shares and Class Defiance Interests by entering into subscription agreements with TAF Ltd and TAF LP respectively (the “Subscription Agreements”). The DC Investors paid for them by transferring cryptocurrencies and fiat currencies into the DC Sub-Accounts, which were then used to purchase other assets (collectively, the “DC Assets”). These assets included simple agreements for future equities (“SAFEs”) and simple agreements for future tokens (“SAFTs”). </div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">5 The claimant had sole discretion and control over the management of the DC Fund. Only the claimant and his employees knew the password to access the DC Sub-Accounts. The claimant sourced a co-working space for himself and his employees. The DC Assets were earmarked for Class Defiance Shares and Class Defiance Interests, and any increase in the value of the DC Assets thus accrued solely to the claimant and DC Investors as holders of the Class Defiance Shares and Class Defiance Interests. The Company also set up a workspace on a platform (the “DC FB Workplace”) which stored cryptocurrency tokens to store the cryptocurrency tokens forming part of the DC Assets, and only the claimant and his representatives could access it. Part of the DC Assets were also stored in cold wallets which belonged to the claimant. </div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">6 In February 2022, SZ and KD told the claimant that they intended to relocate the 3AC Group’s operations to Dubai. The claimant decided to continue operating the DC Fund from Singapore, and incorporated DeFiance Ventures Pte Ltd (“DVPL”) on 9 May 2022, and DeFiance Capital Pte Ltd (“DCPL”) on 14 May 2022. On 14 June 2022, the Company transferred all its rights and interests in the DC FB Workplace and all the DC Assets in the DC Sub-Accounts to DCPL. Some DC Assets were not transferred to the claimant and/or DCPL, including rights and interests in various SAFTs and SAFEs, and shares issued to the Company pursuant to certain SAFEs. DCPL subsequently novated the DC FB Workspace to DVPL on 20 June 2023. </div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">7 The Company was placed under liquidation on 27 June 2022 by a BVI court. Upon the Liquidators’ application on 9 July 2022, the Singapore High Court recognised the BVI liquidation proceedings as a foreign main proceeding. On 4 November 2022, the claimant filed an application in the Singapore High Court seeking permission to commence proceedings against the Company in relation to the DC Assets. Thereafter, on that same day, the Liquidators filed an application in the BVI liquidation proceedings seeking orders that the DC Assets were beneficially owned by the Company (“Parallel BVI Proceedings”). </div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">8 The Singapore High Court granted the claimant leave to commence action against the Company on 25 January 2023. On 18 April 2023, the claimant filed this Originating Claim claiming that the DC Assets were held on trust by the Company for the benefit of the DC Investors.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">9 On 3 February 2023, the claimant filed an application to set aside the BVI court order in the BVI granting the Liquidators permission to serve the Parallel BVI Proceedings on the claimant in Singapore. Judgment was reserved.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">10 On 10 May 2023, the Singapore High Court gave its approval for the claimant to effect service of the court papers in this suit on the defendants in the BVI (“ORC 2117”). Service was effected on the defendants between 12 May 2023 and 16 May 2023. The defendants filed the present application to set aside ORC 2117 and the service of the court papers on the defendants. </div><div class="txt-body text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Decision</span></div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">11 The claimant had to show that: (a) there is a good arguable case that there is sufficient nexus to Singapore; sufficient nexus may be shown by reference to any of the non-exhaustive list of factors set out in para 63(3) of the Supreme Court Practice Directions 2021 (“SCPD”); (b) Singapore is the <span class="font-italic">forum </span><span class="font-italic">conveniens</span>; and (c) there is a serious question to be tried on the merits of the claim (at <span class="font-weight-bold">[37]</span>).</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Sufficient nexus to Singapore</span> </div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">12 The claimant relied on three grounds in the SCPD to establish a good arguable case of a sufficient nexus to Singapore. First, relief was sought against the Company which was ordinarily resident or carrying on business in Singapore. Second, the claim was made to assert, declare or determine proprietary rights in or over movable property, or to obtain authority to dispose of movable property, situated in Singapore. Third, the claim was founded on a cause of action arising in Singapore (at <span class="font-weight-bold">[42]</span>). </div><div class="txt-body text-left">13 The first ground was not satisfied. Where an application for approval for service out of jurisdiction is grounded on the defendant being ordinarily resident or carrying on business in Singapore, in principle, the ground relied upon ought to be satisfied at the time when the application is filed or heard. By the time the claimant filed his application to serve out of jurisdiction, the Company had been placed under liquidation. It was no longer carrying on business and the central management and control of the Company was no longer being exercised in Singapore (at <span class="font-weight-bold">[</span><span class="font-weight-bold">43] </span>to <span class="font-weight-bold">[49]</span>). </div><div class="txt-body text-left">14 The second ground was satisfied. The location of a cryptoasset is best determined by looking at where it is controlled, and the residence of the person who controls the private key should be treated as the <span class="font-italic">situs</span> of the cryptoasset linked to that private key. DVPL (and by extension, the claimant) controlled the private key to the assets, and they were both resident in Singapore (at <span class="font-weight-bold">[50] </span>to <span class="font-weight-bold">[65]</span>). </div><div class="txt-body text-left">15 The third ground was satisfied. Despite the formalities of the fund structure, the creation of the DC Sub-Accounts, the initial transfer of cryptocurrencies and fiat currencies to the DC Sub-Accounts, and the issuance of the Class Defiance Shares and Class Defiance Interests took place when the Company was headquartered and operating in Singapore. In addition, TACPL (the Company’s investment manager then) is a Singapore company and both the Company and TACPL had common directors (at <span class="font-weight-bold">[66] </span>to <span class="font-weight-bold">[70]</span>). </div><div class="txt-body text-left"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Whether Singapore was the more appropriate forum</span></div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">16 The relevant factors pointed to Singapore being the more appropriate forum (at <span class="font-weight-bold">[71]</span>). </div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">17 First, most of the relevant witnesses are in Singapore. The Independent Fund Agreement was key to the claimant’s case. The witnesses, the claimant, SZ and KD were also resident in Singapore at the material time. Ningxin, a trader of the 3AC Group whom the claimant dealt with, was believed to be based in Singapore. The fund administrator for the DC Fund and the 3AC Group (“Ascent”) is incorporated in Singapore, and its employees handling the DC Fund and 3AC Group were understood to be in Singapore. The auditors of the Company (“Oakfield”) is a public accounting firm registered in Singapore, and their representatives could give evidence on instructions by SZ and KD as to the DC Fund (at <span class="font-weight-bold">[72] </span>to <span class="font-weight-bold">[76]</span>). </div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">18 Second, relevant documents in the possession of Ascent and Oakfield would be in Singapore. There is no evidence that a BVI court would be able to compel production of the relevant documents (at <span class="font-weight-bold">[77]</span>). </div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">19 Third, that the transactions were implemented through a BVI investment structure was a neutral factor, since the substance of the claimant’s case was that there was a trust notwithstanding that the master-feeder fund structure was used. In any event, the applicability of BVI law was not sufficient to outweigh the factors in favour of Singapore being the more appropriate forum (at <span class="font-weight-bold">[78] </span>to <span class="font-weight-bold">[79]</span>). </div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">20 Fourth, that the Company’s creditors’ committee had approved the dispute with the claimant being resolved by the BVI court as part of the BVI Liquidation Proceedings was an irrelevant factor. The dispute over the DC Assets was between the Company and the claimant, and it was not clear how the creditors could intervene in this dispute. Further, the fact that the creditors might prefer to intervene in proceedings in the BVI was also irrelevant (at <span class="font-weight-bold">[80] </span>to <span class="font-weight-bold">[81]</span>). </div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">21 The Parallel BVI Proceedings were not significant given the early stage of the proceedings (at <span class="font-weight-bold">[82]</span>). </div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Whether there was a serious question to be tried</span></div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">22 The evidence of the claimant’s discussion with SZ and KD, the segregation of the DC Assets and the extent to which the claimant had control over these assets to the exclusion of the 3AC Group supported the claimant’s trust claim. The defendants’ argument that the trust claim was inconsistent with the master-feeder investment structure and the Subscription Agreements was not a strong argument because a trust could be found to exist even if it contradicts the relevant legal documents (at <span class="font-weight-bold">[8</span><span class="font-weight-bold">3] </span>to <span class="font-weight-bold">[85]</span>). </div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Whether there was failure to make full and frank disclosure</span></div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">23 There was no failure to make full and frank disclosure of material facts. The claimant had disclosed the Liquidators’ position that they disagreed that the DC Assets were held on trust and reproduced the Liquidators’ reasons, which referred to the terms of investment into TAF Ltd and the master-feeder investment structure (at <span class="font-weight-bold">[8</span><span class="font-weight-bold">6] </span>to <span class="font-weight-bold">[87]</span>). </div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion </span></div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">24 The General Division of the High Court dismissed the defendant’s application and ordered costs to be paid to the claimant fixed at $15,000 plus disbursements to be fixed if not agreed (at <span class="font-weight-bold">[90</span><span class="font-weight-bold">]</span>).</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center"><span class="font-italic">This summary is provided to assist in the understanding of the Court’s grounds of decision.
