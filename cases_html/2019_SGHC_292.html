</div> While such trades involve physical cargo (the Bunge merchanting trades utilised cargo in transit between the load port and discharge port), the cargo does not physically enter India. Instead, transfer of ownership is effected by exchanging photocopies of the bills of lading pertaining to the cargo. In this way, the Indian merchanting trader (<span class="font-italic">ie, </span>the intermediary) takes ownership of the cargo <span class="font-italic">on paper</span>, but never actually takes delivery of the physical cargo before it is on-sold to the offshore buyer.

In the interim, the funds routed to India could be placed in interest-bearing Indian bank accounts. According to AOPL and Mr Bhasi, the true purpose of the Bunge-AOPL merchanting trade transactions was “interest arbitrage”. At the time, Indian banks were offering some of the highest interest rates. In other words, the putative trade flows were being used as a cover for routing and parking funds in Indian banks.

</div> However, this arrangement came with a particular risk. As mentioned, the letters of credit matured at the six-month mark, after which the funds would have to be paid out to the negotiating bank, potentially breaking the fixed deposit. Should the fixed deposit be broken, AOPL would not only lose the benefit of the interest that would otherwise have been earned on the deposit, but would also be liable to penalties for early termination of the deposit.

</div> Therefore, in order that the fixed deposit would not be broken, AOPL had to ensure that sufficient funds stood in its account to maintain the deposit.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">19 In practice, AOPL was able to maintain sufficient funds by engaging in multiple trades at a time. In essence, so long as BSA advanced fresh funds (pursuant to a second or subsequent trade) to AOPL before the maturity of the first letter of credit, AOPL would be able to maintain its fixed deposit. AOPL refers to these subsequent trades as “roll-over trades”. Since the letters of credit issued by AOPL were kept open for six months, three roll-over trades would be engaged in in the course of maintaining a two-year fixed deposit.

Pursuant to each AOPL-GRIPT contract, AOPL was obliged to procure from its bank an IPU in GRIPT’s favour. Essentially, the IPU was an undertaking given by AOPL’s bank that it would, upon receipt of the funds advanced by BSA, (a) issue a letter of credit to the benefit of GRIPT; and (b) failing which, remit the funds advanced by BSA to GRIPT. The IPUs were procured by AOPL by way of a “mandate letter” sent by AOPL to its bank, SBI, instructing it to issue the IPU.

Deferred mandate trades differed from ordinary trades in one main respect. In an ordinary trade, AOPL would be required to procure the issuance of a letter of credit within days (usually two days) of receipt of the advance from BSA. In deferred mandate trades, AOPL was given a much longer time to procure the issuance of the letter of credit. In the period between when the advance from BSA was received and when the letter of credit had to be issued, AOPL would have use of the funds advanced.

<div class="FootnoteRef text-justify">  1st Defendant’s Written Submissions (RA 227) dated 9 November 2018 (“D1WS”) at para 4.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> An assistant registrar heard and dismissed the application on 24 August 2018. On 5 September 2018, SBI appealed against the decision <span class="font-italic">vide</span> RA 227. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Applicable legal principles</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 These jurisdictional challenges concerned a number of issues. I begin by setting out the various applicable legal frameworks.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 Where a foreign defendant – who was served out of the jurisdiction in relation to a suit in Singapore – applies for a stay of proceedings under O 12 r 7(2) of the ROC, the issue is whether Singapore courts should decline to assume jurisdiction on the ground that Singapore is not the proper forum for the dispute. Generally, in such stay applications, the question is whether the foreign jurisdiction is clearly or distinctly more appropriate than Singapore for the determination of the claim. The applicable test is the two-stage analysis established in <span class="font-italic">Spiliada Maritime Corporation v Cansulex Ltd </span>[1987] AC 460 (“<span class="font-italic">Spiliada</span>”), as applied in Singapore in cases including <span class="font-italic">Rickshaw Investments Ltd </span><span class="font-italic">and another v Nicolai Baron von Uexkull</span> [2007] 1 SLR(R) 377 (“<span class="font-italic">Rickshaw Investments</span>”) at [12].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 At Stage 1 of the <span class="font-italic">Spiliada </span>test, the court determines if there is <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> some other available forum that is more appropriate for the case to be tried. Relevant connecting factors include the following (<span class="font-italic">JIO Minerals FZC</span><span class="font-italic"> and others v Mineral Enterprises Ltd</span> [2011] 1 SLR 391 at [42]; <span class="font-italic">Halsbury</span><span class="font-italic">’s Laws of Singapore </span>vol 6(2) (LexisNexis, 2016 Reissue) (“<span class="font-italic">Halsbury’s Laws of Singapore</span>”) at paras 75.090–75.095): </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The personal connections of the parties and the witnesses. The compellability of the witnesses is also an important factor (<span class="font-italic">Rickshaw Investments </span>at [23] and [25]).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The connections to relevant events and transactions. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) The law applicable to the dispute.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) The existence of proceedings elsewhere. This raises potential issues of duplication of resources as well as the risk of conflicting judgments. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) The overall “shape of the litigation”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">It is the quality, not the quantity, of connecting factors that is crucial in the analysis. The search is for the connecting factors which have the “most relevant and substantial associations” with the dispute at hand (<span class="font-italic">Rappo, </span><span class="font-italic">Tania v Accent Delight International Ltd and another and another appeal </span>[2017] 2 SLR 265 at [70]). The burden at Stage 1 lies on the defendant. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 If the defendant succeeds at Stage 1, the burden shifts to the plaintiff at Stage 2 to satisfy the court that justice nonetheless requires that a stay should not be granted, even though the court is not <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> the natural forum (<span class="font-italic">Rickshaw Investments </span>at [14]; <span class="font-italic">Zoom Communications</span> <span class="font-italic">Ltd v Broadcast Solutions Pte Ltd </span>[2014] 4 SLR 500 (“<span class="font-italic">Zoom Communications</span>”) at [75]). The court will consider whether substantial justice can be obtained by the plaintiff in the <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> natural forum. Where having trial in the foreign forum will amount to a deprivation of substantial justice, then a stay may be denied. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 In contrast to a stay application, where the foreign defendant applies for a setting aside of the order granting leave to serve out of jurisdiction under O 12 r 7(1)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>), he challenges the <span class="font-italic">existence </span>of the Singapore courts’ jurisdiction on grounds that Singapore is not the proper forum (and thus, one of the requirements for valid service out of jurisdiction has not been satisfied). Here, a threshold issue is whether the defendant has submitted to the jurisdiction of the Singapore courts. If it is found that there is no such submission, the next question is whether the order for service out of jurisdiction should be set aside, because of any of the following (<span class="font-italic">Zoom Communications </span>at [26]–[29]): </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) the plaintiff’s claim does not come within one of the heads of claim in O 11 r 1 of the ROC;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) the plaintiff’s claim does not have a sufficient degree of merit; </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) the plaintiff failed to provide full and frank disclosure of all material facts when it made its <span class="font-italic">ex parte </span>application for the order for service out of jurisdiction; or</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) Singapore is not the proper forum for the trial of the action (as per the same <span class="font-italic">Spiliada </span>test above).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">The plaintiff must establish a “good arguable case” that the claim falls within one of the sub-paragraphs of O 11 r 1 of the ROC, and show sufficient degree of merit by demonstrating that there is a serious question to be tried on the merits of the case: <span class="font-italic">Bradley Lomas Elec</span><span class="font-italic">trolok Ltd and another v Colt Ventilation East Asia Pte Ltd and others </span>[1999] 3 SLR(R) 1156 at [18]–[19]. Here, the burden of proof remains on the plaintiff to demonstrate that Singapore is the proper forum (<span class="font-italic">Zoom Communications </span>at [72]–[75]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 However, the applicable test in relation to stay applications changes where there exists an agreement between parties to litigate in Singapore – whether by an exclusive jurisdiction clause or a non-exclusive jurisdiction clause (because in the latter case, the plaintiff is promised the defendant’s submission if the claim is brought in the named jurisdiction): <span class="font-italic">Shanghai Turbo Enterprises Ltd v Liu Ming </span>[2019] 1 SLR 779 (“<span class="font-italic">Shanghai Turbo</span>”) at [84]–[86]. In such a case, the test is not simply whether the foreign jurisdiction is the more appropriate forum. Rather, the court will generally hold parties to their contractual commitment to litigate in Singapore, unless there is “strong cause” amounting to exceptional circumstances why the proceedings brought in Singapore should be stayed. The burden lies with the party seeking the stay to show strong cause: <span class="font-italic">Trisuryo Garuda Nusa Pte Ltd v SKP Pradiksi (North) Sdn Bhd and another and another appeal</span> [2017] 2 SLR 814 (“<span class="font-italic">Trisuryo</span>”) at [84]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">71 The same “strong cause” test applies in relation to an application to set aside leave to serve out pursuant to O 12 r 7(1)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the ROC. I note at this juncture that AOPL and Mr Bhasi had argued to the contrary. Citing <span class="font-italic">Zoom Communications</span>, AOPL and Mr Bhasi contended that the strong cause test had no application to such setting aside applications because the burden of proof in such cases is always on the plaintiff. This is not correct. The “strong cause” test applies to any challenge to jurisdiction, whether by an application to set aside a court order granting the plaintiff leave to serve out of jurisdiction or to stay those proceedings in favour in proceedings elsewhere:<span class="font-italic"> </span><span class="font-italic">Shanghai Turbo</span> at [86]. This is because both applications amount to attempts on the defendant’s part to be released from his contractual obligations, which should ordinarily be binding on grounds of party autonomy and the sanctity of contract. The onus accordingly lies on the defendant to justify why the court should allow him to do so.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">72 In determining whether a party has shown “strong cause”, the task for the court is not simply to undertake a balancing exercise to determine which forum is more convenient, but to ask why the party seeking the stay should be permitted to be relieved of its contractual obligation to sue (or be sued) in the agreed forum: <span class="font-italic">Trisuryo</span> at [84]. The factors which the court will take into account include (<span class="font-italic">Shang</span><span class="font-italic">hai Turbo</span> at [94], citing <span class="font-italic">Amerco Timbers Pte Ltd v Chatsworth Timber Corp Pte Ltd </span>[1977–1978] SLR(R) 112 at [11]): </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(a) in what country the evidence on the issues of fact is situated or more readily available, and the effect of that on the relative convenience and expense of trial as between the Singapore and foreign courts;</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(b) whether the law of the foreign court applies and, if so, whether it differs from Singapore law in any material respect;</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(c)  with what country either party is connected and, if so, how closely;</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(d)  whether the defendants genuinely desire trial in the foreign country, or are only seeking procedural advantages; and</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(e)  whether the plaintiffs would be prejudiced by having to sue in the foreign court because they would:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(i)  be deprived of security for their claim;</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(ii)  be unable to enforce any judgment obtained;</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(iii)  be faced with a time-bar not applicable here; or</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(iv)  for political, racial, religious or other reasons be unlikely to get a fair trial.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">In applying factor (d), it should be borne in mind that it encapsulates the inquiry of whether the applicant is acting abusively in applying for a stay of proceedings …</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">73 What amounts to exceptional circumstances depends on the facts, but generally, factors within the contemplation of the parties at the time of contracting should carry less weight than unforeseen factors: <span class="font-italic">Shanghai Turbo</span> at [88(a)]. Thus, although fragmentation of proceedings may amount to strong cause against enforcing a jurisdiction agreement, it may not if the fragmentation is foreseeable at the time the contract was formed: <span class="font-italic">Halsbury’s Laws of Singapore</span> at para 75.121. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Preliminary Issue: Whether AOPL and/or Mr Bhasi accepted service of the amended writ</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">74 As a preliminary point, the plaintiffs argued that attempts by AOPL and Mr Bhasi to contest jurisdiction should be dismissed because they had already submitted to the jurisdiction of the Singapore courts as follows:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a)  AOPL’s and Mr Bhasi’s counsel, Shook Lin &amp; Bok LLP (“SLB”), did not object to the plaintiffs’ prayer in SUM 2740 (to amend the writ of summons and the statement of claim) for an order that the amended writ be served on AOPL and Mr Bhasi without any further requirement that leave be obtained for service of the amended writ out of jurisdiction; and </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) the amended writ and Statement of Claim (Amendment No 1) were served on SLB via e-Litigation on 29 June 2018, and this service was accepted without any reservation or qualification.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">75 Having perused the record of SUM 2740, it was clear to me that neither AOPL nor Mr Bhasi had, by their conduct of the proceedings, evinced any unequivocal intention to submit to the jurisdiction of the Singapore courts. On the contrary, the notes of argument for SUM 2740 record that SLB had made it clear that they were attending only as observers, and that their attendance was not to be taken as a step in the proceedings or as submission to jurisdiction. In the circumstances, the fact that SLB did not object to SUM 2740 could not be taken to be a submission to jurisdiction. Notably, counsel for the plaintiffs, Allen &amp; Gledhill LLP (“A&amp;G”), did not argue at the hearing of SUM 2740 that anything should be made of SLB’s attendance at the hearing or the fact that they were not objecting to the application.

By all accounts, SLB did not have instructions to accept service of the writ in Singapore. In fact, as just mentioned, AOPL and Mr Bhasi had expressly reserved their position on jurisdiction. The only reason why A&amp;G were able to serve the amended writ and Statement of Claim (Amendment No 1) via e-Litigation was because AOPL and Mr Bhasi had entered an appearance. An entry of appearance does not constitute waiver of one’s right to mount a challenge to jurisdiction.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">77 For these reasons, I reject the preliminary point that there was submission to the jurisdiction of the Singapore courts.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The claims against AOPL </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">78 To recapitulate, as against AOPL, there were two claims: the AOPL US$50m Claim by GRIPT and the Negative Declaration Claim by the plaintiffs. AOPL applied to set aside the order granting leave for service out of jurisdiction, and in the alternative, a stay of the proceedings in favour of the Indian courts. As mentioned at the outset at [2], I refused to set aside the order for leave to serve the writ out of jurisdiction on AOPL. While I allowed the stay of proceedings in respect of the Negative Declaration Claim in favour of the Indian courts, the AOPL US$50m Claim is to remain in Singapore. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The AOPL US$50m Claim </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">79 In relation to the AOPL US$50m Claim, there were two key issues before me:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) whether the AOPL US$50m Claim may be taken into consideration for the application to set aside the service of the writ on AOPL; and </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) whether Singapore is the proper forum for the dispute.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Whether the AOPL US$50m Claim may be taken into consideration </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">80 It will be recalled that the AOPL US$50m Claim was a belated addition to the writ of summons and the statement of claim (see [61]–[62] above). A preliminary issue is whether the court has a discretion to take the AOPL US$50m Claim into consideration in the application to set aside the service of the writ out of jurisdiction, or whether the court must assess the application based only on the facts and claims as they existed at the time leave was granted. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">81 A similar point was canvassed in <span class="font-italic">IM Skaugen SE </span><span class="font-italic">and another v MAN Diesel &amp; Turbo SE</span> <span class="font-italic">and another</span> [2018] SGHC 123 (“<span class="font-italic">Skaugen</span><span class="font-italic"> (HC)</span>”), which was relied on by the plaintiffs. In <span class="font-italic">Skaugen</span><span class="font-italic"> (HC), </span>after the <span class="font-italic">ex parte </span>application for leave had been granted, but before the setting aside application was made, the plaintiffs had commenced concurrent proceedings – with the very same subject matter – in Norway against the defendants: <span class="font-italic">Skaugen (HC) </span>at [173]. Vinodh Coomaraswamy J held that, at the setting aside application, the court has a discretion to take into account evidence of events occurring <span class="font-italic">after</span> leave is granted <span class="font-italic">ex parte</span>: <span class="font-italic">Skaugen</span> <span class="font-italic">(HC)</span> at [190]. The court disagreed with the defendants’ argument that their setting aside application should be determined based on the facts as they existed at the time of the plaintiffs’ <span class="font-italic">ex parte </span>application for leave, and excluding consideration of the fact of the Norwegian proceedings, and the fact that proceedings in Germany were no longer available. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">82 In support of their argument before Coomaraswamy J, the defendants had cited the English authority of <span class="font-italic">ISC Technologies Ltd and another v James Howard Guerin and others </span>[1992] 2 Lloyd’s Rep 430 (“<span class="font-italic">ISC Technologies</span>”). However, the court instead preferred the competing line of English authorities rejecting the position in <span class="font-italic">ISC Technologies</span>: at [187]–[188]. The leading case in that line of cases was <span class="font-italic">NML Capital Ltd v Republic of Argentina </span>[2011] 2 AC 495 (“<span class="font-italic">NML Capital</span>”). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">83 In <span class="font-italic">NML Capital</span>, the claimant had obtained judgment in New York against the defendant in respect of a series of bonds issued by the defendant. The claimant sought to enforce the New York judgment in England, and, in the enforcement proceedings, sought leave for service out of jurisdiction. It was a requirement of the English Civil Procedure Rules that the claimant show, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, why the prospective defendant was “not absolutely immune from suit”, and the claimant argued that the defendant had contractually waived its right to assert state immunity. Leave was granted, and the defendant sought to set aside the order for leave on the ground that it enjoyed state immunity from the jurisdiction of the English courts. At the hearing of the setting aside application, the claimant conceded that the bases on which it had asserted that the defendant was not entitled to state immunity were erroneous. Instead, the claimant sought to rely on certain alternative grounds (the details of which I shall not set out). The defendant contended that it was not open to the claimant to invoke these alternative grounds for contending that immunity did not apply when these had not been relied on in the original <span class="font-italic">ex parte</span> application, and that the proper course was for the claimant to make a fresh application for leave. On appeal to the UK Supreme Court, Lord Phillips rejected the defendant’s procedural objection, holding that “procedural rules should be the servant not the master of the rule of law”, and that the overarching objective of the rules is to deal with cases expeditiously and efficiently (at [74]). Accordingly, where there is valid basis for subjecting an out-of-jurisdiction defendant to jurisdiction, it should not be mandatory for a claimant (seeking to invoke new grounds) to start again. Instead, the court has discretion as to the order that will best serve the overriding objective: <span class="font-italic">NML Capital </span>at [75].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">84 I also note that in an earlier case of <span class="font-italic">William Jacks &amp; Co (Singapore) </span><span class="font-italic">Pte Ltd v Nelson Honey &amp; Marketing (NZ) Ltd </span>[2015] SGHCR 21 (“<span class="font-italic">William Jacks</span>”), the assistant registrar relied on <span class="font-italic">NML Capital</span>, and held that, in the absence of any finding that the plaintiff’s conduct was an abuse of process, a new cause of action and/or an O 11 r 1 head of jurisdiction may be relied on by the plaintiff in a setting aside application. This is even if that new cause of action or O 11 r 1 head of jurisdiction was not relied upon in the <span class="font-italic">ex parte</span> application for service out of jurisdiction. In <span class="font-italic">Skaugen</span><span class="font-italic"> (HC)</span>, the court observed that <span class="font-italic">William Jacks</span> was different from <span class="font-italic">Skaugen</span><span class="font-italic"> (HC)</span> in that <span class="font-italic">William Jacks</span> did not involve new facts, but a new cause of action on the same existing facts (at [185]). Nevertheless, it affirmed the decision in <span class="font-italic">William Jacks</span>, noting that otherwise, costs and time would be wasted, whether by the plaintiff having to file a fresh originating process even where there is a good arguable case that his additional causes of action come within a head of jurisdiction in O 11 r 1 of the ROC, or by the defendant having to take out a second setting aside application based on the fresh originating process: <span class="font-italic">Skaugen</span><span class="font-italic"> (HC)</span> at [189]. The court remarked that the approach in <span class="font-italic">William Jacks </span>was subject to the court’s overarching power to prevent an abuse of process on the part of the plaintiff: <span class="font-italic">Skaugen</span><span class="font-italic"> (HC) </span>at [189], [193]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">85 Lastly, I note that <span class="font-italic">Skaugen (HC)</span>’s holding that the court is entitled, during setting aside applications, to take into account subsequent events has recently been endorsed by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Man Diesel &amp; Turbo SE and another v IM Skaugen SE and another </span>[2019] SGCA 80 (“<span class="font-italic">Skaugen (CA)</span>”) at [50]. Three reasons underpinned this – principle, coherence and policy (at [52]–[55]). </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) As a matter of principle, the approach in <span class="font-italic">Skaugen (HC) </span>furthers the objective of <span class="font-italic">forum non conveniens</span>, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, to select the more appropriate forum. This inquiry is a <span class="font-italic">dynamic</span> one. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) As a matter of consistency, subsequent events can be considered in stay applications, and there is no reason why the approach should be any different for setting aside applications – the same normative considerations in [85(a)] above apply to both applications.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) As a matter of policy, only subsequent developments that are relevant to the <span class="font-italic">forum non conveniens</span> analysis will be considered. In this connection, if parties “raise wholly unmeritorious matters on the pretext of them being ‘subsequent developments’ … the concept of abuse of process … would apply in its full force”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">86 Turning back to the present case, its facts are different from that in <span class="font-italic">Skaugen</span> <span class="font-italic">(HC) </span>as it did not concern new evidence occurring after leave is granted. The present case was more akin to the facts of <span class="font-italic">William Jacks</span> and <span class="font-italic">NML Capital</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>as it concerned a new cause of action and new arguments being relied on at the setting aside stage – which in this case were premised on facts which were known to the parties at the time the writ was filed, and based on evidence existing at the time of the writ. Nevertheless, the same reasoning as in <span class="font-italic">NML Capital</span><span class="font-italic">, Williams Jacks </span>and <span class="font-italic">Skaugen</span><span class="font-italic"> (HC)</span>, especially the <span class="font-italic">obiter</span> at [189] of <span class="font-italic">Skaugen</span><span class="font-italic"> (HC)</span> cited above, applied. To ignore the AOPL US$50m Claim would leave it open for the plaintiffs, upon the order for leave being set aside, to issue a fresh writ based on the additional cause of action, and then seek leave to serve that writ out of the jurisdiction. This circuitous route would only waste costs and time for the parties, which could be avoided if the court simply considered the additional cause of action at the hearing to set aside service of the writ. Furthermore, the reasoning supporting the consideration of subsequent events cited in <span class="font-italic">Skaugen (CA)</span> also supports the consideration of new causes of action: the inquiry at the setting aside stage for the more appropriate forum is a dynamic one; as long as the new causes of action are relevant and meritorious, they should be considered. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">87 Indeed, as stated above at [62]–[63], the plaintiffs had, by 29 June 2018, already obtained leave to amend the writ of summons and the statement of claim so as to include the AOPL US$50m Claim, and to serve the amended documents on AOPL and Mr Bhasi. It bears noting that this was well before the application to challenge jurisdiction filed by AOPL and Mr Bhasi on 13 July 2018, although a little after SBI’s application filed on 4 June 2018 to stay the proceedings on <span class="font-italic">forum non conveniens </span>grounds. In my view, there was no evidence to suggest that the addition of the AOPL US$50m Claim was an abuse of process on the part of the plaintiffs. The plaintiffs had sought to pursue this additional claim expeditiously, and, as stated below at [89(b)], there was a sufficient degree of merit to the claim. On the whole, it did not seem to me that the claim was only added so as to resist the jurisdictional challenges by SBI, AOPL and Mr Bhasi.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">88 Therefore, following <span class="font-italic">Skaugen</span><span class="font-italic"> (HC)</span>, I do not see any reason why the AOPL US$50m Claim should not be taken into consideration for the purposes of the setting aside application.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Whether Singapore is the proper forum for the claim </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">89 Before I turn to the natural forum issue, I briefly set out my views as to the other limbs of the <span class="font-italic">Zoom Communications</span> test (set out at [69] above). </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Limb (a) – a good arguable case on the heads of jurisdiction under O 11 r 1 of the ROC: AOPL did not contest this, and rightly so. It was clear that at least O 11 r 1(<span class="font-italic">d</span>)(iv) was made out (<span class="font-italic">ie, </span>the claim is brought to obtain relief in respect of a breach of contract, being a contract which contains a jurisdiction clause in favour of Singapore).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Limb (b) – that the claim has a sufficient degree of merit: AOPL submitted that the AOPL US$50m Claim was wholly without basis, and that the sums claimed were due from ACF rather than AOPL (see [46] above).

On AOPL’s case, this structure was devised entirely to evade Indian regulations on the inflow of foreign investment so that all involved might benefit from the interest arbitrage. This raised questions as to whether the overall string and structure of transactions (which included the AOPL-GRIPT Contract) would be void for illegality in the place of performance, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, India:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Indian foreign capital restrictions under its Foreign Exchange Management Act 1999 (“FEMA”) prohibited unauthorised payments into and out of India.

</div> On this front, the Indian courts were better placed to address these issues of Indian law, as these questions could not be meaningfully answered by a Singapore court, even with expert evidence, not least because the Singapore courts ought not to opine on such matters of Indian public policy, which the Indian courts had an interest in deciding. These factors, AOPL submitted, amounted to strong cause.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">104 I was unpersuaded by AOPL’s argument that these factors demonstrated strong cause. While the Indian regulations above may explain why the transactions were structured the way they were, they did not affect the specific dispute – which pertains to AOPL’s obligations under the AOPL-GRIPT Contract. More importantly, the parties were well aware of these Indian laws/regulations when they nevertheless agreed to the exclusive jurisdiction clause. As stated (see [73] above), factors within the contemplation of the parties at the time of contracting carry less weight in the determination of whether strong cause has been shown. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">105 I was likewise unpersuaded by AOPL’s argument that there was strong cause on the basis that the dispute involved a determination of illegality which, on account of public policy, should be left to the Indian courts. I note that neither AOPL nor Mr Bhasi adduced any expert evidence of Indian law to make good their point. Further, a similar argument was recently made to and rejected by the Court of Appeal. In <span class="font-italic">Trisuryo</span>, the Court of Appeal held that, when addressing the question of jurisdiction, “foreign illegality is generally a matter that should be considered when determining the substantive merits of the action” (at [61]). This is because adjudication of the existence of foreign illegality involves a judgment on the merits, a full hearing and findings of fact, for which the stay application would not be the appropriate forum.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">106 In any event, these do not amount to strong cause in light of the other factors taken in totality. One such factor was, as just mentioned, the fact that the governing law of the AOPL-GRIPT contract was Singapore law, as stipulated by its express choice of law clause. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-5 text-left">(D) Related proceedings / Shape of the litigation</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">107 Finally, I also considered the relationship between the AOPL US$50m Claim and the Negative Declaration Claim, the latter of which I decided to stay in favour of the courts in India (see [135] below). AOPL and Mr Bhasi argued that the AOPL US$50m Claim should, on that basis, also be decided in India because the 17172A Trade was relevant to the Kantawala Claim. In other words, the Singapore court should decline to exercise jurisdiction in relation to the AOPL US$50m Claim to prevent fragmentation of the proceedings, and the resulting duplication of time and costs.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">108 I disagreed. In my judgment, strong cause was not shown in respect of the AOPL US$50m Claim, regardless of whether the Negative Declaration Claim remained in Singapore or not. While the AOPL US$50m Claim was connected to some extent to the Negative Declaration Claim by way of their common background and factual matrix, the connection was not a crucial one. In particular, the Negative Declaration Claim would involve a determination of the fact and quality of the alleged Assurances given <span class="font-italic">in relation to Bunge’s alleged obligation to enter into rollover trades</span>, and had little to do with the string contracts and AOPL’s obligations arising thereunder. Hence, the mere fact that the Negative Declaration Claim will be litigated in India does not amount to strong cause justifying a stay of the AOPL US$50m Claim in breach of the parties’ agreement to litigate that claim in Singapore. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(2) Conclusion</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">109 In sum, AOPL failed to show strong cause as to why the court should allow it to breach its contractual agreement. For the foregoing reasons, I rejected the application to set aside the order for service out of jurisdiction, and I did not stay the proceedings in respect of the AOPL US$50m Claim. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The Negative Declaration Claim</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">110 I turn next to the Negative Declaration Claim, which was the plaintiffs’ claim against AOPL for a declaration of non-liability in respect of AOPL’s (prospective) Kantawala Claim. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">111 Given my finding that the plaintiffs had established basis for leave for service out of jurisdiction on AOPL based on the AOPL US$50m Claim, it was no longer necessary for me to deal with the question of whether the order for service out ought to be set aside. In the O 11 r 1 analysis, the court is concerned only with whether it has <span class="font-italic">some </span>basis for establishing personal jurisdiction over the foreign defendant. Once the existence of personal jurisdiction is established over a particular defendant, as was the case here, it seems to me that the question is whether the court would, in its discretion, decline to exercise its personal jurisdiction over that defendant in respect of a particular claim because, for example, there is another more appropriate forum for that claim. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">112 Therefore, the key issue before me was whether Singapore is the proper forum for the dispute (which I analyse under the rubric of whether a stay of proceedings should be granted). In addition, I also considered the question as to whether the claim for a declaration of non-liability serves a useful purpose (or is an illegitimate attempt at forum-shopping). I answered both issues in the negative, and granted a stay of the proceedings in favour of the courts in India on grounds that Singapore was <span class="font-italic">forum non conveniens</span>.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Stay on </span>forum non conveniens<span class="font-italic"> grounds</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(1) Stage 1</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">113 In my judgment, AOPL had discharged its burden at the first stage of the <span class="font-italic">Spiliada</span> test (see [67] above) in showing that there was another available forum abroad that was clearly more appropriate than the Singapore forum, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, India.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">114 The connecting factors tied this dispute closely to India.

</div>
</div> – against AOPL. On the plaintiffs’ own case, the central issues were (a) whether the plaintiffs had given the alleged Assurances so as to give rise to a binding obligation to continue to maintain a certain volume of trade with AOPL (to enable it to roll-over the deposits with SBI); and (b) if so, what loss AOPL had suffered by the plaintiffs’ failure to keep those Assurances. On the facts before me, it seemed to me likely that Indian law would apply in determining whether any such assurances (if given) would have contractual effect. While the contracts between GRIPT and AOPL were governed by Singapore law, or subject to the jurisdiction of Singapore courts, the other legs of the transaction were governed by Indian law (the AOPL-ACF leg) or English law (the ACF-BSA leg). However, unlike the AOPL US$50m Claim, which was focused exclusively on the AOPL-GRIPT Contract, the Kantawala Claim was founded on Assurances pertaining to the overarching relationship between the parties. That relationship was born of dealings in India, using Indian intermediaries and Indian banks, and involving funds kept in Indian bank accounts. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">115 In respect of a potential tortious claim, the <span class="font-italic">lex loci delicti</span> would be the governing law, and it was important therefore to identify the place of the tort. In all probability, this would be India. The plaintiffs submitted that the authority to make such assurances could only validly originate from the Singapore “hub”, and the witnesses relevant to that issue would be members of Bunge senior management in Singapore. However, the very fact of any Assurances being made at all was disputed by the plaintiffs as well. Despite the lack of particulars regarding the surrounding facts, from the evidence before me, it appeared that the Assurances were made in India and/or Geneva, but <span class="font-italic">not</span> in Singapore (see [41(c)] above). The factual question of the Assurances being made was hence more closely linked with the India “spoke”, even if the “hub” was in Singapore. I noted also that on the plaintiffs’ own case, the Assurances would have emanated from Mr Bhasi (who was at the time largely based in India) and would have been received by AOPL in India. These factors pointed in favour of India as well.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">116 I also noted the presence of other proceedings related to the Negative Declaration Claim. While the AOPL US$50m Claim was somewhat connected to the Negative Declaration Claim by way of their common background, the connection was not a crucial one. I refer to [108] above, and reiterate that the key facts disputed in the Negative Declaration Claim were separate and distinct. The Negative Declaration Claim related more to the fact and quality of the alleged Assurances given, and less to the specific contracts entered into by the parties. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">117 The Indemnity Claim against Mr Bhasi was arguably more factually intertwined with the Negative Declaration Claim. However, as explained below, I found that the Indemnity Claim should properly be referred to arbitration. It was therefore not a relevant consideration in favour of Singapore or Indian courts. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">118 Therefore, at Stage 1, Singapore was not clearly the more appropriate forum. Instead, on the facts, India was a forum which was clearly more appropriate. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(2) Stage 2</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">119 At Stage 2, the plaintiffs failed to discharge their burden to show that justice nevertheless required that a stay should not be granted. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">120 The plaintiffs had relied on the alleged prejudice and injustice that would result if its claims were to proceed in India due to the substantial delays in the Indian courts.

</div> Even if there might have been substantial delays in the courts of India in the past, due recognition should be given to the efforts made in recent years to reduce the backlog of cases. In any event, the principle of international comity demands that due deference be accorded to a foreign sovereign. The courts have shown general hesitance to “stigmatise [a foreign] legal system” by holding that delays in the foreign courts are so egregious as to amount to substantial injustice: <span class="font-italic">Konamaneni and others v Rolls Royce Industrial Power (India) Ltd and others </span>[2002] 1 WLR 1269 at [177]. Given the evidence that was before me, I did not see a compelling reason to breach the principle of comity.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">127 Besides the factor of delay, the plaintiffs did not raise any other requirements of justice that demanded the Negative Declaration Claim be heard in Singapore.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Utility of a claim for a declaration of non-liability</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">128 Quite apart from the question of whether Singapore was the natural forum for the claim (which I have determined in the negative), in the context of claims for declarations of non-liability, it has also been suggested that the court ought to consider and ensure that the negative declaration is sought for a valuable purpose and is not an illegitimate attempt to pre-empt the jurisdiction in which the dispute between the parties is to be resolved: <span class="font-italic">New Hampshire Insurance Company v Phillips Electronics North America Corporation</span> [1998] ILPr 256 (“<span class="font-italic">New Hampshire</span>”) at [13]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Where leave to serve out of the jurisdiction a writ claiming a negative declaration is challenged, the court will have to consider both the question of whether there is justification for seeking that relief and the separate question of whether England is the appropriate forum in which to seek it. The two questions will, however, cover common ground where the possibility exists that the plaintiff in the English proceedings will be sued by the defendant in an alternative jurisdiction. It is in that situation that the court must be particularly careful to ensure that the negative declaration is sought for a valid and valuable purpose and not in an illegitimate attempt to pre-empt the jurisdiction in which the dispute between the parties is to be resolved.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">129 This principle has received consideration in our courts. In <span class="font-italic">Mizuho Corporate Bank Ltd v Cho Hung Bank</span> [2004] 4 SLR(R) 67 (“<span class="font-italic">Mizuho</span>”), the defendant sought a stay of the Singapore proceedings based on a letter of credit it issued for the purchase of a cargo of gas oil. Arguing that South Korea was the more appropriate forum, the defendant had commenced proceedings in South Korea for a negative declaration of liability under the letter of credit. The court rejected the argument, and noted that claims for negative declarations “must be viewed with great caution in all situations involving possible conflicts of jurisdictions since they obviously lend themselves to improper attempts at forum shopping” (at [13]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">130 The position now seems more nuanced. I refer to Prof Yeo Tiong Min’s commentary on this point in <span class="font-italic">Halsbury’s Singapore </span>at para 75.100:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">It used to be thought that a claim for a negative declaration (a declaration of non-liability) was to be discouraged in itself as a tool used for forum shopping, and as such it was to be viewed with grave suspicion. The more modern thinking is that it can be a legitimate defensive tool, even if used to establish jurisdiction. It is jurisdictionally neutral device in the sense that the defendant who uses it to establish jurisdiction in a forum is in no different position from a plaintiff who establishes jurisdiction in a forum by commencing proceedings. Thus, from the substantive point of view, <span class="font-italic">a negative declaration could be granted so long as it serves a useful purpose, and the court will scrutinise carefully the utility of the declaration sought. From a jurisdictional point of view, the remedy sought will be scrutinised carefully to ensure that the party seeking it was not merely forum shopping. To this end, the imminence of foreign proceedings is a highly relevant factor to consider in answering both questions</span>. … [emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">131 It would therefore seem that the inherent suspicion with which claims for negative declarations were treated has now given way to a test based on the <span class="font-italic">utility</span> of the declaration sought. If it can be shown that the negative declaration serves a “useful purpose”, that would ordinarily suffice to show that the party seeking it was not merely forum-shopping. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">132 This brings us to the question of what constitutes a “useful purpose”. I suggest that the following considerations are relevant:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) One example of a negative declaration having a useful purpose is where the person against whom it is sought is “temporising” (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, is not prepared to come forward and make his claim). Then, it may be proper for the plaintiff to “force the issue” by bringing a negative declaration claim, to “fix the timing and venue of litigation”: <span class="font-italic">Bristow Helicopters Ltd v Sikorsky Aircraft Corpn</span> [2004] EWHC 401 (Comm) (“<span class="font-italic">Bristow Helicopters</span>”) at [25].</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Relatedly, the existence of imminent or, <span class="font-italic">a fortiori</span>, current foreign proceedings would be a highly relevant consideration. If foreign proceedings have already been commenced by the natural plaintiff, there is arguably less utility to the hearing of a claim for a negative declaration in the forum. It would also seem more likely that the party seeking the negative declaration seeks to do so only as a means of forum-shopping, to pre-empt the foreign proceedings: <span class="font-italic">New Hampshire </span>at [13].</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Generally, a negative declaration will not be appropriate where it is premature or hypothetical, <span class="font-italic">viz</span>, where no claim has been made or threatened against the plaintiff: <span class="font-italic">New Hampshire </span>at [9].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">133 Applying the above, I was of the view that the plaintiffs had failed to establish that their Negative Declaration Claim had any “useful purpose”. The thrust of the plaintiffs’ argument in this regard was that the threat of suit from AOPL was a real and imminent one, relying on the same key facts at [168] below.

</div> While I accepted that the threat of the Kantawala Claim being brought was a real one, the <span class="font-italic">imminence</span> of the action in fact worked to the plaintiffs’ <span class="font-italic">disadvantage</span> here. As mentioned, in determining whether the Negative Declaration Claim had utility, the following considerations are strongly indicative: (a) where there is a real, and not purely hypothetical, threat of proceedings (see [132(c)] above); and (b) where the natural plaintiff (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, AOPL) had been temporising. In my view, the haste with which the plaintiffs had commenced Suit 438 – which included the Negative Declaration Claim – was telling (see also [41]–[42] above): </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The Kantawala Letter was sent on 16 March 2018. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Bunge’s reply to the Kantawala Letter was sent on 27 March 2018, in which it essentially gave a holding response – the reply stated that Bunge was “conducting an investigation into the facts raised”, and requested that AOPL “bear with [Bunge] while [it] consider[ed] [its] legal position” as it could not respond within the 15-day deadline stipulated in the Kantawala Letter.

This was not a case where, like in <span class="font-italic">Bristow Helicopters</span>, AOPL had been “temporising” for some time, or had clearly indicated that it was not intending to come forward to make its claim. While I accept that AOPL has, to date, not yet commenced proceedings in India in respect of the Kantawala Claim, that does not detract from the fact that <span class="font-italic">at the time the plaintiffs commenced </span><span class="font-italic">Suit 438</span>, there was absolutely no indication that AOPL would not be proceeding with its claim.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">135 I therefore held that there was no “useful purpose” to the negative declaration sought by the plaintiffs.

In particular, two sets of breaches are complained of – the Agency Breach Claim and the Indemnity Claim (see [43(d)] above). As mentioned at [63] above, Mr Bhasi sought to set aside service of the writ endorsed with these claims, or a stay of the proceedings in favour of the Indian courts, or to stay the claims in favour of arbitration pursuant to the arbitration clauses in the GRIPT Agency Agreements. In sum, I granted a stay of the proceedings in favour of arbitration. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Setting aside of order to serve out of jurisdiction</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">137 There was some dispute as to which GRIPT Agency Agreement applied to the two claims against Mr Bhasi (see [182]–[184] below). I was of the view that the application to set aside should be rejected regardless of which GRIPT Agency Agreement applied. For any claim under the 1st GRIPT Agency Agreement, the connecting factors pointed towards Singapore, and for any claim under the 2nd GRIPT Agency Agreement, strong cause would need to be shown, and was not shown by Mr Bhasi as to why he should be allowed to breach his agreement. I now turn to the key issues before me which concerned:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) whether Singapore is the proper forum for the dispute, based on either of the GRIPT Agency Agreements;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) whether any of the O 11 r 1 grounds are satisfied; and </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) whether there is a case of sufficient merit. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">1st GRIPT Agency Agreement</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">138 The unique feature of the 1st GRIPT Agency Agreement was that it appeared on its face to contain both an arbitration clause and a non-exclusive jurisdiction clause.

In particular, the question was whether one of the two took precedence over the other, and if so, which clause had primacy. This would determine the applicable test for the setting aside application. If the parties had indeed agreed to submit to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of Singapore, that would mean that the plaintiffs had been promised Mr Bhasi’s submission if and when claims were brought against him in the courts of Singapore. Accordingly, any challenge to the Singapore courts’ jurisdiction – whether in the form of a setting aside or stay application – would amount to an attempt to be released from the non-exclusive jurisdiction clause, and Mr Bhasi would have to show strong cause to succeed: <span class="font-italic">Shanghai Turbo </span>at<span class="font-italic"> </span>[85]–[86] and [91] (see [71] above).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">140 The plaintiffs’ position was that cll 11.2 and 13, read together, merely gave the parties the option to <span class="font-italic">mutually</span> agree to refer certain matters to arbitration, without excluding either party’s right to elect to bring proceedings in Singapore (or any other forum having jurisdiction) instead of pursuing arbitration.

</div> In his arguments, Mr Bhasi relied on the decision of <span class="font-italic">PT</span> <span class="font-italic">Tri-MG Intra Asia Airlines v Norse Air Charter Limited </span>[2009] SGHC 13 (“<span class="font-italic">Norse Air</span>”).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">142  In <span class="font-italic">Norse Air</span>, the contract in question was much like that in the present case – it contained, on its face, an agreement to arbitrate under the heading “Arbitration” as well as a jurisdiction clause under the heading “Governing Law and Jurisdiction”. After undertaking a survey of the position in other jurisdictions, the assistant registrar in <span class="font-italic">Norse Air </span>adopted the English approach and held that the two seemingly contradictory clauses could be reconciled by reading the purported jurisdiction clause as a submission to the Singapore court’s supervisory jurisdiction over the arbitration. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">143 This approach –<span class="font-italic"> </span>where the jurisdiction clause was construed as a reference to the law governing the arbitration, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the curial law or the <span class="font-italic">lex arbitri</span> – was in my view well-founded both as a matter of principle and authority. The landmark case on this subject is the English High Court decision of <span class="font-italic">Paul Smith Ltd v</span><span class="font-italic"> H &amp; S International Holding Inc </span>[1991] 2 Lloyd’s Rep 127 (“<span class="font-italic">Paul Smith</span>”). In <span class="font-italic">Paul Smith</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>the licensing agreement contained an arbitration clause entitled “Settlement of Disputes”, by which it was agreed that any disputes shall be adjudicated upon under the Rules of Conciliation and Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce (“ICC”). The agreement also contained an exclusive jurisdiction clause entitled “Language and Law”, which provided that “[t]he courts of England shall have exclusive jurisdiction <span class="font-italic">over it</span> to which jurisdiction the parties hereby submit” [emphasis added in <span class="font-italic">Paul Smith</span>]. In that case, the Court of Arbitration of the ICC had confirmed London as the place of arbitration. On its face, the court acknowledged that it was clear that the phrase “over it” referred to the agreement between the parties. However, the court held that it should be construed as referring to curial law instead because treating the arbitration clause to be <span class="font-italic">pro non scripto</span> (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, as though it were not written) would be unattractive in the context of an international commercial contract. The same approach has been subsequently applied by the English High Court: see <span class="font-italic">Shell International Petroleum Co Ltd v Coral Oil Co Ltd </span>[1999] 1 Lloyd’s Rep 72; <span class="font-italic">Axa Re v Ace Global Markets Limited </span>[2006] EWHC 216 (Comm); <span class="font-italic">McConnell Dowell Constructors (Aust) Pty Ltd v National Grid Gas plc </span>[2006] EWHC 2551 (TCC).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">144 I noted that the approach in <span class="font-italic">Paul Smith</span> seems to be the prevailing view and has been described as a “sensible, if somewhat inventive” approach to the interpretation of what was, in truth, two competing and contradictory dispute settlement clauses (Gary B Born, <span class="font-italic">International Commercial Arbitration</span> (Kluwer Law International, 2nd Ed, 2014) at pp 784–787):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">A related problem arises from ill-drafted provisions that provide both an arbitration mechanism and a choice-of-court clause. … </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">In a frequently-cited English case, [<span class="font-italic">Paul Smith</span>], one clause of a contract provided that any disputes ‘shall be adjudicated [<span class="font-italic">sic</span>] upon’ under the ICC Rules of Arbitration, while another clause provided that the ‘Courts of England shall have exclusive jurisdiction.’ The court reached the sensible, if somewhat inventive, conclusion that the reference to English courts was only a designation of the courts with supervisory jurisdiction … thereby giving full effect to the unhappily-worded arbitration clause. …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Decisions by national courts in other jurisdictions and arbitral awards are to the same effect, generally seeking to give effect to clauses that refer to both arbitration and national court proceedings. In most cases, courts and arbitral tribunals interpret references to national court proceedings narrowly to include only review of the arbitral award or some other type of judicial assistance for the arbitral process.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">145 The plaintiffs argued that the present case should be distinguished from that in <span class="font-italic">Norse Air</span>: the arbitration clause in <span class="font-italic">Norse Air</span> incorporated the Rules of Conciliation and Arbitration of the ICC, which do not specify the seat of the arbitration. There was therefore a gap in the arbitration clause. The plaintiffs argued that the assistant registrar considered the non-exclusive jurisdiction clause in <span class="font-italic">Norse Air </span>as a clause intended by the parties to fill the gap in the arbitration agreement, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, to specify the seat of the arbitration. Clause 13 of the 1st GRIPT Agency Agreement in the present case referred to the Singapore International Arbitration Centre (“SIAC”) Rules. While the precise edition of the SIAC Rules is not contractually specified, the versions in force at the time of contracting until the expiry of the agreement all provide for Singapore as the default seat of arbitration. Therefore, it could not have been the parties’ intention for cl 11.2 of the 1st GRIPT Agency Agreement to refer to a submission to the Singapore court’s supervisory jurisdiction over the arbitration when that has already been provided for by the reference to the SIAC Rules 2016.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">146 In my judgment, the approach taken in <span class="font-italic">Norse Air</span> was applicable to the present case. In construing agreements, the court should strive to give effect to all clauses in a contract. In this regard, infelicity in the contractual language will have to be endured, especially if the consequence of not doing so would be to disregard the existence of an arbitration clause: <span class="font-italic">Ace Capital Ltd v CMS Energy Corporation </span>[2008] EWHC 1843 (Comm) at [95]–[96], cited in <span class="font-italic">Norse Air </span>at [40]. In the present circumstances, the <span class="font-italic">Norse Air </span>approach balanced these considerations. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">147 For completeness, I should add that I was not persuaded by the plaintiffs’ objections at [145] above. For one, the court in <span class="font-italic">Norse Air</span> did not cite “gap-filling” as the basis for its decision. The key concern which drove the court’s reasoning was the need to reconcile the inconsistency, while giving effect to the intentions of the parties to the contract in a way which made commercial sense. I pause here to refer to <span class="font-italic">BXH v BXI</span> [2019] SGHC 141 (“<span class="font-italic">BXH</span>”), which was decided after I gave my decision but which warrants mention. In <span class="font-italic">BXH</span>, the court was similarly faced with a contract containing both an arbitration clause which referred to the SIAC Rules (and which in fact expressly stated that the arbitration was to be “held in Singapore”), as well as an exclusive jurisdiction clause in favour of the Singapore courts. The court endorsed and applied the <span class="font-italic">Norse Air </span>approach, noting that that approach, whilst “not perfect”, was the only practical approach to the interpretation of those seemingly contradictory clauses (<span class="font-italic">BXH </span>at [242]–[243]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">148 I also rejected the plaintiff’s proposed interpretation as set out at [140] above; <span class="font-italic">viz</span>, that cll 11.2 and 13 should be read as providing alternatives from which the plaintiffs could elect, citing <span class="font-italic">Dyna-Jet</span> <span class="font-italic">(CA)</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>(see [140] above). <span class="font-italic">Dyna-Jet</span><span class="font-italic"> (CA)</span> concerned an arbitration clause which permitted one of the parties to elect to refer the dispute to arbitration, and this was made clear by the permissive language of the clause: "If no amicable settlement is reached through discussions, at the election of Dyna-Jet, the dispute <span class="font-italic">may</span> be referred to and personally settled by means of arbitration proceedings, …” [emphasis in original omitted, emphasis added in italics].

In this regard, since AOPL’s profits were obtained by way of interest earned on the fixed deposits placed in SBI, if the merchanting trade contracts which facilitated these profits are found to have breached RBI’s Circular 115 and are therefore held void <span class="font-italic">ab initio</span>, then there would be no profits to speak of (see [102] above).

Further, I did not consider the Bunge-AOPL merchanting trade structure to be at the centre of the Agency Breach Claim. Instead, the key issues were Mr Bhasi’s interest in AOPL and what constituted a waiver of breach under the No Conflict Terms which turns on the proper interpretation of those terms (see [58(b)] above). In this regard, I considered it significant that the parties had agreed in the 1st GRIPT Agency Agreement that the agency relationship was to be governed by Singapore law, and that Singapore courts were to have a supervisory role pursuant to cl 11.2. As regards the Letter of Arrangement, it was purely speculation on Mr Bhasi’s part that the Letter of Arrangement would necessarily be governed by Indian law despite no express stipulation to that effect, and accordingly I placed little weight on it. In any case, I agreed with the plaintiffs’ submission that even if Indian law was the <span class="font-italic">lex situs</span>, it did not follow that an Indian court had to determine the case.

In determining whether Bunge could have waived any breach of the No Conflict Terms, the crucial question was one of attribution of knowledge (<span class="font-italic">eg</span>, see <span class="font-italic">Ho Kang Peng</span> <span class="font-italic">v Scintronix Corp Ltd (formerly known as TTL Holdings Ltd</span> [2014] 3 SLR 329 at [47]–[48]). As the plaintiffs rightly pointed out, Mr Subramaniam was unlikely to be a relevant witness because he was not a decision-maker on behalf of GRIPT or BSA.

All that Mr Bhasi had done was to seek as one of two potential reliefs, that the proceedings be stayed in favour of the Indian courts (the other being a stay in favour of arbitration). Mr Bhasi’s primary prayer ultimately challenged the very existence of the Singapore courts’ jurisdiction. The fact that he did not expressly caveat that his request for a stay in favour of the Indian courts was without prejudice to his alternative request for a stay in favour of arbitration did not mean that he intended to abandon his right to arbitrate in favour of litigation in India.

Proceedings will be stayed in favour of arbitration if the claim arose out of, or is more closely connected with the contract which contains the arbitration clause, even if the other competing jurisdiction agreement was wide enough, on a literal reading, to cover the dispute: <span class="font-italic">Oei Hong Leong v Goldman Sachs International</span> [2014] 3 SLR 1217 (“<span class="font-italic">Oei Hong Leong</span>”)<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [25]–[26], citing <span class="font-italic">Transocean Offshore International Ventures Ltd v Burgundy Global Exploration Corp </span>[2010] 3 SLR 821 at [26].

However, in this regard, 425 of the total of 534 transactions entered into fell within the period covered by the 1st GRIPT Agency Agreement and 109 transactions fell within the period covered by the 2nd GRIPT Agency Agreement.

In this regard, I noted the following:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) A far larger proportion of the period during which Mr Bhasi was allegedly acting in conflict of interest, and the vast majority of transactions tainted by the said conflict of interest (425 out of 534), fell to be covered by the 1st GRIPT Agency Agreement.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) As regards the nature of the breach, the alleged breach was a <span class="font-italic">continuing</span> one, and should not be characterised as separate breaches simply because of the splicing of time periods by the 1st and 2nd GRIPT Agency Agreements. The pith and substance of the Agency Breach Claim related to events occurring within the period covered by the 1st GRIPT Agency Agreement – the dates of the alleged acquisition of interest in AOPL and the Agreement of Share Transfer fell within that period. In respect of the false representations allegedly made by Mr Bhasi (see [55] above), while the dates of all these representations have not been enumerated, the plaintiffs had relied on answers given by Mr Bhasi during the 3 December 2015 Interview (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, within the period covered by the 1st GRIPT Agency Agreement).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">188 Accordingly, taken in totality, the Agency Breach Claim against Mr Bhasi was more closely connected with the 1st GRIPT Agency Agreement.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">189 I turn next to the Indemnity Claim. According to Mr Bhasi, since this claim was factually predicated on the Kantawala Letter which contained allegations as to events around the first quarter of 2015, the Assurances which Mr Bhasi was alleged to have given would have been given during that same time. The relevant breach would accordingly have been that of the No Authority Terms in the 1st GRIPT Agency Agreement.

SBI sought to show that India was clearly or distinctly the more appropriate forum for the trial on the SBI IPU Claim. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">196 The 15 December 2015 IPU did not have any jurisdiction clause, and hence the standard <span class="font-italic">Spiliada </span>test applied.

</div> SBI further pointed out that at that time of the hearing of RA 227, it had not yet been decided whether the various claims against AOPL should be heard in Singapore. Therefore, the court should not (a) assume the claims against AOPL are to be determined in Singapore; and (b) on that basis, determine that the SBI IPU claim should also be tried in Singapore to prevent the multiplicity of proceedings that would arise.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">198 At the outset, I noted that there would not be any arbitrary assumption being made that the AOPL US$50m Claim would be heard in Singapore, given that the matter was decided on its own merits before me at the same time. More importantly, it was important to understand the thrust of the holding in <span class="font-italic">PT Hu</span><span class="font-italic">tan</span>. The court in <span class="font-italic">PT </span><span class="font-italic">Hutan</span> took pains to stress that it did not really matter whether the <span class="font-italic">Spilia</span><span class="font-italic">da</span> test was considered a two-stage process or one-stage process. The ultimate question that had to be answered was where the case should be suitably tried having regard to the interests of the parties and the ends of justice: <span class="font-italic">PT Hutan </span>at [17]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">199 In any event, I was of the view that even if at Stage 1 of the <span class="font-italic">Spiliada</span> analysis, the issue of the multiplicity of proceedings that would arise if the SBI IPU Claim were to be heard in India (while the AOPL US$50m Claim remained in Singapore) was not considered, the connecting factors relied on by SBI were insufficient to show that India was clearly or distinctly more appropriate than Singapore for the determination of the claim.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">200 In the SBI IPU Claim, the key issue between the parties was whether SBI could rely on the revocation instructions from AOPL and oral confirmations of the same from Bunge representatives, Ms Jadhav and Mr Ambujakshan, so as to release the money to AIT and not to GRIPT. I refer to the respective contentions above at [48] and [49]. On SBI’s case, the confirmations validly emanated from the Indian spoke of Bunge. On GRIPT’s case, the confirmations from Bunge were denied. However, if they were indeed made, they could only have validly emanated from the Singapore “hub”. In this regard, the issues were twofold: (a) whether AOPL, Mr Ambujakshan and Ms Jadhav in fact made those representations; and (b) whether Mr Ambujakshan and Ms Jadhav were authorised to make those representations to SBI that it had been released from its obligations under the 15 December 2015 IPU by Bunge. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">201 As in the AOPL US$50m Claim, the former question was more closely linked to the “spoke” in India, and the latter may be more closely linked to the “hub” in Singapore. In particular, as SBI submitted in relation to the former question, it was Bunge’s representatives in India who dealt with SBI at all material times, while none of the Singaporean staff of Bunge communicated with SBI at all material times.

</div> However, I considered the former factor to be neutral (as it was neither Singapore or Indian law). I gave little to no weight to the latter factor – the String Sale contracts had peripheral relevance to the SBI IPU Claim, given that they were not the basis on which this claim was founded. The heart of the disputed issues in relation to this claim also did not turn on the interpretation of those agreements. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">204 I also noted SBI’s submission that SBI’s documents relevant to the SBI IPU Claim were located in India.

Also, there was no need to proceed to Stage 2 of the <span class="font-italic">Spiliada </span>analysis. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">206 Nonetheless, for completeness, I would add that on a holistic analysis of the SBI IPU Claim, the fact that the AOPL US$50m Claim was to be heard in Singapore made it overwhelmingly clear that Singapore was the natural forum for the SBI IPU Claim to be heard. While the AOPL US$50m Claim was a separate and distinct claim, the factual issues were intricately intertwined with those in the SBI IPU Claim. In order to prevent inconsistent findings from any concurrent proceedings, and to save inconvenience, time and costs, there was even more reason that they should be heard together. With AOPL remaining a party in the proceedings relating to the AOPL US$50m Claim, key witnesses of AOPL would be available in Singapore – including Mr Ambujakshan, who was now an employee of AOPL (see above at [98]) – for the purposes of dealing with the SBI IPU Claim. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">207 In sum, I was of the view that SBI did not discharge its burden of showing that India was clearly or distinctly the more appropriate forum for the trial of the SBI IPU Claim. Accordingly, I dismissed RA 227.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">208 The outcome of the matters was as follows:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Prayer 1 of SUM 3235 was dismissed, and the order granting leave to serve out of jurisdiction was not set aside;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Prayer 2 of SUM 3235 was granted in part, in that the Negative Declaration Claim was to be stayed in favour of Indian jurisdiction; </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Prayer 3 of SUM 3235 was granted, in that the Agency Breach Claim and the Indemnity Claim against Mr Bhasi were to be stayed in in favour of arbitration pursuant to s 6 of the IAA and the court’s inherent power of case management; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) The AOPL US$50m Claim and the SBI IPU Claim were to remain in Singapore, with RA 227 dismissed.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">209 The fragmentation of the proceedings was indeed unfortunate. However, in no small part, this arose from the various jurisdiction and arbitration agreements between the parties which had to be given effect. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">210 For SUM 3235, I fixed the total costs at S$50,000, being S$12,500 in relation to each of the four claims. I then apportioned the costs as follows:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) For the plaintiffs, I apportioned S$20,000 out of S$50,000: comprising of S$12,500 for succeeding fully in arguing for the AOPL US$50m Claim to remain in Singapore, and S$7,500 for succeeding in resisting the setting aside of the service of the writ out of jurisdiction in relation to the three other claims under Prayer 1 (being S$2,500 for each of the three other claims). </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) For the defendants, I apportioned S$30,000 out of S$50,000: S$10,000 for each claim successfully stayed on various grounds – <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the Negative Declaration Claim, the Agency Breach Claim and the Indemnity Claim.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">211 The net outcome was that the defendants were awarded S$10,000 as costs for the application. Similarly, I allowed the defendants one-fifth of the disbursements (including the experts’ fees) which amounted to S$4,370. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">212 As for RA 227, I ordered costs of S$12,000 to be paid by SBI to GRIPT, with disbursements to be agreed if not taxed.</div><div class="Judg-Sign text-left">Hoo Sheau Peng  <br/>Judge</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Ang Hui Ming Vivian, Yap Yin Soon, Ho Pey Yann, Dorcas Seah Yi Hui and Douglas Lok Bao Guang (Allen &amp; Gledhill LLP) for the 1st and 2nd plaintiffs;<br/>Gary Leonard Low, Vikram Ranjan Ramasamy, Priya d/o Gobal and Kellyn Lee Miao Qian (Drew &amp; Napier LLC) for the 1st defendant;<br/></div><div class="Judg-Quote-List text-justify"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
