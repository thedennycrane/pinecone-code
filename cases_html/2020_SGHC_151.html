However, he was informed by the Appointed Agents that he had to obtain approval from the Land Dealings Approval Unit (“LDAU”) of the Singapore Land Authority (“SLA”) in order to do so, as he was a “foreign person” for the purposes of the RPA. The Appointed Agents also advised Tejinder that acquiring Singapore permanent resident (“PR”) status was a prerequisite for the LDAU application. Tejinder thus proceeded to apply for PR status on 15 June 2006.

Notwithstanding his attempts to discredit Quah’s version of the 20 October 2006 Call, the plaintiff’s own account of the conversation remained uncorroborated by the objective evidence on record. Ultimately, I found that the plaintiff was, as the defendants asserted, “none the wiser” as to what had actually transpired during the 20 October 2006 Call.

According to the defendants, the inclusion of the word “nominee” in the 27 October 2006 Letter was inconclusive, as the term had been used (as it was commonly used in conveyancing parlance) “to indicate that the Plaintiff was nominated by Tejinder to purchase the Property in place of him”, and “not… in relation to and/or in connection with any purported trust arrangement between the Plaintiff and Tejinder”.

In my view, the second defendant’s explanation (that she had used the word “nominee” loosely because she had already apprised the Vendors’ solicitors of its intended meaning in a separate conversation) was not implausible. It was also supported by the first sentence of the 27 October 2006 Letter, which read: “We refer to the teleconversation between our Ms Yasmin Binte Abdullah and your Ms Jennifer Lim this afternoon”.

</div> Even if the Alleged October Meeting had taken place in mid-October (and not 22 or 23 October as the plaintiff subsequently alleged), the second defendant would have had at least a few days to familiarise herself with Tejinder’s matter. Given that the second defendant was not a novice to conveyancing law, it was reasonable to conclude that the second defendant would have been well-placed to speak to Tejinder and/or the plaintiff about their matter <span class="font-italic">in the event </span>that the Alleged October Meeting had actually taken place. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 Second, the contention that the second defendant ought to have known that the Nominee Arrangement was illegal because of her conveyancing experience was premised on circular reasoning and did not advance the defendants’ case very far. The crucial question for present purposes was not whether the second defendant should have known, but whether she <span class="font-italic">actually knew </span>that the Nominee Arrangement was unlawful at the time of the Alleged October Meeting. The second defendant’s experience as a conveyancing solicitor was only tangentially relevant, if at all, to this inquiry. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 Thirdly, the fact that the second defendant did not draw up the requisite trust documents was likewise equivocal. As the plaintiff pointed out, there was no evidence to suggest that either Tejinder or the plaintiff would have wanted such documents to be drawn up. During cross-examination, Tejinder averred that he did not see “any risk at all” in allowing the plaintiff to purchase the Property in his name since he and the plaintiff were “like… brother[s]”

According to the defendants, the existence of the Alleged October Meeting would mean that the following three events had<span class="font-italic"> all</span> taken place between the night of 19 October 2006 and the afternoon of 20 October 2006: (a) Tejinder meeting with the second defendant at the first defendant’s office to discuss whether the plaintiff could act as Tejinder’s nominee; (b) Tejinder meeting with the plaintiff at either Tejinder’s or the plaintiff’s place to discuss the advice given by the second defendant to Tejinder; and (c) the plaintiff and Tejinder meeting with the second defendant at the first defendant’s office for the Alleged October Meeting. The defendants contended that, given the short time frame involved, it was highly implausible that “there were 3 different meetings – two of which … could only have happened during office working hours – that required Tejinder to travel back and forth to the respective meetings [<span class="font-italic">sic</span>] locations”.

</div>
</div> it did not go so far as to suggest that this discussion took place during a <span class="font-italic">physical </span>meeting. Furthermore, although the plaintiff’s answer to Question 2(a)(iii) of the defendants’ Request for Further and Better Particulars dated 1 June 2016 stated the location at which Tejinder “sought … legal advice” from the defendants as “the 1st Defendant’s office”, I found that this answer was only intended to denote the location of the Alleged October Meeting, and <span class="font-italic">not </span>the location of the parties’ prior discussion. If the plaintiff’s “discussion” with the second defendant had indeed taken place over the telephone (as alleged by the plaintiff), and not in person, then it was not inherently improbable that all three events outlined at [60] above could have taken place within a short span of time. I was therefore unable to place significant weight on the defendants’ submissions on this point. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 Notwithstanding the above considerations, I was of the view that the objective evidence on record clearly weighed in favour of a finding that the Alleged October Meeting did not take place. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 First, it was telling that <span class="font-italic">the second defendant was not mentioned </span><span class="font-italic">at all</span> in <span class="font-italic">any</span> of the parties’ October 2006 correspondence. In his closing submissions, the plaintiff sought to justify this conspicuous absence by referring to Quah’s explanation that it was the first defendant’s practice not to copy lawyers in their correspondence with clients.

</div> However, even if Tejinder was not in possession of the second defendant’s e-mail address, he could easily have referred to her by her name or identity in his e-mail and text messages to Quah. Given that Tejinder was (on his own evidence) unsure about the legality of the Nominee Arrangement, one would have expected him to direct his instructions and enquiries to the second defendant instead of Quah. After all, the second defendant was a legally-trained solicitor. Quah, while conversant with conveyancing matters, was the first defendant’s office manager and was not legally qualified. It was clear that the second defendant was much better placed than Quah to address Tejinder’s queries and concerns. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 Next, I agreed with the defendants that it was significant that the defendants had requested for a copy of the plaintiff’s NRIC on 14 November 2006.

</div> If the Alleged October Meeting had indeed taken place, it was likely that the defendants would have utilised that opportunity to procure a copy of the plaintiff’s NRIC. The plaintiff’s response in his written submissions was that the defendants might not have taken a copy of his NRIC during the Alleged October Meeting because it was merely an “introductory meeting”.

</div> However, this submission was inconsistent with the plaintiff’s position that the second defendant had rendered negligent advice to him and Tejinder during the Alleged October Meeting. To my mind, it was extremely improbable that the second defendant would have rendered such advice to the plaintiff without first verifying his identity. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 Furthermore, I agreed with the defendants that Tejinder’s testimony was unreliable as it contradicted his own affidavit evidence as well as the plaintiff’s evidence at multiple junctures. While Tejinder’s inability to recall the <span class="font-italic">precise </span>date of the Alleged October Meeting was understandable given the lapse of thirteen years between the present suit and the events which had transpired, there were various other inconsistencies – some of which related to material facts – which surfaced during the course of trial. For example, Tejinder gave evidence that the Alleged October Meeting had taken place after he had put forward the plaintiff’s name as purchaser in his 20 October 2006 E-mail to Quah.

It only stated that “[Tejinder] informed me that the lawyers said that it was okay for me to purchase the property as a nominee” and that “[t]his was further confirmed when [Tejinder] received a letter from [the first defendant] dated 27/10/2006 … stating that I could purchase the property as a nominee”.

</div> Reading this statement in context, it was only logical that the italicised word “he” was a reference to <span class="font-italic">Tejinder</span>, and not the plaintiff, seeking legal advice. While the Letter of Representations subsequently went on to state that “[b]eing a layman [the plaintiff] had completely relied on the advice of his solicitor, Ms Yasmin Binte Abdullah”, it did not set out any specific instances in which the plaintiff (as opposed to Tejinder) had sought and received advice on the Nominee Arrangement from the second defendant. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 The plaintiff attempted to explain away this glaring omission in his Cautioned Statement by asserting that he had been focused on providing contemporaneous documentary evidence that was “black and white”, and that “it was… not necessary for [him] to write within the very limited space available the facts that give rise to a claim for negligence”.

</div> In my view, these arguments were not persuasive. It was clear that the Alleged October Meeting formed a crucial part of the plaintiff’s negligence claim against the defendants, which in turn constituted the cornerstone of the plaintiff’s defence against the RPA charge. In addition, the Letter of Representations contained a similar glaring omission, while making references to several other oral discussions between Tejinder and the plaintiff

</div> I was unable to place any weight on this bare allegation since the plaintiff’s long statement was not adduced before this court. Furthermore, even if this point were taken at its highest, it still would not point conclusively towards a finding that the Alleged October Meeting had taken place, since the plaintiff did not mention it at all in both the Cautioned Statement and the Letter of Representations.

</div> He argued that this ought to give rise to an adverse inference against the second defendant’s evidence of what had transpired during the meeting. In support of this submission, he relied on the 2018 Practice Directions and Rulings of the Law Society (“2018 Practice Directions”), which exhort legal practitioners to “maintain contemporaneous notes of their dealings with clients”, failing which “the court may draw an adverse inference against the legal practitioner’s testimony of events”.  The plaintiff also referred to the case of <span class="font-italic">Lie </span><span class="font-italic">Hendri Rusli v Wong Tan &amp; Molly Lim (a firm) </span>[2004] 4 SLR(R) 594 (“<span class="font-italic">Lie </span><span class="font-italic">Hendri Rusli</span>”), in which V K Rajah JC (as he then was) gave the legal profession a “salutary reminder … to maintain attendance notes”, in the absence of which “the solicitor may find himself handicapped when the credibility of his evidence is assessed” (at [63]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">77 It is clear that neither the 2018 Practice Directions nor <span class="font-italic">Lie </span><span class="font-italic">Hendri Rusli </span>suggest that an adverse inference would <span class="font-italic">invariably </span>be drawn against a lawyer who had failed to keep attendance notes of a particular meeting. Indeed, Rajah JC clarified in <span class="font-italic">Lie </span><span class="font-italic">Hendri Rusli </span>that it would be incorrect to assume that the absence of an attendance note “is either tantamount to negligence or robs a solicitor’s testimony of all significance” (at [63]). Rather, the ultimate inquiry in each case is whether the solicitor is able to “satisfy the court that his recollection of events is case specific and not a convenient reconstruction of events” (at [63]). Thus, in <span class="font-italic">Lie </span><span class="font-italic">Hendri Rusli</span>, the court chose to accept a solicitor’s account of what had transpired during a client meeting despite the fact that the solicitor had not maintained attendance notes of the same (at [36]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">78 Looking at the evidence in its totality, I was of the view that it would not be appropriate to draw an adverse inference against the second defendant’s evidence in this case. Like the solicitor in <span class="font-italic">Lie </span><span class="font-italic">Hendri Rusli</span>, the second defendant was “consistent, assured and candid” in giving evidence, and any “minor creases” which emerged in her testimony were readily explicable by the substantial lapse of time since the relevant events had transpired. I elaborate on my reasoning below. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">79 Firstly, I agreed that the second defendant had a rational and compelling explanation for her failure to take attendance notes during the 17 November 2006 Meeting. She had not thought it necessary to reduce the contents of the meeting to writing because there had been no change in her understanding that the plaintiff was purchasing the Property as its legal and beneficial owner. As the second defendant explained during cross-examination, “going [into] the meeting, the understanding was that [the plaintiff was] going to be the replacement purchaser, and at the end of the meeting, he was still a replacement purchaser”.

In this regard, he stressed that there was no attempt to conceal the fact that Tejinder had lived in the Property for five-and-a-half years, or that Tejinder had arranged for the payment of the monthly mortgage. Furthermore, Tejinder had carried out extensive renovations to the Property and the invoices for those renovations were issued under his name or that of his wife.

</div> In my view, this explanation did not hold much water. Tejinder had been instructing and directing the plaintiff behind the scenes at all material times. Even if the plaintiff was to be their main point of contact with ALC, it would have been more efficient and logical to include Tejinder in the communications with ALC since any information which ALC conveyed to the plaintiff would eventually have to be relayed to Tejinder. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">90 Furthermore, if the plaintiff and Tejinder had genuinely believed that the Nominee Arrangement was <span class="font-italic">bona fide</span> and lawful, it was even more puzzling that the plaintiff did not inform ALC that he was taking instructions from Tejinder, or that Tejinder was the beneficial owner of the Property. When the plaintiff was queried on this point during cross-examination, his feeble comeback was: “Tejinder told me what to do, I was dealing with it.”

</div>
</div> With respect, this was an evasive non-answer. The existence of the Nominee Arrangement had obvious legal implications, and it was more likely than not that the plaintiff – being a commercially-savvy, legally-trained individual – would have recognised the need to disclose such information to ALC whilst it was acting for him in the sale of the Property. I found that a deliberate decision was made to keep the information away from ALC and avoid alerting them to the Nominee Arrangement.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">91 The plaintiff also highlighted the fact that Tejinder had been involved in “open” and written communications with the plaintiff, Mr Robin Lim (who was one of the Property’s purchasers) and Mr Jenard Nair (Tejinder’s appointed property agent who assisted in the sale of the Property (“Mr Nair”)).

No similar “paper trail” was extended to ALC, who were acting as the plaintiff’s solicitors in the sale of the Property. Moreover, as the defendants pointed out, there were many possible (and plausible) reasons as to why Tejinder and the plaintiff may have “openly” revealed Tejinder’s involvement to the purchasers and/or Mr Nair.

</div> For instance, the purchasers and/or Mr Nair may well have been misled into believing that it was the plaintiff (and not Tejinder) who was the beneficial owner of the Property. Neither Mr Nair nor the purchasers were called to give evidence on this score and an adverse inference could thus be properly drawn against the plaintiff in this regard.

However, the evidence did not disclose any apparent spontaneous concern whatsoever on the plaintiff’s part over the defendants’ alleged negligence. Neither the plaintiff nor Tejinder had thought to approach the defendants to seek clarity or to confront them on the negligent advice which had supposedly been dispensed to them. It was only some <span class="font-italic">nine months</span> after the CAD raid that Tejinder suggested in a WhatsApp message to the plaintiff dated 14 September 2013 that the plaintiff should ask his lawyer, Mr Harpal Singh (“Mr Singh”), to “try… out” putting the first defendant on notice that they would sue them.

</div>  In my view, these explanations were contrived and wholly without merit. If the plaintiff had relied in all earnestness on negligent legal advice only to find himself facing potential prosecution, surely the natural and logical reaction would be to confront the defendants to seek an explanation. The plaintiff’s suggestion that he had been preoccupied with the criminal proceedings was unconvincing since it was self-evident that the defendant’s purported negligence would have formed the central plank of his defence against the RPA charge. If the defendants had indeed been responsible for the plaintiff’s predicament, there was no reason why the plaintiff could not have informed Mr Singh of the defendants’ alleged negligence from the very outset. The plaintiff would not have had to be prompted by Tejinder, <span class="font-italic">nine months </span>after the CAD raid, that he should “try… out” suing the defendants. In the circumstances, the irresistible inference was that the plaintiff had, up till September 2013, failed to provide his solicitors with a consistent and coherent account of the events which had transpired during the purchase of the Property in 2006. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">97 The nature and contents of the plaintiff’s and Tejinder’s WhatsApp communications in the aftermath of the CAD raid were also significant.

There were no such “compelling” circumstances here.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">116 In my view, the plaintiff’s contentions on this point were largely speculative. The context of the parties’ correspondence had to be borne in mind. Given that the possibility of a trust arrangement had only been brought to the defendants’ attention during the plaintiff’s meeting with the second defendant on 17 November 2006, the words “for own occupation” on the plaintiff’s Warrant to Act could only have been a reference to the occupation of the Property <span class="font-italic">by the plaintiff</span>. Furthermore, for the reasons stated at [84(b)] above, I did not see a need to draw any inferences from the fact that SCB and the Vendors’ solicitors had sent letters to the plaintiff’s address (instead of to the Property’s address). I was thus satisfied that, on the facts, a reasonably competent solicitor in the second defendant’s position would not have had any reason to believe that Tejinder would be living in the Property after completion. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Conclusion on the Failure to Continue to Advise Contention </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">117 For completeness, it should also be stated that the cases which were referred to by the plaintiff did not advance his case.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) <span class="font-italic">Various Claimants v Giambrone &amp; Law (A Firm) and others </span>[2015] EWHC 1946 (QB) stands for the proposition that a solicitor has to be “very diligent” when he or she is acting in a transaction where “red flags… were popping up” (at [268] and [270]). However, the case does not explain how unusual or obvious these red flags must be in order for the solicitor to be regarded as being in breach of his/her duty of care. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) <span class="font-italic">AEL and others v Cheo Yeoh &amp; Associates LLC and another </span>[2014] 3 SLR 1231 was a case in which a solicitor was held to have breached his duty of care to the beneficiaries of a will because he had failed to ensure that there were at least two witnesses present at the time of execution of the will. This was not a case involving red flags, but a straightforward case in which the solicitor had failed to carry out the steps which were necessary to ensure the validity of the will. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Likewise, the issue of red flags did not arise in <span class="font-italic">Wai Wing Properties Pte Ltd v Lim, Ganesh &amp; Liu (a firm) </span>[1994] 1 SLR(R) 1004. In that case, a solicitor had failed to respond to two statutory notices due to an oversight on his part. The court held that the need to reply to the notices had been “obvious” (at [52]), but did not point to any <span class="font-italic">unusual</span> factual circumstances which could have alerted the solicitor to the need for a response. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) The cases of <span class="font-italic">Law Society of Singapore v Tan </span><span class="font-italic">Chwee Wan Allan </span>[2007] 4 SLR(R) 699 and<span class="font-italic"> </span><span class="font-italic">Chu Said Thong and another v Vision Law LLC </span>[2014] 4 SLR 375 were also irrelevant to the facts at hand. The plaintiff relied on these cases to argue that the defendants had a duty to supervise Quah’s conduct of the plaintiff’s transaction.

The defence of illegality applies generally to all areas of law, including tort law (see <span class="font-italic">ANC Holdings Pte Ltd v Bina </span><span class="font-italic">Puri Holdings Bhd </span>[2013] 3 SLR 666 (“<span class="font-italic">ANC Holdings</span>”) at [81]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">121 The plaintiff asserted that the defence of illegality was inapplicable in the present case because he had not known or understood that it was illegal and unlawful for him to purchase the Property on trust for Tejinder.

</div> Reliance was placed on the observations of Vinodh Coomaraswamy JC (as he then was) in <span class="font-italic">ANC Holdings</span> at [82]: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… [N]ot every civil or criminal wrong will trigger the doctrine: <span class="font-italic">where the wrong is a criminal wrong of strict liability and the plaintiff is unaware of it, the doctrine may not be engaged.</span> The common thread is that – as the doctrine’s maxim implies – the plaintiff’s behaviour must involve turpitude or culpability … [emphasis added] </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">122 However, as stated at [86]–[100] above, I found that the plaintiff’s factual case was not credible, and that both Tejinder and the plaintiff had proceeeded with the Nominee Arrangement despite knowing that it was illegal and/or unlawful. Correspondingly, I was of the view that the plaintiff’s claim was necessarily barred by the doctrine of illegality. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">123 From the evidence before me, it was patently clear that the plaintiff and Tejinder were mature, educated and savvy individuals; neither was a babe in the woods. In my assessment, both of them knew exactly what they were doing. It was uncontroversial that the plaintiff himself did not stand to gain from the purchase arrangement; he had not stayed in the Property, and there was no evidence that he had obtained any benefit, whether direct or collateral, from the purchase. Obviously, it was Tejinder who was fully incentivised to ensure that the purchase went ahead, possibly with the hope or expectation that it could be sold for profit in due course (as it eventually was). The plaintiff was Tejinder’s means to this end. He went along with the arrangement believing that he and Tejinder would not get caught out. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">124 I should add that I was not persuaded by Tejinder’s assertion

</div> that they would “never” have entered into the Nominee Arrangement if they had known that it would put anyone at risk. The evidence pointed cogently to the inference that the plaintiff had been prepared to enter into the illegal transaction because he himself had determined, or had been persuaded by Tejinder, that any attendant risk was low and could be managed. Indeed, until the property was sold in mid-2012, it would not have been obvious to any third party that a nominee purchase arrangement had taken place in 2006. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">125 In conclusion, I found it implausible that the plaintiff had not been advised or had been wrongly advised by the defendants in relation to the unlawful nature of the Nominee Arrangement. The probabilities were that he had been appropriately advised and was fully conscious of the fact that purchasing the Property as Tejinder’s nominee was unlawful and in breach of s 23 of the RPA. The objective evidence did not support the plaintiff’s assertions that the defendants had been negligent in advising him. I found it more likely than not that he had chosen to proceed with the purchase because of Tejinder’s request for his assistance. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">126 Accordingly, I found that the plaintiff had not discharged his burden of proving that the defendants were in breach of the duty of care which they owed to him. Given this finding, it was unnecessary to address whether the plaintiff had suffered loss or damage as a result of the defendants’ alleged negligence. I therefore dismissed the plaintiff’s claim. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Costs</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">127 Having perused the parties’ written submissions on costs, I determined that the plaintiff should bear the defendants’ costs totalling $160,000, inclusive of full disbursements of $13,650 claimed by the defendants. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">128 Effectively, the hearing of the evidence at trial required five days over two tranches. The trial did not involve novel or complex legal issues. The factual disputes, though considerable, were not inordinately convoluted. The proceedings were unfortunately somewhat protracted and the matter ultimately took over four years to reach its conclusion. </div><div class="txt-body text-left"></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">129 Costs in respect of the various interlocutory applications had already been fixed. I was thus of the view that the defendants’ pre-trial costs would reasonably and fairly be allowed at $60,000, with the balance amount (excluding disbursements) to be allowed for the preparation for and conduct of the trial proper. </div><div class="Judg-Sign text-left">See Kee Oon <br/>Judge</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Deborah Barker SC, Harpal Singh and Ushan Premaratne (Withers Khattarwong LLP) for the plaintiff;</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Chandra Mohan Rethnam, Ang Tze Phern and Marissa Zhao (Rajah &amp; Tann Singapore LLP) for the first and second defendants.</div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"> </div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
