They only got to know each other shortly before the purchase of the Flat through their mutual friend, Mr Ang. Mdm Tan and Mr Ng lost contact with each other soon after the purchase of the Flat. Mr Ng moved to Japan in 2000 where he spent 18 years in prison after being convicted of a drug-related offence. Mr Ng never stayed a single day in the Flat until after his return from Japan in December 2018.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">3 Mdm Tan was 41 years old back in 1997 and is now aged 63. Mr Ng was 37 years old back in 1997 and is now aged 59. Over the past twenty-odd years, the monthly repayments for the HDB mortgage loan came entirely from Mdm Tan. Mr Ng’s <span class="font-italic">only</span> monetary contribution towards the Flat was a payment of $7,922.44 from <span class="font-italic">his CPF account</span> in October 1998 as part of the initial capital payment for the Flat, for which he received a partial repayment of $5,000 <span class="font-italic">in cash </span>from Mdm Tan a few days later.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">4 After Mr Ng’s return to Singapore, disputes arose between Mdm Tan and Mr Ng over the Flat. This prompted Mdm Tan to apply to court for the Flat to be sold in the open market and for the sale proceeds to be divided between her and Mr Ng in the ratio of 95:5. Mdm Tan also sought to be given sole conduct of the sale. In addition, Mdm Tan sought an order that she be allowed to buy over Mr Ng’s share directly at valuation price in lieu of putting the Flat up for sale. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">5 Mr Ng did not object to the court ordering a sale of the Flat. Instead, Mr Ng objected to Mdm Tan having sole conduct of the sale and to Mdm Tan being given the right to buy over his share at valuation price. Mr Ng also claimed to be entitled to 43.4% of the sale proceeds on the basis that Mdm Tan held 38.4% of the Flat on resulting trust for Mr Ng.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">6 The Flat was purchased for $237,282.44 and is now worth about $450,000 (based on recent HDB transacted prices for similar flats). Deducting the outstanding mortgage loan of about $50,000, the equity in the Flat should be around $400,000. Thus a 5% share in the Flat should be worth around $20,000 while a 43.4% share should be worth around $170,000.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">7 After hearing the parties, I ordered the sale of the Flat with Mdm Tan having sole conduct of the sale. I also ordered that the sale proceeds should be divided in the ratio of 95:5 between Mdm Tan and Mr Ng. I did <span class="font-italic">not</span> grant Mdm Tan’s request for an order giving her the right to buy over Mr Ng’s share. Both Mr Ng and Mdm Tan have appealed against my decision. I now provide my grounds of decision.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Issues</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">8 In these grounds, I will address the following key issues:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) the parties’ relative shares in the Flat;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) whether the court should order the sale of the Flat;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) whether Mdm Tan should be given sole conduct of the sale; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) whether Mdm Tan should be given the right to buy over Mr Ng’s share.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The parties’ relative shares in the Flat</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Relevant facts</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">How parties came to purchase the Flat together</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">9 It is common ground that Mdm Tan and Mr Ng became acquainted sometime in 1997 through their mutual friend Mr Ang.

He added that, as he only had primary school education and a very limited command of English, he was not aware that the completion documents stated that he owned only 5% of the Flat.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Analysis</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 Since the starting point of Mr Ng’s submission was the case of <span class="font-italic">Lau Siew Kim</span>, and since Mr Ng did not cite any authority where equity intervened in legal tenancies in common in the same way that it did in legal joint tenancies, it would be useful to begin by examining the rationale given in <span class="font-italic">Lau Siew Kim </span>for the intervention of equity in legal joint tenancies. This rationale was explained in a detailed and comprehensive discussion found at [83]–[95] of <span class="font-italic">Lau Siew Kim</span>. The key points of this discussion are:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Traditionally, equity’s intervention in legal joint tenancies has been a reaction to the common law presumption of joint tenancy (at [83] and [84]).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Much like the presumption of joint tenancy at common law, there exists in Singapore a statutory presumption of joint tenancy in the form of s 53(1) of the Land Titles Act (Cap 157, 2004 Rev Ed) (“LTA”). Therefore, “just as equity inclines towards a tenancy in common when faced with the common law presumption of joint tenancy, equity may similarly intervene in the statutory presumption of joint tenancy in Singapore to deem, as beneficial tenants in common, co-owners holding local registered land as joint tenants at law” (at [87]).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) The existence of s 53(1) gives rises to “a default position where equitable presumptions may still be required to effect justice between the parties given that they may have been presumed to be joint tenants at law without any informed or voluntary intention on their part to hold the land they co-own in such a manner” (at [90]).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) “Under s 53(1) of the LTA, there may exist situations where co-owners hold land as legal joint tenants without fully appreciating or voluntarily intending the consequences of such manner of holding; there is, therefore, room for the intervention of equity to ensure fairness between the parties” (at [92]).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) “[I]t is <span class="font-italic">only</span> where the registered co-owners of land had <span class="font-italic">not </span>made a conscious and informed choice to hold as joint tenants at law that equity kicks in to presume a tenancy in common. In contrast, where co-owners had expressly specified their intention to hold land in a legal joint tenancy, there would be no cause for equity not to follow the law; thus, in such instances, legal joint tenants should also be beneficial joint tenants unless it may be shown that the expressly-state choice should be vitiated for some reason” [emphasis in original] (at [93]).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(f) If there had been no statutory presumption of joint tenancy in the form of s 53(1) of the LTA, and if parties were required to state their manner of holding (failing which the land registrar would refuse to register transfers), “the equitable presumption of a tenancy in common might have been displaced and rendered unnecessary” (at [88]–[89]).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(g) Where parties can make an informed choice as to whichever type of co-ownership they desire, “there would be no need, generally, for any intervention on the part of the courts or equity to presume a completely different beneficial manner of holding” (at [94]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 From the foregoing summary, it can be seen that:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The equitable presumption that parties hold as beneficial tenants in common in proportion to their contributions to the acquisition of the property is a reaction to the legal presumption of joint tenancy.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Equity intervenes in a legal joint tenancy in order to “effect justice between the parties” or “ensure fairness between the parties” because of the legal presumption of joint tenancy gives rise to the risk that the parties may “hold land as legal joint tenants without fully appreciating or voluntarily intending the consequences of such manner of holder” or “may have been presumed to be joint tenants at law without any informed or voluntary intention on their part to hold the land they co-own in such a manner” (<span class="font-italic">Lau Siew Kim </span>at [90] and [92]).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Where co-owners have expressly specified their intention on their manner of holding, “there would be no cause for equity not to follow the law” (at [93]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 Since there is no legal presumption concerning tenancies in common, the consideration at [29(a)] above would not apply to a legal tenancy in common. Since, in a purchase of property as legal tenants in common, parties would necessarily have to state expressly their relative share, the consideration at [29(b)] above would also not apply to a legal tenancy in common. Lastly, since legal tenants in common would have expressly specified their intention to hold as tenants in common and expressly specified their relative shares in the property, legal tenancies in common fall within the situation described at [29(c)] above, with the result that equity should follow the law.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 I therefore held that, where parties had expressly agreed to hold as tenants in common and expressly agreed on their relative shares, there was no room for equity to intervene with an equitable presumption that parties held as beneficial tenants in common in proportion to their contributions to the acquisition of the property.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 Mr Ng submitted that he only had primary school education and had a very limited command of English, that he was not made aware that the completion documents stated that he had only a 5% share of the Flat, and that he did not agree to the 5%.

</div> I did not give much weight to this submission. First, Mr Ng had not relied on the doctrine of <span class="font-italic">non est factum</span>. In my view, he was right not to claim <span class="font-italic">non est factum </span>as such a claim would clearly have been unsustainable on the facts. Secondly, the effects of the HDB documents he signed would in all likelihood have been explained to him when he attended at the HDB office to sign the documents. Thirdly, even if I were to accept that Mr Ng had a poor command of English, he would at the minimum have been able to recognise his own name and been able to read the number “5/100” against his name on both the Sale Order and the Agreement Order, as well as on the Agreement for Lease. Fourthly, counsel for Mr Ng accepted that both Mr Ng and Mdm Tan were equally handicapped when it came to reading English.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 Lastly, given the factual background (especially having regard to the nature of the relationship between the parties as well as the purpose for purchasing the Flat and the reason Mr Ng’s assistance was sought), I found it extremely unlikely that either Mr Ang or Mdm Tan would have promised Mr Ng a half-share in the Flat simply for helping out in the manner he did. I found that, in all probability, an offer of $5,000 cash upfront plus a 5% share when the Flat was eventually sold would have been sufficiently attractive to persuade Mr Ng to assist Mr Ang or Mdm Tan in the manner he did.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 I therefore found that Mr Ng is bound by the contractual documents he signed and therefore acquired only a 5% share in the Flat.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 Given my finding at [34] above, there was no need for me to consider Mr Ng’s further submission at [27] above, since that submission would become relevant only if I were to accept Mr Ng’s submission at [26] above that equity would intervene in a legal tenancy in common to disregard parties’ express agreement on their relative shares. This was because the principle set out in <span class="font-italic">Su Emmanuel </span>at [89] is in essence a method for ascertaining the parties’ respective contributions <span class="font-italic">in the event that</span> the court has decided that parties in a legal joint tenancy are presumed to hold as beneficial tenants in common. There was no scope for applying the said principle in the present case given my finding, on the facts, that parties hold as tenants in common in the shares specified in the contractual documents, as opposed to in shares in proportion to their respective contributions. Nevertheless, for completeness, I shall explain why, even if I were wrong in my finding at [34] above, the proper application of the principle in <span class="font-italic">Su Emmanuel </span>at [89] would have led me to attribute all the loan repayments to Mdm Tan instead of apportioning the loan repayments equally between Mr Ng and Mdm Tan.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 <span class="font-italic">Su Emmanuel </span>states at [89] that:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… When a mortgage is taken out, the crucial consideration is the parties’ intentions, at the time the property is acquired, as to the ultimate source of the funds for purchase of that property (see <span class="font-italic">Lau Siew Kim</span> at [116] and <span class="font-italic">Bertei v Feher</span> [2000] WASCA 165 at [44]). Actual mortgage payments made at a later time would therefore only count as direct contributions to the purchase price where these are referable to, and in keeping with, a prior agreement between the parties as to who would be liable to repay the loan. …</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 Mr Ng’s submission was that, because the HDB loan was taken out in Mdm Tan’s and Mr Ng’s joint names, half of the loan amount should be attributed to Mr Ng as his contribution. Although Mr Ng did not tender the loan documentation in evidence, I would have been prepared to accept that the HDB loan was, in all likelihood, taken out in both their names. However, the fact that the loan was taken out in both their names did not necessarily mean that each party must be taken as having contributed the equivalent of half the loan. As explained in <span class="font-italic">Su Emmanuel </span>at [90]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Many factors are engaged in the determination of the precise agreement or understanding between the parties as to who would repay the mortgage. The focus should not lie exclusively on who took on <span class="font-italic">liability</span> for the mortgage as against the bank. Often such liability will be joint because the bank would like to have the widest choice of the parties against whom it can enforce the liability under the mortgage. Rather, the question will turn on what the operating agreement was between the co-owning parties at the time the loan was taken out. In this regard, subsequent conduct may be relevant to the extent that it sheds light on such an agreement (if any) between the co-owners. Thus, in <span class="font-italic">Chan Yuen Lan</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>[<span class="font-italic">v See Fong Mun </span>[2014] 3 SLR 1048], despite the fact that liability for the loan fell on the wife, the court found that the agreement between the parties was for the husband to repay the loan and therefore the loan amount of $400,000 was attributed to the husband as his direct contribution to the acquisition of the property (at [81]–[87]).

</div> Mr Ng denied that there was such a verbal agreement. He referred to the written agreement of 13 October 1998 (see [22] above) and submitted that since this written agreement was silent on the question of liability for repayment of the loan, that amounted to evidence that there was no verbal agreement between parties on the liability for repayment of the loan.

</div>
</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 I did not agree with Mr Ng that I should read so much into the absence of provisions concerning loan repayment in the 13 October 1998 written agreement. That written agreement recorded the payment of $5,000 by Mdm Tan in consideration of Mr Ng contributing $9,000 [<span class="font-italic">sic</span>] from his CPF account towards the acquisition of the Flat and contained a further stipulation that parties agreed not to sell the Flat within the HDB-mandated minimum occupation period of five years. On its face, the 13 October 1998 agreement was not drafted in a manner which signified that it was intended to comprehensively and exhaustively encompass all of the parties’ understanding concerning the Flat. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 In contrast, I found that Mdm Tan’s submission was more consistent with the factual background and with the parties’ subsequent conduct. Dealing first with the latter point, I noted that this was not a case where Mr Ng had initially made some contributions towards the loan repayment only for those contributions to cease after he moved to Japan. What in fact occurred was that, for the two years between the completion of the purchase of the Flat and Mr Ng’s move to Japan, he made no contribution at all towards the loan repayment. This conduct was strong evidence that the parties’ understanding was that Mdm Tan would be solely responsible for the loan repayment. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 As for the factual background, I noted that whether on Mr Ng’s version (<span class="font-italic">ie, </span>Mr Ang wishing to provide a roof over Mdm Tan’s head) or Mdm Tan’s version (<span class="font-italic">ie, </span>Mdm Tan was planning to buy a flat with her mother but her mother had passed away), the key feature of the factual background was that of Mdm Tan seeking to obtain a flat <span class="font-italic">for her own occupation</span> but being unable to do so in her sole name due to the relevant HDB requirements, thus necessitating Mr Ng’s assistance to consent to his name to be included as a co-owner of the Flat. Given this factual background, it was extremely unlikely that either Mr Ang or Mdm Tan would have expected Mr Ng to bear responsibility for half of the mortgage loan and equally unlikely that Mr Ng would have agreed to do so.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 I would therefore have found that it was the parties’ understanding, at the time the Flat was purchased, that Mdm Tan would be solely responsible for repayment of the HDB mortgage loan. What this would mean in terms of parties’ relative contribution was that Mr Ng’s contribution was limited to the $7,922.44 from his CPF account, which amounted to only 3.3% of the purchase price of the Flat. If the $5,000 paid to Mr Ng on 13 October 1998 were taken into account, Mr Ng’s contribution would be only $2,922.44, which amounted to 1.2% of the purchase price.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 For the reasons given above, I held that Mdm Tan is the owner of 95% of the Flat while Mr N`g is the owner of 5% of the Flat.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Whether the court should order the sale of the Flat</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 As noted in <span class="font-italic">Su Emmanuel </span>at [57(a)]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">In deciding whether it is necessary or expedient for a sale to be ordered in lieu of partition, the court conducts a balancing exercise of various factors, including (i) the state of the relationship between the parties (which would be indicative of whether they are likely to be able to co-operate in the future); (ii) the state of the property; and (iii) the prospect of the relationship between the parties deteriorating if a sale was not granted such that a “clean break” would be preferable.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 It was clear that the relationship between parties had deteriorated to such an extent that it would be necessary and expedient for a sale to be ordered in lieu of partition. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 Mdm Tan’s affidavits recounted how Mr Ng broke into the Flat

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 Where one of two co-owners applies to court for a sale in lieu of partition, it could be because one owner wishes to sell while the other owner does not wish to sell. In such a situation, it may be unrealistic to expect the other owner to cooperate in the sale if the court were to order a sale with parties having joint conduct of the sale. In such a situation, an order for joint conduct of the sale would simply afford the owner not wishing to sell an opportunity to hold up the sale. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 In my view, the foregoing considerations apply squarely to the present case. Although Mr Ng did not formally object to the court granting an order of sale, his past behaviour demonstrated that he may have an incentive to not cooperate in the sale, especially since the Flat is now solely occupied by him, with Mdm Tan fearful of returning to the Flat. The state of the parties’ relationship (as recounted above) also meant that it is unrealistic to expect parties to cooperate in the sale. Finally, having regard to the fact that Mdm Tan will be entitled to 95% of the sale proceeds while Mr Ng will only be entitled to 5%, I considered it fair and equitable for Mdm Tan to have sole conduct of the sale, subject to the following safeguards:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Mdm Tan shall keep Mr Ng updated on all issues of importance concerning the sale process, including the appointment of property agents for the conduct of the sale, the appointment of conveyancing lawyers for the conduct of the sale and all offers received for the purchase of the Flat.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Mr Ng shall be at liberty to apply.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Whether Mdm Tan should be given the right to buy over Mr Ng’s share</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52  Mdm Tan prayed, as an alternative to selling the entire Flat to a third party, for an order that she be given the right to buy over Mr Ng’s share in the Flat. Mr Ng submitted that there was no basis in law for the court to make such an order.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 I agreed with Mr Ng’s submission. It was noteworthy that even though I had granted an adjournment for Mdm Tan’s counsel to do further research, she was not able to furnish any authorities in support of such an order.

</div> The wording of para 2 of the First Schedule of the SCJA is clear. It empowers the court to “order the land or any part of it to be sold”. It does not empower the court to allow one co-owner to compulsorily purchase the other co-owner’s share.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 I therefore declined to make an order giving Mdm Tan the right to purchase Mr Ng’s share. Notwithstanding this ruling, parties are not precluded from negotiating with each other for one side to buy over the other’s share at a mutually agreed price.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 In the light of the foregoing, I ordered the sale of the Flat in the open market, with the sale proceeds to be divided in the proportion of 95% to Mdm Tan and 5% to Mr Ng. Mdm Tan is to have sole conduct of the sale, subject to the safeguards outlined at [50] above. I also ordered each party to make the necessary refund (if any) to their CPF accounts from their respective shares of the sale proceeds. In keeping with my finding that it was the parties’ understanding that Mdm Tan was to be solely responsible for repaying the housing loan, the repayment of the outstanding loan shall be made fully from Mdm Tan’s share of the sale proceeds. Finally, I ordered Mdm Tan to account to Mr Ng for 5% of all rental proceeds she had received from the Flat. There shall be liberty for parties to apply.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 I made no order as to costs as Mr Ng was legally aided. </div><div class="Judg-Sign text-left">Pang Khang Chau  <br/>Judge </div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Sujatha Selvakumar (I.R.B.
