        Chan Sek Keong CJ (delivering the grounds of decision of the
                court):</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       This was an expedited appeal against the
                    decision of the High Court judge (“the Judge”) in <em>Beckkett Pte Ltd v Deutsche Bank AG and another</em>
                    [2010] SGHC 284 (“the Judgment”). The Judge granted an
                    anti-suit injunction against the appellant, Beckkett Pte Ltd
                    (“Beckkett”), in the terms set out at sub-paras (a) and (b)
                    of [47] of the Judgment. We dismissed the appeal after hearing counsel for
                    Beckkett and said that we would give our reasons later. This, we now
                do.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Background facts</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       We first set out the relevant factual
                    background, in particular, the extraordinary procedural history of the various
                    legal proceedings leading to this appeal.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       Beckkett had guaranteed a US$100m loan
                    (“the Loan”) granted to its indirect subsidiary by the respondent,
                    Deutsche Bank AG (“DB”). Beckkett had also pledged certain shares
                    owned by it (“the Pledged Shares”) as security for the Loan. The
                    Pledged Shares were pledged pursuant to several share pledge agreements, all
                    governed by Indonesian law. Subsequently, there was a default on the Loan, and
                    DB exercised its powers as pledgee to sell the Pledged Shares. To this end, DB
                    obtained, via <em>ex parte</em> applications to the South
                    Jakarta District Court, <em>penetapans</em> (court orders)
                    authorising the sale of the Pledged Shares, and sold the Pledged Shares pursuant
                    to those <em>penetapans</em>. After the sale, DB obtained
                    further <em>penetapans</em> declaring that the buyer of the
                    Pledged Shares was their rightful owner. All this was done between December 2001
                    and February 2002.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       On 27 April 2004, Beckkett brought Suit
                    No 326 of 2004 (“the Singapore action”) in the (Singapore)
                    High Court, claiming essentially for either an order setting aside the sale of
                    the Pledged Shares or, alternatively, damages for DB’s wrongful (so
                    Beckkett alleged) sale of the Pledged Shares at an undervalue. DB counterclaimed
                    for the amount outstanding under the Loan after the sale of the Pledged
                    Shares.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       On 11 February 2005, Beckkett applied to
                    the Jakarta High Court for both sets of <em>penetapans</em>
                    mentioned at <a href="#p1_3">[3]</a> above (“the <em>Penetapans</em>”) to be revoked. On 25 February
                    2005, the Jakarta High Court ruled that the <em>Penatapans</em> were void and should be revoked. DB appealed against
                    that ruling.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       On 20 February 2006, Kan Ting Chiu J
                    began hearing the trial of the Singapore action. Pertinently, one of the issues
                    raised during the trial was whether the sale of the Pledged Shares was in
                    accordance with Indonesian law, specifically, Arts 1155 and 1156 of the
                    Indonesian Civil Code.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       On 3 March 2006, the Indonesian Supreme
                    Court affirmed the decision of the Jakarta High Court (see <a href="#p1_5">[5]</a> above) that the <em>Penetapans</em> were void, and ruled that the parties injured by the
                    issuance of the <em>Penatapans</em> could bring claims for
                    relief. This decision was disclosed to Kan J.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       On 26 January 2007, the trial of the
                    Singapore action ended. Kan J reserved judgment, which he subsequently
                    handed down on 21 September 2007 (see <em>Beckkett Pte Ltd v
                        Deutsche Bank AG and another</em> [2008] 2 SLR(R) 189). In
                    his judgment, Kan J dismissed both Beckkett’s claim and DB’s
                    counterclaim. Both parties appealed to this court: Beckkett, via Civil Appeal
                    No 125 of 2007, and DB, via Civil Appeal No 126 of 2007 (collectively
                    referred to hereafter as “the Singapore appeals”). This court
                    heard the Singapore appeals on 23 April 2008 and reserved judgment at the
                    end of the hearing. Pertinently, the meaning, applicability and effect of
                    Arts 1155 and 1156 of the Indonesian Civil Code were fully argued during
                    the hearing of the Singapore appeals.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       On 2 May 2008, Beckkett brought Suit
                    No 649 of 2008 (“the Indonesian action”) in the South Jakarta
                    District Court against DB and several others, claiming the same reliefs as those
                    sought in the Singapore action and relying on the same grounds as those relied
                    on in the Singapore action. On 8 January 2009, the South Jakarta District
                    Court rejected a jurisdictional challenge brought by DB. DB did not appeal
                    against this ruling and decided, instead, to defend the Indonesian action on the
                    merits. However, DB continued to maintain its jurisdictional objections in its
                    submissions before the South Jakarta District Court. On 8 April 2009, the
                    South Jakarta District Court dismissed Beckkett’s claims in the Indonesian
                    action on the merits. Beckkett subsequently appealed to the Jakarta High Court.
                    All these proceedings were not disclosed to this court, which was, at that time,
                    still deliberating on the Singapore appeals.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     On 27 April 2009, this court handed down
                    its judgment in the Singapore appeals (see <em>Beckkett Pte Ltd v
                        Deutsche Bank AG and another and another appeal</em> [2009]
                    3 SLR(R) 452). The appeal by Beckkett against Kan J’s
                    rejection of (<em>inter alia</em>) its claim for an order
                    setting aside the sale of the Pledged Shares was dismissed. This court also held
                    that the sale of the Pledged Shares had not violated Indonesian law. However, DB
                    was found to have breached its duties as pledgee in failing to take reasonable
                    steps to obtain the proper price for the Pledged Shares when it sold them, and
                    Beckkett was held to be entitled to damages (to be assessed) for this breach of
                    duty. The cross-appeal by DB against Kan J’s dismissal of its
                    counterclaim was allowed, but enforcement of the judgment for the outstanding
                    balance of the Loan (and interest thereon) was stayed pending the assessment of
                    the damages to be awarded to Beckkett for DB’s breach of duty (“the
                    AD”). Up to this stage of the proceedings in the Singapore appeals,
                    neither Beckkett nor DB saw it fit or thought it necessary to inform this court
                    of the Indonesian action – this court was kept completely in the
                    dark.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     Between May 2009 and September 2009, the
                    parties’ solicitors attended a summons for directions and several
                    pre-trial conferences for the purposes of the AD. During the same period,
                    DB’s solicitors wrote to Beckkett’s solicitors requesting that
                    Beckkett desist from prosecuting the Indonesian action. Beckkett, however,
                    declined to do so.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     On 9 October 2009, DB applied to the High
                    Court for an anti-suit injunction to restrain Beckkett from continuing to
                    prosecute the Indonesian action. The application was heard by an assistant
                    registrar (“the AR”), who reserved judgment at the end of the
                    hearing.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     On 30 December 2009, the respective
                    parties’ solicitors in Indonesia were informed that the Jakarta High Court
                    had dismissed Beckkett’s appeal against the South Jakarta District
                    Court’s decision in the Indonesian action (see <a href="#p1_9">[9]</a> above). Beckkett subsequently appealed to the Indonesian
                    Supreme Court.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     On 12 February 2010, the AR delivered his
                    decision ordering Beckkett to elect between proceeding with the Indonesian
                    action and proceeding with the AD in the Singapore action (see <em>Beckkett Pte Ltd v Deutsche Bank AG</em>
                    [2010] SGHC 55). Beckkett elected to proceed with the Indonesian
                    action. DB appealed against the AR’s order. That appeal was heard by the
                    Judge, who reserved judgment. On 24 September 2010, the Judge handed down
                    the Judgment. She set aside the order made by the AR and granted an anti-suit
                    injunction restraining Beckkett from proceeding further with the Indonesian
                    action. Beckkett then filed the present appeal to this court.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     We heard this appeal on 1 December 2010.
                    During the hearing, counsel for Beckkett informed us that Beckkett’s
                    appeal to the Indonesian Supreme Court in relation to the Indonesian action (see
                        <a href="#p1_13">[13]</a> above) was still
                pending.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Beckkett’s arguments on appeal</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     Before us, counsel for Beckkett made carefully
                    focused arguments on why Beckkett should be allowed to proceed with the
                    Indonesian action. He began by defending the commencement of the Indonesian
                    action. Beckkett’s decision to commence that action was said to be both in
                    accordance with the ruling of the Indonesian Supreme Court on 3 March 2006
                    that the parties injured by the issuance of the <em>Penetapans</em> (which had been granted on an <em>ex
                        parte</em> basis) could bring claims for relief, as well as consistent
                    with DB’s argument before this court in the Singapore appeals that the
                    legality of the sale of the Pledged Shares under Indonesian law should be
                    litigated in Indonesia. Moreover, Beckkett’s counsel pointed out, the
                    affidavits filed on behalf of DB in support of its application for an anti-suit
                    injunction did not protest the <em>commencement</em> of the
                    Indonesian action; instead, they only protested the <em>continuation</em> of the Indonesian action after this court had
                    handed down its judgment in the Singapore appeals. This, in counsel’s
                    view, implied that DB accepted that Beckkett was entitled to bring the
                    Indonesian action.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     Counsel for Beckkett then proceeded to show
                    how DB had embraced the Indonesian action. In this regard, it was pointed out
                    that DB had not appealed against the dismissal of its challenge to the
                    jurisdiction of the Indonesian courts (see <a href="#p1_9">[9]</a> above); neither had it applied for an anti-suit injunction
                    in Singapore with due dispatch after Beckkett commenced the Indonesian action.
                    Instead, counsel pointed out, DB had contested the Indonesian action on the
                    merits. It was only after succeeding at first instance before the South Jakarta
                    District Court that DB had applied in Singapore, on 9 October 2009, for an
                    anti-suit injunction. This was some 17 months after the Indonesian action was
                    commenced. It was also argued that prior to applying for an anti-suit
                    injunction, DB had been dilatory in instructing its solicitors to write to
                    Beckkett’s solicitors to request that Beckkett cease pursuing the
                    Indonesian action. Counsel for Beckkett submitted that there was no satisfactory
                    explanation for these delays on DB’s part, and invited us to draw the
                    inference that DB had participated in the Indonesian action as a hedge against
                    an adverse judgment by this court in the Singapore appeals.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     In closing his arguments, Beckkett’s
                    counsel submitted that Beckkett should not be deprived of the fruits of its
                    labour in the Indonesian action, especially when all that remained was for the
                    Indonesian Supreme Court to hand down its judgment on Beckkett’s appeal
                    against the Jakarta High Court’s decision (see <a href="#p1_13">[13]</a> above). Counsel also referred to considerations of comity,
                    citing the advanced state of the Indonesian action, which (according to counsel)
                    militated in favour of allowing Beckkett to continue the Indonesian
                    action.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Our decision</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Our reasons for dismissing the present appeal</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     In the proceedings below, both the AR and the
                    Judge rendered careful and considered judgments dealing with the arguments
                    raised by both sides. We do not propose to examine their judgments in detail. In
                    our view, the issue was very simply this. As stated by Lord Hobhouse of
                    Woodborough in <em>Turner v Grovit and others</em> [2002]
                    1 WLR 107 at [24] (the facts of that case are not directly relevant),
                    a court may issue an anti-suit injunction to restrain an individual from
                    continuing to prosecute foreign proceedings which amount to an abuse of its
                        (<em>ie</em>, the aforesaid court’s) process
                    because of their effect on pending litigation in that court. Such abuse is a
                    species of unconscionability and wrongful conduct justifying the grant of an
                    injunction. We should add that once there is an abuse of the court’s
                    process, the matter ceases to be a case involving only the competing interests
                    of the parties concerned – the public interest in ensuring that the
                    judicial process is not abused is engaged, and the court must intervene, where
                    it is able to do so, to prevent its process from being abused.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     In the present case, there was not only an
                    abuse of court process of precisely the kind outlined in the preceding
                    paragraph, but also blatant, opportunistic and egregious abuse, having regard to
                    the fact that Beckkett commenced the Indonesian action after Kan J had
                    dismissed its claim against DB on the merits and after this court had heard
                        (<em>inter alia</em>) Beckkett’s appeal against
                    Kan J’s decision. Even assuming that DB had wholeheartedly embraced
                    the Indonesian action, we could not possibly permit the parties, even by
                    consent, to abuse the process of this court and undermine its authority by
                    stealthily engaging in the Indonesian action after placing (via the Singapore
                    appeals) the substantive merits of the Singapore action before this court. For
                    the same reason, there could be no question of Beckkett being able to elect
                    between proceeding with the Indonesian action and proceeding with the AD in the
                    Singapore action. Even if there was some valid reason why the forum for
                    resolving the parties’ dispute should be changed from Singapore to
                    Indonesia, the proper procedure would be for one or both of the parties to
                    inform this court, so that appropriate orders, such as a reference to the
                    Indonesian courts, could be made (in this regard, see, <em>eg</em>, <em>Westacre Investments Inc v The
                        State-Owned Company Yugoimport SDPR (also known as
                        Jugoimport-SDPR)</em> [2009] 2 SLR(R) 166, where this court
                    directed the appellant to refer a point of English law to an English court for
                    determination). Since this was not done during the (approximately) 12-month
                    period from 23 April 2008 to 27 April 2009 while this court
                    deliberated on the Singapore appeals, the parties must be content to wait upon
                    this court’s deliberations and abide by this court’s decision. If
                    any or both of the parties thought that the judgment of this court could be
                    undermined and/or influenced by presenting the court with the <em>fait accompli</em> of an advanced Indonesian proceeding (in the form
                    of the Indonesian action) prosecuted in stealth while this court deliberated on
                    the Singapore appeals, they were gravely mistaken.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Our views on Beckkett’s arguments</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     The above analysis suffices to explain why we
                    had no hesitation in dismissing the present appeal. In deference to counsel for
                    Beckkett, we shall now briefly address his arguments as set out at <a href="#p1_16">[16]</a>–<a href="#p1_18">[18]</a> above.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     With regard to counsel’s point that the
                    affidavits filed on behalf of DB in support of its application for an anti-suit
                    injunction did not raise the <em>commencement</em> of the
                    Indonesian action as a ground for granting such an injunction (see <a href="#p1_16">[16]</a> above), that fact is undisputed. But, this
                    does not entail that we must therefore accept Beckkett’s submission (at
                        <a href="#p1_16">[16]</a> above) that DB had impliedly
                    accepted that Beckkett was entitled to commence the Indonesian action. The
                    relevance and significance of DB’s failure to raise the commencement of
                    the Indonesian action as a ground for ordering an anti-suit injunction against
                    Beckkett is a question of law on which we are entitled to disagree with counsel
                    for Beckkett, especially since the present appeal concerns (as just mentioned at
                        <a href="#p1_20">[20]</a> above) a blatant, opportunistic and
                    egregious abuse of the process of this court. In our view, Beckkett’s
                    commencement and pursuit of the Indonesian action not only manifested a cynical
                    disregard for this court, but also amounted to an attempt to undermine the
                    judgment of Kan J, who had already decided the dispute between Beckkett and
                    DB on the merits. No court can countenance such an egregious abuse of its
                    process. Indeed, Beckkett’s counsel effectively conceded this point in
                    arguing that DB should have filed its application for an anti-suit injunction
                    against Beckkett earlier, specifically, during the period between 23 April
                    2008 and 27 April 2009 while this court deliberated on the Singapore
                    appeals. Beckkett’s explanation for commencing the Indonesian action (see
                        <a href="#p1_16">[16]</a> above) cannot be accepted, given
                    that it was Beckkett itself which had placed the issue of Indonesian law before
                    the Singapore courts. In this connection, Beckkett had also produced expert
                    evidence on Indonesian law before both Kan J (in the Singapore action) and
                    this court (in the Singapore appeals).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     With regard to DB’s conduct in the
                    Indonesian action, we note that DB had challenged the jurisdiction of the
                    Indonesian courts and had maintained its objections even after they were
                    rejected by the South Jakarta District Court (see <a href="#p1_9">[9]</a> above). In the absence of any evidence on the judicial
                    process of Indonesia, we cannot form any view on or draw any inference from the
                    decision by DB not to appeal against its failed jurisdictional challenge and to,
                    instead, defend the Indonesian action on the merits whilst reserving its
                    jurisdictional objections. However, we do accept the submission by
                    Beckkett’s counsel (at <a href="#p1_17">[17]</a> above)
                    that DB had no satisfactory explanation for its undue delay in applying for an
                    anti-suit injunction. DB’s conduct in this respect is also to be
                    deplored.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     As mentioned at <a href="#p1_18">[18]</a> above, considerations of comity were raised by counsel for
                    Beckkett. This was despite the fact that it was Beckkett itself which, by
                    bringing the Indonesian action, had raised the spectre of a possible breach of
                    comity in the event of the Indonesian courts reaching a decision which was
                    inconsistent with the decisions of the Singapore courts. As the principle of
                    comity was only lightly touched on by counsel, we shall not enter into a
                    detailed discussion of it. We agree with Lord Goff of Chieveley’s
                    comment in <em>Société Nationale Industrielle Aerospatiale v Lee
                        Kui Jak and Another</em> [1987] AC 871 (at 892) that the
                    jurisdiction to grant an anti-suit injunction, although technically <em>in personam</em> in nature, constitutes an indirect
                    interference with the process of a foreign court and should, therefore, be
                    exercised with circumspection. We also agree with the English Court of
                    Appeal’s view in <em>Royal Bank of Canada v Coöperatieve
                        Centrale Raiffeisen-Boerenleenbank BA</em> [2004] 1 Lloyd’s
                    Rep 471 (at [50]) that considerations of comity grow in importance the longer
                    the foreign suit in question has continued, and the more the parties and the
                    foreign court have engaged in its conduct and management. But, we cannot see how
                    these principles assist Beckkett on the facts of this case. Beckkett not only
                    brought the Indonesian action at a time when this court had reserved judgment on
                        (<em>inter alia</em>) Beckkett’s own appeal
                    against Kan J’s decision, but also continued to pursue the Indonesian
                    action even after this court had handed down its judgment in the Singapore
                    appeals. This state of affairs put both the Singapore courts and the Indonesian
                    courts in an unhappy position in so far as comity was concerned: the Indonesian
                    courts might reach a decision contrary to the decision of Kan J (and, later
                    on, that of this court), while the Singapore courts might – and eventually
                    did – have to intrude upon Beckkett’s litigation in Indonesia of a
                    dispute that had already been heard and finally determined by the Singapore
                    courts on the merits. Even if the possibility of a breach of comity were remote
                    (from the viewpoint that the Indonesian Supreme Court might well reach a
                    conclusion on the Indonesian action that is in accord with this court’s
                    judgment in the Singapore appeals), that possibility should be nipped in the bud
                    here and now, given Beckkett’s cynical abuse of and contemptuous disregard
                    for our judicial process.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     In the circumstances, we were of the view
                    that, in so far as comity was concerned, the only practical and sensible
                    solution in the present case was to restrain Beckkett from continuing the
                    Indonesian action while the outcome of the Indonesian action (post-the Jakarta
                    High Court’s ruling (see <a href="#p1_13">[13]</a> above))
                    and the outcome of the Singapore action (post-this court’s ruling in the
                    Singapore appeals (see <a href="#p1_10">[10]</a> above)) were,
                    happily, in accord with each other.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     For the foregoing reasons, we dismissed the
                    appeal. We also awarded the costs of this appeal as well as the costs of the
                    proceedings below to DB on a standard basis, and made the usual consequential
                    orders. We should add that the sole reason why we did not order Beckkett to pay
                    costs on an indemnity basis, despite its blatant attempt to frustrate and/or
                    undermine our judicial process, was that DB’s conduct in the entire affair
                    was not beyond reproach either.</p>
