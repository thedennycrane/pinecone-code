<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       The defendant filed Summons No 4950 of
                    2011/L (“Sums 4950”) to strike out the plaintiff’s claim and
                    Summons No 4939 of 2011/P (“Sums 4939”) for the court to
                    determine, in the alternative, several questions of law which would dispose of
                    the matter. I ordered the plaintiff’s statement of claim to be struck out
                    in part and declined to answer the questions of law. I set out the reasons for
                    my decision here.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The Background</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The parties entered into a state tenancy
                    agreement dated 26 February 2010 for the plaintiff to occupy 60 Jalan
                    Penjara (Parcel B), Singapore 149375, State Land Lots 3536N(PT) MK 02 and
                    3432N(PT) MK 03 (“the premises”) for three years commencing
                    17 February 2010. The premises belonged to the state and the state tenancy
                    agreement was entered into by the defendant pursuant to r 19 of the State
                    Lands Rules (Cap 314, Rule 1). The State Lands Act (Cap 314,
                    1996 Rev Ed) is the parent legislation to those rules.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       Under the state tenancy agreement, the plaintiff
                    had to comply with the following pertinent clauses:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_3-p2_a"></a>(a)     Clause 5.1.4: “To use the said
                        premises only as <b><u>Plant Nursery,
                            Orchid/Flower/Ornamental Plant Production</u></b> and not to use the
                        said premises for any other purpose without the prior written consent of the
                        Landlord.” (emphasis in original)</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_3-p2_b"></a>(b)     Clause 5.1.5: “To obtain the prior written
                        approval from the Landlord for any intensified land use (e.g. placement of
                        containers, erection of shelter etc.) of said
                    premises.”</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_3-p2_c"></a>(c)     Clause 7.2: “Not to assign, transfer, sublet, license or part with
                        the actual or legal possession or use of the said premises or any part
                        thereof except with the prior written consent of the
                        Landlord.”</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_3-p2_d"></a>(d)     Clause 7.3: “No permanent building or temporary structures
                        shall be constructed/used or permitted to be constructed/used on the said
                        premises except with the prior written consent of the
                        Landlord.”</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       The defendant alleged that the plaintiff had
                    breached these clauses and thus terminated the state tenancy agreement by way of
                    a letter dated 8 September 2011 served by hand. Paragraph five of the
                    letter stated as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">By reason of your breaches of the Tenancy Agreement, and pursuant to Rule
                        29(1) of the State Lands Rules, I hereby give you notice to terminate the
                        tenancy on <b>22 September 2011</b>. You are
                        to:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(a)    deliver possession of the Premises to me in good
                            and tenantable repair and condition on 22 September 2011;
                            and</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(b)    remove all your movable property from the Premises
                            by 22 September 2011.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis in original]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       In the light of the defendant’s position
                    as stated in this letter, the plaintiff filed this suit, Suit 649 of 2011/H
                    (“Suit 649”) against the defendant seeking the following material
                    reliefs:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(1)    Relief against forfeiture of the lease under the
                            Tenancy Agreement pursuant to the inherent jurisdiction of these
                            Honourable Courts on such terms as may be just and
                        equitable;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(2)    Further and/or in the alternative, relief against
                            forfeiture of the lease under the Tenancy Agreement pursuant to section
                            18 of the Conveyancing and Law of Property Act (Cap. 61), on such terms
                            as may be just and equitable;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(3)    Further and/or in the alternative, a declaration
                            that the Defendant’s purported notice of termination dated
                            8 September 2011 is invalid;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(4)    Further and/or in the alternative, a declaration
                            that the Plaintiff’s use of the land falls within the allowable
                            use contemplated under Clause 5.1.4 of the Tenancy
                        Agreement;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(5)    Further and/or in the alternative, a declaration
                            that the Tenancy Agreement ought to be rectified so as to embody the
                            true agreement actually made between the Plaintiff and the Defendant
                            and/or the true intentions at the time and that the said agreement
                            should be treated as being so rectified...</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       Simply put, the plaintiff sought relief against
                    forfeiture; and in the alternative, a declaration that the notice of termination
                    was invalid; a declaration on the scope of the proper use of the land under
                    cl 5.1.4; and a rectification of the tenancy agreement to reflect the true
                    intentions of the parties.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       In these applications, the defendant sought to
                    strike out the plaintiff’s claim. In the alternative, it sought to have
                    the following questions determined pursuant to O 14 r 12(1) of the
                    Rules of Court (Cap 322, R5, 2006 Rev Ed):</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_7-p2_a"></a>(a)     Whether the termination of the
                        tenancy agreement was valid?</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_7-p2_b"></a>(b)     Whether relief against forfeiture under s 18 of the
                        Conveyancing and Law of Property Act (Cap 61, 1994 Rev Ed)
                        (“CLPA”) is available to the plaintiff?</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_7-p2_c"></a>(c)     Whether relief against forfeiture
                        through the exercise of the inherent jurisdiction of the court is available
                        to the plaintiff?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       These questions are different from the questions
                    as originally framed in Sums 4939 as the defendant had made an oral application,
                    which I had allowed, to amend the contents of Sums 4939 to reflect these revised
                    questions.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">My Decision</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Pleadings and questions of law concerning relief against forfeiture
                and termination</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       I did not strike out that part of the
                    plaintiff’s statement of claim pertaining to relief against forfeiture and
                    the validity of the termination notice. I also declined to answer all three
                    questions of law. I explain first my decision to refuse to answer the questions
                    of law.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     The questions of law posed were novel
                    questions of considerable public importance and not suitable for summary
                    disposal under O 14 r 12. With regard to O 14 r 12,
                    Chong J in <em>ANB v ANF</em> [2011] 2 SLR 1
                    set out comprehensively the history of that provision. The learned judge
                    observed (at [24] to [28]) that English jurisprudence was such that
                    the English Court of Appeal had adopted two divergent approaches towards the
                    O 14 summary judgment procedure. The first approach was to deny summary
                    judgment as long as the defendant could raise a serious defence even if that
                    defence was based on a point of law that could be decided at the interlocutory
                    stage. The second approach showed a greater readiness to deal with complex
                    issues of law in an O 14 application where that issue of law was
                    dispositive of the dispute in question. The divergent approaches confused the
                    lower courts and necessitated the introduction of O 14A of the English
                    Rules of the Supreme Court to allow the court to answer any question of law.
                    Order 14 r 12 of the Singapore Rules of Court is in <em>pari
                        </em><em>materia</em> with the English
                    O 14A.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     Chong J observed thus of the English
                    O 14A (at [28]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Order 14A mandated that where the court was of the opinion that the
                        defendant had raised an arguable defence on a <em>question of
                            law</em>, it could proceed to determine that issue of law in an
                        interlocutory manner and grant summary judgment. [emphasis in
                        original]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     Chong J’s observation is a general
                    pronouncement on the tenor of the English O 14A and thus O 14
                    r 12 of the Rules of Court which is the Singapore equivalent. Nonetheless,
                    there are exceptional situations in which the court should refrain from
                    answering a question of law under O 14 r 12. On this point, the Court
                    of Appeal’s decision in <em>Obegi Melissa and others v
                        Vestwin Trading Pte Ltd and another</em> [2008] 2 SLR(R) 540
                        (“<em>Obegi Melissa</em>”) is apposite.
                    In that case, the Court of Appeal (V K Rajah JA delivering the grounds of
                    decision of the court) made the following observations on O 14 r 12(1)
                    applications:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">40    ... We decided, without adjudicating conclusively
                            on the merits of each side's case, that the matter should proceed to
                            trial instead of being summarily determined. In <em>Lim
                                and Tan Securities Pte v Sunbird Pte Ltd</em> [1991]
                            2 SLR(R) 776, Chan Sek Keong J (as he then was) held
                                at [22] that "the
                            novelty of the legal issues and also the uncertainty of the factual
                            issues that ha[d] become apparent" warranted a full trial in that case.
                            As this court pointed out in <em>Tat Lee Securities Pte
                                Ltd v Tsang Tsang Kwong</em> [1999] 3 SLR(R) 692,
                            the O 14 r 12 procedure is not appropriate where the law
                            relating to the issues in dispute is unclear and more evidence is needed
                            before those issues can be satisfactorily determined. The present suit
                            similarly raised novel legal issues and required a full examination of
                            all the relevant facts. It was thus unsuitable for determination under
                            O 14 r 12.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">41    To elaborate, the law on abandonment has not been
                            settled in Singapore. There is no legislation, case law or authoritative
                            academic view on title to or possession of items which have been
                            disposed of as rubbish. In particular, there is no recent English
                            jurisprudence on this area of the law, and comparative common law
                            decisions provide little by way of consensus or guidance. The positions
                            vary across different jurisdictions, with the courts in Australia,
                            Canada and the US generally recognising, but applying differently, the
                            concept of "divesting abandonment" - <em>ie</em>,
                            the abandonment of both ownership as well as possession.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">42    Rubbish disposal - the paradigmatic example of
                            "divesting abandonment" - is a necessary and common occurrence in daily
                            life. It is usually regarded as a mundane matter and is taken for
                            granted until a case like the present suit arises. The disposal of
                            rubbish may also raise, as demonstrated by the facts of this case, the
                            issue of protecting the privacy of individuals and business entities.
                            This is a matter of considerable public importance and should not be
                            decided summarily. Furthermore, there are, in our view, several
                            important findings of fact that need to be made before the respondents'
                            claim against the appellants can be properly determined.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     The Court of Appeal declined to summarily
                    dispose of the matter under O 14 r 12 for two reasons. First, the
                    nature of the legal issue in <em>Obegi Melissa</em> (the
                    question of title to or possession of items which have been disposed of as
                    rubbish) was novel and of considerable public importance and should not be
                    decided summarily. Second, there were important findings of fact that needed to
                    be made before the claim could be properly determined.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     The defendant argued that <em>Obegi Melissa</em> was decided on the basis of the second reason and
                    that the first reason, namely that the legal issue was of considerable public
                    importance, was not an independent ground for refusing to summarily dispose of
                    the matter under O 14 r 12. I disagree. Chan J in <em>Lim and Tan Securities Pte v Sunbird Pte Ltd</em> [1991]
                2 SLR(R) 776, quoted in <em>Obegi Melissa</em>
                        (at [40] quoted above at <a href="#p1_12">[12]</a>) had stated that a full trial was warranted because of
                    “the novelty of the legal issues <em>and also</em>
                    the uncertainty of the factual issues that ha[d] become apparent”
                    (emphasis added). The emphasised words suggested that the uncertainty of the
                    factual issues was an <em>additional</em> factor militating
                    against summary disposal of the matter. The following observation of the Court
                    of Appeal in <em>Obegi Melissa</em> (at [42] quoted
                    above at <a href="#p1_12">[12]</a>) also makes this
                    clear:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">This is a matter of considerable public importance and should not be
                        decided summarily. <em>Furthermore</em>, there are, in
                        our view, several important findings of fact that need to be made before the
                        respondents' claim against the appellants can be properly determined.
                        [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     The court is not obliged to summarily dispose
                    of the matter under O 14 r 12 simply because the facts are
                    uncomplicated. Ultimately, the court has to consider the suitability of the
                    matter for summary disposal. Although the facts may be uncomplicated, there
                    could be other factors militating against the summary disposal of the matter. In
                    this connection, the Court of Appeal’s observations in <em>Obegi Melissa</em>, suggest that questions of law of considerable
                    public importance should not be dealt with summarily. Why this is so is plain.
                    The devil is in the details and the details are in the facts of a case. What
                    appears factually uncomplicated at the interlocutory stage more often than not
                    turns out to be factually complicated at trial. In run of the mill cases which
                    do not raise questions of law of considerable public importance and which appear
                    factually uncomplicated, the legal process accepts the risk of assuming so and
                    deals with the legal issues that arise at the interlocutory stage as efficiency
                    and costs savings are weighty considerations. But where the questions of law
                    raised are of considerable public importance, considerations of efficiency and
                    costs savings are outweighed by the need to deal with these issues thoroughly in
                    the light of the ramifications of a decision on those issues. Thorough treatment
                    of issues of considerable public importance requires the consideration of those
                    issues in their factual context as fully fleshed out at trial.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     This was a case in which the issues of law
                    raised (as framed by the defendant (see <a href="#p1_7">[7]</a> above)) are novel questions of considerable public
                    importance. The following points I had raised to counsel in the course of
                    discussing the issues demonstrates the complexity of the matter and their
                    ramifications. First, is relief against forfeiture precluded when the defendant
                    terminates a state tenancy agreement under r 29(1) of the State Lands
                    Rules? That rule reads as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-Heading1">
<b>Cancellation or revocation of
                            licence and termination of tenancy agreement.</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">29 – (1) The Collector of Land Revenue may at any time cancel
                        or revoke any licence issued or terminate any tenancy agreement entered
                        under these Rules.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     The defendant argued that regardless of
                    whether the plaintiff had breached the terms of the tenancy agreement, it was
                    entitled to terminate the tenancy agreement under r 29(1). This was clearly
                    supported by the wording of r 29(1). What was unclear, however, was whether
                    termination under r 29(1) of a state tenancy agreement was such that relief
                    against forfeiture was precluded. In other words, is a state tenancy agreement
                    different from a regular tenancy agreement entered into between individuals so
                    that relief against forfeiture is available under s 18 of the CLPA or the
                    court’s equitable jurisdiction where a regular tenancy agreement is
                    concerned but not where a state tenancy agreement is concerned?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     Did the Executive intend to exclude the
                    court’s powers where a state tenancy agreement is concerned? In the
                    context of a state lease (which is different from a state tenancy agreement)
                    governed by rr 5 to 18 of the State Lands Rules, Parliament took pains to
                    stipulate in the parent act, the State Lands Act, in s 13A(7) that the
                    inclusion of that section “shall not affect the powers of the court to
                    give relief against forfeiture”. Where Parliament is cautious to include
                    an express clarification in the parent act even when s 13A does not affect
                    the court’s powers, would the Executive exclude these powers without any
                    provision expressly stating so in the subsidiary legislation?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     There are more questions. What is the nature
                    of a state tenancy agreement? Does it confer proprietary interest so as to
                    engage the equitable jurisdiction of the court so as to allow the court to grant
                    relief against forfeiture or does it only confer a personal interest? The
                    learned editors of <em>Tan Sook Yee’s Principles of
                        Singapore Land Law</em> (Singapore: LexisNexis,
                        3<sup>rd</sup> Ed, 2009) take the view (at [4.16])
                    that: “[state tenancy agreements] are also technically leases but differ
                    from State leases in important respects [such as being limited in term to three
                    years and does not require the President’s approval to be
                    granted]”. On the other hand, Professor Ricquier in <em>Land Law</em> (Singapore: LexisNexis,
                        4<sup>th</sup> Ed, 2010) takes the view (at p 14) that
                    “[a state] tenancy agreement gives only a personal interest to the
                    licensee”. I note in this regard that r 26(1)(d) of the State Lands
                    Rules provides that the state tenancy agreement shall cease and be determined on
                    the death of the tenant. A traditional analysis under property law would suggest
                    that this condition is repugnant to the granting of proprietary interest. What
                    then is the nature of a state tenancy agreement?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     The termination itself also presents a whole
                    host of questions. First, although r 29(1) allows the defendant to
                    terminate the tenancy agreement at any time, r 19(2) permits the defendant
                    to subject the tenancy agreement to such terms and conditions as the defendant
                    considers fit to impose. Where the defendant has stipulated terms and conditions
                    in the tenancy agreement, is the defendant entitled to contend that regardless
                    of whether those terms and conditions have been breached, it is entitled to
                    terminate under r 29(1)? In other words, is the defendant entitled to
                    terminate under r 29(1) regardless of the terms and conditions it had
                    prescribed as governing the relationship of the parties?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     Second, with regard to the notice of
                    termination, the plaintiff contends that the defendant did not give good notice
                    of termination because personal service is not provided for under the tenancy
                    agreement. The plaintiff argues that the defendant should have served the notice
                    in accordance with cl 10.6.1 of the tenancy agreement which does not
                    expressly stipulate personal service on the plaintiff as a mode of service. In
                    this regard the defendant referred me to the decision of Woo J in <em>Kader </em><em>Mydeen </em><em>s/o Muthu </em><em>Ibrahim
                        </em><em>Samsudin v Gulab </em><em>Bhojraj and another</em> [2008] SGHC 175 which concerned a
                    clause almost identical to cl 10.6.1. Woo J concluded that although
                    personal service was not expressly stipulated, it was good service within the
                    meaning of the clause.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     I expressed the view that Woo J’s case
                    was on all fours with this case with regard to the interpretation of
                    cl 10.6.1 but that there were more important issues which parties had
                    missed. First, was a notice of termination even necessary to terminate a state
                    tenancy agreement? For ordinary leases, it made sense to require a notice of
                    termination to be served in accordance with certain formalities for without such
                    notice, the tenant would never know that the landlord intended to bring an end
                    to the tenancy. But a state tenancy agreement is governed by rr 19 to 31 of the
                    State Lands Rules. Rule 30 provides instead for a notice to quit to be served
                    before proceedings may be taken under the State Lands Encroachment Act
                    (Cap 315, 1985 Rev Ed) to remove the occupants of state land. It thus
                    seemed that under the unique regime of the State Lands Rules, a notice of
                    termination is not required to be served in accordance with any particular
                    procedure. If a tenant does not leave when told that the tenancy is terminated
                    (regardless of how this information is conveyed whether by written notice or
                    orally), the relationship is brought to an end and the tenant evicted only after
                    a notice to quit is served pursuant to r 30. It may be argued that under
                    this regime, the conveying of the intention of the defendant to terminate may be
                    done by any means because unlike an ordinary lease where continued possession
                    after the termination date carries certain civil penalties, no adverse action
                    can be taken against the tenant under a state tenancy agreement until the notice
                    to quit is issued. In that sense, the tenant is not prejudiced even if the
                    termination is not brought to his attention in accordance with the usual
                    formalities. He is only adversely affected <em>after</em>
                    the notice to quit is served and that must be served properly in accordance with
                    r 30. Arguably, for a state tenancy agreement, it is the formalities for
                    service of the notice to quit that must be observed and a “notice of
                    termination” is not required to be served in any particular way or even
                    required at all.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     These questions of law are not only complex
                    and raise numerous sub-issues of equal or greater complexity, they are also
                    issues of considerable public importance. The determination of these issues
                    affects the rights of every single tenant who has entered and will enter into a
                    state tenancy agreement with the government. These are issues of considerable
                    public importance the determination of which has far reaching
                    implications.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     For these reasons, I declined to summarily
                    dispose of the matter by answering the questions of law posed by the defendant.
                    For the same reasons, I disagreed with the defendant that the plaintiff had no
                    reasonable cause of action with regard to the relief against forfeiture and the
                    notice of termination issues and concluded that the plaintiff had a chance of
                    success in these matters. I therefore refused to strike out the prayers and
                    related paragraphs connected with these issues.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Pleadings concerning breach</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     I struck out the plaintiff’s prayers and
                    pleadings concerning breach of the state tenancy agreement. It was clear that on
                    these points, the plaintiff had no reasonable cause of action. First, with
                    regard to breach of cll 5.1.5 and 7.3 (quoted above at <a href="#p1_3">[3]</a>), it was clear even from the plaintiff’s
                    pleaded case that there had been a breach. The relevant parts of the amended
                    statement of claim read as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">30    As a necessary incident to plant nursery,
                            flower/orchid/ornamental plant production and other landscape-related
                            activities, some of the Plaintiff’s sub-tenants erected makeshift
                            structures for landscape tools, equipment, chemicals, fertilizers and
                            indoor plants.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">46(3)(a)    While some of [the plaintiff’s]
                            sub-tenants had erected agricultural shade nets and temporary structures
                            for landscape tools, equipment, chemicals, fertilizers and indoor
                            plants, this was however a necessary incident to plant nursery,
                            flower/orchid/ornamental plant production and other landscape-related
                            businesses and do not fall within the purview of Clauses 5.1.5 and
                            7.3.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     Clauses 5.1.5 and 7.3 make it clear that the
                    structures erected by the plaintiff’s sub-tenants require prior written
                    approval from the defendant and such approval was not sought before the
                    construction of these structures. The plaintiff had sought to argue that
                    approval could not be unreasonably withheld. However, it was clear that the
                    plaintiff had not even sought approval <em>prior</em> to
                    the construction of the structures. The plaintiff had pleaded in its statement
                    of claim (at 32]) that the
                    defendant had written on or about 21 February 2011 to express concern about
                    the “unauthorised structures.” The plaintiff then pleaded
                        (at [31]) that it had made
                    known the presence of the structures to the defendant by a letter dated
                    2 March 2011 but had received no reply as to whether approval was granted
                    for these structures. In my view, that approval was sought subsequent to the
                    construction of the structures was fatal to the plaintiff’s case on this
                    issue. Even if I had accepted the plaintiff’s argument that it would have
                    been unreasonable for the defendant to withhold approval, that the plaintiff had
                    not even sought approval <em>prior</em> to the construction
                    of these structures renders its case unarguable in the light of the express
                    wording of cll 5.1.5 and 7.3 which require <em>prior</em>
                    written approval/consent.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     As for breach of cl 7.2, I accepted the
                    defendant’s submission that the plaintiff had sublet the premises even
                    before it had sought approval. The plaintiff’s email of 21 December
                    2010, signed off by Philip Teh for the plaintiff, had stated “Please see
                    the attached files of sub tenants as at 1<sup>st</sup>
                    December 2010.” This email demonstrates that approval was sought only
                    after the premises were sublet, contrary to cl 7.2 which requires prior
                    written consent before the premises could be sublet. Although the plaintiff had
                    relied on the defendant’s reply on 22 December 2010 that it would
                    evaluate the request and its subsequent silence as demonstrating approval or
                    waiver, this argument is unsustainable in the light of the defendant’s
                    letter of 3 January 2011 which reiterated the defendant’s position
                    that the plaintiff was not allowed to sublet the premises without obtaining
                    prior approval.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     As for breach of cl 5.1.4, it was plain
                    even from the plaintiff’s documentary evidence that there had been a
                    breach in the sense that the premises were used for purposes other than as a
                    “plant nursery, [or] orchid/flower/ornamental plant production”.
                    Of the many examples, I highlight two. First, one of the plaintiff’s
                    subtenants Red House Carved Furniture Co was selling antique furniture. Philip
                    Teh from the plaintiff wrote an email dated 28 January 2011 to the
                    proprietor of Red House Carved Furniture Co asking it to explain how the
                    products and services fit with the “sanctioned usage”. The
                    proprietor was entirely candid and replied on 8 February 2011 stating the
                    following:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I do hope you’ll give us some time to perform the necessary changes
                        as we still have some old stock from our previous addresses. Our company is
                        slowly moving into a new field of business, from antiques to garden related
                        product, and this transition will require some time to complete.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     Second, one of the plaintiff’s other
                    subtenants, Jehan Gallery Pte Ltd, sold carpets. Plaintiff’s counsel tried
                    her best to argue that these were perhaps “outdoor carpets” and
                    fell within the category of garden furniture. In a moment of levity, the
                    defendant’s counsel stated that he had never heard of “outdoor
                    carpets” to which plaintiff’s counsel replied that she herself
                    owned several outdoor carpets. What was perhaps more important was the fact that
                    the plaintiff’s counsel had no instructions that these were outdoor
                    carpets. The defendant’s affidavits also exhibited photographs showing
                    quite plainly that these were not outdoor carpets.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     I am mindful that the determination of a
                    striking out application should not involve a protracted examination of all the
                    evidence. In the present case, however, even on a cursory examination of the
                    pleadings and the evidence, the plaintiff’s own evidence no less, it was
                    plain and obvious that the plaintiff had breached cll 5.1.4, 5.1.5, 7.2
                    and 7.3.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     I thus struck out the plaintiff’s
                    pleadings suggesting that there had been no breach of these clauses.
                    Nonetheless, I allowed the plaintiff the option of retaining certain pleaded
                    background facts or amending the statement of claim to reintroduce these facts
                    as background facts as these were pertinent to the claim for relief against
                    forfeiture.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Pleadings concerning rectification</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     I struck out the plaintiff’s prayer and
                    related pleadings concerning rectification. The plaintiff had pleaded that the
                    state tenancy agreement did not properly reflect the intentions of the parties.
                    The plaintiff relied on the decision of the House of Lords in <em>Chartbrook Ltd v Persimmon Homes Ltd</em> [2009] 1 AC 1101.
                    In that case, Lord Hoffmann quoted favourably (at [60]) the following
                    passage from Denning LJ’s decision in <em>Frederick E Rose
                        (London) Ltd v William H Pim </em><em>Jnr &amp; Co
                        Ltd</em> [1953] 2 QB 450 at 461:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">If you can predicate with certainty what their contract was, and that it
                        is, by a common mistake, wrongly expressed in the document, then you rectify
                        the document; but nothing less will suffice.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     It was impossible to predicate with certainty
                    what the state tenancy agreement truly was as argued by the plaintiff. This was
                    so as the plaintiff was relying on the pictures in the plaintiff’s
                    presentation tender slides to delineate the scope of the state tenancy agreement
                    which it argued was the true agreement but was wrongly recorded. A picture
                    paints a thousand words and of its many meanings, I am unable to predicate with
                    certainty this alleged contract which the plaintiff argued was actually entered
                    into but unfortunately wrongly expressed in the state tenancy
                agreement.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     For these reasons, I struck out the
                    plaintiff’s pleadings relating to rectification.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     After giving my orders, the parties attended a
                    hearing before me on 9 January 2012 to determine specifically the parts of
                    the plaintiff’s statement of claim which should be struck out. The
                    plaintiff sought to make and did make further arguments. My decision remained
                    unchanged.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     I should add that plaintiff’s counsel
                    also represented Nursery Mart Pte Ltd in Suit 647 of 2011/Z (“Suit
                    647”) against the same defendant. The statement of claim for that suit
                    was substantially similar. The defendant took out similar applications, Summons
                    No 4930 of 2011/A and Summons No 4951 of 2011/Q, to determine the same
                    questions of law and to strike out that claim. Before me, the parties dealt
                    primarily with Suit 649 taking the position that my orders on Suit 647
                    should mirror that for Suit 649. In the result, I made similar orders for
                    the defendant’s applications for Suit 647. My reasoning for those
                    orders was the same as my reasoning for the orders I had made on these
                    applications.</p>
