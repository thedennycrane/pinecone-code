The relevant past judgments are as follows:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) On 26 December 2017, JTA commenced proceedings against the defendants and Cougar Pacific Pte Ltd (“Cougar”) in HC/S 1212/2017 (“Suit 1212”). Cougar is a company incorporated in Singapore, which has the same registered address as GLH and whose sole shareholder is a company owned by a former director of GL Thailand’s subsidiary in Cambodia. JTA’s claim was that GL Thailand and the defendants had conspired to defraud JTA into believing that GL Thailand’s performance was better than it was, and to misappropriate JTA’s investment in GL Thailand to Mr Konoshita’s benefit by lending money to Cougar and the Cyprus companies.</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(i) Pursuant to Suit 1212, JTA then took out an application under HC/SUM 148/2018 (“SUM 148”) to expand the scope of a Mareva injunction granted <span class="font-italic">ex </span><span class="font-italic">parte</span> against several of the defendants in Suit 1212. It also took out an application under HC/SUM 377/2018 (“SUM 377”) for an order that specific conduct by several of the defendants in Suit 1212 be prohibited. On the other hand, GLH and Mr Konoshita took out applications to set aside the <span class="font-italic">ex </span><span class="font-italic">parte</span> Mareva injunction (the “Setting Aside Applications”). The High Court dismissed SUM 148 and SUM 377 and allowed the Setting Aside Applications on 23 February 2018: see <span class="font-italic">JTrust</span><span class="font-italic"> Asia Pte Ltd v Group Lease Holdings Pte Ltd and others </span>[2018] SGHC 38 at [1], [2] and [16].</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(ii) JTA appealed against this decision in CA/CA 46/2018 (“CA 46”). The SGCA allowed the appeal, reinstating the domestic Mareva injunctions against GLH, Mr Konoshita and Cougar, and expanding the injunctions against GLH and Cougar to worldwide Mareva injunctions on 1 June 2018 in <span class="font-italic">JTrust</span><span class="font-italic"> Asia Pte Ltd v Group Lease Holdings Pte Ltd and others </span>[2018] 2 SLR 159 (“<span class="font-italic">CA 46 Decision</span>”) at [3].</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(iii) GLH and Mr Konoshita applied under HC/SUM 5340/2018 (“SUM 5340”) to strike out Suit 1212 but were unsuccessful. The High Court gave its decision on 1 February 2019 in <span class="font-italic">JTrust</span><span class="font-italic"> Asia Pte Ltd v Group Lease Holdings Pte Ltd and others </span>[2019] SGHC 21 at [1] and [11].</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) On 12 February 2020, the High Court gave its decision in respect of Suit 1212 where it dismissed JTA’s claims in the torts of deceit and conspiracy and discharged the domestic Mareva injunction against Mr Konoshita and the worldwide Mareva injunctions against GLH and Cougar: see <span class="font-italic">JTrust</span><span class="font-italic"> Asia Pte Ltd v Group Lease Holdings Pte Ltd and others </span>[2020] SGHC 29 at [25].</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) On 13 February 2020, JTA appealed against the High Court’s decision in Suit 1212 under CA/CA 21/2020 (“CA 21”).</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(i) JTA applied under CA/SUM 21/2020 (“SUM 21”) to reinstate the domestic Mareva injunction against Mr Konoshita and the worldwide Mareva injunctions against GLH and Cougar pending the determination of CA 21. The SGCA gave its decision on 1 June 2020 in <span class="font-italic">JTrust</span><span class="font-italic"> Asia Pte Ltd v Group Lease Holdings Pte Ltd and others </span>[2020] 2 SLR 490, wherein it reinstated the domestic Mareva injunction against Mr Konoshita and the worldwide injunction against GLH but dismissed the application to reinstate the Mareva injunction against Cougar (at [103]).</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(ii) JTA’s appeal in CA 21 was allowed by the SGCA on 6 October 2020: see <span class="font-italic">JTrust</span><span class="font-italic"> Asia Pte Ltd v Group Lease Holdings Pte Ltd and others </span>[2020] 2 SLR 1256 (“<span class="font-italic">CA 21 Decision</span>”) at [3] and [257].</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(iii) Following the <span class="font-italic">CA</span><span class="font-italic"> 21 Decision</span>, JTA brought an application under CA/SUM 132/2020 for the existing Mareva injunctions against GLH, Mr Konoshita and Cougar to remain in effect until the judgment debt and costs were satisfied, and for JTA to be released from undertakings it had provided when the worldwide Mareva injunctions were granted. GLH and Mr Konoshita in turn applied under CA/SUM 133/2020 for the enjoined quantum of the Mareva injunctions to be reduced. On 26 March 2021, in <span class="font-italic">JTrust</span><span class="font-italic"> Asia Pte Ltd v Group Lease Holdings Pte Ltd and others </span>[2021] 1 SLR 1298, the SGCA ordered, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, that the Mareva injunctions be extended until GLH, Mr Konoshita and Cougar satisfied the judgment debt and costs that they owed to JTA, but reduced the enjoined sum (at [3] and [74]): see <span class="font-italic">JTrust</span><span class="font-italic"> Asia v Group Lease Holdings Pte Ltd and others </span>[2021] 1 SLR 1298.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">6 The above disputes – and also the present one – arose out of three investment agreements (“IAs”). Between March 2015 and September 2017, while Mr Konoshita was the chairman of GL Thailand, JTA made investments in GL Thailand pursuant to the following IAs (see <span class="font-italic">CA 21 Decision</span> at [13]):</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The first IA (“1IA”):<span class="font-weight-bold"> </span>On 20 March 2015, JTA invested US$30m under the 1IA which provided that JTA would subscribe to US$30m worth of GL Thailand’s convertible debentures.

JTA completed the subscription on 20 March 2017. If JTA elected not to convert the debentures into shares, it would be entitled to be repaid its investment in 2020.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">All three IAs contained an express warranty in respect of the accuracy of GL Thailand’s consolidated financial statements: see <span class="font-italic">CA 21 Decision</span> at [14].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">7 On 16 October 2017, the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) of Thailand issued a news release (the “SEC News Release”) stating that GLH had issued sham loans under a round-tripping scheme designed to inflate GL Thailand’s operating results. The SEC announced that it had filed a criminal complaint against Mr Konoshita: see <span class="font-italic">CA 21 Decision</span> at [18].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">8 On 26 December 2017, JTA commenced Suit 1212 against, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, the defendants, bringing claims in the torts of unlawful conspiracy and deceit: see <span class="font-italic">CA 21 Decision</span> at [21]. As mentioned above, its claims were dismissed at first instance, but on appeal, the SGCA in CA 21 allowed JTA’s appeal for its claims in deceit and unlawful conspiracy: see <span class="font-italic">CA 21 Decision</span> at [202] and [210].

</div> The SGCA found that the loans made were in fact shams and not <span class="font-italic">bona fide</span>, independent, arm’s length transactions: see <span class="font-italic">CA 21 Decision</span> at [45]. The SGCA allowed JTA’s appeal for its claims in deceit and unlawful conspiracy (see <span class="font-italic">CA 21 Decision</span> at [202] and [210]) and awarded JTA damages for its loss suffered as a result of the exercise of conversion rights of the convertible debentures under the 1IA (see <span class="font-italic">CA 21 Decision</span> at [239]). The SGCA also held that JTA was entitled to the principal sum of US$50m owed under the 3IA, minus the interest it had received (see <span class="font-italic">CA 21 Decision</span> at [246]). However, JTA was unable to establish actual loss for the 2IA at the time, as it was only entitled to be repaid the principal sum of its investments in 2021 and had not proven that GL Thailand would not be able to pay back the principal sum for the 2IA in 2021 (<span class="font-italic">CA 21 Decision</span> at [244]–[245]).

Essentially, it provides that the final judicial pronouncement of a competent court creates legal barriers to re-litigation, and it is founded on two undergirding considerations: the public interest of finality in litigation and the private interest that nobody be proceeded against twice on the same matter (see <span class="font-italic">Turf Club Auto Emporium Pte Ltd and others v Yeo </span><span class="font-italic">Boong Hua and others and another appeal and other matters </span>[2017] 2 SLR 12 (“<span class="font-italic">Turf </span><span class="font-italic">Club</span>”) at [81]). There are three conceptually distinct but interrelated principles which make up the doctrine of <span class="font-italic">res judicata</span> (<span class="font-italic">Turf Club </span>at [82]):</div><div class="mb-3"><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(a) cause of action estoppel;</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(b) issue estoppel; and</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(c) the extended doctrine of <span class="font-italic">res </span><span class="font-italic">judicata</span>, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the defence of abuse of process or the <span class="font-italic">Henderson </span>rule (the “extended doctrine”).</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 Cause of action estoppel holds that when a cause of action has been determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to exist or not to exist between the same parties, that outcome may not be challenged by either party in subsequent proceedings: (see <span class="font-italic">Turf Club </span>at [83]; <span class="font-italic">RBS</span> at [99]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 Issue estoppel is wider in application than cause of action estoppel, and operates as long as some question of fact or law which is necessarily common to both an earlier action and a later action had been decided on the earlier occasion and is binding on the parties, either in the course of the same litigation (<span class="font-italic">eg</span>, as a preliminary point) or in other litigation which raises the same point between the same parties (see <span class="font-italic">Turf Club </span>at [84]; <span class="font-italic">RBS</span> at [100]). The following requirements must be met to establish an issue estoppel (see <span class="font-italic">Turf Club </span>at [87], citing <span class="font-italic">Lee Tat</span><span class="font-italic"> Development Pte Ltd v MCST Plan No 301 </span>[2005] 3 SLR(R) 157 at [14]–[15]):</div><div class="mb-3"><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(a) there must be a final and conclusive judgment on the merits;</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(b) the judgment must be by a court of competent jurisdiction;</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(c) the two actions that are being compared must involve the same parties; and</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(d) there must be identity of subject matter in the two proceedings.</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 That being said, the doctrine of issue estoppel may be excluded in the special circumstance where relevant evidence subsequently becomes available (see <span class="font-italic">Beh Chew Boo v Public Prosecutor</span> [2021] 2 SLR 180 at [39]). This exception has been referred to in local case law as the <span class="font-italic">Arnold </span>exception, taking its name from the House of Lords decision of <span class="font-italic">Arnold </span><span class="font-italic">and others v National Westminster Bank plc </span>[1991] 2 AC 93, where it was considered that there might be “an exception to issue estoppel in the special circumstance that there has become available to a party further material relevant to the correct determination of a point involved in the earlier proceedings”, provided that the further material in question “could not by reasonable diligence have been adduced in those [earlier] proceedings” (at 109A–109B). However, the <span class="font-italic">Arnold</span> exception is a highly circumscribed one, for which five cumulative conditions which must be fulfilled before such exception can arise: (see <span class="font-italic">RBS</span> at [103] and [190]):</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) first, the decision said to give rise to issue estoppel must directly affect the future determination of the rights of the litigants;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) second, the decision must be shown to be clearly wrong;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) third, the error in the decision must be shown to have stemmed from the fact that some point of fact or law relevant to the decision was not taken or argued before the court which made that decision and could not reasonably have been taken or argued on that occasion;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) fourth, there can be no attempt to claw back rights that have accrued pursuant to the erroneous decision or to otherwise undo the effects of that decision; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) fifth, it must be shown that great injustice would result if the litigant in question were estopped from putting forward the particular point which is said to be the subject of issue estoppel – in this regard, if the litigant failed to take advantage of an avenue of appeal that was available to him, it will usually not be possible for him to show that the requisite injustice nevertheless exists.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 Finally, the extended doctrine applies to situations where litigants seek to argue points not previously determined by the court as they had not been brought to the court’s attention but ought properly to have been raised or argued then. The extended doctrine essentially extends the cause of action estoppel and issue estoppel to preclude parties, in the absence of special circumstances, from raising in subsequent proceedings matters which were not, but could and should have been, raised in the earlier proceedings (see <span class="font-italic">Turf Club </span>at [85]; <span class="font-italic">RBS</span> at [101]–[102]).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Decision</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The first and second defendant’s liability in deceit and unlawful means conspiracy was res judicata</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 A major plank of the first and second defendants’ submissions was essentially that JTA’s causes of action in tort and the issue of JTA’s loss under the 2IA were both not complete as the issue of loss and damage had not been resolved in CA 21.

</div> In any event, I did not think it was necessary to consider the operation of cause of action estoppel here. It was clear from the <span class="font-italic">CA</span><span class="font-italic"> 21 Decision</span> that JTA had causes of action in the torts of deceit and conspiracy with respect to the 2IA against the first and second defendants; the real dispute before me was not actually over the question of whether parties were entitled to challenge the existence or non-existence of this cause of action. Instead, the question before me was whether the doctrine of issue estoppel applied in this case; <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, whether the defendants were precluded in OS 780 from litigating <span class="font-italic">issues</span> pertaining to their liability in deceit and conspiracy, in light of the SGCA’s holding in CA 21 that actual loss under 2IA had not been established as it was not evident that GL Thailand would not be able to pay JTA in 2021 for the 2IA (see <span class="font-italic">CA 21 Decision</span> at [243]–[245]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 Turning then to the question of issue estoppel, I was of the view that with respect to the 2IA, the doctrine of issue estoppel would operate to prevent re-litigation of the question of whether the defendants were liable in the torts of deceit and conspiracy. Out of the four requirements to make out issue estoppel (see above at [36]), the first three were clearly met in the present case. It was hence unsurprising that the first and second defendants only appeared to seriously dispute the fourth requirement, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, that there must be identity of subject matter in both CA 21 and the present proceedings.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 The first and second defendants contended that there was no final and conclusive judgment on the merits in the <span class="font-italic">CA 21 Decision</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>in relation to the issue of JTA’s loss under the 2IA, and hence the <span class="font-italic">CA 21 Decision</span> had no preclusive effect on their ability to defend themselves on the issue of loss and damage.

</div>
</div>
</div> I did not agree with this line of argument. With respect to JTA’s claim in deceit, the SGCA had found in the <span class="font-italic">CA 21 Decision</span> that:</div><div class="mb-3"><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(a) GLH had made false representations of fact to JTA through GL Thailand’s financial statements (at [146]);</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(b) Mr Konoshita and GLH had both made false representations of fact (at [165]); and</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(c) JTA had relied on Mr Konoshita’s representations along with GL Thailand’s financial statements before entering into the 2IA (at [172]);</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(d) JTA had established dishonest intent on the part of GLH and Mr Konoshita (at [192], [194]–[201]); and</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(e) JTA had made out all the elements of its claim in deceit against GLH and Mr Konoshita (at [202]).</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 With respect to JTA’s claim in unlawful conspiracy, the SGCA held that the first to seventh respondents in CA 21 had intended to cause loss to JTA and were liable for the unlawful conspiracy claim (at [210]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 The SGCA proceeded to note at [221] that:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Having found [Mr Konoshita] and GLH liable for the deceit claim and the first to seventh respondents liable for the unlawful conspiracy claim, we now turn to the assessment of damages.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">It then held that actual loss under 2IA had not been established as it was not evident that GL Thailand would not be able to pay JTA in 2021 for the 2IA (see <span class="font-italic">CA 21 Decision</span> at [243]–[245]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 From the above, it was clear to me that the only question of fact and/or law which was <span class="font-italic">not</span> caught by issue estoppel was the question of the quantum of damages to which JTA was entitled under the 2IA following its maturity, and GL Thailand’s non-payment of the principal sum. This question could be considered in the present application and will be addressed later in these grounds. Other questions pertaining to liability in deceit and/or unlawful conspiracy were however already resolved in CA 21 and could not be re-litigated in the present application.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 Turning to another point, the first and second defendants also submitted that although the SGCA had accepted JTA’s claims mounted on the basis of the SEC News Release, the SGCA had not yet considered the NPO as well as the Thai Civil Case, which had not yet been concluded at the material time. Preliminarily and for the sake of clarity, while Suit 1212 was commenced soon after the SEC News Release, I did not think that the subsequent and final decision in CA 21 was based solely on the SEC News Release. Rather, the SGCA had premised its findings in respect of GLH’s liability on evidence of: (a) two levels of round-tripping, which in turn showed that there had been sham loans designed to misrepresent GL Thailand’s profitability; (b) the unusual and suspicious nature of the loans in question; and (c) Mr Konoshita’s beneficial ownership of the third to seventh respondent borrowers, which included the Cyprus companies (see <span class="font-italic">CA 21 Decision </span>at [46]–[86], [101]–[111]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 Turning then to the NPO, I did not think the NPO sufficed to change the complexion of JTA’s case against GLH, such that the <span class="font-italic">Arnold </span>exception would thereby arise in GLH’s favour. Applying the cumulative conditions of the <span class="font-italic">Arnold </span>exception (see above at [37]), I did not see how the NPO would establish that CA 21 had been clearly wrong. The NPO was concerned with criminal fraud as defined in s 341 of the Thai Penal Code. This had no bearing on the SGCA’s finding of whether the elements of deceit and unlawful means conspiracy in Singapore tort law were made out; the NPO did not throw up any new evidence that would be relevant to establishing the first and second defendant’s liability for the torts of deceit and unlawful means conspiracy.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 As for the Thai Civil Case, this was a claim for contractual damages against GL Thailand on the basis of JTA’s Avoidance Notice of the 2IA and was distinct from the loss and damage claimed for here, which instead was based on JTA’s claim that it entered into the 2IA as a result of the defendants’ deceit and conspiracy. Accordingly, I did not see how any decision in the Thai Civil Case would engage the <span class="font-italic">Arnold </span>exception since it would not be relevant to the first and second defendant’s liability in tort. Further, as noted by JTA, the <span class="font-italic">CA 46 Decision </span>had already held at [50] that JTA’s contractual claim against GL Thailand in the Thai proceedings was separate from its claims in tort in Singapore against entities which it alleged to be part of a conspiracy to defraud it.

</div>
</div> I saw little merit in this line of argument. It was already established in the <span class="font-italic">CA 21 Decision</span> that JTA’s loss and damage arose from the tortious wrongs inflicted by the defendants. Moreover, JTA was entitled to seek legal remedies for alleged wrongs that it had sustained; I did not see how doing so would constitute unreasonable intervening conduct.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 Turning back to the <span class="font-italic">quantum </span>of damages, I was of the view that JTA is entitled to the principal sum under the 2IA of US$130m less interest already received. After deducting the interest already received, I found the first and second defendants jointly and severally liable to pay JTA the sum of US$124,474,854.00, with interest to accrue on the said sum at the rate of 5.33% per annum from 1 August 2021 to the date of full payment.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Whether a case management stay should be granted</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 Finally, I turn to the question of whether a case management stay should be granted. For case management concerns to be relevant at all, there must be the existence or at least the imminence of separate legal proceedings giving rise to a real risk of overlapping issues. The typical case would be one where, in the action, there was some overlap in the parties, some overlap in the issues engaged, and possibly an underlap in the remedies to be granted: see <span class="font-italic">Rex International Holding Ltd and another v Gulf Hibiscus Ltd</span> [2019] 2 SLR 682 at [11].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 I was not minded to grant a case management stay with respect to OS 780. The Thai Civil Claim, for one, was against GL Thailand and there was hence no overlap in parties. The issues also differed sufficiently as the Thai Civil Claim is for a contractual claim. Moreover, given what I had found above with respect to issue estoppel, I also did not think the other live Thai proceedings – which were largely concerned with questions of contractual liability, unlawful commencement of proceedings or criminal complaints under the laws of Thailand – were relevant to or had any bearing on the findings and orders granted in OS 780.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 Further, as submitted by JTA,
