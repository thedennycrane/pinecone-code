<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       This matter came before me on the application of
                    Mr Soo Ngak Hee (the “Applicant”) for a declaration that his
                    younger brother, Mr Soh Ngak Wee (“SNW”) be presumed dead. The
                    application was made on the basis that SNW had disappeared and had not been seen
                    by any member of his family since April 2001. I granted the application and now
                    wish to give the reasons for my decision.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Facts</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The facts stated in this judgment are taken from
                    the affidavits filed by the following members of SNW’s family: his mother,
                    Mdm Ong Ah Kiau, his sisters Ms Soh Geok Cheng and Ms Soh Moey
                    Khia, and the Applicant himself.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       SNW was born on 19 November 1953. After
                    completing his education, he worked as a manual labourer. Prior to the year
                    2000, SNW was working in a shipyard and, for a while, he was living in rented
                    accommodation with a friend. He was not married. Sometime in 2000, SNW suffered
                    a stroke and fell and had trouble walking thereafter. As a result, he lost his
                    job and did not manage to find another one. He then moved back to live with his
                    parents. From then on, he was unemployed and was supported by his
                    siblings.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       A few months after losing his job, on
                    28 October 2000, SNW was admitted to the Institute of Mental Health by the
                    police when he was found making a lot of noise in a public place. He was
                    apparently stressed and depressed about a prospective change of residence. The
                    Applicant took SNW out of the hospital three days later as the family felt that
                    he would be better off at home. About two months later, SNW and his parents
                    moved to Block 264, Jurong East Street 24, #04-521, Singapore (“the
                    flat”). The flat is held in the joint names of Mdm Ong and
                    SNW.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       On 14 March 2001, Mdm Ong and SNW made
                    joint wills. This was done at SNW’s suggestion. In both wills, Ms Soh
                    Geok Cheng was appointed sole Executrix and Trustee. In his will, SNW stated
                    that upon his death, his share in the flat should be given to Mdm Ong but
                    that if Mdm Ong should predecease him, then the flat should be given to
                    Ms Soh Geok Cheng. Mdm Ong’s will stated that upon her death,
                    the flat should be given to SNW but if he should predecease her, then it should
                    go to Ms Soh Geok Cheng.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       According to Mdm Ong, SNW left home on
                    14 April 2001 at about 7.30am and did not return that night or thereafter.
                    Subsequent checks revealed that he had not taken any of his personal belongings
                    with him, including his passport. He had with him only the clothes on his back,
                    his IC and whatever little cash he then had in his wallet.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       A week after SNW’s disappearance,
                    Mdm Ong contacted the Applicant and told him that SNW had been missing for
                    a week. The Applicant began searching for SNW. Acting on a tip from two of
                    SNW’s friends, the Applicant visited the Jalan Bahar cemetery. SNW had a
                    vegetable plot there which he tended daily. The Applicant did not find SNW at
                    the cemetery although he noted that the latter’s motorcycle had been
                    abandoned there. The Applicant walked around the cemetery for a few hours but
                    there was no trace of SNW.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       SNW did not return home or contact any of his
                    siblings over the next few weeks. On 24 May 2001, the Applicant made a police
                    report about SNW having gone missing. The police refused to accept the report
                    until they had confirmed that SNW was not in prison, in any hospital or the
                    Institute of Mental Health. The police made immediate checks with these
                    institutions and then informed the Applicant that SNW could not be located in
                    any of them. Until today, the police have not been able to trace
                SNW.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       In July 2007, the Applicant placed an
                    advertisement in the Lian He Zao Bao newspaper in an attempt to trace SNW. There
                    was no response to this advertisement. The Applicant also returned to the
                    cemetery about seven years after SNW’s disappearance. He found that the
                    land had been cleared for redevelopment and the motorcycle had
                    disappeared.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     In his affidavit made in July 2010, the
                    Applicant stated that there were no further avenues that he could pursue to
                    search for SNW. None of the members of SNW’s family had had any contact
                    with SNW for the past nine years. They had absolutely no knowledge of his
                    whereabouts.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     The Applicant was of the view that it was
                    abnormal for SNW to have ceased contact with his siblings and his parents
                    (SNW’s father died only in 2009). SNW had relied on his family for
                    financial support and was close to Mdm Ong. There were no family quarrels
                    and thus it was very strange that he had not contacted them in the previous nine
                    years and had not enquired about Mdm Ong to whom he was close. This opinion
                    was echoed by SNW’s two sisters who both described him as being a quiet
                    and home-loving person.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     The Applicant explained the reason for the
                    application. As Mdm Ong is now 84 years old, the Applicant wished to obtain
                    an order for presumption of death so that in the event of her demise, the flat
                    would not be left in limbo with SNW as the permanently absent owner of the
                    flat.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     On the above facts, the question that I had to
                    answer was whether there was sufficient evidence for me to make an order that
                    SNW be presumed to be dead.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The Evidence Act</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     There are two sections in the Evidence Act
                    (Cap 97, 1997 Rev Ed) (“the Act”) which deal with the
                    presumption of death, <em>viz</em>, ss 109 and 110.
                    These provide:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>Burden of proving death of person known to have been
                            alive within 30 years</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>109</b>.    When the question
                            is whether a man is alive or dead, and it is shown that he was alive
                            within 30 years, the burden of proving that he is dead is on the person
                            who affirms it.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>Burden of proving that person is alive who has not been
                            heard of for 7 years</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>110</b>.    When the question
                            is whether a man is alive or dead, and it is proved that he has not been
                            heard of for 7 years by those who would naturally have heard of him if
                            he had been alive, the burden of proving that he is alive is shifted to
                            the person who affirms it.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     In <em>Re Wong Sook Mun
                        Christina</em> [2005] 3 SLR(R) 329;
                    [2005] SGHC 100 (“<em>Christina
                    Wong</em>”), the High Court held that s 110 is a proviso to
                    s 109. Section 109 applies to impose the burden of proof on an applicant
                    who asserts that a person is dead, if that person has been alive within the past
                    30 years (as in the present case). However, if such person has not been heard of
                    for seven years by those who would naturally have heard of him, s 110 would
                    then apply to shift the burden of proof back to any person who asserts that the
                    person concerned is still alive. If there is no one interested in asserting that
                    the person concerned is alive, however, s 110 can apply in order to
                    establish the presumption of the fact of death, though not to establish the
                    particular time of death: <em>Christina Wong</em> at [14] -
                    [19]. <em>Christina Wong</em> followed the approach taken
                    in the Malaysian case of <em>Re Osman bin Bachit</em>
                    [1997] 4 MLJ 445 (“<em>Osman bin
                        Bachit</em>”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     Therefore, in a case where the alleged
                    deceased has not been heard of for seven years by persons who would naturally
                    have heard of him, an applicant for a declaration of death can rely on
                    s 110 to invoke the presumption of death because the presumption of
                    continuance of life which s 109 contains would have ended.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     On a plain reading of s 110, there are
                    two elements required to shift the burden of proof to one who asserts
                    continuance of life:</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(a)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">The person must not have been heard of for seven
                            years; and</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(b)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">The person must not have been heard of by those
                            who would naturally have heard of him if he had been
                        alive.</div>
<p class="Judg-1">These elements were also referred to in <em>Christina
                        Wong</em> and <em>Osman bin Bachit</em>. The
                    question that arises is whether there is a third element, <em>ie</em>, that the applicant must show that sufficient steps have been
                    taken to ascertain whether the person is alive. This requirement does not appear
                    on the wording of s 110 but is a common law principle that was read into
                    s 110 in <em>Christina Wong</em> (at [30]) to prevent
                    the section being abused as “a device of convenience” where proof
                    of a person’s death by another means exists.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Are the requirements satisfied?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     The first requirement that the alleged
                    deceased must have not been heard of for seven years was clearly satisfied in
                    this case: SNW had been missing for more than nine years.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     The second requirement was that SNW should not
                    have been heard of by those who would naturally have heard of him, if he had
                    been alive. The category of “those who would naturally have heard
                    of” the deceased if he had been alive would usually comprise persons
                    related to the deceased “by virtue of blood or marital ties: <em>Christina Wong</em> at [23]. In <em>Osman bin
                        Bachit</em> (at 448) the court referred to the English case of
                        <em>Doe d’France v Andrews</em> (1850)
                    15 QBD 756 and held that such persons would be “close relatives
                    or neighbours”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     In the situation where the alleged deceased
                    had an estranged relationship with his family such that he would want nothing to
                    do with them, however, the family would not fall into the category of persons
                    who would “naturally have heard of” him. Such was the case in
                        <em>Christina Wong</em> where the judge found that
                    there had been an “irreparable rent in the fabric of familial
                    relations” (at [23]). There, the applicant’s father was totally
                    estranged from his wife and children in Singapore and, from his conduct,
                    appeared to want to have nothing more to do with them. Thus, the court held that
                    the applicant and her family could not fall into the category of persons
                    mentioned in s 110. That being the case, s 110 could not be used to
                    assist the applicant in <em>Christina
                Wong</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     The circumstances here were different. I was
                    satisfied that SNW had good relationship with his parents and siblings prior to
                    his disappearance. He was especially close to his mother and was living with
                    her. He was on good terms with the Applicant and his sisters and depended on
                    them financially. There were no family quarrels prior to SNW’s
                    disappearance. He was not married and did not have any girlfriends and was not
                    close to his relatives outside the immediate family circle. I was satisfied that
                    the evidence established, on a balance of probabilities, that if SNW was alive
                    he would contact his siblings and parents. This was clearly a case where there
                    were people who would naturally have heard of the alleged deceased if he had
                    been alive, yet they had not heard of him for more than seven years. The second
                    requirement was therefore established.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     The next point was whether I should go on to
                    consider if the Applicant had fulfilled the third requirement posited in
                        <em>Christina Wong</em>, that of making sufficient
                    enquiries to ascertain whether SNW was alive. This was a common law requirement
                    as can be seen from the case of <em>Chard v Chard (Orse.
                        Northcott), Haye, Winstanley, Lord and Norris</em>
                    [1956] P 259 where Sachs J stated at 270 and 272:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I respectfully agree with Harman J.’s conclusion in <em>In re Watkins</em> [1953] 1 W.L.R. 1323 that,
                        where no statue applies, there is no “magic” in the mere fact
                        of a period of seven years elapsing without there being positive evidence of
                        a person being alive. It is, generally speaking, a matter in each case of
                        taking the facts as a whole and of balancing, as a jury would, the
                        respective probabilities of life continuing and having ceased.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[...]</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">My view is thus that in matters where no statute lays down an applicable
                        rule, the issue of whether a person is, or is not to be presumed dead, is
                        generally speaking one of fact and not subject to a presumption of
                        law.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">To that there is an exception which can be assumed without affecting the
                        present case. By virtue of a long sequence of judicial statements, which
                        either assert or assume such a rule, it appears accepted that there is a
                        convenient presumption of law applicable to certain cases of seven
                        years’ absence where no statue applies. That presumption in its modern
                        shape takes effect (without examining its terms too exactly) substantially
                        as follows. Where as regards “A.B.” there is no acceptable
                        affirmative evidence that he was alive at some time during a continuous
                        period of seven years or more, then if it can be proved first, that there
                        are persons who would be likely to have heard of him over that period,
                        secondly that those persons have not heard of him, and thirdly that all due
                        inquiries have been made appropriate to the circumstances,
                        “A.B.” will be presumed to have died at some time within that
                        period. (Such a presumption would, of course be one of law, and could not be
                        one of fact, because there can hardly be a logical inference from any
                        particular set of facts that a man had not died within 2,555 days but had
                        died within 2,560.)</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     In <em>Christina
                        Wong</em>, Andrew Phang JC (as he then was) recognised that the
                    third requirement was not statutorily imposed in Singapore but considered that
                    it should be adhered to as a matter set down by common law:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">30    In any event, however, it was clear to me that, on
                            the facts of the present case, the applicant had not taken sufficient
                            steps to ascertain whether or not her father was still alive. It is true
                            that, on a literal construction of s 110 itself, it might be argued
                            that that provision does not include this particular requirement. At
                            common law, however, it appears clear that this is indeed a requirement
                            [...] It appears to me that both logic and common sense (as well as the
                            common law from which the present provision was in fact derived) suggest
                            that such a requirement ought to be incorporated as part of s 110
                            itself, and this view appears to have been confirmed in the Malaysian
                            context (see the Malaysian High Court decision of <em>Re
                                Gun Soon Thin</em> [1997] 2 MLJ 351 at 359). Such an
                            approach acknowledges that the operation of s 110 is not one-sided,
                            so to speak. Indeed, an extreme example occurs where it is sought to
                            invoke s 110 where another method for proving the death of a
                            particular individual clearly exists. Such a use of s 110 as a
                            device of convenience may in fact border on abuse and cannot be
                            permitted, as the Singapore High Court decision of <em>Lim Ah Khee v Legal Representative of the Estate of Ong Koh
                                Tee</em>, <em>deceased</em> [1994]
                            2 SLR 769 clearly illustrates.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     With due respect, I do not find it necessary
                    to add the third requirement as a compulsory requirement which has to be
                    fulfilled before a court can hold that the burden of proving that an alleged
                    deceased person is still alive has shifted to those asserting that fact. To me,
                    it would all depend on the circumstances before the court as to whether it
                    should require any particular applicant to fulfil the third requirement before
                    applying the presumption. In <em>Christina Wong</em>, the
                    second requirement of s 110 had not been fulfilled so it was not possible
                    to invoke the aid of that section and the applicant had to in fact prove her
                    father’s death. In those circumstances, clearly all due and sufficient
                    steps and inquiries needed to be made to establish that fact. To the extent that
                    the judgment in <em>Christina Wong</em> implies that such
                    inquiries are invariably necessary before s 110 can be invoked, I consider
                    the holding to be <em>obiter</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     I was, in any case, satisfied that the
                    Applicant here had made sufficient inquiries and taken sufficient steps to
                    establish whether SNW was still alive. He did the following:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_25-p2_a"></a>(a)     When he knew that SNW had gone
                        missing, he contacted the two friends he knew that SNW had, and asked them
                        if they had been in touch with him, and if they knew where he could be. They
                        replied that they had not heard from him, but suggested he search in Jalan
                        Bahar cemetery, which was where SNW went regularly to tend his vegetable
                        plot. Sometime in late April 2001/early May 2001, the Applicant searched the
                        whole perimeter of the cemetery, to no avail. He only found SNW’s
                        motorcycle.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_25-p2_b"></a>(b)     The
                        Applicant lodged a police report on SNW’s disappearance on 24 May
                        2001. The police ran a check on their computer network to search for records
                        of SNW in the hospitals, prisons and the Institute of Mental Health. Their
                        check did not yield any positive results. The police have not been able to
                        locate SNW to date.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_25-p2_c"></a>(c)     The Applicant placed a missing person advertisement in the Chinese
                        daily newspaper, “Lianhe Zaobao”, on 14 July 2007 but no
                        responses were received.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_25-p2_d"></a>(d)     The Applicant also returned to the cemetery in 2008 to
                        search for SNW but found the motorcycle gone and the land cleared for
                        redevelopment.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_25-p2_e"></a>(e)     An Internet search on the Google search engine did not give any positive
                        hits.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     I agreed with counsel’s submission that
                    the Applicant and his family had done all that could reasonably be expected to
                    be done in this regard, given their knowledge of SNW’s acquaintances,
                    routine and habits. There were no other leads they could follow. The situation
                    here was quite different from that in <em>Christina
                        Wong</em> where the alleged deceased had emigrated to the United
                    States and where the judge held that various efforts made to trace him in the
                    United States were token efforts and insufficient.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     I was also buttressed in my decision by the
                    English case of <em>Bullock v Bullock</em> [1960]
                    1 WLR 975 where <em>no</em> efforts were made by
                    the wife to look for the husband yet the court proceeded to make a declaration
                    that the husband be presumed dead. In that case, the wife had gone to court and
                    obtained a committal order against the husband in relation to a matrimonial
                    dispute. The police were enlisted to search for the husband, and failed to find
                    him. The court held that the applicant wife had made sufficient inquiries to
                    find her husband by going to court and enlisting the police to find her husband,
                    and that she could “be excused for not having any hope of succeeding
                    where the police have failed” (<em>per</em>
                    Collingwood J at 982). I would simply add that the sufficiency of the steps
                    taken to locate an alleged deceased must always be a question of what is
                    reasonable in the circumstances of the case having regard to the characteristics
                    of the alleged deceased, the circumstances in which he disappeared and the
                    circumstances relating to his relationships with friends and
                family.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     The facts before me showed that SNW appeared
                    depressed at the time of his disappearance. A year earlier, he had suffered a
                    stroke which caused him difficulty in walking and to lose his job. He was unable
                    to find another job and was forced to move back to live with his parents and to
                    depend financially on his siblings. He had made a will about a month before he
                    disappeared and it is possible that he was preparing for his death. In any
                    event, his sudden disappearance from the home which he jointly owned, without
                    taking any of his personal belongings or his passport and without any cause to
                    leave, was inexplicable. He had no financial resources which would have allowed
                    him to live on his own. Yet for nine years after his disappearance, nothing more
                    was heard of him. It appeared to me, on a balance of probabilities, that he must
                    have died sometime during that period.</p>
