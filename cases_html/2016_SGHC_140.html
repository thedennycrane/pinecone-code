The parties agreed that the appropriate order was a buyout order. However, whilst the 1st to 6th defendants were prepared to buy out the plaintiffs, the plaintiffs themselves wanted to buy out the 1st to 6th defendants. In the circumstances, the parties asked this court to decide a single issue: whether the order should be for the 1st to 6th defendants to purchase the plaintiffs’ shares in the 7th to 16th defendants, or for the plaintiffs to purchase the 1st to 6th defendants’ shares in the 7th to 16th defendants. It was also agreed that the buyout order would be at a price to be determined by an independent valuer to be appointed. The appointment of the valuer, the reference date and the costs of the valuation will be decided by this court if the parties cannot agree on the same within 30 days of the buyout order being made. A consent order was entered to reflect the parties’ agreement. I would add that the parties do not want the companies to be wound up and, indeed, there is no reason to wind up the companies.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Background</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">3 In 1975, a partnership called Samwoh Transport and Trading (“Samwoh Trading”) was formed by three friends, Mr Koh Keng Chew, Mr Soh Kim Seng and the late Mr Pang Chok. It was in the transport and logistics business. Subsequently, three additional partners came on board: Mr Wang Nee Chon and Mr Liew Chiew Woon in 1978, and Mr Poh Choon Huat in 1980.

In my view, it would be wrong in this case to attribute the success of the Samwoh Group to any one individual or family.

Elvin Koh did say that the shareholders should choose another MD if they felt someone else would better serve as the leader but not that he wished to resign from the Board. Both Eric Soh and Pang KL admitted, after extensive questioning, that they did not have any reason for believing that Elvin Koh wanted to resign as a director.

</div> In fact, it appears that the reason they had decided on voting by poll when it came to re-electing the Board at the EGM on 13 May (see [25] above) was so that Pang KL and Eric Soh could vote in favour of Elvin Koh’s re-election. This plan was carried out at the EGM. The plaintiffs submitted that the voting arrangement was a purely tactical move to make it more difficult for Elvin Koh to complain about not being re-elected by pretending that the initiative to remove Elvin Koh did not come from Pang KL and Eric Soh.

The evidence shows that Pang KL was unhappy with Elvin Koh’s disagreement with her decision to appoint a new FC. As the dispute escalated, Elvin Koh’s insistence on having a casting vote very likely upset the 1st to 6th defendants as the casting vote would mean that Elvin Koh and Koh HL would control the Board. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 However, as shareholders, the 1st to 6th defendants were entitled to remove Elvin Koh as MD and director. There was no mutual understanding that Elvin Koh would remain as MD or as director. Indeed, at the EGM, Elvin Koh admitted that the shareholders had the right to remove him although he had not expected them to make the decision they had (see [25] above). In his oral testimony, Koh HL also agreed that the shareholders had “the authority” to remove Elvin Koh as a director.

It seems to me that if Elvin Koh had realised that the waiver had been amended, it is highly likely that he would have complained about not having been told about the amendment. It is also highly likely that he would have sought legal advice on the amended waiver clause, especially given the strained relationship between Pang KL and him by then.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 The plaintiffs submitted that the surreptitious amendment of the settlement agreement was intended to stymie claims by Elvin Koh as a shareholder. However, the 1st to 6th defendants confirmed that they were not in fact relying on the waiver clause. On the stand, Pang KL unhesitatingly accepted that the waiver clause did not preclude Elvin Koh from bringing a claim as a shareholder.

</div>
</div> I agree with the plaintiffs that both measures were in fact targeted at Koh HL. However, the measures were put in place because of concerns over the potential conflicts of interest arising out of Elvin Koh’s competing business, Koh HL’s relationship to Elvin Koh, and Koh KL’s participation in this suit. Therefore, I do not think that the fact that the measures were targeted at only Koh KL is cause for complaint.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 However, the question remains whether the decision to impose the measures on Koh HL was unfair. The 1st to 6th defendants claimed that there was a real risk of sensitive information being leaked to Elvin Koh’s competing business, a risk which was particularly pronounced given the competitive and sensitive nature of pricing in the asphalt premix business and Koh HL’s close relationship with Elvin Koh.

</div> They submitted that their suspicions were confirmed by two observations. First, Elvin Koh learnt about Samwoh Group’s performance in 2015 based on information “from [his] brothers”.

</div> However, there was no evidence that Elvin Koh had been told anything more specific about the Samwoh Group’s performance other than that the Group had done well. I do not see anything wrong in a director (Koh HL) telling a shareholder (Elvin Koh) that the Group had done well. As for the fact that United E&amp;P had successfully bid for contracts from Samwoh Corp’s clients, this could not have been surprising given that Elvin Koh had led the Samwoh Group as MD for several years and would have built a relationship with these clients. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 In my view, the Board did not have sufficient grounds to show that Koh HL had leaked or would leak sensitive financial information to Elvin Koh. All they had was a suspicion. Nevertheless, given Koh HL’s relationship to Elvin Koh and his participation as a plaintiff in this suit, I do not think it was unreasonable for the Board to restrict Koh HL’s access to information that was sensitive with respect to United E&amp;P or this suit. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 It would be unreasonable if the Board used the measures to restrict Koh HL’s access to other information. However, there was no evidence that the Board has done so. There was evidence that Koh HL made two requests for “sensitive documents”. The first, made on 17 April 2015, was for documents in litigation over companies known as Knight Synergy and Synergy GeoTech. This request was discussed at a Board meeting of 18 April 2015, and Eric Soh directed the documents to be made available and for the review to be carried out in a specific room.

</div> The second request pertained to resignation letters, exit interview documents, and warning letters, and was made via email on 5 May 2015. Dr Ho asked Koh HL why he required the documents. Although it is not clear if the Board had any reason to deny Koh HL access to these documents, there was no evidence that Koh KL pursued this request any further.

The part allegedly tampered with was Side A of the second cassette tape, which recorded the 8 June 2012 meeting from the start of the tape to about the 37-minute mark (“the Partial Recording”).

Since the recorder was placed on the table, it was unlikely that anyone could have caused friction intervention, much less battery intervention, during the course of the meeting without being noticed. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">77 Therefore, Mr Garde suggested that one of the attendees covertly used a second recorder to record the meeting; he called this the two-recorder hypothesis.

</div>
</div> On this hypothesis, someone made a recording but probably terminated it prematurely and then interchanged it with the original recording. The Tape Speed issue on the second recorder could have been due to any of the three causes, most likely friction or battery interventions. In my view, Mr Garde’s two-recorder hypothesis is also unlikely. First, there is no evidence whatsoever as to who might have made this covert recording. Second, it does not seem likely that anyone could have made a covert recording and physically manipulated the recording speed using either friction or battery interventions without being noticed. Ms Koh testified that she, Elvin Koh and Pang KL were seated quite close together.

</div> There is no reason to believe that it was any different for the others who were at the meeting.

Mr Garde has not managed to rule out battery failure as a cause of the Tape Speed issue.

Mr Garde’s hypothesis for the Tape Speed issue was that someone covertly recorded the meeting (“the 2nd cassette”), covertly intervened with the recording speed and then covertly interchanged the 2nd cassette with the one originally made by Ms Koh (“the 1st cassette”). However, according to Ms Koh (who was the plaintiffs’ witness), the recording was clear, audible and complete when she listened to it sometime in June 2012 to prepare the minutes of the meeting.

As for the Transient Events, based on Mr Garde’s theory that the cassette tape was a copy, someone would have had to obtain the 2nd cassette, make a copy of that and create the Transient Events during the copy process (“the 3rd cassette”), and then make a second switch to replace the 2nd cassette with the 3rd cassette. On top of it all, the 3rd cassette had to be made using one of the used cassette tapes containing a recording of a previous meeting (see [73(b)]). I find this whole chain of events to be highly improbable. There was also no discernible reason why the 1st to 6th defendants would have done any of this when the comprehensive minutes had been approved at the 31 October 2012 Advisors’ meeting and the plaintiffs had no real issue with the contents of the minutes.      </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">83 Both experts’ evidence could not satisfactorily explain the Tape Speed issue or the Transient Events. However, the burden is on the plaintiffs to prove their allegation that the tape recording had been tampered with. As I am not persuaded by Mr Garde’s explanations, the plaintiffs have therefore not discharged their burden of proving that any or all of the 1st to 6th defendants tampered with the tape recording of the 8 June 2012 meeting.   </div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">Digital recordings  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">84 The digital recordings were of the 7 February 2013, 7 August 2013 and 24 October 2013 meetings.

The experts could find no trace of Sony Silver being connected to Felicia Chen’s computer or laptop on the dates the audio recordings were allegedly transferred from the Sony Silver. This made it possible that the files were manipulated before transfer. There were two ways to transfer the files: using an external medium such as a USB stick or SD card, or plugging in the Sony Silver directly into the laptop using its internal USB jack. The experts agreed that it would be impossible to trace any transfer if external media were used.

</div> The Sony Silver was not produced for inspection. Pang KL’s explanation was that she did not know that Samwoh Corp had a Sony Silver recorder until Mr Rule’s forensic investigation revealed that a device other than those which had been produced had been used to record the meetings of 7 August 2013 and 23 October 2013. She contacted Felicia Chen (who had by then left Samwoh Corp’s employ) who told her about the existence of Sony Silver. She then located and handed over Sony Silver on 18 November 2015.

However, this was not a case where Pang KL instructed Felicia Chen not to hand over Sony Silver. Rather, Felicia Chen wanted to hold on to Sony Silver as it was her working recorder and Pang KL agreed. Pang KL should have consulted her lawyers before agreeing to Felicia Chen’s request.

The 1st to 6th defendants planned to remove Elvin Koh as MD and director at the 13 May EGM.

</div> The facts alleged by the plaintiffs, even if true, would at best justify a finding of “ordinary” oppression. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) In addition, a minority buyout would be highly likely to be disruptive. It would result in a likely replacement of four out of five directors on the Samwoh board and trigger change of shareholding default clauses in Samwoh Group’s banking facilities due to the significant change of shareholding (as compared to the change of shareholding if the 1st to 6th defendants were to purchase the plaintiff’s shares). </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Lastly, a minority buyout order would likely result in a merger between Elvin Koh’s United E&amp;P and the Samwoh Group, which would require approval from the Competition Commission of Singapore (“CCS”). If CCS approval were granted, it would not be for some time, and it was unclear who should manage the Samwoh Group in the meantime. If CCS approval were not granted, Samwoh Group might be required to dispose of operations or assets, and there had been no suggestions by the plaintiffs on how this could be done. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The applicable legal principles </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">97 Section 216 of the Companies Act confers personal remedies on the applicant shareholder in cases of oppression or injustice. To bring an action under s 216, an applicant must show that the conduct complained of affected him in his capacity as a shareholder. Any remedy granted under s 216(2) must be granted “with a view to bringing to an end or remedying the matters complained of”. There is no doubt that the range of remedies which the court has the power to grant includes a minority buyout order.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">98 However, it was common ground that a minority buyout order is the less usual remedy. As pointed out in Hans Tjio, Pearlie Koh &amp; Lee Pey Woan, <span class="font-italic">Corporate Law</span> (Academy Publishing, 2015) at para 11.088:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Section 216(2)(d) contemplates a situation in which the shares of the applicant are purchased from him. This is by far the more usual form of the order and allows the applicant to realise his investment in the company at a fair value. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">99 In <span class="font-italic">Fedorovitch</span><span class="font-italic"> v St Aubins Pty Ltd (No 2)</span> [1999] NSWSC 776 (“<span class="font-italic">Fed</span><span class="font-italic">orovitch</span>”), Young J explained the purpose of a remedy under the equivalent provision of s 216 as follows (at [9]): </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Since its original appearance in the Act, the section has been reframed to allow other remedies, so that today the prime remedy is a buy-out by one side of the other. Essentially, however, the aim still is to permit the minority to free its capital, even though it has locked its capital into a venture. The reason for this is that it is unfair that the capital should continue to be locked up if the circumstances are indicative of oppression. <span class="font-italic">Accordingly, the prime thrust of the section is to either make the venture work so that the capital is properly employed, or to allow the capital to be removed. It is not for punishment or compensation or for making the profit that ought to have been made had the venture been successful.</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">100 It has also been said that a minority buyout order should be “cautiously made for it amounts to a judicially endorsed compulsory acquisition of the majority’s shares”: Margaret Chew, <span class="font-italic">Minority Shareholders’ Rights and Remedies</span> (LexisNexis, 2nd Ed, 2007) (“<span class="font-italic">Minority Shareholders’ Rights and Remedies</span>”)<span class="font-italic"> </span>at 238.<span class="font-italic"> </span>The court would be more inclined to order the purchase of the applicant shareholder’s shares because “it is one thing to allow the [applicant] to realise his interest in the company and quite another thing compulsorily to expropriate the interests of other members, who will usually constitute the majority”: Robert Hollington QC, <span class="font-italic">Hollington</span><span class="font-italic"> on Shareholder’s Rights </span>(Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 7th Ed, 2013) at para 8-51. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">101 A minority buyout order exceeds the purpose of allowing the minority shareholder to exit the company. Instead, it punishes the majority and amounts to an expropriation of the majority’s shares. For these reasons, in my view, there must be something more than just oppressive or unfair conduct before a minority buyout order is justified. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">102 One obvious instance where a minority buyout order is appropriate is where the majority is financially or legally unable to buy out the minority. On the other hand, it is also obvious that a minority buyout order should not be made if it would not be in the company’s interest, <span class="font-italic">eg</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>where there are other shareholders who object to the minority shareholder being put in control of the company: <span class="font-italic">Re a company (No 0056885 of 1988), ex parte </span><span class="font-italic">Schwarcz (No 2)</span> [1989] BCLC 427 at 451–452.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">103 The more difficult question is whether, and if so when, the majority’s egregious conduct towards the minority can justify a minority buyout order. In <span class="font-italic">Minority Shareholders’ Rights and Remedies</span>, the learned author suggests (at 239) that a minority buyout order would be appropriate “where the mismanagement of the company has been oppressive and egregious, but where the winding up of the company may not be desirable in so far as it might have societal repercussions”. Two observations may be made. First, I do not think the court has to conclude that winding up is undesirable before making a minority buyout order. A winding up order should be an order of last resort where the company is a going concern. Second, I do not think the learned author meant to say that all oppressive or egregious conduct will justify a minority buyout order. That would be an unsupportable proposition. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">104 Indeed, in <span class="font-italic">Sharikat</span><span class="font-italic"> Logistics Pte Ltd v Ong Boon Chuan and others </span>[2014] SGHC 224 (“<span class="font-italic">Sharikat</span><span class="font-italic"> Logistics</span>”), the only local decision to consider the possibility of a minority buyout order, Judith Prakash J found egregious acts on the part of the majority shareholders but held that they were not egregious enough for a minority buyout order (at [235]–[236]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">105 In my judgment, egregious conduct justifies a minority buyout order if it renders the majority shareholder unfit to exercise control of the company. Where there is no reason to conclude that the majority is unfit to exercise control of the company, the usual order that the majority buy out the minority suffices as a remedy for the minority. A majority shareholder would be unfit to exercise control of the company if allowing him to do so would be damaging to the company or its business, or would pose a serious risk to the public. I would add that in principle, exercising control as a shareholder is different from managing a company. However, s 216 cases often involve shareholders who are also managing the company as directors. In such cases, the majority shareholder’s fitness to manage the company would also be relevant since his control of the company allows him to manage the company.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">106 There are not many cases in which minority buyout orders were considered. Apart from <span class="font-italic">Sharikat</span><span class="font-italic"> Logistics</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>the parties referred me to the following cases.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">107 In <span class="font-italic">Re a Company (No 006834 of 1988), ex parte Kremer</span> [1989] BCLC 365 (“<span class="font-italic">Kremer</span>”), Hoffman J noted that it was “inconceivable” that a court would order the majority shareholder, who was “actively concerned in the management of the company” to be “compulsorily expropriated”, especially since he had made far greater contributions to the growth of the company than the minority shareholder (at 367). In his view, the allegations of mismanagement and misappropriation, if proven, would amount at most to “high-handed conduct”; there was nothing in them which could “carry a serious imputation of dishonesty” (at 368). While the majority shareholder’s greater contributions to the company’s growth was a relevant consideration, this must have been, at best, a secondary consideration. This is because, as Hoffman J observed, the normal remedy in an ordinary case of breakdown of confidence between the parties is for the minority shareholder to be offered a fair price for his shares; the s 216 remedy is not intended to “enable the court to preside over a protracted and expensive contest of virtue between the shareholders and … award the company to the winner” (at 368).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">108 In <span class="font-italic">Re a </span><span class="font-italic">company (No 00789 of 1987); ex parte Shooter</span> [1990] BCLC 384 (“<span class="font-italic">Shooter</span>”), the company ran a football club. The majority shareholder was chairman of the board. He had managed the company’s affairs “with a very nearly total disregard of the requirements of the Companies Act” (at 388). There was repeated failure to hold annual general meetings or to lay accounts before members. The failure to hold annual general meetings deprived the company of any proper board of directors. This led Harman J to observe that the company’s affairs had been conducted by the majority shareholder “without any regard for formalities or legal obligations”, thereby demonstrating that he was “unfit to exercise such control [of the company] in law, although not for any reason of bad faith” (at 395). Having observed that he had the power to make an order that would “enable the company, for the future, to be properly run”, Harman J made a minority buyout order.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">109 In <span class="font-italic">Re </span><span class="font-italic">Brenfield Squash Rackets Club Ltd</span> [1996] 2 BCLC 184 (“<span class="font-italic">Brenfield</span>”), the majority shareholder was a company named FMR Investments (“FMR”). The company ran a squash club. FMR and the company shared three directors. Rattee J found that the “whole pattern of the management of the company’s affairs” by the directors had been to benefit themselves through FMR to the detriment of the minority shareholders, and then dishonestly conceal such facts from the minority shareholder (at 189). For example, the directors caused the company to execute a charge on company premises to secure FMR’s own debt to a bank (at 187). The majority shareholder had also neglected the management of the company since no annual general meeting had been held, and no audited accounts produced, from 1992 to 1996 (at 189). Rattee J made a minority buyout order. Acknowledging that it may be a comparatively unusual order, Rattee J concluded that it was appropriate in the circumstances of the case. Rattee J expressly took into consideration the fact that the minority may in any event have become entitled to purchase the majority’s shares under a shareholders’ agreement on the ground that FMR had ceased to trade or was unable to pay its debts (at 190–191).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">110 In <span class="font-italic">Fexuto</span><span class="font-italic"> Pty Ltd v Bosnjak Holdings Pte Ltd</span> [2001] NSWCA 97 (“<span class="font-italic">Fexuto</span>”), the oppressive conduct comprised, among other things, the acquisition of corporate opportunities by the majority shareholder in breach of his fiduciary duties, the failure to provide proper and lawful access to information, and the exclusion of the minority shareholder from the decision making process in breach of a consensus style of management. The New South Wales Court of Appeal upheld the order made by the trial judge for the majority shareholders to buy out the minority. Describing a minority buyout order as “extraordinary, and virtually unprecedented” (at [160]), Spigelman CJ found that the conduct of the majority shareholders “did not approach the level of moral blameworthiness” in <span class="font-italic">Shooter</span> and <span class="font-italic">Brenfield</span> (at [163]). His view was that only a “systematic course of improper conduct” would justify a minority buyout order (at [166]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">111 In <span class="font-italic">Oak Investment Partners XII, Limited Partnership v </span><span class="font-italic">Boughtwood and others</span> [2009] EWHC 176 (Ch) (“<span class="font-italic">Oak Investment</span>”), there were two principal shareholders in a company. Both the majority shareholder (“Boughtwood”) and the minority shareholder (“Oak”) brought petitions under s 996 of the Companies Act 2006 (c 46) (UK) and established unfair prejudice against each other. Sales J found that Boughtwood had, among other things, tried to assert wider management authority in the business contrary to what had been agreed, and had also staged a coup to take control of the company, thereby destroying the relationship of trust and confidence which should have been the foundation of the quasi-partnership between the shareholders (at [329]). Oak’s misconduct, in contrast, did not cause actual prejudice to Boughtwood and was “very minor” in comparison with his (at [328]). Sales J concluded that a minority buyout order, while an “atypical order to make”, would be the order that best met the overall justice of the case (at [327] and [330]). The decision was upheld on appeal: <span class="font-italic">Boughtwood</span><span class="font-italic"> v Oak Investment Partners XII, Ltd Partnership </span>[2010] EWCA Civ 23. The Court of Appeal described Boughtwood’s conduct as “damaging to the group and its business” and “seriously destructive of the group’s well-being” (at [120] and [122]). Boughtwood’s conduct was also described as “probably the most direct cause of PML’s subsequent collapse into administration” (at [120]). PML was subsidiary of the company. In addition, Boughtwood was found to have created a “poisoned culture that was damaging to the group’s morale” (at [122]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">112 In <span class="font-italic">Lantsbury</span><span class="font-italic"> v Hauser and another</span> [2010] EWHC 390 (“<span class="font-italic">Hauser</span>”), the majority shareholder (a) used company money as his own, (b) materially misled the minority into accepting fewer shares than his rightful entitlement in a share issue (leading the court to reverse that share issue), (c) entered false public records and give false information to the company’s bankers saying that the minority shareholder had been removed as a director, and (d) misappropriated company property. The court made a minority buyout order, concluding that any continued involvement of the majority shareholder in the running of the company carried “a serious risk to the public”, since he was “plainly not a fit person to hold the office of director in a limited liability company” (at [79]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">113 In my view, the proposition that a majority shareholder’s egregious conduct should not warrant a minority buyout order unless it makes him unfit to exercise control of the company is consistent with the above cases. It can be seen from the above that the courts in <span class="font-italic">Shooter </span>and <span class="font-italic">Hauser </span>were prepared to make a minority buyout order because the majority was found to be unfit to exercise control of the company. In <span class="font-italic">Oak Investment</span>, the Court of Appeal did not expressly discuss the majority’s fitness to exercise control of the company. However, the Court of Appeal upheld the minority buyout order for reasons which strongly suggest that the majority was unfit to exercise control of the company. In <span class="font-italic">Kremer</span>, the court refused to make a minority buyout order after finding high-handed conduct and noted that there was no serious imputation of dishonesty. In my view, a serious imputation of dishonesty would suggest that the majority shareholder is unfit to exercise control of the company. The court in <span class="font-italic">Fexuto</span> also refused to make a minority buyout order. Spigelman CJ was of the view that only a systematic course of improper conduct could justify a minority buyout order. It seems to me that a systematic course of improper conduct would also suggest that the majority shareholder is unfit to exercise control of the company, although admittedly the nature of the improper conduct would be relevant as well.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">114 The decision in <span class="font-italic">Brenfield</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>has to be looked at in context. A key reason for the minority buyout order in that case was the fact that the minority may have become entitled to purchase the majority’s shares under the shareholders’ agreement. It is also questionable whether the majority shareholder would have been able to buy out the minority given its unsatisfactory financial position. In my view, there is nothing in <span class="font-italic">Brenfield</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>that contradicts the proposition that egregious conduct is insufficient to justify a minority buyout order if it does not cause the majority shareholder to be unfit to exercise control of the company. <span class="font-italic">Brenfield</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>has to be looked at in the light of the facts in that case. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">115 The plaintiffs urged me to place greater weight on the opinion of Fitzgerald JA in <span class="font-italic">Fexuto</span>.<span class="font-italic"> </span>Fitzgerald JA preferred not to view a minority buyout order as an exceptional remedy (at [705]): </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">I do not accept that there is some special inhibition on the Court’s power to order shareholders engaged in oppression to sell their shares because they constitute a majority. What order is practically just will depend on the particular circumstances of each case. Majorities should not be encouraged to think that oppression is unlikely to have any more adverse consequence than an obligation to purchase the oppressed minority’s shares, which might well suit the majority’s purpose …</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">116 The caution in Fitzgerald JA’s opinion is a valid one. However, in my respectful opinion, that has to be balanced against, and greater weight given to, the intent of a s 216 remedy and the expropriatory nature of a minority buyout order. A s 216 remedy is not meant to punish the majority shareholder for his misconduct by dispossessing him of his shares. A minority buyout order ought not to be available as a matter of course; it should be made only in exceptional situations. In a normal case such as the present, the unfairness to a minority caused by locking up his investment in a company, managed by a shareholder with whom he has fallen out, is remedied by offering the minority shareholder a fair price for his shares. Any departure from that principle must be justified by wider considerations. In the context of a minority buyout order under s 216, such justification exists where the majority shareholder is not fit to exercise control of the company in that allowing him to continue exercising control of the company would be damaging to the company or its business, or would pose a serious risk to the public. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Order to be made in the present case </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">117 My conclusion can be put shortly. The proven instances of misconduct of the 1st to 6th defendants (at [93] above) do not amount to misconduct which renders the 1st to 6th defendants unfit to exercise control of the Samwoh Group. As much as I acknowledge the grievances of Elvin Koh and Koh HL regarding the way they were removed as directors, in my view, there is no reason to forcibly take away the 1st to 6th defendants’ rights as the majority shareholders to continue exercising control of the Samwoh Group. The usual buyout order suffices to address the plaintiffs’ grievances. My order therefore is for the 1st to 6th defendants to purchase the shares of the plaintiffs.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">118 I would add for completeness that in my view,</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) even if all the allegations made by the plaintiffs had been proven, they would not have led me to conclude that the 1st to 6th defendants are unfit to exercise control of the Samwoh Group; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) even if the test for a minority buyout order does not require a finding that the 1st to 6th defendants are unfit to exercise control of the Samwoh Group, the allegations by the plaintiffs (even if proven) are not egregious enough to justify a minority buyout order. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Two further observations </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">119 I make two further observations. First, the Samwoh Group had submitted that a minority buyout order (a) may raise competition law issues because Elvin Koh is in a similar business, and (b) would likely be disruptive as it would result in a likely replacement of four out of five directors and trigger default clauses in the Samwoh Group’s banking facilities due to the significant change of shareholding. These arguments would have been relevant factors to consider if I had been minded to make a minority buyout order on the facts. The question would be whether a minority buyout order would be in the interests of the company given the issues raised. The court would have to balance the impact of these issues on the company against the fact that the majority has been found unfit to exercise control of the company. However, in light of the conclusion I have reached, this issue is moot.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">120 The second observation concerns Elvin Koh’s testimony that he would require third-party financing for the plaintiffs’ purchase of the 1st to 6th defendants’ shares if I ordered a minority buyout. Elvin Koh testified that he already had a fund to buy the 1st to 6th defendants’ shares and that this fund would also “involve” other investors – specifically, two other construction companies.

</div>
</div> I would have thought that this would be a relevant factor against making a minority buyout order given the expropriatory nature of the order. Section 216(2)(<span class="font-italic">d</span>) of the Companies Act also contemplates purchases of shares only by other shareholders, debenture holders or the company itself. The difficulty though is that there is nothing to stop a minority from selling some of the shares to a third party after he has purchased the majority’s shares. Anyway, in view of the conclusion I have reached, I do not need to decide this issue.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">121 My order is for the 1st to 6th defendants to purchase the shares of the plaintiffs in the 7th to 16th defendants. As agreed between the plaintiffs and the 1st to 6th defendants, the price will be determined by an independent valuer to be appointed. The valuer to be appointed, the reference date for the valuation and the costs of the valuation will be decided by this court if the parties cannot reach agreement on the same within 30 days of this order. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">122 The plaintiffs are to pay costs to </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) the 1st to 6th defendants fixed at $270,000 plus reasonable disbursements to be fixed by me if not agreed;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) the 7th to 16th defendants fixed at $100,000 plus reasonable disbursements to be fixed by me if not agreed.</div><div class="Judg-Sign text-left"></div><div class="Judg-Sign text-left">Chua Lee Ming <br/>Judicial Commissioner </div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Alvin Yeo SC, Lim Wei Lee, Daniel Tan Shi Min and Catherine Chan (WongPartnership LLP) for the plaintiffs;<br/>Francis Xavier SC, Patrick Ang, Chong Kah Kheng, Amy Seow, Chai Wei Han and Priscilla Soh (Rajah &amp; Tan LLP) for the 1st to 6th defendants;<br/>Thio Shen Yi SC, Gordon Lim and Matthias Goh (TSMP Law Corporation) for the 7th to 16th defendants.</div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
