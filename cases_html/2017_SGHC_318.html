</div> In the first place, the plaintiff argued that even if the defendant was able to make out his case that the Loan Facilities were void or unenforceable for illegality or misrepresentation or mistake, this would not defeat the plaintiff’s claim under the Indemnity Agreement. This was because the Indemnity Agreement was in the nature of an <span class="font-italic">indemnity</span> and not a mere <span class="font-italic">guarantee</span>. While liability under a guarantee was “collateral to and dependent upon the liability of a third person”, liability under an indemnity was “original and independent” (citing <span class="font-italic">PT Jaya Sumpiles Indonesia v Kristle Trading Ltd </span>[2009] 3 SLR(R) 689 (“<span class="font-italic">PT Jaya</span>”) at [50]). While the fact that a principal contract is void would generally render a guarantee similarly unenforceable, an indemnity was in the nature of a primary obligation and was not affected even if the principal contract was found to be defective (citing <span class="font-italic">S Y Technology v Pacific Recreation Pte Ltd </span>[2007] 2 SLR(R) 756 (“<span class="font-italic">S Y Technology</span>”) at [22]).

There was no basis for the defendant’s case that the First Surewin Facility was part of a “fraudulent scheme” by Jolene Wu, the plaintiff and EFG Bank to cause Singfor to provide its assets as collateral for an unrelated third party’s loans. Even if it was illegal under Taiwanese law for a life insurance company to pledge its assets as collateral for an unrelated third party’s loans, this would only render <span class="font-italic">the </span><span class="font-italic">Pledges </span>illegal.

In oral submissions, the plaintiff contended that the Indemnity Agreement was not tainted by any foreign illegality, citing the case of <span class="font-italic">Euro-Diam v Bathurst </span>[1990] 1 QB 1 (“<span class="font-italic">Euro</span><span class="font-italic">-Diam</span>”) in support of its position. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Principles applicable to summary judgment</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 The principles applicable to summary judgment under O 14 r 1 of the Rules are well established and can be dealt with briefly. In order to obtain summary judgment, a plaintiff must first establish a <span class="font-italic">prima facie </span>case for judgment. Once this has been done, the burden as such shifts to the defendant who, in order to obtain leave to defend, must establish a fair or reasonable probability that he has a real or <span class="font-italic">bona fide </span>defence in order to resist summary judgment (see <span class="font-italic">Singapore Civil Procedure 2017</span> vol 1 (Foo Chee Hock JC gen ed) (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 2017) (“<span class="font-italic">SCP</span>”) at para 14/4/5 and also <span class="font-italic">M2B World Asia Pacific Pte Ltd v Matsumura Akihiko </span>[2015] 1 SLR 325 at [17]).

</div>
</div> However, neither party made any reference to this affidavit in the hearing before me, and the arguments proceeded on the basis that the Pledges were illegal under Taiwanese law. I have considered whether the defendant has a <span class="font-italic">bona fide </span>defence on the assumption that it <span class="font-italic">is </span>indeed a breach of Taiwanese law for a life insurance company to pledge its assets to secure loans to an unrelated third party. The question, however, is what effect this would have on the plaintiff’s claim in the present proceedings.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(1) Applicable legal principles</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 Before I deal with the legal principles relevant to this question, it may be helpful to clarify three points.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 First, there is no doubt that the First Surewin Facility and the Indemnity Agreement are both governed by Singapore law. Where a contract contains express provisions as to its governing law, the governing law of the contract is generally determined in accordance with such express terms (<span class="font-italic">Pacific Recreation </span>at [36] citing <span class="font-italic">Overseas Union Insurance Ltd v Turegum Insurance Co </span>[2001] 2 SLR(R) 285 at [82]). As stated at [12] and [19] above, Singapore law is expressly stated to be the governing law of both the First Surewin Facility and the Indemnity Agreement.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 Secondly, I have found that the place of performance for both the First Surewin Facility and the Indemnity Agreement is Singapore. With regard to First Surewin Facility, the defendant accepts that the place of performance is “arguably” Singapore given that the plaintiff is the Singapore branch of EFG Bank and the funds to be disbursed under the First Surewin Facility would be disbursed to Surewin’s bank account located in Singapore. I note, however, that the defendant argues that there is a connection between the First Surewin Faciltiy and Taiwan in that the source of Surewin’s instructions came from the defendant in Taiwan.

</div>
</div> In my view, the place of performance of the First Surewin Facility is clearly Singapore. As noted by the court in <span class="font-italic">Peh Teck Quee v Bayerische Landesbank Girozentrale</span> [1999] 3 SLR (R) 842 (“<span class="font-italic">Peh Teck </span><span class="font-italic">Quee</span>”) at [21]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">According to the <span class="font-italic">Encyclopaedia of Banking Law </span>(1998 Ed), the key obligation in a loan contract is generally the obligation to make payments, and the place where those payments must be made is accordingly the place of performance. …</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 The terms of the Indemnity Agreement were silent as to where repayment was to take place. However, the same arguments which the defendant acknowledged in relation to the First Surewin Facility similarly apply in respect of the Indemnity Agreement – <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, that the place of performance is in all likelihood Singapore, given that the Indemnity Agreement was executed in favour of the plaintiff, which is the Singapore branch of EFG Bank, and any payment would presumably take place in Singapore.

</div> I agree.

</div> I agree that the applicable principles are to be found in that decision.<span class="font-italic"> </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 In <span class="font-italic">Euro-Diam</span>, the plaintiff was a UK supplier of precious stones who had entered into a contract of indemnity insurance (governed by English law) with the defendant insurer in respect of the export of consignments of precious stones. After the plaintiff exported certain diamonds to West Germany, the diamonds were stolen from the German company’s warehouse. The stolen diamonds were part of two consignments negotiated by one “B”, an Israeli citizen engaged in business in contravention of West German immigration laws, and addressed to the German company. The plaintiffs claimed to be indemnified for the loss of the stolen diamonds under the contract of insurance. The defendants denied liability, arguing that the plaintiffs had misrepresented the value of the second consignment of diamonds on the invoice sent to the German company to enable the German company to evade West German import tax law. The defendants argued that the plaintiff’s claims were thus tainted by illegality. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 Staughton J gave judgment for the plaintiffs and held that a claim could be tainted with illegality and unenforceable <span class="font-italic">if the plaintiff needed to plead or prove illegality </span>to establish his claim, or if the claim was so closely connected with the proceeds of crime as to offend the conscience of the court. Since the plaintiff’s claim against the defendant insurers did not fall afoul of those principles, the claim was allowed. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 In coming to his decision, which was upheld on appeal, Staughton J held<span class="font-italic"> </span>at 23–24:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… when an English claim is said to be tainted by foreign illegality, one must first inquire whether, applying the appropriate connecting factor, the transaction from which the taint is said to arise would be enforceable here. If not, one has next to decide whether there is sufficient connection between that transaction and the claim to amount to taint within the <span class="font-italic">Bowmaker </span>or <span class="font-italic">Beresford </span>principle. If the answer to that second question is yes the claim is unenforceable here. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 Staughton J identified three possible “connecting factors” in a case concerning the topic of contractual illegality – the forum, the proper law, and the place of performance (<span class="font-italic">Euro-Diam </span>at 21).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 The <span class="font-italic">Bowmaker </span>principle refers to the decision of the English Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Bowmakers Ltd v Barnet Instruments Ltd</span> [1945] KB 65 at 71:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… a man’s right to possess his own chattels will as a general rule be enforced against one who, without any claim of right, is detaining them, or has converted them to his own use, even though it may appear either from the pleadings, or in the course of the trial, that the chattels in question came into the defendant’s possession by reason of an illegal contract between himself and the plaintiff, <span class="font-italic">provided that the plaintiff does not seek, and is not forced, either to found his claim on the illegal contract or to plead its illegality</span> in order to support his claim.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 The <span class="font-italic">Bowmake</span>r principle as developed in the UK applies where the plaintiff <span class="font-italic">needs</span> to plead or prove the illegality in order to make out his claim (see <span class="font-italic">Euro-Diam </span>at 18).

No doubt the rule pays regard to the fact that to hold otherwise would in some cases offer an inducement to crime or remove a restraint to crime, and that its effect is to act as a deterrent to crime. But apart from these considerations the absolute rule is that the Courts will not recognise a benefit accruing to a criminal from his crime.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 The <span class="font-italic">Beresford</span> principle has been described as a test based on conscience as it raises the question of the degree of proximity between the plaintiff’s claim and the criminal behaviour: the more remote the crime, the less reason to apply the principle.

As stated by Lord Atkin in <span class="font-italic">Beresford</span>, the principle is that “a man is not to be allowed…to claim a benefit from his crime” (<span class="font-italic">Beresford </span>at 598). To refuse to hold the First Surewin Facility void would simply be to enforce the debt owed by Surewin to the plaintiff. It is difficult to see in what sense that would be allowing the plaintiff to <span class="font-italic">benefit </span>from the alleged crime of causing Singfor’s assets to be pledged as collateral for that loan. The same reasoning applies all the more to the Indemnity Agreement. To enforce the Indemnity Agreement would <span class="font-italic">not</span> allow the plaintiff to benefit from causing Singfor’s assets to be pledged as security for the First Surewin Facility. It would simply be allowing the plaintiff to enforce a security arrangement entered into in <span class="font-italic">parallel </span>with the allegedly illegal Pledges.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">79 The <span class="font-italic">Bowmaker </span>principle does not apply because the plaintiff in this case does not need to plead or prove illegal conduct to establish his claim at all.

I note that in oral submissions, the defendant highlighted that the plaintiff had, as a matter of fact, described the “illegal transactions” (<span class="font-italic">ie</span> the Pledges) in its statement of claim. The point, however, is that there is no <span class="font-italic">need </span>for the plaintiff to even make any mention of the Pledges in order to establish its entitlement to claim indemnity from the defendant. If the plaintiff did so, it was only for the purpose of setting out the background narrative.

</div> <span class="font-italic">Ting Siew May</span> concerned the back-dating of an option to purchase property in Singapore. The back-dating was for the purpose of obtaining loans on better terms as a result of certain changes implemented by the Monetary Authority of Singapore. The illegality in <span class="font-italic">Ting Siew May </span>pertained to the contract sought to be enforced (the back-dated option), and also concerned acts done in Singapore as opposed to illegality in respect of the law of another country. In the present case, it is clear that the place of performance of the First Surewin Facility and the Indemnity Agreement was Singapore. Whilst the STAAP and SFIP-1 Pledges were found to contravene Taiwan law on insurance companies, I emphasise that (i) the present action is not concerned with enforcement of these two Pledges; (ii) the express choice of law clauses in the Pledges point to Singapore as the governing law; (iii) there is no suggestion that the Pledges were illegal under Singapore law. <span class="font-italic">Ting Siew May</span> was therefore of limited assistance.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The nature of the Indemnity Agreement: indemnity or guarantee?</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">82 I was prepared to grant the plaintiff summary judgment based on my findings at [50]–[81] above that the Indemnity Agreement was not void or unenforceable for foreign illegality. However, I set out my brief views with respect to the plaintiff’s alternative submission: <span class="font-italic">ie,</span> that even if the First Surewin Facility was void/unenforceable for illegality, there would still be no defence to the claim because the invalidity of the First Surewin Facility would not affect the validity of the Indemnity Agreement.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">83 The plaintiff has highlighted the distinction between an indemnity and a guarantee. Liability under a guarantee is “collateral to and dependent upon the liability of a third person” whereas “an indemnitor’s liability is original and independent” (<span class="font-italic">PT Jaya</span> at [50], citing Low Kee Yang, <span class="font-italic">The Law of Guarantees in Singapore and Malaysia </span>(LexisNexis Butterworths, 2nd Ed, 2003) at pp 52–53). Since an indemnity is in the nature of a primary obligation, a creditor may still recover the relevant losses even if the primary transaction is defective (<span class="font-italic">S Y Technology </span>at [22]).

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">85 While the defendant does refer to the Indemnity Agreement as a “Guarantee Agreement”, the question as to whether the agreement embodied a true indemnity was not dealt with in his written submissions</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">86 Looking at its terms and provisions, I was satisfied that the Indemnity Agreement was in the nature of a true indemnity. In my view, the strongest factors weighing in favour of the plaintiff’s construction of the Indemnity Agreement as a true indemnity were cll 9 and 25(a). In particular, I note that cl 25(a) was almost identical to the wording of a clause considered in <span class="font-italic">Habibullah Mohamed Yousuff v Indian Bank </span>[1999] 2 SLR(R) 880 at [45], which the court in <span class="font-italic">PT Jaya </span>described as appearing on its face “to be a true indemnity” (<span class="font-italic">PT Jaya </span>at [56]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">87 The question, however, was whether the Indemnity Agreement would remain enforceable even if the First Surewin Facility was found to be void or unenforceable for illegality. The plaintiff relied on cl 9(h) of the Indemnity Agreement, which stated “the guarantee shall not be prejudiced… by … any irregularity, unenforceability or invalidity of any obligation of the Borrower or any other persons under any security or document …” The plaintiff further submitted that a similar clause had been found to be valid in <span class="font-italic">Gulf Bank KSC v </span><span class="font-italic">Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd (No 2</span>) [1994] 2 Lloyd’s Rep 145 (“<span class="font-italic">Gulf Bank KSC</span>”).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">88 In oral submissions, the defendant questioned whether it is settled law that an indemnity can never be affected by the illegality of the underlying transaction.

</div> However, no authorities were raised to counter the plaintiff’s position. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">89 Apart from <span class="font-italic">Gulf Bank KSC</span>, which weighs in favour of upholding cl 9(h) of the Indemnity Agreement, the position that the Indemnity Agreement would remain enforceable even if the underlying transaction (<span class="font-italic">ie </span>the First Surewin Facility) was void or unenforceable for illegality also appears to be consistent with authorities such as <span class="font-italic">PT Jaya </span>(at [50]) and <span class="font-italic">S Y Technology (</span>at [22]), which have emphasised the original and independent nature of the indemnitor’s liability. However, it is not necessary for this court to decide this point since I have found above that the First Surewin Facility is <span class="font-italic">not</span> rendered void or unenforceable by reason of illegality. The Indemnity Agreement would remain valid and enforceable whether or not the illegality of an underlying transaction would also render an indemnity in respect of that transaction void or unenforceable.

I have dealt with the arguments concerning illegality at [50]–[81] above. I turn now to deal briefly with the issues surrounding the claim that the defendant had been misled or tricked by the plaintiff, EFG Bank and their officers and the related defence of <span class="font-italic">non est factum</span>. While the defendant asserts that he is a victim of fraud or misrepresentation, an assertion of fraud is not necessarily sufficient to avoid summary judgment if the court believes that there is no prospect of success at trial.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">92 The issues surrounding this claim flowed essentially from the general assertion that the defendant and Huang were the victims of misrepresentation or fraud on the part of the plaintiff’s officers. Put at its worst, the allegation was that the plaintiff and its officers hatched a plan to deceive the defendant over the nature and scope of the various transactions (the Pledges, the Loan Facilities and the Indemnity Agreement) so as to cause Singfor to provide its assets as collateral for the loans to Surewin. The transactions were allegedly structured in a way such that Singfor (and the defendant) did not know its assets were being used as collateral for Surewin’s liabilities. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">93 In seeking to establish this narrative, the defendant has relied heavily on the findings of the Taiwanese Court, as well as the testimony of various witnesses who gave evidence in the proceedings before that court.

The plaintiff and its officers were not charged with any offence before the Taiwanese Court. In this regard, it was ironic that counsel for the defendant sought, on one hand, to rely on the findings of the Taiwanese Court, and on the other, to argue that the defendant was appealing his conviction and “[his] client’s involvement in the scheme [had] not been tested”.

</div> On the contrary, of all the parties said to be involved in the alleged scheme to defraud the defendant and Singfor, the defendant was the <span class="font-italic">only </span>person whose involvement in the scheme had been tested in a court. Seen in that light, the defendant’s position that he had unwittingly been tricked into pledging Singfor’s assets to secure loans to an unrelated third party was without basis.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">95 I also note that the defendant is by all accounts a very experienced businessman who was in 2007 taking on a very senior position in Singfor.

</div>
</div> It bears repeating that the undisputed sequence of events establishes that shortly after the defendant was appointed Vice Chairman in 2007, the four accounts of Surewin, High Grounds, the STAAP Fund, and the SFIP-1 Unit Trust were opened with the plaintiff, and the accompanying Four Pledges (including the Pledges alleged to be illegal) were created. Some four years later on 19 January 2012, the defendant entered the Indemnity Agreement. On 31 January 2012, the First Surewin Facility (as referred to above) was granted.  On 6 November 2012, the Second Surewin Facility was granted. This was followed by the defendant’s assignment of the Life Insurance Policies in late December 2012. Singfor was placed under receivership in Taiwan on 12 August 2014. I find it is inconceivable that the defendant would have signed so many documents including the Indemnity Agreement without ensuring that he understood the nature of the documents and transactions.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">96 In any case, while the defendant has made a general assertion that his English is poor, the defence of <span class="font-italic">non est factum</span> is only pleaded in respect of the Second Surewin Facility. The plaintiff took the position that the sums due under the Second Surewin Facility have been satisfied already by the measures taken to enforce the collateral (see [33] above). As I have mentioned, the plaintiff’s claim is now limited to the First Surewin Facility.
