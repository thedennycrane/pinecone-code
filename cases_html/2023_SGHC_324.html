Two grounds were relied on to wind up the Companies, namely, that the Companies were unable to pay their debts under s 125(1)(<span class="font-italic">e</span>) of the IRDA, and that it was just and equitable that the Companies be wound up under s 125(1)(<span class="font-italic">i</span>) of the IRDA. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The standing to bring these applications</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The relevant law </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">10 With the above background in mind, a preliminary issue was whether the claimants making these applications were the Companies or the interim judicial manager, and whether they had standing to bring the applications to wind up the Companies. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">11 In this regard, s 124(1) of the IRDA sets out a list of the entities with standing<span class="font-italic"> </span>to apply for the winding up of a company.

</div>
</div> This raised a question of statutory interpretation as to whether “judicial manager” extended to “interim judicial manager” in the relevant provisions for this purpose. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The IRDA suggests that an interim judicial manager appointed under s 94 of the IRDA has and may exercise all the powers of a judicial manager</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">15 To begin with, s 88(1) of the IRDA provides that a judicial manager is presumed not to include an interim judicial manager unless a contrary intention appears. Such a contrary intention may take the form of an express inclusion of an interim judicial manager in the definition of a judicial manager (see, for example, s 114(2) of the IRDA). However, this definition in s 88(1) of the IRDA is only applicable to Part 7 of the IRDA. Since s 124(1)(<span class="font-italic">h</span>) falls under Part 8 of the IRDA, s 88(1) is not directly applicable. There is therefore an apparent ambiguity as to whether “judicial manager” in s 124(1)(<span class="font-italic">h</span>) is meant to include an interim judicial manager. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">16 In my view, the reference to “judicial manager” in s 124(1)(<span class="font-italic">h</span>) of the IRDA should include an interim judicial manager.<span class="font-italic"> </span>In the present case, Mr Furler was appointed as the interim judicial manager by a resolution of the Companies’ boards of directors pursuant to s 94(3) of the IRDA, which provides the conditions for such an appointment.<span class="font-weight-bold"> </span>Section 94(4)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the IRDA provides that an interim judicial manager appointed under s 94(3) of the IRDA “has, and may exercise, all the functions and powers of a judicial manager appointed by a Court under section 91, subject to such limitations and restrictions as may be prescribed by regulations”. However, there are no limitations or restrictions prescribed in the Insolvency, Restructuring and Dissolution (Judicial Management) Regulations 2020. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">17 With the above in mind, so as to give effect to s 94(4)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the IRDA, an interim judicial manager appointed under s 94(3) should have the same powers of a judicial manager appointed under s 91(2) to apply for the winding up of a company. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">This interpretation is supported by the legislative purpose behind s 94 of the IRDA</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">18 This interpretation is also supported by the legislative purpose for introducing the framework under s 94 of the IRDA. Section 94 permits companies to enter into judicial management through a resolution of the creditors so as to minimise the formality, expense, and delay associated with the judicial management process (see <span class="font-italic">Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report </span>(1 October 2018) vol 94 (Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai SC, Senior Minister of State for Law)). More specifically, the purpose behind the appointment of an <span class="font-italic">interim</span> judicial manager under s 94 was to prevent a company’s directors from abusing the judicial management process (see the Insolvency Law Review Committee, Ministry of Law, <span class="font-italic">Report of the Insolvency Law Review Committee</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>(2013) (Chairperson: Lee Eng Beng SC) (“2013 Insolvency Report”) at pp 104–105). Indeed, due to concerns that a company might dissipate assets in the interim before an application for judicial management was heard before the courts, the Committee recommended that a creditor of the company should be entitled to apply for the appointment of an interim judicial manager (see the 2013 Insolvency Report at pp 104–105). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">19 Accordingly, an interpretation that a “judicial manager” under s 124(1)(<span class="font-italic">h</span>) of the IRDA extended to an interim judicial manager appointed under s 94(3) furthered this legislative purpose in two ways. First, allowing an interim judicial manager to bring an application to wind up a company where none of the purposes of judicial management are capable of achievement is more effective in minimising formality, expense, and delay. I therefore agreed with the claimants that there was little benefit in requiring that the Quantuma directors, rather than the interim judicial manager, be the parties to initiate separate proceedings to wind up the Companies.

</div> Second, the power to apply to wind up the company does not interfere with the purposes behind appointing an interim judicial manager, namely, to adjudicate proofs of debt, facilitate the meeting of creditors for a resolution that the company enter into judicial management, and to prevent the dissipation of assets in the interim period. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">20 I was therefore satisfied that the proper interpretation of s 124(1)(<span class="font-italic">h</span>) of the IRDA extends “judicial manager” to include an interim judicial manager appointed under s 94(3) of the IRDA. Mr Furler therefore had the standing to bring these applications as the interim judicial manager. For clarity, as I found earlier that Mr Furler was acting as the Companies when he brought these applications, this finding of the interim judicial manager’s standing is <span class="font-italic">obiter</span>. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">21 With the preliminary issue of standing determined, I now turn to consider the grounds on which the Companies may be wound up. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">My decision: the applications were allowed</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The Companies were unable to pay their debts</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">22 Having considered the submissions, I was satisfied that the Companies were unable to pay their debts, taking into account the contingent and prospective liabilities of the Companies, under s 125(2)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the IRDA. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The relevant law</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">23 In <span class="font-italic">Sun Electric Power Pte Ltd v RCMA Asia Pte Ltd (formerly known as Tong </span><span class="font-italic">Teik Pte Ltd)</span> [2021] 2 SLR 478 (“<span class="font-italic">Sun Electric</span><span class="font-italic"> CA</span>”), the Court of Appeal held that the “the cash flow test should be the sole and determinative test” for determining an inability to pay debts (at [56]). The cash flow test “assesses whether the company’s current assets exceed its current liabilities such that it is able to meet all debts as and when they fall due” (at [65]). The court also agreed that “current assets” and “current liabilities” refer to assets which will be realisable and debts which will fall due within a 12‑month timeframe (at [65]).

In this regard, a company’s substratum is the main object it was formed to achieve. Where a company is no longer able to carry on its main object, a member may apply for the company to be wound up as it would be unfair to hold the parties to the association when the main object of such association could no longer be achieved (see the Court of Appeal decision of <span class="font-italic">Ma Wai Fong Kathryn v Trillion Investment Pte Ltd and others and another appeal</span> [2019] 1 SLR 1046 (“<span class="font-italic">Kathryn Ma</span>”) at [63]). Another situation where a company has lost its substratum is “where the company is effectively dormant at the time of the application (contrary to what it was set up to do) and its finances are poor such that the company is no longer viable … [such that] it can be said that the company had stopped conducting the business it was set up to do and, given its poor financial state, there is no longer any reasonable prospect that the company will achieve its substratum” (see <span class="font-italic">Kathryn Ma </span>at [64]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 In summary, the guiding principle in assessing whether a company should be wound up on the basis of the loss of its substratum is to determine whether there is unfairness in keeping an aggrieved, often minority, shareholder locked into a company which is no longer, or can no longer, carry out the objects and business it was set up to do (see <span class="font-italic">Kathryn Ma </span>at [65]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 Applying the above tests to the facts before me, the main object of the Companies was the operation and management of the Atom Asset Exchange platform in Singapore as a means of trading in cryptocurrency.

In that case, the petitioner, Bell Group Finance (Pty) Ltd (“Bell Australia”), was an Australian company in liquidation and a creditor of Bell Group (UK) Holdings Ltd (“Bell UK”) (at 506). Prior to the insolvency of Bell UK, Bell UK had granted comprehensive securities over their properties and undertakings in favour of various syndicates of English and Australian banks (at 506–507). Bell Australia alleged that the directors of Bell UK had granted charges over the assets of the company in breach of their duty to act in the best interests of the company, and the banks’ knowledge of the directors’ breach allowed the charges to be avoided (at 507). One of the banks holding charges over Bell UK’s assets, Westpac Banking Corporation, had appointed administrative receivers over Bell UK, and these receivers were asserting legal professional privilege in relation to the documents of Bell UK (at 508). The petitioners therefore sought to wind up Bell UK, to enable a court-ordered liquidator to be appointed to investigate the grant of securities in favour of the banks. The court-appointed liquidator could then make their own determination of whether to assert privilege over the transaction documents and cooperate with the liquidator of Bell Australia (at 508–510 and 514).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 Chadwick J ordered a winding up of Bell UK to enable a liquidator of Bell UK to investigate the grants of security.

It may well be just and equitable to make such an order in order to enable an investigation to take place. In circumstances in which I find that assets having a book value of some £353m are estimated to have nil realisable value, it seems to me that an investigation is undoubtedly called for.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">In those circumstances I am satisfied that it is just and equitable to make a winding-up order in this case so that a liquidator of BG (UK) can consider whether there is any advantage to the creditors in his or her liquidation in co-operation with the Australian liquidators. …</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 Notwithstanding the Companies’ reliance on <span class="font-italic">Bell Group Finance</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>the enhanced investigations rationale does not fall within any of the currently recognised categories of cases where the “just and equitable” limb is relied upon to wind up a company in Singapore insolvency law. Indeed, no Singapore court has accepted a need to conduct investigations as a ground for invoking the just and equitable jurisdiction of the court to wind up a company. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 That said, the enhanced investigations rationale has been canvassed before the Singapore courts in other contexts. For example, in the High Court decision of <span class="font-italic">RCMA</span><span class="font-italic"> Asia Pte Ltd v Sun Electric Power Pte Ltd (Energy Market Authority of Singapore, non-party)</span> [2020] SGHC 205, Tan Siong Thye J ordered the winding up of a company on the basis that the company was unable to pay its debts under s 254(1)(<span class="font-italic">e</span>) of the Companies Act (at [58]), and that the lack of probity in the conduct and management of the company’s affairs made it just and equitable that the company be wound up under s 254(1)(<span class="font-italic">i</span>) of the Companies Act (at [73]). On the subject of investigations, Tan J found that the fact that a liquidator could conduct investigations into disputed dealings, and take further action, if necessary, in the interests of the creditors, was a factor to consider in exercising his discretion to wind up a company (at [91]). These observations were not disturbed on appeal in <span class="font-italic">Sun Electric</span><span class="font-italic"> CA</span>. Similarly, in the High Court decision of <span class="font-italic">DB International Trust (Singapore) Ltd v Medora Xerxes Jamshid and another</span> [2023] SGHC 83, the court held at [17] that one of the purposes of an insolvent liquidation is to “[allow] for an investigation into the company’s affairs by an independent and appropriately qualified person, especially in relation to the circumstances that led to the winding up”. This was said in the context of an application to remove a liquidator for failing to carry out his duties with sufficient vigour, failing to comply with his statutory obligations and therefore causing the creditors to lose confidence (at [79]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 It can therefore be seen that the enhanced investigations rationale has been found to be relevant to whether a company should be wound up, and how such liquidations should take effect. In my judgment, the need to empower a liquidator to conduct enhanced investigations for the benefit of unsecured creditors constitutes a sufficient ground to wind up a company on just and equitable grounds.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The Companies should be wound up in light of the overall fairness and justice of the case</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 Applying the relief stage of the two-stage test set out in <span class="font-italic">Tan Yew </span><span class="font-italic">Huat</span> at [18] (as discussed above at [28]), I was of the view that, in light of all the relevant factors and the overall fairness and justice of the case, the Companies should be wound up. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 First, the Companies had lost their substratum, were no longer operating, and were not expected to have a viable future stream of income. Second, the Companies’ debts and liabilities, although not clearly ascertained, were likely to be substantial, and liquidation would better enable the identification of an asset pool out of which to pay creditors. Third, no party had appeared before this court to allege that they would suffer prejudice by the winding up of the Companies, or to oppose the applications.

</div> Fourth, Mr Furler appeared to be an appropriate person to be the liquidator, given his familiarity and working experience with the Companies, and his relationship with Quantuma, the liquidators of other companies within the AAX Group.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 I was therefore satisfied that the overall fairness and justice of the case justified the winding up of the Companies. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Applicable statutory moratorium period </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 As the Companies were in interim judicial management, an automatic moratorium period was triggered. Under s 95(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) and s 95(1)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the IRDA, no order may be made for the winding up of the Companies and no other proceedings may be commenced or continued against the Companies, except with the leave of the court, during the automatic moratorium period that arose after the lodging of a written notice of appointment of an interim judicial manager under s 94(5)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the IRDA. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 In the present case, under s 95(4) of the IRDA, this automatic moratorium period began from the date the Companies lodged written notices of appointment of Mr Furler as the interim judicial manager under s 94(5)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>). The period would end upon the appointment of a judicial manager, the rejection of the creditors’ resolution to place the company under judicial management, or the date on which the term of the interim judicial manager ended under s 94(6) of the IRDA. The last category was the relevant date for this application. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 Under s 94(6) of the IRDA, the term of the appointment of the interim judicial manager ends on the earlier of the occurrence of either the expiry of 30 days after the appointment of the interim judicial manager, or such extension of that period as the Official Receiver may allow (s 94(6)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the IRDA), or the appointment of a judicial manager, or the rejection of the creditors’ resolution to place the company under judicial management (s 94(6)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the IRDA). In the present case, the Official Receiver granted three extensions to the period of interim judicial management for the Companies, for the following periods, with the final extension being from 20 September 2023 to 16 October 2023.

</div> As such, the automatic moratorium period that arose under s 95(4) of the IRDA would have ended on 16 October 2023. The question that arose at the hearing on 12 October 2023 was whether the court has the power to override the end date of 16 October 2023.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 In this regard, I agreed with the Companies that the IRDA was silent as to whether the court has the power to end the statutory moratoria discussed above. For clarity, s 115(3)(<span class="font-italic">d</span>) of the IRDA, read with s 115(1)(<span class="font-italic">e</span>), would have permitted a creditor or member of the Companies to apply to the court to discharge the company from interim judicial management. However, the discharge of a company from interim judicial management is not expressly one of the conditions for ending the term of appointment of an interim judicial manager under s 94(6) of the IRDA. It was therefore arguable that the automatic moratoria periods only terminated upon the end of the period that the Official Receiver had extended the term of the interim judicial management to, namely, 16 October 2023. Consequently, out of caution, I granted leave for the claimants to amend their prayers such that the winding up orders would only take effect from 12.00am on 17 October 2023.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 For all the reasons given above, I decided that the Companies themselves had the standing to, through the interim judicial manager, make these applications to wind themselves up under s 124(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the IRDA. For completeness, I also found that the interim judicial manager would have had the standing to bring these applications in his own right under s 124(1)(<span class="font-italic">h</span>) of the IRDA. I was satisfied that I could order the winding up of the Companies based on s 125(1)(<span class="font-italic">e</span>) and s 125(1)(<span class="font-italic">i</span>) of the IRDA, on the alternate grounds that the Companies were unable to pay their debts or that it was just and equitable for the Companies to be wound up. For the reasons above, I exercised my residual discretion to order the winding up of the Companies with the consequential orders sought by the claimants.</div><table class="table table-sm table-borderless"><tbody><tr><td><div class="txt-body text-left">Goh Yihan<br/>Judge of the High Court</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-left"></div></td></tr></tbody></table><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Chua Sui Tong and Gan Jhia Huei (Rev Law LLC) (instructed), </div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Troy Doyle and Peter Madden (Gibson Dunn &amp; Crutcher LLP) for the claimants;</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Janica Tan for the Official Receiver (Ministry of Law (IPTO)).</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right"></div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
