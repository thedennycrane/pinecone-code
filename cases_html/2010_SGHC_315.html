<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       This is the Plaintiff’s application to
                    amend its statement of claim in order to add a cause of action for minority
                    oppression and an additional relief that the second to fourth Defendants be
                    ordered to buy him out of the company, ie the first Defendant. The Defendants
                    objected to the application for amendment and, in turn, applied to strike out
                    the Plaintiff’s statement of claim on the grounds of, <em>inter alia</em>, abuse of process.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Summary of facts</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The present suit is a consolidation of multiple
                    winding up actions which were commenced in 2008 against three companies –
                    namely, Reflexology and Holistic Health Academy Pte Ltd, My Foot International
                    Pte Ltd and My Foot Reflexology Pte Ltd – that are part of the My Foot
                    group of companies (“My Foot Group”; the My Foot Group comprises
                    of the following additional companies: The Relax Room Pte Ltd, My Summer Day Spa
                    Pte Ltd and Career Design Hub Pte Ltd.) These were initially winding up
                    applications commenced by originating summons, but were converted to and ordered
                    to continue as writ actions in January 2009; the separate writ actions were
                    eventually consolidated in the present suit.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       Without delving too deeply into the factual
                    matrix of this matter, I summarise the key facts which are relevant to my
                    decision in these applications. The Plaintiffs bought into the My Foot Group in
                    2005, after a period of due diligence spanning five months and having had full
                    access to the books of the My Foot Group. Between 2005 and 2007, the Defendants
                    – who are the majority shareholders of the My Foot Group – allege
                    that the Plaintiff’s financial backers made several attempts to engineer a
                    sale of the My Foot Group. Sometime in the middle of 2007, the Defendants
                    decided to grow the business instead of making attempts to sell. This is alleged
                    to have marked the turning point in the relationship.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       Arising from this change of heart on the part of
                    the majority shareholders, the Plaintiffs are alleged to have embarked on a
                    course that led to the present set of suits. In January 2008, the Plaintiffs
                    exercised their right – which hitherto they had waived – to appoint
                    a nominee director, Mr Raymond Wong, to the board of directors of the companies
                    in the My Foot Group. Wong started to look through the books of the My Foot
                    Group with the assistance of his accountants: the Defendants suspected that Wong
                    was on a fishing expedition to try and find something to use against them. The
                    Defendants allege that it was during this period that the Plaintiffs made their
                    initial attempt to seek a buyout from them.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       During June and July 2008, the Plaintiffs made
                    allegations to the effect that the corporate and franchise structure of the My
                    Foot Group went against the spirit of the Skills Development Fund
                    (“SDF”) scheme which the Workforce Development Authority made
                    available. In gist, the Plaintiffs allege that the My Foot Group was structured
                    such that Reflexology and Holistic Health Academy provided training to the rest
                    of the companies in the group. In so doing, the Academy would benefit from the
                    fees and the rest of the companies in the group would apply for subsidies from
                    the SDF. Overlaid on top of this arrangement are franchise arrangements and
                    inter-company loans which the Plaintiffs allege were not strictly enforced, in
                    that franchise fees and loan repayments were waived. The Plaintiffs assert that
                    this complex structure amounted to an artificial business model which was not
                    sustainable without the availability of SDF subsidies. The Plaintiffs also
                    allege that some of the persons trained by the Academy were not
                    “true” employees of the My Foot Group, in that they were not
                        <em>bona fide</em> employees.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       In June 2008, the Plaintiffs commenced winding
                    up proceedings against three of the companies in the My Foot Group — but
                    not the rest — on two main grounds: the complete loss of the substratum or
                    original purpose of the business and loss of trust and confidence between the
                    Plaintiffs and the majority shareholders. The Plaintiffs relied on the
                    following:</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(a)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">The affairs of these companies are being
                            conducted in a manner contrary to the spirit and objectives of the SDF
                            scheme;</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(b)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">Tax evasion by reclassifying loans extended by
                            the My Foot Group to directors as shareholder loans;</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(c)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">Dilution of the Plaintiffs’ shareholding by
                            a rights issue that was priced below net tangible asset value;
                            and</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(d)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">Failure to recall outstanding
                        loans.</div>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       It needs also be noted that subsequent to the
                    commencement of winding up proceedings, the My Foot Group of companies have
                    commenced suits to recover loans made to the Plaintiff; a suit against Wong for
                    breaches of director’s duties; and the Plaintiffs have also sued the
                    majority shareholders and the CEO of the My Foot Group for misrepresentation,
                    leading to its investment into the group.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Whether minority oppression and winding up causes of action may be
                contained in a single writ of summons</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       More than two years after the winding up actions
                    have been commenced, the Plaintiffs seek to amend the converted winding up
                    actions by inserting a minority oppression action and a relief for a
                    court-mandated buyout. The Defendants have responded with an application to
                    strike out the entire set of winding up actions as an abuse of process. Having
                    considered the arguments of counsel for both Plaintiff and Defendants, I am
                    dismissing both applications. My reasons, in brief, are as
                follows.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       The first issue is whether — as argued by
                    the Defendants — the Plaintiff’s proposed amendment is one that is
                    precluded by law. If not, are there any reasons why the proposed amendment
                    should nevertheless not be allowed?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     The Defendants object to the proposed
                    amendment on the following main grounds. First, that the nature and character of
                    the causes of action for winding up and for minority oppression are so different
                    that, as a matter of law, they cannot be brought together in a single writ of
                    summons. Their submissions are that the operative sections in the Companies Act
                    provide for separate regimes: Part X for companies winding up and section 216
                    for minority oppression. Further, the Defendants submit that a winding up action
                    is governed by the Companies (Winding Up) Rules while an oppression action is
                    governed by the Rules of Court.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     I do not think that it is impossible that a
                    writ of summons may contain both causes of action where there is unity of
                    procedural regime. In this case, the winding up actions, although commenced as
                    originating summons under the Companies (Winding Up) Rules, have been converted
                    to writ actions under Order 88, rule 2(5) of the Rules of Court. I have held
                    previously in <em>Woodcliff Assets Ltd v Reflexology and Holistic
                        Health Academy and Others</em> [2009] SGHC 162, at
                    [28]–[30], that the Rules of Court applies post-conversion. However, this
                    does not mean that the Companies (Winding Up) Rules cease to apply completely:
                    for example, the majority of the Companies (Winding Up) Rules that deal with the
                    procedures post winding up order will apply during the liquidation process. In
                    my view, the Companies (Winding Up) Rules will continue to apply insofar as they
                    are not incompatible with the writ process laid down in the Rules of
                    Court.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     By virtue of Order 88, rule 2(4), an
                    oppression action has to be commenced by writ under the Rules of Court. To my
                    mind, even if both causes of action are contained in a single writ of summons
                    — as will be in this case if the proposed amendments are allowed —
                    it makes no difference that separate sets of procedural rules applied to the
                    winding up action and the minority oppression action when they were commenced.
                    In this case, the winding up actions have been converted and the Rules of Court
                    applies post-conversion; and the Rules of Court applies to a minority oppression
                    writ from commencement. There is therefore an effective merger of the procedural
                    regimes in the present case. This being the case, I do not see any difficulties
                    which prevent a single writ of summons from containing both causes of action
                    since the procedural rules applicable to both causes of action are now
                    determined by the Rules of Court. In the event of any incompatibility, the court
                    has broad powers to make directions for the proper management of the case: see
                    generally, the court’s powers during pre-trial conferences in Order 34A,
                    the court’s duties in a summons for direction in Order 25, rule 2 and
                    inherent powers under Order 92, rule 4.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     To my mind, the juridical grounding of the
                    winding up and the minority oppression causes of action in different parts of
                    the Companies Act does not prevent a single writ of summons from containing both
                    causes of action. The case law on the court’s substantive powers in a
                    winding up action and a minority oppression action is clear: see generally,
                        <em>Sim Yong Kim v Evenstar Investments Pte Ltd</em>
                    [2006] 3 SLR(R) 827, <em>Lim Swee Khiang &amp; Anor v
                        Borden Co (Pte) Ltd &amp; Ors</em> [2006] 4 SLR(R) 745 and
                        <em>Metalform Asia Pte Ltd v Holland Leedon Pte
                        Ltd</em> [2007] 2 SLR(R) 268. In summary, where a cause of
                    action in winding up is made out, the court has to make an order for the winding
                    up of the company. In a minority oppression action, the court will be slow to
                    make a winding up order if there are other options: “a winding-up order
                    is an order of last resort for an oppression application”
                    <em>per</em> Chan Sek Keong CJ in <em>Sim Yong Kim v Evenstar Investments Pte Ltd</em>, at [38]. This power
                    will not be exercised if “the state of affairs … can be remedied
                    by an order other than winding up … In general, the courts are not minded
                    to wind up operational and successful companies unless no other remedy is
                    available.”
                    <em>per</em> Chan Sek Keong CJ in <em>Lim Swee Khiang &amp; Anor v Borden Co (Pte) Ltd &amp; Ors</em>, at
                    [91].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     If the court were to be presented with a
                    winding up originating summons and a minority oppression writ, it will have to
                    determine which (or both) of them are made out on the facts. In <em>Kumagai Gumi Co Ltd v Zenecon Pte Ltd &amp; Ors</em> [1995]
                    2 SLR(R) 304, the court heard a winding up petition and a minority
                    oppression petition. It found that the minority oppression cause of action was
                    made out and ordered the winding up of the company on this basis; but it did not
                    make any orders in the winding up petitions. On appeal, the Court of Appeal
                    affirmed the trial judge’s decision not to make any order in the
                    winding-up petition since oppressive conduct had been established in the
                    minority oppression petition. In <em>Kumagai</em>, each
                    cause of action was contained in a separate originating process. I do not think
                    that the analysis would be any different if both causes of action are contained
                    in the same originating process. The court can make orders for the minority
                    oppression cause of action and make no orders for the winding up cause of
                    action; or it can make orders for the latter and no orders for the
                    former.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     In summary, I am of the view that both a
                    winding up action and a minority oppression action can be contained in a single
                    writ of summons where the winding up action, though commenced by originating
                    summons, has been converted to and ordered to continue as a writ action and the
                    minority oppression action is sought to be added subsequent to such conversion,
                    on the basis that post-conversion, there is a merger of the procedural regime
                    and the Rules of Court applies to both causes of action. I am of the view that
                    the operation of the substantive law on winding up and minority oppression will
                    not be affected by the form in which these causes of action are
                    contained.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Whether proposed amendment should be allowed</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     Having come to the conclusion that there is
                    nothing to prevent an amendment to add the minority oppression cause of action
                    to a winding up writ of summons; is there any reason why the amendment should
                    nevertheless not be allowed? The Defendants’ main substantive argument in
                    resisting the proposed amendments is that the amendments betray the
                    Plaintiffs’ real motives, in that the entire winding up action is an abuse
                    of process since what the Plaintiffs are truly after is to force a buyout on its
                    terms. The Defendants argue that this is an abuse of process and therefore seek
                    a striking out of the Plaintiff’s winding up action. Further, they argue
                    that the proposed amendment should in any event not be allowed on what I will
                    refer to as the ground of estoppel: in that since the Plaintiff had a choice of
                    bringing either a winding up action or minority oppression action, or both, and
                    having chosen to commence a winding up action and conducted the matter along
                    these lines for a substantial period of more than 2 years, they are now estopped
                    from changing tack.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     On the first argument – that the actions
                    should be struck out as the proposed amendment betrays the Plaintiffs’
                    true intentions of forcing a buyout – I think that the submissions must
                    fail. These arguments had been raised previously when the winding up proceedings
                    were first commenced and the Plaintiffs sought to strike out these actions
                    before Justice Belinda Ang (in Summonses 3519–3521 of 2008). The arguments
                    failed then and they have to fail now, since there has not been any substantive
                    developments such that material relevant to the correct determination of this
                    issue, not available earlier, is now available. In other words, there are no
                    exceptional circumstances that justify revisiting these grounds: see <em>RecordTV Pte Ltd v MediaCorp TV Singapore Pte Ltd and
                        others</em> [2009] 4 SLR(R) 43, at [28]–[30]. In any
                    event, I am of the view that the Plaintiffs have a choice on the cause of action
                    which they wish to bring, which they have duly exercised. In <em>RecordTV</em>, the exchange of affidavits of evidence-in-chief
                    justified revisiting the issue of striking out of a portion of the
                    plaintiffs’ case on the ground that there was no evidence from the
                    plaintiffs that supported their claims. In the present case, the facts on which
                    Belinda Ang J decided the earlier applications have remained substantially
                    unchanged. There had been no new development or new revelations of fact or
                    evidence that justify revisiting this issue. The application to insert a new
                    cause of action, to my mind, does not amount to new material which was not
                    available earlier. Particularly since in this case, the Plaintiffs have always
                    had this cause of action available to them in law, right from the time when they
                    commenced these winding up proceedings. This is not a case where the Plaintiffs
                    only realised they have this additional cause of action in minority oppression
                    after discovery disclosed documents which they did not have prior access to. On
                    the contrary, the Plaintiffs could have exercised this choice earlier. They
                    choose to do it now. This alone, without more, is insufficient to warrant
                    revisiting the issues.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     Had the amendment application to add the
                    minority oppression action been taken out earlier, I would have allowed it.
                    However, the application to amend should not be allowed at this stage of the
                    proceedings as it comes too late. A very substantial period of time has elapsed
                    since the winding up actions were first commenced: it has been over 2 years. In
                        <em>Asia Business Forum Pte Ltd v Long Ai Sin and
                        another</em> [2004] 2 SLR(R) 173, the Court of Appeal held,
                    at [12], that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Generally, it is true that an amendment may be allowed at any stage of the
                        proceedings, including post-judgment. Clearly, the later an application is
                        made, the stronger would be the grounds required to justify it. As it is a
                        matter of discretion, no hard and fast rules may be laid down. But at the
                        end of the day, the court must balance it against the justice of the
                        case.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     These actions have taken a windy path,
                    meandering towards trial. Several discovery and interrogatory applications have
                    been fought. The issues have crystallised: there appear only to be a final issue
                    relating the scope, nature and extent of expert evidence on the SDF issue to be
                    settled. Crucially, I do not think that the interlocutory proceedings have
                    uncovered any new facts or evidence which cast a different light on these
                    winding up actions. The facts upon which the Plaintiffs elected to proceed with
                    winding up actions remain substantially unchanged.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     Having chosen to conduct the matter along the
                    path of a winding up action, I do think that the Plaintiffs are now estopped
                    from changing tack by adding in a cause of action of a substantively different
                    nature. At least not at this fairly advanced stage of these proceedings. As I
                    had opined earlier, if this application was made at an earlier stage of the
                    proceedings, I would have allowed it. Where a party has made an election and
                    chosen to commence one cause of action and forego another, he should not
                    afterwards seek an amendment which would effectively give him a second bite at
                    the cherry, particularly where such amendment would cause prejudice to the other
                    party: see <em>Asia Business Forum Pte Ltd v Long Ai Sin and
                        another</em>, at [18].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     I am also persuaded by authorities cited by
                    counsel for the Defendants in support of his proposition that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… if a [party] chooses to conduct his case to a certain point, on
                        certain lines, and leads the [other party] on into a certain position, [the
                        first-mentioned party] has no right to change his front; that is only acting
                        on the well-known doctrine of estoppel ...</p>
<p class="Judg-1">
<em>Per</em> Pollock, B in <em>Steward v The North Metropolitan Tramways Co</em> (1885)
                    16 QBD 178, at p 180. On appeal, the Court of Appeal upheld the
                    decision on the basis that the plaintiff in the case had changed its position
                    based on the defendant’s pleadings such that costs would not compensate
                    the prejudice to the plaintiff: <em>Steward v The North
                        Metropolitan Tramways Co</em> (1886)
                16 QBD 556.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     To my mind, a winding up action and a minority
                    oppression action are fundamentally different. While both may share similarities
                    where, as in this case, they arise from shareholder disputes, the interests of
                    the actors on this stage are very different, depending on the cause of action.
                    In a winding up action commenced by the minority shareholders, their interest is
                    in the liquidation of the company. In such a cause of action, the interests of
                    the majority shareholders and the company are aligned. Both the majority
                    shareholders and the company join, as in this case, to resist the winding up in
                    order to keep the company as a going concern.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     In a minority oppression action, the company
                    takes a back seat as it has no interest in the fight between the minority and
                    majority shareholders. This, to my mind, is why s 216 Companies Act
                    provides the court with a broad range of options to resolve the shareholder
                    dispute, without having to wind up the company; and this is also why the courts
                    are slow to make a winding up order against the company in a minority oppression
                    act. The company may only take an active part in the proceedings if its very
                    existence is threatened or its interests are otherwise adversely
                    affected.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     To my mind, had the Plaintiffs elected to
                    commence both causes of action at an earlier stage, the majority shareholders
                    and the company may have conducted their defences differently from how they have
                    conducted their defences when faced only with the present winding up actions.
                    Having elected to commence only winding up actions, the Plaintiffs cannot now
                    have a second bite at the cherry and add the minority oppression action without
                    good reason. To allow them to do so would be severely prejudicial to the
                    Defendants. To my mind, such prejudice is not something that can be compensated
                    by costs. The Defendants have had to take positions over the past two years as
                    they defended the winding up actions. They may have conducted their defence
                    differently had they known that they were resisting a minority oppression action
                    as well. Further, the substantive facts on which the Plaintiffs had made their
                    election to commence only winding up actions have not changed; discovery and
                    interrogatories have not disclosed major findings which warrant a change of
                    position.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     Finally, I make the observation that on the
                    facts of this case, had the application to amend been made earlier in the
                    proceedings, I would have allowed it as it would have the benefit of providing
                    the court with a more complete range of options to arrive at a pragmatic
                    resolution of the shareholders’ disputes. So far, it has not been argued
                    before me that the My Foot Group is in any financial difficulties; in fact the
                    Defendants submitted that My Foot Group is a going concern and the majority
                    shareholders do not wish to have the companies wound up. However, having picked
                    its horse, the Plaintiffs have to run the course to completion and the track
                    which they have chosen ends either in a winding up order or a dismissal of the
                    action, without any middle ground. They have to convince the Court why it is
                    just and equitable to wind up these companies.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     For these reasons, I dismiss the
                    Plaintiffs’ application to amend and the Defendants’ application to
                    strike out.</p>
