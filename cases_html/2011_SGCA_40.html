        Chao Hick Tin JA (delivering the judgment of the
                court):</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       This is an appeal against the decision of the
                    High Court judge (“the Judge”) made in <em>Tjong
                        Very Sumito and others v Chan Sing En and others</em> [2011] 2 SLR 360
                    (“the Judgment”), where the Judge ordered that the appellants (the
                    plaintiffs in Suit No 89 of 2010 (“the main action”)) be required
                    to furnish security for costs in the sum of $35,000 in favour of the first
                    respondent (the first defendant in the main action) and $40,000 in favour of the
                    second and third respondents (the fifth and sixth defendants in the main action
                    respectively).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Procedural background</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The appellants, who are citizens of Indonesia,
                    commenced the main action against a total of 11 defendants. The first respondent
                    applied by way of Summons No 1720 of 2010 under O 23 r 1 of the Rules of
                    Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2006 Rev Ed) (“the ROC”) for
                    an order for security for costs against the appellants. This application was
                    dismissed by an Assistant Registrar (“the AR”) on the ground that
                    the first appellant (“Sumito”) was ordinarily resident in
                    Singapore. The AR also refused to order security for costs against the second
                    and third appellants (who are nominal plaintiffs, being nominee parties of
                    Sumito). This part of his decision was based on the principle set out in
                        <em>Singapore Civil Procedure 2007</em> (G P
                    Selvam gen ed) (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 2007) (“<em>Singapore
                        Civil Procedure</em>”) at para 23/3/10 and the cases cited
                    therein to the effect that security for costs will not normally be made against
                    plaintiffs who have a co-plaintiff resident within the jurisdiction.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       The first respondent filed an appeal,
                    Registrar’s Appeal No 234 of 2010 (“RA 234/2010”),
                    against the AR’s refusal to order security for costs. The second and third
                    respondents also applied for security for costs against the appellants by way of
                    Summons No 2961 of 2010. The Judge heard this application together with RA
                    234/2010. At the end of the hearings, the Judge reversed the AR’s decision
                    and made the orders mentioned above at <a href="#p1_1">[1]</a>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Arguments below</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Respondents’ arguments below</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       In their submissions below the respondents did
                    not strictly distinguish between arguments relevant to jurisdiction and those
                    relevant to the exercise of the Judge’s discretion under O 23 r 1(1)
                    of the ROC (see <a href="#p1_20">[20]</a> below). However, for
                    clarity we have attempted to arrange their arguments according to such a
                    distinction. The respondents’ arguments before the Judge that were
                    relevant to the court’s jurisdiction to order security for costs were as
                    follows. Firstly, the appellants were all ordinarily resident out of Singapore
                    (under O 23 r 1(1)(<em>a</em>) of the
                        ROC).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span> In addition, the second and third appellants
                    were nominal plaintiffs of Sumito (under O 23 r 1(1)(<em>b</em>) of the ROC).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span> Finally, the respondents pointed out that the
                    appellants were trying to evade the consequences of litigation by using multiple
                    identities and multiple addresses (under O 23 r 1(1)(<em>d</em>) of the ROC).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span> The applicable rules are set out at <a href="#p1_20">[20]</a> below.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       The respondents argued that the court should
                    exercise its discretion to grant security for costs for the reasons mentioned
                    above in support of a finding of jurisdiction as well as the fact that the
                    appellants (a) had obtained a Mareva injunction against the first
                    respondent without good grounds,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_5" id="Ftn_5_1"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span> (b) had done so on the basis of fabricated
                    documents and without full and frank disclosure,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_6" id="Ftn_6_1"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span>
                    (c) had initiated the main action against the respondents
                        vexatiously,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_7" id="Ftn_7_1"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span> and (d) had
                    no ready assets in Singapore against which the respondents could enforce any
                    judgment obtained in their favour.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_8" id="Ftn_8_1"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span> In addition, the second and third
                    respondents stated that Sumito was using false identity documents and that his
                    probity could not be relied upon.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_9" id="Ftn_9_1"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span> The second and third respondents further
                    highlighted the fact that their defence in the main action was likely to
                        succeed.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_10" id="Ftn_10_1"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Appellants’ arguments below</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       As against the respondents’ submissions on
                    the court’s jurisdiction to order security for costs, the appellants
                    argued below that they were <em>not</em> ordinarily
                    resident <em>outside</em> of Singapore for the purposes of
                    O 23 r 1(1)(<em>a</em>).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_11" id="Ftn_11_1"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span> In
                    addition, the second and third appellants were not nominal plaintiffs, nor were
                    they proven unable to pay costs for the purposes of O 23 r 1(1)(<em>b</em>).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_12" id="Ftn_12_1"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span> As for his alleged changes in
                    address (relevant under of O 23 r 1(1)(<em>c</em>)),
                    Sumito argued that the last time that he had been proven to have changed his
                    address was before the commencement of the main action.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_13" id="Ftn_13_1"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       As concerning the exercise of the court’s
                    discretion, the appellants argued that (a) as Sumito <em>was</em> ordinarily resident <em>in</em>
                    Singapore, in any event the court should not order security for costs against
                    him even if it found it had the jurisdiction to do so,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_14" id="Ftn_14_1"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span> (b) no security should be ordered against
                    the second and third appellants as they are co-plaintiffs of Sumito, who was
                    ordinarily resident in Singapore<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_15" id="Ftn_15_1"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span> (the same ground relied upon by the AR), (c)
                    they had a good arguable case in the main action,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_16" id="Ftn_16_1"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span> and (d) the respondents’ applications
                    were intended to stifle their claim in the main action.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_17" id="Ftn_17_1"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a></span> The appellants also denied the allegations
                    regarding Sumito’s supposedly questionable probity.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_18" id="Ftn_18_1"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Decision below</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       The Judge below first restated the law that the
                    words “ordinarily resident” in O 23 r 1(1)(<em>a</em>) were to be given their natural meaning, and that cases
                    outside the security for costs context could be relevant on this issue (see
                        [11]–[12] of the Judgment). The Judge then
                    addressed the question of whether a person could be found to be ordinarily
                    resident in more than one place at a specific point in time. After reviewing
                    Singapore and Commonwealth case law, he concluded that he was not precluded from
                    making such a finding (see [19] of the
                        Judgment).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_19" id="Ftn_19_1"><sup>[note: 19]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       The Judge then addressed the evidence concerning
                    Sumito’s ordinary residence, finding that Sumito was ordinarily resident
                    in Indonesia. He found that this sufficed to trigger his jurisdiction to order
                    security for costs under O 23 r 1(1)(<em>a</em>)
                    of the ROC (see [21] and [24] of the Judgment).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     The Judge also concluded that in addition to
                    being ordinarily resident in Indonesia, Sumito was simultaneously also
                    ordinarily resident in Singapore, although he added a qualification that this
                    was not a necessary finding for his purposes (see [25] of the Judgment). He then held that a plaintiff found to be
                    ordinarily resident both in Singapore as well as another jurisdiction could
                    still have security for costs ordered against him (see [34] of the Judgment).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     Having found that he had jurisdiction to order
                    security for costs, the Judge took note of the fact that the appellants lacked
                    assets in Singapore, the fact that neither parties’ case in the main
                    action was obviously stronger, and the fact that no evidence was produced to
                    prove the application for security was oppressive (see [38], [39], [45] and [46] of the Judgment). He therefore allowed
                    the application of the second and third respondent and allowed the appeal of the
                    first respondent, ordering the appellants to provide $40,000 as security for the
                    costs of the second and third respondents and $35,000 as security for the costs
                    of the first respondent, in all cases up to and including the date for filing
                    the List of Documents in the main action (see [48] of the Judgment).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     Although the Judge noted the AR’s
                    findings that the second and third appellants were nominal plaintiffs (see
                        [9] of the Judgment), he eventually
                    stated that it was unnecessary to make any findings in relation to this issue
                    under O 23 r 1(1)(<em>b</em>) as his jurisdiction
                    had already been triggered under O 23 r 1(1)(<em>a</em>) (see [35] of the
                    Judgment). We note that he also did not go on to address the argument that costs
                    are not normally ordered against foreign parties with co-plaintiffs ordinarily
                    resident in Singapore (see <a href="#p1_7">[7]</a>
                above).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Appellants’ and respondents’ cases</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     The Appellants’ arguments essentially
                    focused on the fact that Sumito is ordinarily resident in Singapore. They
                    contended that any individual who is ordinarily resident in Singapore <em>cannot</em> fall within the scope of O 23
                        r 1(1)(<em>a</em>) of the ROC, even if he is also
                    ordinarily resident outside of Singapore. This was based on the premise that the
                    rule only targets plaintiffs who are not amenable to the process of the
                        court.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_20" id="Ftn_20_1"><sup>[note: 20]</sup></a></span> In
                    this connection they argued that the Judge had erred in not considering an
                    Australian case, <em>ie</em>, <em>Rivera v
                        Australian Broadcasting Corporation</em> [2005] FCA 661,
                        (“<em>Rivera</em>”), which they asserted
                    was an authority in their favour that was brought to the court’s attention
                        below.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_21" id="Ftn_21_1"><sup>[note: 21]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     The appellants also argued in the alternative
                    that, in any event, a person cannot be ordinarily resident in more than one
                    place at any one moment for the purposes of O 23 r 1 of the ROC except in
                    exceptional circumstances.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_22" id="Ftn_22_1"><sup>[note: 22]</sup></a></span> They sought to distinguish certain
                    English cases that stated otherwise on the ground that those cases did not
                    concern the question of security for costs under any equivalent of O 23
                        r 1(1)(<em>a</em>) and/or did not actually result
                    in a finding that a propositus was ordinarily resident in more than one
                        place.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_23" id="Ftn_23_1"><sup>[note: 23]</sup></a></span> On this premise, they sought to argue that
                    Sumito must be found to be ordinarily resident in Singapore only.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_24" id="Ftn_24_1"><sup>[note: 24]</sup></a></span> In any event,
                    the appellants also argued that based on the objective facts Sumito is not
                    ordinarily resident in Indonesia.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_25" id="Ftn_25_1"><sup>[note: 25]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     The appellants finally argued that even if
                    jurisdiction to order security for costs was found, the discretion to do so
                    ought not to have been exercised. This was because the appellants were
                    ordinarily resident within Singapore and had a good arguable case in the main
                        action.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_26" id="Ftn_26_1"><sup>[note: 26]</sup></a></span> We note that the appellants did not
                    seek to revisit the argument made below that no security should be ordered
                    against the second and third appellants as a co-plaintiff of theirs (<em>ie</em>, Sumito) was ordinarily resident in Singapore (see
                        <a href="#p1_7">[7]</a> above).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     In addition to the arguments mentioned, which
                    were already raised at the hearing below, the appellants also wished to raise a
                    new point at this appeal, namely that the second and third respondents had
                    unduly delayed applying for security for costs and that this justified the
                    dismissal of their application.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_27" id="Ftn_27_1"><sup>[note: 27]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     The respondents supported the view, contrary
                    to that of the appellants (see <a href="#p1_13">[13]</a> above),
                    that the rationale for ordering security for costs against a plaintiff
                    ordinarily resident out of Singapore was in fact to ensure the availability of a
                    fund within jurisdiction to meet any costs order obtained in favour of the
                    defendant(s). This rationale also applied to plaintiffs concurrently ordinarily
                    resident both inside and outside of Singapore, meaning that the court should be
                    able to order security for costs against such plaintiffs.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_28" id="Ftn_28_1"><sup>[note: 28]</sup></a></span> Beyond that the respondents’ arguments
                    generally supported the position taken by the Judge.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Issues before this court</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     The issues that are raised in this appeal can
                    be broadly categorised under the following heads:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_18-p2_a"></a>(a)     Whether it is possible for a court
                        to find that a plaintiff is concurrently ordinarily resident in more than
                        one place for the purposes of O 23 r 1(1)(<em>a</em>) of the ROC.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_18-p2_b"></a>(b)     What the underlying rationale is for jurisdiction under
                        O 23 r 1(1)(<em>a</em>) of the ROC –
                        whether it is to ensure the plaintiff’s amenability to the process of
                        the court or to ensure the availability of a fund to facilitate the payment
                        of costs to the defendant(s) if so ordered.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_18-p2_c"></a>(c)     Assuming a plaintiff is found to be ordinarily
                        resident in Singapore <em>as well as</em> outside it,
                        whether jurisdiction is triggered under O 23 r 1(1)(<em>a</em>) of the ROC.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_18-p2_d"></a>(d)     If jurisdiction is triggered under O 23 r 1(1) of
                        the ROC, whether and to what extent the fact of ordinary residence in
                        Singapore is relevant to the exercise of the court’s discretion to
                        order security for costs.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_18-p2_e"></a>(e)     On the facts, whether the appellants are ordinarily
                        resident in Indonesia, Singapore, or both, and therefore whether
                        jurisdiction is triggered under O 23 r 1(1)(<em>a</em>) of the ROC.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_18-p2_f"></a>(f)     Whether, in the circumstances of the case, the Judge had
                        erred in exercising his discretion under O 23 r 1(1) of the ROC to
                        order security for costs against the appellants.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">We will
                    also be considering the new argument of undue delay raised by the appellants at
                    this appeal in relation to the application of the second and third respondents
                    for security for costs.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     We should mention that although at the hearing
                    below questions relating to the scope of O 23 r 1(1)(<em>b</em>) of the ROC and the status of the second and third appellants
                    as nominal plaintiffs were raised, they are no longer live issues in this appeal
                    (see <a href="#p1_15">[15]</a> above). We will, therefore, not be
                    addressing them in this judgment.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Our decision</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The applicable rules of court</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     We will begin our consideration by looking at
                    the applicable rules of court. Order 23 r 1(1) of the ROC provides:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-Heading1">
<b>Security for costs of action, etc.
                            (O. 23, r. 1)</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>1</b>. —(1) Where, on the application of a
                        defendant to an action or other proceeding in the Court, it appears to
                        the Court —</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(<em>a</em>) that the plaintiff is
                            ordinarily resident out of the jurisdiction;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(<em>b</em>) that the plaintiff (not being a
                            plaintiff who is suing in a representative capacity) is a nominal
                            plaintiff who is suing for the benefit of some other person and
                            that there is reason to believe that he will be unable to pay the
                            costs of the defendant if ordered to do so;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(<em>c</em>) subject to paragraph (2), that the
                            plaintiff’s address is not stated in the writ or other originating
                            process or is incorrectly stated therein; or</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(<em>d</em>) that the plaintiff has changed his
                            address during the course of the proceedings with a view to evading the
                            consequences of the litigation,</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">then, if, having regard to all the circumstances of the case, the
                        Court thinks it just to do so, it may order the plaintiff to give such
                        security for the defendant’s costs of the action or other
                        proceeding as it thinks just. </p>
<p class="Judg-1">It would be seen that this rule creates a two-stage test, consisting
                    of the “jurisdiction” stage and the “discretion”
                    stage. It is only if the applicant-defendant can show that the court has
                    jurisdiction to order security against the plaintiff under one of the four
                    grounds set out in O 23 rr 1(1)(<em>a</em>)–(<em>d</em>) that the court would
                    then proceed to consider whether it would, in the circumstances, exercise its
                    discretion to order security in favour of the defendant. For the purposes of
                    this appeal, O 23 r 1(1)(<em>a</em>) contains the
                    most relevant ground of jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The standard of review</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     On an appeal to the Court of Appeal, if it is
                    shown that the court below had correctly decided the question of whether it had
                    jurisdiction to order security for costs, the only remaining question would then
                    relate to the exercise of the court’s discretion in making the order. In
                    such a situation the appellate court’s review function is limited. This
                    was enunciated by this court in <em>Lian Soon Construction Pte
                        Ltd v Guan Qian Realty Pte Ltd</em> [1999] 1 SLR(R) 1053 at
                        [34] in these terms:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It is trite law that an appeal against the exercise of a judge’s
                        discretion will not be entertained unless it be shown that he exercised his
                        discretion under a mistake of law, in disregard of principle, under a
                        misapprehension as to the facts, or that he took account of irrelevant
                        matters, or the decision reached was “outside the generous ambit
                        within which a reasonable disagreement is possible”. …</p>
<p class="Judg-1">This passage was quoted in <em>Westacre Investments Inc
                        v The State-Owned Company Yugoimport SDPR (also known as
                        Jugoimport-SDPR)</em> [2009] 2 SLR(R) 166 at [17], where this court also stated (at
                        [18]) that “the starting
                    presumption would be that the Judge had rightly exercised his
                    discretion.”</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Multiple ordinary residences</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     At [11] of the Judgment, the Judge explained the meaning of the
                    term “ordinarily resident” as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The words “ordinarily resident” should be given
                        their natural and ordinary meaning; the expression is not a term of art with
                        any technical or special meaning. Thus, in [<em>Akbarali v
                            Brent London Borough Council</em>] [1983] 2 AC 309
                            (“[<em>Akbarali</em>]”), the House of
                        Lords held that (at 343):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">... ‘ordinarily resident’ refers to a man’s abode in
                            a particular place or country which he has adopted voluntarily and for
                            settled purposes as part of the regular order of his life for the time
                            being, whether of short or of long duration.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It is the state of mind of the “propositus”
                        that is paramount in determining ordinary residence. Not only should the
                        place of residence be adopted voluntarily (as opposed to enforced presence
                        in a particular jurisdiction by reason of kidnapping or imprisonment
                            <em>etc</em>), there should also be a degree of
                        settled purpose. In this regard, in his Lordship’s judgment in
                            [<em>Akbarali</em>], Lord Scarman observed that (at
                        344):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">... The purpose may be one; or there may be several. It may be
                            specific or general. All that the law requires is that there is a
                            settled purpose. This is not to say that the ‘propositus’
                            intends to stay where he is indefinitely; indeed his purpose, while
                            settled, may be for a limited period. Education, business or profession,
                            employment, health, family, or merely love of the place spring to mind
                            as common reasons for a choice of regular abode. And there may well be
                            many others. All that is necessary is that the purpose of living where
                            one does has a sufficient degree of continuity to be properly described
                            as settled.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">All parties do not dispute the correctness of this basic
                    definition of the term “ordinary residence”; nor do we disagree
                    with it. It will be seen from this passage that a person’s ordinary
                    residence is to be determined not only by his or her physical presence in a
                    place, but also his mental attitude and purpose in relation to that place. In
                    other words, the test for “ordinary residence” depends to a
                    significant degree upon the state of mind of the person. It also connotes
                    residence in a place with some degree of continuity apart from accidental or
                    temporary absences: see <em>Levene v Commissioners of Inland
                        Revenue</em> [1928] AC 217 at 225.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     The position taken by the appellants at this
                    appeal is that a person can only be ordinarily resident in one place at any one
                    time, although he can change his ordinary residence from time to time. We
                    observe that this sits rather curiously with an affidavit deposed by Sumito on
                    18 August 2010 for the hearing below in which he states, “… I am
                    advised and verily believe that a person can be ordinarily resident in more than
                    one country.”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_29" id="Ftn_29_1"><sup>[note: 29]</sup></a></span> With regard to their present position, the
                    appellants relied very much on the case of <em>Wishing Star Ltd v
                        Jurong Town Corp</em> [2004] 1 SLR(R) 1 (“<em>Wishing Star</em>”), which also concerned security for
                    costs. There the High Court stated the following (at [3]–[4]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">3    A branch is but a
                            part of the company. When reference is made to the term
                            “ordinarily resident”, it applies to the company and not
                            to its branches. The question arises as to whether a company can be
                            ordinarily resident in a jurisdiction where its branches are located.
                            Generally speaking, it would do violence to the language to hold that
                            anyone, whether a corporate body or an individual person, may be said to
                            be ordinarily resident in more than one place at a time. A person or a
                            company may always set up more than one residence in as many
                            jurisdictions as they can afford – but a house is not a home.
                            Support for this view can be gleaned from the judgment of the court in
                                <em>Jones v Scottish Accident Co</em> (1886) 17
                            QBD 421 at 423:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">An individual carrying on business in Scotland with branches in
                            England is resident at the place where he carries on his business; why
                            should we adopt a different rule for a company?</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Security for costs may be sought against a corporation under the Companies
                        Act only if that corporation is not “ordinarily resident” in
                        Singapore. Having a registered branch does not necessarily satisfy that
                        criteria. It is no more than having another address, another house. We want
                        to be satisfied that the corporation has deeper roots than that so that it
                        may be excused from providing security for costs in the event that it fails
                        in the action. Hence, having registered an office or even carrying on some
                        of its business through that address may not be sufficient in this regard.
                        …</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">4    Therefore, in itself, the mere fact that a company
                            has a branch within the jurisdiction does not confer any special reason
                            to deny a defendant from getting security for costs. It is possible that
                            a company who has a registered office elsewhere prefers to operate
                            principally from its branch. In such a case, it is possible that the
                            company may be said to be ordinarily resident in the jurisdiction where
                            that branch is located. Thus, courts have preferred to apply “the
                            central management and command of the company” test. …
                            [S]ome exceptions must be recognised. An example would be those cases in
                            which the management and control is divided. It is, of course, possible
                            that a company comprising of, say three main shareholders and directors,
                            may have three equally dominant centres of management if each of the
                            three operate in like-manner and extent in different jurisdictions. In
                            such cases, the company may be said to be ordinarily resident in each of
                            the three jurisdictions for the purposes of an application for security
                            for costs. On the affidavit evidence, it does not appear that Wishing
                            Star Ltd falls into this category. It has a branch, and a reasonably
                            active one involved in a major construction project here. But the seat
                            of management of the company is still in Hong Kong.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     The High Court in <em>Wishing
                        Star</em> relied on the analogy between individual and corporate
                    parties made in <em>Jones v The Scottish Accident Insurance
                        Company, Limited</em> (1886) 17 QBD 421 (“<em>Jones</em>”), where Cave J stated (at
                    423):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... The language of Order XI. [regarding service of a writ out of
                        jurisdiction] does not expressly apply to companies, but the analogy of the
                        practice with regard to individuals is against the present application. In
                        the case of a man residing and carrying on business in Scotland, but having
                        branch establishments in England, it is clear that leave would not be given
                        to issue a writ for service out of the jurisdiction; it would be absurd to
                        say that he was ordinarily resident in England <em>because he
                            had a branch establishment there</em>; and a plaintiff in such a
                        case would be unable to bring himself within sub-s. (<em>c</em>) of Order XI., r. 1. If that is the way in which the
                        Courts have dealt with the case of an individual, why should they not deal
                        in the same way with that of a company? An individual carrying on business
                        in Scotland with branches in England is resident at the place where he
                        carries on his business; why should we adopt a different rule for a company?
                        …</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     Cave J’s point was that an
                    individual did not become ordinarily resident in a place <em>just
                        because</em> he had a branch of his business there, when it was clear
                    that his main residence and business was elsewhere. One should be careful not to
                    extend the scope of what a judge says to situations which were not within his
                    contemplation. For the sake of argument, even if we further extended the example
                    given by Cave J to a person having branches of his business in several (not
                    just one) foreign countries, we would agree with him that this fact, without
                    more, would not mean that that person was concurrently ordinarily resident in
                    those several countries if it was clear that his main residence and business was
                    in one specific place. The logic of Cave J’s conclusion, in the
                        <em>specific context</em> of his example, cannot be
                    faulted. But this is not to say that a person cannot be ordinarily resident in
                    more than one jurisdiction in other appropriate circumstances. Cave J did
                    not, on the facts of the case before him, expressly address that possibility.
                    Similarly, the High Court in <em>Wishing Star</em> was
                    making the same point that having a registered branch or a house in a
                    jurisdiction did not, without more, mean that a company or person was ordinarily
                    resident in that jurisdiction. Indeed, the court in <em>Wishing
                        Star</em> explicitly recognised (at [4]) a scenario where having a branch in a foreign jurisdiction
                    could lead to acquiring ordinary residence in that jurisdiction, namely, where
                    the branch was a place of principal operation. It even went further to say that
                    where several branches were equally dominant centres of management, the company
                    could be said to be ordinarily resident in the various jurisdictions of those
                    branches at the same time.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     Admittedly, if one were to compare [3] with [4] of <em>Wishing Star</em>, there
                    appears, at first blush, to be a slight inconsistency between them. This is
                    because at [3] the court stated that
                    “[g]enerally speaking, it would do violence to the language to hold that
                    anyone, whether a corporate body or an individual person, may be said to be
                    ordinarily resident in more than one place at a time”. But it should be
                    noted that this sentence begins with the words “[<em>g</em>]<em>enerally</em> speaking”
                    [emphasis added]. Clearly the court was conscious that in certain <em>particular</em> circumstances a company or a person could be
                    ordinarily resident in more than one jurisdiction. At [4] of <em>Wishing
                        Star</em>, the court there indeed elaborated on one such set of
                    circumstances. As such, we cannot see how the appellants could rely upon
                        <em>Wishing Star</em> to contend that in law, a company
                    or an individual can only be ordinarily resident in one jurisdiction at any one
                    time. It seems to us that this assertion is based on an erroneous appreciation
                    of the opinion of the court in <em>Wishing
                    Star</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     We would reiterate that what <em>Wishing Star</em> and <em>Jones</em>
                    established is that the place of ordinary residence of a company is the place of
                    its central management. The rationale for this is that establishing a place as a
                    place of central management would indicate the settled purpose of the company to
                    do business from there (see <em>Akbarali v Brent London Borough
                        Council</em> [1983] 2 AC 309 at 344 as quoted in the Judgment at
                        [11], reproduced above at <a href="#p1_22">[22]</a>). If, for instance, all the directors and
                    managers of the company were away from that location for a corporate retreat,
                    the ordinary residence of the company would remain there; it would not be
                    shifted to the place of the retreat. This is because the place of ordinary
                    residence is based on a settled purpose, not on the temporary physical presence
                    of the company’s directors or managers. If the settled purpose of the
                    management is that its principal operations be divided among several places, as
                    described in <em>Wishing Star</em> at [4], the ordinary residence of the company
                    could very well be in those several places simultaneously. The same would follow
                    in the case of an individual. It is a question of fact and evidence as to
                    whether it has been shown that the person has indeed adopted and established two
                    (or more) places of ordinary residence. The fact that he cannot physically be in
                    more than one place at the same time is immaterial. It is the settled purpose
                    that would be determinative. Once this purpose is established, temporary absence
                    from a place does not <em>per se</em> alter the fact that a
                    company or an individual is still ordinarily resident there.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     At this juncture, we should refer to the case
                    of <em>In re Little Olympian Each Ways Ltd</em> [1995]
                    1 WLR 560 (“<em>Little
                    Olympian</em>”), which was cited by the appellants. In <em>Little Olympian</em> at 568, Lindsay J held that to
                    determine where a corporation ordinarily resides, the court must ascertain where
                    its central management and control actually resides. This holding, as mentioned
                    above, is uncontroversial. Lindsay J also stated, in <em>obiter</em> (at 565–566):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… [T]he context of Ord. 23, r. 1(1)(a) [of the English Rules of the
                        Supreme Court 1965, <em>in pari materia</em> with
                        O 23 r 1(1)(<em>a</em>) of the ROC] is, at
                        lowest, consistent with the propositus having only one ordinary residence.
                        If that is not so one gets to the position, surely uncontemplated, that
                        whereas a man ordinarily resident here could not have an order made against
                        him by reason of his impecuniosity, if he also were to be ordinarily
                        resident out of the jurisdiction then there would be jurisdiction to make an
                        order against him. Both the word “ordinarily” and the
                        framework of Order 23 should incline me to a meaning for "ordinarily
                        resident" in this case such that, other than in exceptional circumstances, I
                        should be able to envisage only one such residence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">While this is a strong statement, it is still a qualified one. It
                    envisages that it is still possible for a person to be ordinarily resident in
                    more than one jurisdiction “in exceptional circumstances”. At the
                    end of the day, as stated above at <a href="#p1_27">[27]</a>, the
                    question of multiple places of ordinary residence is a matter of
                    evidence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     Moreover, there are other recent cases which
                    have taken a less conservative approach (and, one could say, perhaps a more
                    appropriate approach in this modern age of globalisation) than <em>Little Olympian</em> in addressing this question of ordinary
                    residence. We note that it is now becoming more common for individuals to have
                    multiple homes and places of business across the globe, more than one of which
                    they might possibly have adopted as their ordinary residence. One English case
                    adopting the more progressive approach is <em>Leyvand v Barasch
                        and others</em> (2000) The Times 23 March 2000 (“<em>Leyvand</em>”), decided by Lightman J. Although
                    on the facts of <em>Leyvand</em> Lightman J did not
                    consider it necessary to make a finding that the plaintiff was ordinarily
                    resident in more than one place simultaneously, he did make the following remark
                    in <em>obiter</em> (at [5]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The fact that the Claimant is ordinarily resident out of the jurisdiction
                        confers on the Court jurisdiction to order him to provide security.
                            <em>It is well established that a claimant may have two
                            ordinary residences, one within the jurisdiction and one outside. The
                            fact that a claimant who is ordinarily resident outside the jurisdiction
                            is also ordinarily resident within the jurisdiction does not preclude
                            the Court [from] ordering security</em>. For Order 23 [of the
                        English Rules of the Supreme Court 1965] confers jurisdiction to order
                        security in the case of a claimant “ordinarily resident out of the
                        jurisdiction” and not in the case of a claimant “not
                        ordinarily resident within the jurisdiction”. ... [emphasis
                        added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">We would further note that Lightman J added (at [8]) that if it were necessary for him to do so
                    he would have held that the claimant was ordinarily resident in England as well
                    as in Israel.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     The Judge had quoted and relied on this
                    passage of Lightman J in coming to his decision (see [16] of the Judgment). What is significant is
                    that <em>Leyvand</em> was endorsed, albeit in <em>obiter</em>, by the Federal Court of Australia in <em>Logue v Hansen Technologies Ltd</em> [2003] FCA 81
                        (“<em>Logue</em>”) at [24]. Both <em>Leyvand</em> and <em>Logue</em> were in turn
                    applied by the New South Wales Supreme Court in <em>Corbett v
                        Nguyen &amp; Ors</em> [2008] NSWSC 1265 (“<em>Corbett</em>”), where there was an actual finding (at
                        [21] and [24]) that the plaintiff was ordinarily
                    resident both in Vietnam and in New South Wales, Australia,
                    simultaneously.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     In so far as the Australian courts are
                    concerned, as early as 1992 the Federal Court of Australia, in the case of
                        <em>Re Kenneth Dudley Taylor; Ex parte Natwest Australia Bank
                        Ltd</em> (1992) 37 FCR 194, had clearly accepted that a
                    person could be ordinarily resident in more than one country. Quoting
                    Lockhart J at [18] –
                    [19]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… At first blush it may seem strange to say that a person can be
                        ordinarily resident in more than one country at the same time; but on closer
                        analysis it is not. Plainly you cannot be physically present in more than
                        one place at the same time. But the lifestyles of people vary greatly. Some
                        people in the ordinary pursuit of their lives regularly or customarily live
                        in more than one place, each of which has an element of permanence about it
                        and is not merely a place of casual or intermittent resort.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Most people, if asked where they were ordinarily resident at a particular
                        time, would name but one place: their home, because that would be the only
                        place in which they normally or customarily live, although they may travel
                        to other places on holidays or business intermittently. Other people may
                        have two or more houses or flats and stay for various purposes and varying
                        lengths of time in each. It may, depending on the circumstances, be
                        permissible to say that at a particular time they are ordinarily resident in
                        each of the places, though they may be at that time physically present
                        somewhere else. …</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     The appellants did not address these cases
                    directly, saying only that in “the English authorities” the
                        <em>ratio</em> did not include a finding that the
                        <em>propositus</em> was ordinarily resident in more
                    than one place.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_30" id="Ftn_30_1"><sup>[note: 30]</sup></a></span> While this was true in <em>Leyvand</em> and the Australian case of <em>Logue</em>, such a finding was actually made in <em>Corbett</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     It seems to us that as a matter of principle,
                    we cannot see any reason why a person cannot be ordinarily resident in more than
                    one jurisdiction. This is a question of fact. We note that some countries, like
                    England and Australia, do permit their citizens to have dual nationality –
                    it would not be unlikely for such persons to have more than one ordinary
                    residence. In any event, there is nothing to stop a person (even if his country
                    of citizenship, like Singapore for example, does not permit dual nationality)
                    from establishing a second home in another country and thus, in turn, have two
                    (or even more than two) ordinary residences. This leads us to the next question:
                    Does a factual finding that a party is ordinarily resident in Singapore
                        <em>as well as</em> in another country, preclude the
                    court from exercising jurisdiction under O 23 r 1(1)(<em>a</em>) of the ROC? To answer this question, we will first
                    consider the rationale underlying jurisdiction under O 23
                        r 1(1)(<em>a</em>).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Rationale underlying jurisdiction under O 23 r 1(1)(a) of
                the ROC</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The appellants’ argument: ensuring amenability to
                jurisdiction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     The parties have urged this court to recognise
                    different underlying rationales as the basis for jurisdiction under O 23
                        r 1(1)(<em>a</em>) of the ROC. The appellants
                    argued that this jurisdiction is fundamentally based on ensuring that a
                    plaintiff is amenable to the court’s enforcement jurisdiction; where the
                    plaintiffs are already amenable in this way, the courts should not invoke this
                    jurisdiction to order security for costs. The corollary of this is that where a
                    plaintiff is ordinarily resident in Singapore, the court should have no
                    jurisdiction to order costs against him, <em>notwithstanding that
                        he may also be ordinarily resident out of Singapore</em> (in spite of
                    the words of O 23 r 1(1)(<em>a</em>)).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_31" id="Ftn_31_1"><sup>[note: 31]</sup></a></span> The appellants justify their position by
                    raising the example of a person with no ordinary residence. The appellants
                    submitted that since the rationale of O 23 r 1(1)(<em>a</em>) is to ensure the plaintiff’s amenability to
                    jurisdiction, it must be interpreted to give jurisdiction to order security
                    against a person ordinarily resident in no jurisdiction (again, in spite of the
                    words of the rule). The appellants asserted that to interpret the rule otherwise
                    would give the “absurd” result that the court could not have
                    jurisdiction to order security for costs against such a person.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_32" id="Ftn_32_1"><sup>[note: 32]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     We accept that it is theoretically possible,
                    though rather unlikely, for a person to have no ordinary residence, since they
                    may not have voluntarily adopted any place with the settled purpose of residing
                    there. This was indeed the finding of the Federal Court of Australia in relation
                    to the plaintiff in <em>Rivera</em> at [50] (reproduced at <a href="#p1_44">[44]</a> below). However, we fail to see how this example supports
                    the appellants’ position. The rule’s positive formulation strongly
                    suggests that where a person has no ordinary residence in any jurisdiction,
                    jurisdiction to order security for costs is not triggered under O 23
                        r 1(1)(<em>a</em>). That seems to be the clear
                    intention of the framers of the rule, whom we can assume were mindful to strike
                    a specific balance between the rights of plaintiffs and defendants. In this
                    light, the appellants did not explain precisely what was so
                    “absurd” about the stated outcome. On the contrary, we find the
                    appellants’ proposed approach unintuitive because it renders completely
                    meaningless the clear express words of O 23 r 1(1)(<em>a</em>), which gives the court jurisdiction where “the
                    plaintiff <em>is</em> ordinarily resident <em>out of</em> [Singapore’s] jurisdiction”
                    [emphasis added].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     Far from being persuaded that the
                    appellants’ proposed rationale justifies departure from the express words
                    of O 23 r 1(1)(<em>a</em>), on the contrary it seems
                    to us that their contention concerning the rationale of that rule is effectively
                    rebutted by the express words of the rule. Only by rejecting their proposed
                    rationale can we avoid the truly absurd prospect of interpreting the rule to
                    mean the exact opposite of what it says. To illustrate the difficulties with the
                    appellants’ suggested rationale we offer the example of a person who is
                    invariably physically present in Singapore but not <em>ordinarily</em> resident there (perhaps because of a lack of settled
                    intention to reside there). He would be no less amenable to the process of the
                    Singapore courts than someone who is ordinarily resident here. The logical
                    consequence of the appellants’ contention, based on their proposed
                    rationale for O 23 r 1(1)(<em>a</em>), is that
                    jurisdiction under that ground would <em>not</em> arise
                    against such a person, <em>even if they were ordinarily resident
                        out of jurisdiction</em>. This would again obviate the express words
                    of the rule.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     We note that the Judge (at [33] of the Judgment) also found that the
                    issue of amenability to process could not be the main rationale (the “be
                    all and end all”) behind the decision whether or not to order security
                    for costs. He came to this conclusion by distinguishing the cases relied upon by
                    the appellants for their proposition. As further support for his conclusion, he
                    pointed out that the court still retains the discretion not to make an order for
                    security even against foreign plaintiffs who are not amenable to process. While
                    we agree with the Judge’s conclusion (for the reasons stated at <a href="#p1_36">[36]</a> above), we feel the need to make an
                    observation with regard to this last reference to the discretion. We must
                    caution against the conflating of, on the one hand, factors or grounds which
                    relate to jurisdiction and, on the other hand, those which are relevant to the
                    exercise of the court’s discretion as to whether security for costs should
                    be ordered (see <a href="#p1_40">[40]</a> and <a href="#p1_48">[48]</a> below). In discussing the question of whether
                    jurisdiction is established under the first stage of the O 23 r 1(1)
                    process, not all arguments relating to the later stage where the discretion is
                    exercised may be relevant (although some of them may be, as at <a href="#p1_40">[40]</a> below).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     Another reason to reject the appellants’
                    proposed rationale was put forward by the first respondent: in principle, a
                    person can be amenable to Singapore’s judicial process in any country if
                    they use the mechanism provided in O 11 of the ROC for service out of
                        jurisdiction.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_33" id="Ftn_33_1"><sup>[note: 33]</sup></a></span> We would say that this argument is, at
                    best, only partially valid as the O 11 procedure does not fully remove the
                    inconvenience and cost of foreign enforcement that underlies the
                    “non-amenability to process” argument relied on by the
                    appellants.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The respondents’ argument: ensuring availability of a fund to
                facilitate payment of costs</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     To turn to the respondents’ proposed
                    rationale, they argued that the foundation of jurisdiction under O 23
                        r 1(1)(<em>a</em>) of the ROC is the need to
                    ensure that a fund exists within the jurisdiction to facilitate payment of costs
                    without the risks, expenses and delay of foreign enforcement.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_34" id="Ftn_34_1"><sup>[note: 34]</sup></a></span> In support of this proposition they
                    cited the decision of this court in <em>Ooi Ching Ling Shirley v
                        Just Gems Inc</em> [2002] 2 SLR(R) 738 (“<em>Shirley Ooi</em>”) at [27] as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… The whole point of ordering a foreign plaintiff or appellant to
                        furnish security is to ensure that a fund would be available within the
                        jurisdiction of this court against which the successful defendant or
                        respondent could enforce the judgment for costs: see <em>Porzelack KG v Porzelack (UK) Ltd</em> [1987] 1 WLR 420 at 422.
                        Without such further security there is a real risk that JGI could be left
                        with a costs order which would be unenforceable or only enforceable with
                        great difficulty and expense, plus delay.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The respondents also relied on a case following <em>Shirley Ooi</em> , namely the High Court decision in <em>Pacific Integrated Logistics Pte Ltd v Gorman Vernel International
                        Freight Ltd</em> [2007] 1 SLR(R) 1017 (“<em>Pacific Integrated Logistics</em>”) at [7], where it was stated:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… The purpose behind O 23 r 1(1)(<em>a</em>) is not limited to protecting a defendant in the extreme
                        situation where an order of costs would otherwise be a “paper
                        judgment”. On a more nuanced level, it is also aimed at <em>reducing</em> the time and expense involved in enforcing
                        such orders. As stated by our Court of Appeal in <em>Ooi
                            Ching Ling Shirley v Just Gems Inc</em> [2002] 2 SLR(R) 738 at
                            [19], one of the rationales for
                        granting security against a foreign plaintiff is “<em>the delay or expense</em> that will arise in enforcing the costs
                        order abroad”. [emphasis in original]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">To these quotations we would add the following statement of the
                    Federal Court of Australia in <em>Logue</em> at [18]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… [T]he purpose of ordering security for costs against an applicant
                        “ordinarily resident outside Australia” is to create a fund
                        within this country against which a successful respondent may enforce a
                        judgment for costs thereby enabling the avoiding of the risks, uncertainties
                        and delays of attempting to enforce such a judgment in the applicant’s
                        claimed country of residence…</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     We would again caution, as we did above (at
                        <a href="#p1_37">[37]</a>), that care should be taken to
                    differentiate between factors relevant to jurisdiction and those relevant to the
                    exercise of discretion. The passages cited from <em>Shirley
                        Ooi</em> (at [27]) and
                        <em>Pacific Integrated Logistics</em> (at [7]) were written in the context of the
                    exercise of the discretion against a foreign plaintiff <em>after</em> jurisdiction had already been established. That said, in
                    this specific instance we find that the rationale stated in those cases is
                    relevant in relation to determining the basis for jurisdiction. This is further
                    supported by the very similar passage in <em>Logue</em> (at
                        [18]), which was written in the
                    context of determining the meaning of the phrase “ordinarily resident
                    outside Australia” for the purposes of finding jurisdiction to order
                    security for costs.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     While we recognise that “ease of
                    enforcement” is a rationale for the jurisdiction under O 23
                        r 1(1)(<em>a</em>), we must state that it is not a
                    determinative factor in all questions arising under that rule. This caveat was
                    recognised by the Judge at [34] of the
                    Judgment in relation to the exercise of his discretion: we would add that it is
                    equally applicable in relation to the question of jurisdiction. It is
                    established law, for example, that the impecuniosity of a plaintiff who is a
                    natural person cannot of itself found jurisdiction to give security for costs
                    (see <em>Ho Wing On Christopher and others v ECRC Land Pte Ltd
                        (in liquidation)</em> [2006] 4 SLR(R) 817 (“<em>Christopher Ho</em>”) at [71]). This is in spite of
                    the fact that enforcement of costs against such a plaintiff may be impossible,
                    to say nothing of risky, expensive or delayed. Therefore, while the
                    inconvenience of enforcing costs against a plaintiff ordinarily resident out of
                    Singapore is one rationale for the jurisdiction provided under O 23
                        r 1(1)(<em>a</em>), inconvenience of enforcement
                    in general is neither a necessary nor a sufficient ground of jurisdiction.
                    Recourse must always be had first and foremost to the wording of the four
                    grounds of jurisdiction under O 23 r 1(1).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     As stated in <em>Christopher
                        Ho</em> at [72], under the law on security for costs, there is a wider
                    public policy of balancing access to the courts for certain high-risk categories
                    of plaintiffs against the need to ensure defendants get their costs if they win.
                    This balance is struck by the rule-framers based on multiple factors. If it was
                    the intention of the framers of the rules that every person who is ordinarily
                    resident in Singapore should not in any circumstances be required to furnish
                    security for costs, O 23 r 1(1)(<em>a</em>) would
                    have been worded differently, perhaps such as to trigger jurisdiction where it
                    appears to the court “that the plaintiff is <em>not</em> ordinarily resident <em>within</em> the
                    jurisdiction”. Instead, the rule is formulated the other way such as to
                    give jurisdiction where it appears to the court “that the plaintiff
                        <em>is</em> ordinarily resident <em>out
                        of</em> the jurisdiction” [emphasis added]. It seems to us,
                    perhaps, too simplistic to suggest that there should be only one specific
                    rationale for the rule. The words of O 23 r 1(1)(<em>a</em>) are clear and we do not see the need to exhaustively explore
                    the precise rationale for the rule in this judgment.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Is jurisdiction triggered under O 23 r 1(1)(a) for persons
                ordinarily resident in Singapore as well as in another jurisdiction?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     In the light of the discussions in <a href="#p1_39">[39]</a> to <a href="#p1_42">[42]</a>
                    above, it should be clear that we believe a plaintiff ordinarily resident out of
                    jurisdiction would come within O 23 r 1(1)(<em>a</em>)
                    even though he or she is also concurrently ordinarily resident within
                    jurisdiction. On their part, the appellants argued that once a party is found to
                    be ordinarily resident in Singapore, the jurisdiction in O 23
                        r 1(1)(<em>a</em>) <em>cannot</em> apply to that party. This is based partly on the
                    rationale already rejected at <a href="#p1_36">[36]</a> above and
                    partly on the authority of various cases.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     One of the cases heavily relied upon by the
                    appellants was <em>Rivera</em> (cited at <a href="#p1_13">[13]</a> above). There the court stated (at <a href="#p1_50">[50]</a>):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It may be accepted that Mr Rivera is not a person who is ordinarily
                        resident in Australia, if that is the relevant question to ask. Indeed, if
                        his actual residence at the moment is considered, it might be said that he
                        is not ordinarily resident anywhere. Although Order 28 rule 3 requires the
                        Court to <em>take into account</em> the fact that an
                        applicant is ordinarily resident outside Australia, there is much to be said
                        for the view that the rule really contemplates that the Court <em>takes into account</em> ordinary residence outside
                        Australia as proof that the applicant is not resident ordinarily in
                        Australia. The place outside Australia where the applicant ordinarily
                        resides is, of itself, of no relevance. What is really relevant is the
                        absence of residence in Australia. However, the rule is expressed in the
                        reverse. It requires there to be <em>taken into
                            account</em> the fact, if it be a fact, that the applicant is
                        ordinarily resident outside Australia. … [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The applicable procedural rule in <em>Rivera</em>

                    current version. The relevant parts of O 28 r 3 of that version of the

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     The appellants argued that the Judge erred in
                    law by not referring to <em>Rivera</em> (see <a href="#p1_13">[13]</a> above). However, as pointed out by the
                    respondents, the procedural rule applicable in <em>Rivera</em> was quite different from our O 23 r 1(1)(<em>a</em>) of the ROC. The Australian rule has no jurisdictional
                    triggers; instead it treats the fact that the plaintiff is ordinarily resident
                    outside Australia as one of the factors to be “taken into account”
                    to inform the court’s discretion in making an order for security. The
                    passage from <em>Rivera</em> cited above should be read in
                    this light. As the Australian rule merely prescribes soft-edged discretionary
                    factors, it is understandable that a court could interpret the concept of
                    “ordinary residence outside Australia” as being similar to that of
                    “lack of ordinary residence in Australia” for the purposes of
                    exercising its discretion. However, under our O 23 r 1(1)(<em>a</em>), the test of being “ordinarily resident out of
                    the jurisdiction” is a hard-edged and specific requirement (what the
                    court in <em>Pacific Integrated Logistics</em> at <a href="#p1_5">[5]</a> aptly called a “<em>threshold condition</em>” [emphasis in original]). The court
                    should not seek to modify it.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     As will be discussed later (at <a href="#p1_51">[51]</a> below), for the purposes of the court
                    exercising its discretion under O 23 r 1(1), the fact that a plaintiff
                    ordinarily resident out of Singapore is <em>also</em>
                    ordinarily resident <em>in</em> Singapore is a factor which
                    the court should take into account in determining whether security for costs
                    should in fact be ordered. That was effectively the substance of the ruling in
                        <em>Rivera</em> at [50]: there it was stated that the court should <em>take into account</em> the fact, if established, that the
                    plaintiff was also resident in Australia in determining whether to order
                    security. Given that the Judge had taken this factor into account in the
                    exercise of his discretion, the fact that he had omitted to expressly refer to
                        <em>Rivera</em> is quite immaterial.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     The appellants also referred to the English
                    cases of <em>Fitzgerald and Others v Williams and
                        Others</em> [1996] QB 657 and <em>Berkeley
                        Administration Inc and Others v McClelland and Others</em> [1990]
                    2 QB 407. However, as pointed out by the respondents,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_35" id="Ftn_35_1"><sup>[note: 35]</sup></a></span> both
                    those cases did not consider the case of a plaintiff ordinarily resident both
                    within and out of jurisdiction. We agree that they ought to be distinguished on
                    that basis.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     It seems to us that some parts of the
                    appellants’ Case appeared to conflate the question of jurisdiction with
                    the exercise of the court’s discretion in making (or maintaining) a
                    security for costs order. In their Case, the appellants quoted the following
                    passage from Jeffrey Pinsler, <em>Singapore Court Practice
                        2009</em> (LexisNexis, 2009) (“<em>Singapore
                        Court Practice</em>”) at p 553:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">An interesting point arises if the plaintiff, having given security on the
                        ground that he was out of the jurisdiction, subsequently settles permanently
                        in the jurisdiction. It is submitted that as it may no longer be just
                        (depending on the circumstances) to require the plaintiff to continue to
                        provide security, the court should have the discretion pursuant to O 23
                        or its inherent jurisdiction to order the security to be returned to the
                        plaintiff. ...</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Having done this, they made the following contention:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_36" id="Ftn_36_1"><sup>[note: 36]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">If the learned author is correct that it may not be just for a person
                        initially ordinarily resident outside of jurisdiction but subsequently
                        becomes ordinarily resident in the jurisdiction to continue to provide
                        security, <em>a fortiori</em> it would not be just to
                        order that a person, who was and always have [<em>sic</em>] been ordinarily resident within the jurisdiction, to
                        provide security for costs.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">It would be apparent that in the above passage from <em>Singapore Court Practice</em>, Professor Pinsler was not addressing
                    the issue of jurisdiction under O 23 r 1(1)(<em>a</em>) but rather the much more specific question of whether in the
                    light of changed circumstances (the plaintiff subsequently settling permanently
                    within jurisdiction) an order for security for costs made against him earlier
                    should continue. Even within that narrow context, which is not relevant to this
                    appeal, the tentative language used by the author is noteworthy: “it
                        <em>may</em> no longer be just (<em>depending on the circumstances</em>) to require a plaintiff to
                    continue to provide security” [emphasis added].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     The respondents in their turn relied on
                    several cases where the Australian courts stated that they had jurisdiction to
                    order security for costs against plaintiffs both ordinarily resident in and out
                    of jurisdiction. The relevant passages were <em>Logue</em>
                    at [24], <em>Corbett</em> at [11] and
                        <em>Robson &amp; Ors v Robson</em> [2010] QSC 378 at
                        [35]–[36] (a passage citing <em>Logue</em> and <em>Corbett</em>). Those cases
                    were decided under Order 28 r 3(1)(a) of the 26 November 2002 version of
                    the Federal Court Rules, r 42.21(1)(a) of the Uniform Civil Procedure Rules
                    2005 (Reg 418 of 2005) (NSW) and r 671(e) of the Uniform Civil
                    Procedure Rules 1999 (SL No 111) (Qld) respectively. Unlike the relevant
                    rule in <em>Rivera</em> (as discussed above at [45]), those rules, like O 23
                        r 1(1)(<em>a</em>) of the ROC, were part of a
                    two-stage process. The rules cited provided that ordinary residence outside
                    jurisdiction was one of several possible triggers for the court’s
                    jurisdiction to order security for costs. Once jurisdiction is established under
                    those rules, a second discretionary stage follows. In fact, <em>Logue</em> and <em>Corbett</em> were decided
                    under rules practically <em>in pari materia</em> with ours.
                    These factors make the cases mentioned highly persuasive authority for the
                    respondents’ proposition.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     On the basis of these authorities and, even
                    more importantly, on a plain reading of O 23 r 1(1)(<em>a</em>) (see <a href="#p1_36">[36]</a> and <a href="#p1_42">[42]</a> above), in our judgment, the court has
                    jurisdiction to order security for costs against a person ordinarily resident in
                    Singapore if he or she is <em>also</em> ordinarily resident
                        <em>out</em> of jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Relevance of ordinary residence in Singapore for the purposes of
                exercising discretion to order for security for costs</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     Although ordinary residence in Singapore does
                    not bar the court’s jurisdiction in making an order for security for costs
                    in respect of a plaintiff who is also ordinarily resident elsewhere, the fact of
                    ordinary residence in Singapore is highly relevant in the exercise of the
                    court’s discretion under O 23 r 1(1) of the ROC. Essentially,
                    the relevant findings in cases relating to the exercise of discretion to order
                    security for costs such as <em>Leyvand</em> (at [5] and [8]), <em>Logue</em> (at [24]), <em>Corbett</em>
                    (at [11]) and <em>Rivera</em> (at [50]) show
                    that where a plaintiff is ordinarily resident in the jurisdiction, this is a
                    strong factor in favour of the court refusing to exercise its discretion to
                    order security for costs. This was recognised by the Judge below, who took note
                    of this principle and the fact that it is in opposition to the usual rule that
                    other matters being equal, security is normally ordered against plaintiffs
                    resident outside of jurisdiction (at [36]–[37] of the
                    Judgment). We believe this to be a well-founded principle that should be
                    considered by the court in the exercise of its discretion to order security for
                    costs.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Where are the appellants ordinarily resident and was jurisdiction
                triggered under O 23 r 1(1)(a) of the ROC?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     The Judge considered the objective evidence
                    relating to the appellants’ place of ordinary residence at [21] of the Judgment and concluded that the
                    appellants were ordinarily resident in Indonesia. There is hardly any basis upon
                    which we could demur from this finding of the Judge, which was based on the
                    evidence before him. We have not been given any cogent reason to depart from
                    that finding of the Judge.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     The Judge found it significant that the
                    appellants consistently provided their Indonesian addresses in various legal
                    documents. For example, the first and third appellants provided an Indonesian
                    address when registering themselves as directors of a Singapore incorporated
                    company, Venus International Productions Pte Ltd. The appellants argued that
                    they were not given a chance to explain this before the Judge,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_37" id="Ftn_37_1"><sup>[note: 37]</sup></a></span>
                    stating that it was possible that they did not realise that they were required
                    to provide their “usual residential address” under ss 173(2) and
                    (6) of the Companies Act (Cap 50, 2006 Rev Ed) for this purpose. We are not
                    persuaded by this explanation. In our view, even if they subjectively did not
                    know or understand the details of that statutory requirement, their provision of
                    Indonesian addresses still showed that they were at least putting forward
                    Indonesian addresses as their main address for business use. These are the
                    addresses that would appear when customers or other interested parties performed
                    Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority searches on the company or its
                    directors. The same reasoning holds true in respect of the Indonesian addresses
                    provided by the appellants in court documents for a separate litigation against
                    the 11<sup>th</sup> defendant in the main action. The appellants
                    sought to explain in the court below that these addresses were “simply a
                    means of identification and for contact purposes”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_38" id="Ftn_38_1"><sup>[note: 38]</sup></a></span> With this
                    having being said, they cannot then deny that by furnishing the Indonesian
                    addresses they regarded these addresses as suitable to identify and contact
                    them. This in turn shows their intention to do business from
                Indonesia.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     At this appeal, the appellants argued that the
                    fact that a person holds himself out as being ordinarily resident in a place is
                    not determinative of the question of his real ordinary residence.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_39" id="Ftn_39_1"><sup>[note: 39]</sup></a></span> While this
                    is technically true, the fact of holding-out is still highly relevant and was
                    rightly given weight below. Here we would underscore the fact that Sumito and
                    the second appellant are persons who have various businesses in Indonesia and
                    Singapore. They are not ignoramuses, nor are they novices in legal proceedings.
                    They would have appreciated the significance of those legal documents in which
                    they were required to fill in their personal particulars.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     Based on all the factors described above, we
                    are of the opinion that the finding of the Judge that the appellants are
                    ordinarily resident outside jurisdiction should be upheld. As such, based on our
                    finding above at <a href="#p1_50">[50]</a>, the Judge was correct
                    to hold that he had jurisdiction to order security for costs against the
                    appellants under O 23 r 1(1)(<em>a</em>) of the
                    ROC.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Exercise of discretion under O 23 r 1(1) of the ROC</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Factors considered by the Judge</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     We now turn to the final issue of whether the
                    Judge had correctly exercised his discretion under O 23 r 1(1) of the ROC.
                    This exercise required him to consider what was just having regard to all the
                    circumstances of the case.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     The Judge recognised (at [37] of the Judgment) that where a plaintiff
                    has been found to be ordinarily resident within jurisdiction (in addition to
                    being ordinarily resident out of it), it will be very rare that security for
                    costs will be ordered against that person. The Judge referred to <em>Leyvand</em> (at [5]),
                        <em>Logue</em> (at [24]) and <em>Corbett</em> (at [11]) for this proposition. Having found that
                    Sumito was ordinarily resident in Singapore as well as in Indonesia, the Judge
                    also found (at [38] of the Judgment)
                    that he lacked property of a fixed and permanent nature in Singapore that could
                    be available for satisfaction of costs. It is not in dispute that Sumito does
                    not own any real property in Singapore, and while he holds shares in two
                    Singapore companies, the Judge regarded those shareholdings as of doubtful
                    value. He also stated (at [39] of the
                    Judgment) that the second and third appellants did not provide evidence relating
                    to their assets in Singapore which could be used to satisfy any costs order in
                    the defendants’ favour: from this he inferred that they did not possess
                    any such assets. Based on <em>Singapore Civil
                        Procedure</em> at para 23/3/11 (and, presumably, the cases cited
                    therein), the Judge found that the appellants did not have such fixed and
                    permanent property as would be certainly available for costs. The Judge regarded
                    this circumstance as a reason in favour of ordering security for costs against
                    them. The Judge, having noted (at [45]
                    of the Judgment) that both sides’ cases in the main action were evenly
                    balanced, did not think that the merits of the case should play a part in his
                    consideration. The Judge also found (at [46] of the Judgment) that beyond a bare assertion, the
                    appellants provided no evidence that the application for security was meant to
                    stifle their claim.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a>58     At this appeal, the appellants have not
                    sufficiently addressed the Judge’s main reason for exercising his
                    discretion, which is that they lack fixed assets in Singapore suitable for
                    satisfying a possible order of costs against them. All they could say in
                    relation to this was that the Judge should not have taken this factor into
                    consideration as Sumito has businesses in Singapore.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_40" id="Ftn_40_1"><sup>[note: 40]</sup></a></span> No explanation was
                    offered to show how this assertion was relevant. The principle laid down in
                        <em>Leyvand</em> (at [5]) that a plaintiff ordinarily resident in jurisdiction would
                    rarely have security ordered against him must be viewed together with what
                    Lightman J stated at [8] of the same
                    case:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The Claimant has a substantial connection with this country. He is plainly
                        resident here: it is unnecessary to decide whether he is also ordinarily
                        resident here. If it were necessary to do so, I would hold that he was.
                        Having regard to his long residence (whether or not ordinary residence) his
                        long connection and <em>substantial assets</em> here, I
                        have no doubt that the Master was right in holding that it is not just to
                        require him to provide security for costs. <em>This view is
                            doubly reinforced by the offer (which I accept) of an undertaking not to
                            complete the sale of his home prior to the likely date of judgment at
                            the trial of this action without prior permission of the
                            Court</em>. … [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a>59     In <em>Corbett</em>,
                    where the plaintiff was found to be ordinarily resident in Vietnam as well as in
                    New South Wales, Australia, the court took into account, <em>inter alia</em>, the fact that he owned a house in Sydney where his
                    family lived and which was worth A$400,000 more than the mortgage debt in
                    refusing to make an order for security for costs against him (see <em>Corbett</em> at [30]). In contrast, in <em>Logue</em>, the
                    applicant owned no assets of any real value in Australia and also chose not to
                    provide the court with any evidence regarding his current financial position
                    (see <em>Logue</em> at [55]). Security for costs was ordered against him. It seems to
                    us that the appellants’ position closely resembles that of the applicant
                    in <em>Logue</em> in that they own no fixed or even
                    substantial property in Singapore and/or have not provided evidence that they
                    own any such usable assets to the court (see <a href="#p1_57">[57]</a> above).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a>60     The position taken by the appellants would
                    appear to be simply this: as they are ordinarily resident in Singapore (leaving
                    aside any question of being concurrently ordinarily resident elsewhere), no
                    security for costs should in any event be awarded against them.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_41" id="Ftn_41_1"><sup>[note: 41]</sup></a></span> However, contrary to this rather absolute
                    argument, it seems to us that there is some sense in saying that while a
                    plaintiff who is ordinarily resident both within and out of jurisdiction
                    deserves substantial recognition of his or her connection with the jurisdiction
                    (see <a href="#p1_51">[51]</a> above), the consideration given to
                    him or her will not be as great as that accorded to a plaintiff who is <em>only</em> ordinarily resident within jurisdiction (unless the
                    latter person falls under O 23 rr 1(1)(<em>b</em>)–(<em>d</em>) of the ROC). The
                    first respondent submitted in his Case:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_42" id="Ftn_42_1"><sup>[note: 42]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… In the situation where a person is <b>only</b> ordinarily resident within jurisdiction, security is
                        found in the fact that it is assumed that the person’s life and assets
                        are only within jurisdiction and they will be reached by process of the
                        court. However, in the situation where a person is <b>both</b> ordinarily resident within jurisdiction and out of
                        jurisdiction (particularly in a case such as this where that person has no
                        fixed or permanent assets within jurisdiction) there is no security in the
                        fact that that person has residence within jurisdiction, because that person
                        can quickly and easily move his assets and himself out of jurisdiction (to
                        the location of his other ordinary residence). … [emphasis in
                        original]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">We see some merit in this contention. As the appellants have not shown
                    that they own any meaningful assets within jurisdiction which the respondents
                    could look to for the purposes of satisfying any costs order which they may
                    eventually obtain, and the Judge’s decision being made in exercise of his
                    discretion under O 23 r 1(1) (see <a href="#p1_21">[21]</a>
                    above), we are unable to see any legitimate basis to interfere with
                it.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">New argument based on undue delay</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a>61     We now turn to a new argument raised by the
                    appellants which was not raised below, namely that the application for security
                    for costs by the second and third respondents was made so late that most of the
                    costs of discovery had already been incurred. As stated in <em>Shirley Ooi</em> at [20],
                    such a late application may be refused unless there is a satisfactory
                    explanation for the delay. A similar view was also expressed in <em>Corbett</em> at [45],
                    with the qualification that “the significance of the delay is reduced by
                    the absence of relevant prejudice”, although it will remain “one
                    factor to be taken into account in the balancing exercise of determining the
                    justice or injustice of making an order for security”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_62"></a>62     However, an important preliminary question
                    arises for consideration in relation to this new point: should this appellate
                    court, in the circumstances of this case, allow this new point to be canvassed?
                    The test for allowing such a new argument was enunciated by this court in
                        <em>Panwah Steel Pte Ltd v Koh Brothers Building &amp; Civil
                        Engineering Contractor (Pte) Ltd</em> [2006] 4 SLR(R) 571 at
                        [15] as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The classic statement of principle is, of course, that of
                        Lord Herschell in the House of Lords decision of <em>The
                            Owners of the Ship “Tasmania” and the Owners of the
                            Freight v Smith and others, The Owners of the Ship “City of
                            Corinth”</em> (<em>The
                            “Tasmania”)</em> (1890) 15 App Cas 223, as
                        follows (at 225):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">My Lords, I think that a point such as this, not taken at the trial,
                            and presented for the first time in the Court of Appeal, ought to be
                            most jealously scrutinised. The conduct of a cause at the trial is
                            governed by, and the questions asked of the witnesses are directed to,
                            the points then suggested. And it is obvious that no care is exercised
                            in the elucidation of facts not material to them.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">
<em>It appears to me that under these circumstances a
                                Court of Appeal ought only to decide in favour of an appellant on a
                                ground there put forward for the first time, if it be satisfied
                                beyond doubt, first, that it has before it all the facts bearing
                                upon the new contention, as completely as would have been the case
                                if the controversy had arisen at the trial; and next, that no
                                satisfactory explanation could have been offered by those whose
                                conduct is impugned if an opportunity for explanation had been
                                afforded them when in the witness box</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis in original]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_63"></a>63     In the circumstances of this case, the new
                    argument proposed by the appellants would turn almost entirely on questions of
                    fact, namely whether most of the costs of the discovery process have been
                    incurred already (which is disputed by the respondents) and whether the
                    respondents have any adequate explanation for the delay. The respondents rightly
                    pointed out that they have not been given a chance to provide such an
                    explanation. The facts relating to the discovery process and the costs incurred
                    therein are not in evidence before this court, although the appellants have
                    somewhat blithely submitted that the facts support their position.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_43" id="Ftn_43_1"><sup>[note: 43]</sup></a></span> The appellants
                    have also not applied for leave to adduce such material as fresh evidence. In
                    the circumstances, we do not think it just to allow the appellants to raise this
                    new point as the second and third respondents will be very much prejudiced
                    thereby.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_64"></a>64     We wish to add in passing that even if this
                    court was minded to consider this argument, and even if the five-month lapse of
                    time between the commencement of the main action and the filing of the
                    application for security by the second and third respondents on 28 June
                    2010 constituted a delay, it has not been shown that the appellants would have
                    been much prejudiced, if at all, by that delay. Here, we have noted that the
                    second and third respondents had made a request to the appellants as early as
                    19 April 2010 (three months after the main action commenced) asking them to
                    voluntarily provide security for costs, failing which the necessary application
                    would be made to the court.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_44" id="Ftn_44_1"><sup>[note: 44]</sup></a></span> On 25 April 2010,
                    the appellants replied, refusing the request and stating their intention to
                    resist such an application.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_45" id="Ftn_45_1"><sup>[note: 45]</sup></a></span> Given the fact that
                    this request was made and brought to the appellants’ attention at an early
                    stage, they cannot now seriously claim that they were prejudiced by any delay on
                    the part of the second and third respondents in making the
                application.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_65"></a>65     In the result, we would dismiss this appeal
                    with costs and the usual consequential orders.</p>
