<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       The plaintiff seeks damages from the defendant,
                    a futures broker, for wrongfully closing out his open futures contracts at a
                    loss. The defendant says that it had the right to do so because the plaintiff
                    failed to fulfil his margin obligations. The plaintiff alleges that he would not
                    have been in breach of those margin obligations if the defendant had credited
                    his incoming funds to his trading account in a timely and expeditious manner.
                    The plaintiff therefore seeks damages from the defendant not only for the
                    capital he lost when the defendant closed out his positions but also for the
                    profits he would have made if the defendant had allowed him to keep those
                    positions open until he could close them out voluntarily.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       For the reasons which follow, I find the
                    plaintiff's claim to be wholly unmeritorious. I have no hesitation in dismissing
                    it in its entirety.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Facts</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       The plaintiff, Mr Joseph Tan Chin Yew, holds a
                    finance-related degree and is qualified as a certified financial analyst. He has
                    12 years of experience in the financial services sector.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> Until 30 June 2012, he was employed by Credit
                    Suisse AG as Asian Chief Economist.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       The defendant, Saxo Capital Markets Pte Ltd, is
                    a broker which allows its clients to trade on a wide variety of international
                    exchanges in a wide variety of financial products using a “fully
                    self-directed trading model.” Under this model, the defendant provides
                    execution-only services to its clients through its electronic trading platform
                    at discounted brokerage fees.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span> The financial products which the
                    defendant enables its clients to trade in this way include futures contracts for
                    commodities such as precious metals.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The plaintiff opens a trading account</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       On 18 May 2011, the plaintiff walked into the
                    defendant’s office in Raffles Place to inquire about its services. One of
                    the defendant’s sales managers, Mr Eoh You Loong (“Loong”),
                    attended to the plaintiff. After speaking to Loong, the plaintiff decided to
                    open a trading account with the defendant. Like all other trading accounts with
                    the defendant, the plaintiff’s was an execution-only
                account.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       As part of the defendant’s account-opening
                    procedures, the plaintiff signed various documents. These included a client
                    application form (“the Application Form”) and a trading checklist
                    (“the Checklist”). The plaintiff also received from Loong the
                    defendant’s standard account-opening documentation. This documentation
                    included the defendant’s General Business Terms (“the
                    GBT”).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The Application Form </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       Part 8 of the Application Form said:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-Heading1">
<b>I/We declare by my/our
                            signature(s):</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">To understand and accept that the General Business Terms and any other
                        relevant terms and conditions (as amended from time to time) apply to my/our
                        entire trading relationship with Saxo Capital Markets.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-Heading1">
<b>Furthermore I/we
                            confirm:</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">That I/we specifically acknowledge and agree that Saxo Capital Markets
                        will provide me/us execution only services and no financial advisory
                        services…</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       By signing the Application Form, the plaintiff
                    acknowledged two things. First, he acknowledged that the terms of the GBT formed
                    part of the contract that governed his relationship with the defendant
                    (“the Contract”). Second, he acknowledged that the defendant was
                    going to provide him execution-only services. It is true that the plaintiff was
                    what the defendant calls a “Premium Account Holder”. There was
                    also some suggestion by the plaintiff that the defendant agreed to make
                    arrangements for him to execute his trades by speaking to a representative of
                    the defendant rather than on his own through its electronic platform.
                        <span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span> None of this changes the fact that his account
                    was an execution-only account.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The General Business Terms</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       The following terms of the GBT are of particular

<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The plaintiff implements a trading strategy</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     In or around May 2011, the plaintiff formed a
                    view that the price of platinum was going to rise while the price of gold was
                    going to fall.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_8" id="Ftn_8_1"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span> He
                    intended to profit from this by implementing a sophisticated and aggressive
                    trading strategy called a “spread trade”. A spread trade involves
                    taking a position on the price difference (known as the “spread”)
                    between two commodities by simultaneously purchasing long futures contracts for
                    the commodity which the trader expects to go up in price (in the
                    plaintiff’s case, platinum) and short futures contracts for the commodity
                    which the trader expects to go down in price (in the plaintiff’s case,
                    gold). A long futures contract is a contract to <em>buy</em> a specific amount of the commodity at a specified price on a
                    specified date in the future. A short futures contract is a contract to
                        <em>sell</em> a specific amount of the commodity at a
                    specified price on a specified date in the future. When the spread between
                    platinum and gold had widened sufficiently in the plaintiff’s favour, his
                    plan was to take his profit by closing out his trading positions.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     On 29 June 2011, the plaintiff credited SGD
                    200,000 to his trading account. On the next day, 30 June 2011, he credited a
                    further USD 95,837.30 to the account.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     On 30 June 2011, the plaintiff corresponded
                    with Loong in a series of emails about the maximum long platinum and short gold
                    positions which he could hold based on the funds in his account.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_9" id="Ftn_9_1"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span> I return to this email
                    correspondence again at [22].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     On 18 July 2011, the plaintiff executed the
                    spread trade described above (at [10]). He instructed one of the
                    defendant’s account managers, Ms Christin Tan (“Christin”),
                    to purchase 24 long futures for 50 troy ounces of platinum each on the New York
                    Mercantile Exchange (“NYMEX”) and 12 short futures for 100 troy
                    ounces of gold each on the Commodity Exchange
                (“COMEX”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     Both NYMEX and COMEX are futures exchanges
                    based in the United States. Both exchanges have electronic trading platforms
                    which operate virtually 24 hours per day, six days a week. Anyone who trades on
                    these markets anywhere in the world is therefore exposed to the risk of adverse
                    market movements at any time.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Trading on margin</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     The plaintiff acquired these 36 futures
                    contracts on margin. That meant that the capital which the plaintiff had to put
                    up in his trading account to buy these 36 futures contracts was a small fraction
                    of his total exposure under them. Trading on margin thus allowed the plaintiff
                    to use a small amount of capital to take a large position on the relative price
                    movements in these two commodities. A small increase in the spread between the
                    price of platinum and gold would amplify his profits. But margin-trading is a
                    double-edged sword: a small decrease in the spread would amplify his losses. And
                    his losses were not in any way limited by the capital he had staked in his
                    account.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     The plaintiff’s 24 platinum contracts
                    had a margin requirement of USD 3,500 each. His total margin requirement for the
                    platinum contracts was therefore USD 84,000. His 12 gold contracts had a margin
                    requirement of USD 4,500 each. His total margin requirement for the gold
                    contracts was therefore USD 54,000. His total margin requirement for all 36
                    contracts was USD 138,000.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     This USD 138,000 was just the
                    plaintiff’s minimum margin requirement. So long as his positions remained
                    open, the plaintiff had to ensure that his account had funds which exceeded what
                    the defendant called the “total margin requirement”. At any given
                    time, the plaintiff’s margin situation was captured in a ratio –
                    which the plaintiff was familiar with – called the margin utilisation
                    ratio (“MUR”). MUR was calculated in real time by the following
                    formula:</p>

</td></tr></tbody></table><br clear="left"/><br clear="left"/>
<p class="Judg-1">Net Equity for Margin is calculated by taking the funds standing to
                    his credit in the account, adding to that all unrealised gains arising from his
                    positions, subtracting from that all unrealised losses arising from his
                    positions and finally subtracting from that certain transaction
                costs.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     If the plaintiff’s positions sustained
                    losses, his MUR would be exactly 100% when the funds standing to his credit in
                    his account less his unrealised losses and transaction costs equalled exactly
                    the total margin requirement. If his positions continued to sustain losses from
                    that point, his Net Equity for Margin would diminish and his MUR would exceed
                    100%.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     If the plaintiff’s MUR equalled or
                    exceeded 100%, the plaintiff would immediately be subject to a “margin
                    call”, <em>ie</em> a contractual obligation
                    immediately to reduce his MUR either by either (a) depositing more funds into
                    his account or (b) closing out some of his open positions. On the face of the
                    Contract, the consequence of being on margin call was severe. Pursuant to Cl 7.2
                    and 7.3 of the GBT (see [9(d)] above) a margin call triggered the following
                        consequences:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_10" id="Ftn_10_1"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_19-p2_a"></a>(a)     The defendant had the right
                        unilaterally to “close one, several or all of the [plaintiff’s]
                        Margin Trades… at its sole discretion without assuming any
                        responsibility towards the [plaintiff] for such
                    action”.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_19-p2_b"></a>(b)     If
                        the defendant “closes one, several or all of the [plaintiff’s]
                        Margin Trades, the [plaintiff] shall expect… that all of the
                        [plaintiff’s] open Margin Trades will be
                closed.”</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     In reality, however, the defendant allowed
                    each client, including the plaintiff, a grace period to bring his MUR below
                    100%. This grace period was 47 hours or until his MUR reached 150%, whichever
                    was sooner.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     Cl 7.2 of the GBT further provided that
                    although the defendant would, “if practicable”, notify the
                    plaintiff if his margin requirements were not met, it was the plaintiff’s
                    “responsibility to continuously ensure that sufficient margin is
                    available on the Account at any time.” The plaintiff understood this
                        well:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_11" id="Ftn_11_1"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span></p>

<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The plaintiff takes his positions</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     As I have mentioned above, the plaintiff
                    executed his spread trades on 18 July 2011. The plaintiff clearly knew the risks
                    of spread trading on margin. Before taking his positions, the plaintiff
                    initiated an email correspondence (see [12] above) with Loong to find out how
                    many platinum and gold futures he could purchase in a 2:1 ratio based on the
                    funds in his account.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_12" id="Ftn_12_1"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span> Loong
                    initially gave the plaintiff a conservative estimate, suggesting that he could
                    purchase 20 platinum futures and 10 gold futures (<em>ie</em> a total of 30 futures contracts). Based on the available
                    funds in his account, this position could withstand an unrealised loss of about
                    USD 119,250 before the plaintiff’s MUR would reach 100% and trigger a
                    margin call. Loong expressly caveated his suggestion by saying that “the
                    above case is just purely my view and not an [<em>sic</em>]
                    suggestion on what to trade”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_13" id="Ftn_13_1"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span> The plaintiff, however, wanted to
                    maximise his risk to maximise his reward. He asked Loong how many contracts he
                    could buy “when pushed to the limit of my funds in the
                        account.”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_14" id="Ftn_14_1"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span> The
                    plaintiff asked whether he could go up to a total of 42 contracts (14 gold and
                    28 platinum) or 45 contracts (15 gold and 30 platinum). To this, Loong replied
                    as follows:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_15" id="Ftn_15_1"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">When seriously push [<em>sic</em>] to the limit of
                        your funds in your account, it should be 24 lots of platinum contracts and
                        12 lots of gold contracts with 45 points gap difference [USD 90,000] set
                        aside as buffer before hitting margin call.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     Thus, when the plaintiff bought these 36
                    futures contracts, he was taking the view that, while he waited to take his
                    profit, his worst-case scenario was an unrealised loss of USD 90,000. With that
                    in mind, he bought 36 contracts to maximise his potential gain based on the
                    capital he had staked as margin. He was deliberately implementing a high-risk
                    trading strategy (spread trading) in a high-risk manner (on margin) to maximise
                    his rewards (by maximising his contracts). He piled risk upon risk upon risk.
                    That necessarily meant that he left no margin for error if his assumed
                    worst-case scenario turned out to be overly-optimistic. That is precisely what
                    happened in August 2011.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The plaintiff’s positions deteriorate on 4 Aug 2011</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The lead-up to the margin calls</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     In early August 2011, the US financial markets
                    experienced turmoil. This led to a narrowing of the spread between platinum and
                    gold. The plaintiff sustained unforeseen losses on his open positions, albeit
                    unrealised losses. The plaintiff’s prediction had been defeated, at least
                    at this point in time. This led to severe upward pressure on his
                MUR.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     On 4 August 2011 at around 15:16, the
                    plaintiff called the defendant to enquire about his MUR (“the 4 August
                    15:16 Conversation”). One Mr Gavin Tay (“Gavin”) attended
                    to the plaintiff. I set out the relevant portions of the 4 August 15:16

                    told the plaintiff that his MUR had reached 80%. Like Gavin, she went on to
                    inform the plaintiff of the defendant’s policy on clients whose MUR

<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The margin calls</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     The platinum and gold markets remained
                    volatile throughout the day on 4 August 2011 (New York time). At 22:44 that day
                    in Singapore, the plaintiff’s MUR reached 100% for the first time. At
                    23:39, the defendant’s automated system sent the plaintiff an email to
                    inform him of a margin call. The email contained the following
                        warning:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_18" id="Ftn_18_1"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">You should either reduce your positions and/or transfer sufficient funds

                    2011 (Singapore time). Each time his MUR dipped below 100% and then went back
                    above it, he received another margin call email. In all, he received 12 more
                    margin call emails that night.</p>

                    his MUR had reached 102% and that he was subject to a margin call. The defendant
                    had no contractual obligation to make this call, and the plaintiff knew it (see
                    [21] above). This was a wake-up call. The plaintiff would have done well to heed
                    it, and to do so with alacrity.</p>

                        defendant’s cash management team of the plaintiff’s incoming

<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_33-p2_c"></a>(c)     although the defendant was giving him 47 hours to meet

                    hours.</p>

                    August 09:41 Conversation”). At 09:49, Christin sent to the plaintiff by
                    email the defendant’s standard settlement instructions (“the
                    Settlement Instructions”) which set out how clients could fund their
                    trading accounts through the defendant’s account at The Hongkong and

                    an immediate automatic close out if his MUR reached 150% – the plaintiff
                    visited the Battery Road branch of SCB to sign the remittance form which had

                    remittance by telegraphic transfer of SGD 40,000 from the plaintiff through SCB
                    and that they should inform her “when the funds [are] sighted and

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     At around 15:00, Christin noticed that the
                    plaintiff’s MUR had shot up to 138%. Concerned for the plaintiff, she
                    called the cash management team to check if the SGD 40,000 had arrived. They
                    told her that the funds had not yet come in.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     At 15:08:52, Christin called the plaintiff
                    (“the 5 August 15:08 Conversation”). She encouraged him to close
                    out some of his trading positions in order to bring down his MUR. As was the
                    case all along, she had no obligation to monitor the plaintiff’s margin
                    position let alone to call him about it (see [21] above). The 5 August 15:08
                    Conversation lasted a total 4 minutes 5 seconds. Two critical events occurred
                    during this phone call. First, at 15:11:23, the plaintiff’s MUR exceeded
                    150%. As a result, the defendant’s automated system immediately closed out
                    all his open positions. Second, 1 minute and 16 seconds later, the defendant

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     The 5 August 15:08 Conversation must be viewed
                    against the backdrop of the precise sequence of events which occurred between
                    14:47 and 15:13 on 5 August, none of which are disputed:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_40-p2_a"></a>(a)     At 14:47, SCB debited SGD 40,000
                        from the plaintiff’s account at SCB pursuant to his instructions given
                        earlier that day and further to the confirmation it sent at 11:41 that
                            morning.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_27" id="Ftn_27_1"><sup>[note: 27]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_40-p2_b"></a>(b)     At 15:05:15, HSBC acknowledged SCB’s SWIFT message
                        crediting the defendant’s account with SGD 40,000.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_28" id="Ftn_28_1"><sup>[note: 28]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_40-p2_c"></a>(c)     At 15:07, HSBC credited SGD 40,000 to the
                        defendant’s segregated trust account with HSBC.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_29" id="Ftn_29_1"><sup>[note: 29]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_40-p2_d"></a>(d)     At 15:08:56, HSBC sent a SWIFT message
                        to the defendant reporting that it had credited SGD 40,000 to the trust
                            account.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_30" id="Ftn_30_1"><sup>[note: 30]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_40-p2_e"></a>(e)     At 15:09:20, the defendant’s cash management team
                        accessed the trust account to validate the transfer of SGD
                            40,000.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_31" id="Ftn_31_1"><sup>[note: 31]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_40-p2_f"></a>(f)     At 15:11:18, the plaintiff’s MUR reached
                        151% and all his positions were automatically closed out.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_32" id="Ftn_32_1"><sup>[note: 32]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_40-p2_g"></a>(g)     At 15:12:25, after conducting its
                        standard anti-money laundering checks, the defendant’s cash management
                        team directed the SGD 40,000 to the plaintiff’s Account.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_33" id="Ftn_33_1"><sup>[note: 33]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_40-p2_h"></a>(h)     At 15:12:34, the defendant’s
                        system booked the SGD 40,000 into the plaintiff’s trading
                        account.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     So the defendant booked the plaintiff’s
                    SGD 40,000 to his account 3 minutes 38 seconds after the defendant received the
                    SWIFT confirmation from HSBC, and 1 minute 16 seconds after the
                    defendant’s system automatically closed out the plaintiff’s
                        positions.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_34" id="Ftn_34_1"><sup>[note: 34]</sup></a></span> The
                    plaintiff says, therefore, that it is the defendant who is responsible for his
                    loss and not himself.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Summary of the parties’ cases</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The plaintiff’s case</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     In his closing submissions, counsel for the
                    plaintiff, Mr Siraj Omar, contends that the defendant was obliged to give the
                    plaintiff the benefit of the SGD 40,000 at 15:08:56<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_35" id="Ftn_35_1"><sup>[note: 35]</sup></a></span> (the point at which HSBC notified the
                    defendant that HSBC had received the plaintiff’s remittance of SGD
                    40,000), and not at 15:12:34 (when the defendant in fact booked the SGD 40,000
                    into the plaintiff’s account). Mr Omar submits further that this
                    obligation arises from an implied term of the Contract that the defendant would
                    provide its services to the plaintiff in a timely and expeditious manner;
                    alternatively because it owed him a duty of care in tort to the same effect. In
                    breach of this implied term, alternatively this duty of care, the defendant gave
                    the plaintiff the benefit of the SGD 40,000 only at 15:12:34. If not for this
                    breach, Mr Omar’s argument goes, the plaintiff’s MUR would have been
                    well below 150% at 15:11:18, and the automatic close-out would not have been
                    triggered at that moment. On that basis, Mr Omar submits the defendant
                    wrongfully closed out the plaintiff’s trading positions at 15:11:18. Thus,
                    says Mr Omar, the defendant is liable to compensate the plaintiff not only for
                    the SGD 214,000 or so which he lost when his positions were automatically closed
                    out but also for the profit of SGD 322,000 or so he would have achieved on his
                    positions when the markets for platinum and gold eventually recovered in his
                    favour, as they did.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_36" id="Ftn_36_1"><sup>[note: 36]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     Even if all this is correct, it still leaves
                    the fact that the plaintiff’s MUR, although below 150% at 15:11:18, would
                    have been above 100% at that time. Mr Omar does not deny that the defendant had
                    a contractual right to close out the plaintiff’s positions immediately and
                    without warning upon the plaintiff’s MUR crossing 100% under Cl 6.10, 7.2
                    and 7.3 of the GBT (see [9(c)] and [9(d)] above). However, Mr Omar argues that
                    the defendant is estopped from relying on these provisions by virtue of Gavin
                    and Christin’s assurances that his positions would not be closed out
                    unless his MUR remained above 100% for more than 47 hours or his MUR reached
                    150%.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     Mr Omar also does not deny that Cl 5.1 and 6.3
                    of the GBT (see [9(a)] and [9(b)]) gives the defendant the contractual right to
                    book incoming funds to the plaintiff’s account at any time up to one
                    business day after the defendant receives the funds in the trust account.
                    However, Mr Omar argues that the defendant is estopped from relying on Cl 5.1
                    and 6.3 of the GBT by the defendant’s clear and unequivocal promise to the
                    plaintiff that he would be entitled to the benefit of the SGD 40,000 as soon as
                    it was credited to the trust account.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     The plaintiff’s case which I have
                    outlined above was his case in closing. This case was significantly different
                    from the one advanced in his pleadings. Below are examples of how his position
                    changed over the course of the proceedings:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_45-p2_a"></a>(a)     In his pleadings, the plaintiff
                        alleged that by closing out his positions, the defendant breached the
                        express terms of the Contract to act according to his
                            instructions.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_37" id="Ftn_37_1"><sup>[note: 37]</sup></a></span>
                        The plaintiff abandoned this allegation in his closing
                    submissions.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_45-p2_b"></a>(b)     In his
                        pleadings, the plaintiff alleged that the defendant negligently handled his
                        funds at 15:08:56 on 5 August 2011 because a fault in the defendant’s
                        automated system occurred at that time which required manual intervention.
                        The delay occasioned by that manual intervention, the plaintiff said, is why
                        the system failed automatically and immediately to attribute his funds to
                        his account before the automatic close-out. <span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_38" id="Ftn_38_1"><sup>[note: 38]</sup></a></span> The plaintiff had no basis for
                        these assertions. Indeed the evidence at trial showed them to be untrue: the
                        defendant did not have an automated system as alleged; and the automated
                        system which it actually did have handled his remittance without
                            error.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_39" id="Ftn_39_1"><sup>[note: 39]</sup></a></span> The plaintiff abandoned these
                        allegations in his closing submissions.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_45-p2_c"></a>(c)     Related to (b), the plaintiff pleaded that the
                        defendant was negligent in failing to have a straight-through processing
                        system that would credit funds to its clients immediately upon receipt at
                            HSBC.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_40" id="Ftn_40_1"><sup>[note: 40]</sup></a></span> However, the plaintiff
                        later conceded that it was not part of his case that the defendant had an
                        obligation to have such a system.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_41" id="Ftn_41_1"><sup>[note: 41]</sup></a></span> The plaintiff abandoned this allegation in
                        his closing submissions.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_45-p2_d"></a>(d)     In his pleadings, the plaintiff alleged the defendant
                        breached its duty to exercise due care and skill in providing its services
                        because a reasonable holder of a capital markets licence in the
                        defendant’s circumstances would have suspended the automatic process
                        for closing out the plaintiff’s positions and would have managed them
                        manually and/or closed them out individually instead of all
                            together.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_42" id="Ftn_42_1"><sup>[note: 42]</sup></a></span>
                        However:</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_45-p2_d-p3_i"></a>(i)       The plaintiff adduced no
                            evidence whatsoever to support this allegation;<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_43" id="Ftn_43_1"><sup>[note: 43]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_45-p2_d-p3_ii"></a>(ii)       The plaintiff quickly conceded in
                            cross-examination that a financial institution with a capital markets
                            licence did not have an obligation to suspend an automatic
                                close-out;<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_44" id="Ftn_44_1"><sup>[note: 44]</sup></a></span> and</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_45-p2_d-p3_iii"></a>(iii)       Any such a duty would be
                            inconsistent with Cl 7.2 and 7.3 of the GBT (see [9(d)]
                        above).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_45-p2_a_1"></a>(a)     The plaintiff abandoned this allegation in his closing
                        submissions.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_45-p2_e"></a>(e)     In
                        his pleadings, the plaintiff alleged that the assurances given by Gavin and
                        Christin that his positions would not be automatically closed out unless his
                        MUR was above 100% for more than 47 hours amounted to a representation that
                        he would have a grace period of two Singapore business days after his MUR
                        crossed 100% to bring his MUR down below 100%.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_45" id="Ftn_45_1"><sup>[note: 45]</sup></a></span> In cross-examination, however, he
                        accepted that the grace period was in fact 47 consecutive hours by the
                        clock. He accepted also that there was no sense in talking about
                        “Singapore business days” because platinum and gold futures
                        were traded on NYMEX and COMEX virtually around the clock and around the
                            world.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_46" id="Ftn_46_1"><sup>[note: 46]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_45-p2_f"></a>(f)     The plaintiff’s primary position
                        in his pleadings was that he was entitled to the benefit of the funds at
                        15:05 (when HSBC received the SWIFT message from SCB).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_47" id="Ftn_47_1"><sup>[note: 47]</sup></a></span> In cross-examination,
                        however, he changed his position and alleged that the defendant ought to
                        have given him the benefit of the funds at 15:07 (when HSBC credited the
                        funds to the trust account). In support, he tried to rely on the Checklist
                        which stated that “your trading account will not be credited until
                        funds are received and booked to <em>your
                        account</em>” (see [70] below). According to him, the phrase
                        “your account” was a reference to the defendant’s trust
                        account with HSBC, not to a customer’s trading account with the
                            defendant.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_48" id="Ftn_48_1"><sup>[note: 48]</sup></a></span> On that basis, he
                        reasoned that his account ought to have been credited immediately when HSBC
                        booked the funds to the trust account at 15:07. However, he had to admit
                        eventually that this interpretation was simply nonsensical. The Checklist is
                        addressed to a client of the defendant. “Your account” in this
                        context is clearly a reference to a <em>client’s</em> trading account with the <em>defendant</em>.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_49" id="Ftn_49_1"><sup>[note: 49]</sup></a></span> It simply cannot refer to the <em>defendant’s</em> account with <em>HSBC</em>. In light of this, the plaintiff’s position
                        shifted once more. After accepting that it made no sense to argue that the
                        defendant had to give him the benefit of the funds <em>before</em> HSBC had even communicated the receipt of the funds
                        to the defendant, he argued instead that the defendant should have given him
                        the benefit of the funds as soon as the “transfer was
                        effected”. To him, this meant the point at which HSBC notified the
                        defendant that HSBC had received the plaintiff’s remittance of SGD
                        40,000 <em>ie</em> 15:08:36.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     None of these changes of position inspires me
                    with any confidence about the plaintiff’s conviction in his own case as it
                    was finally formulated or with his credibility as a witness.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The defendant’s case</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     Counsel for the defendant, Mr Harish Kumar,
                    argues that Cl 5.1, 6.3, 6.10, 7.2 and 7.3 of the GBT provide a complete defence
                    to the plaintiff’s claims because Mr Omar’s implied term and duty of
                    care in tort are not sustainable in the face of these express provisions of the
                    Contract.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     Mr Kumar further contends that, in any event,
                    the defendant acted in a timely and expeditious manner by booking the funds into
                    the plaintiff’s account within 3 minutes 38 seconds of being notified of
                    their receipt.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     Finally, Mr Kumar denies that the defendant is
                    estopped from relying on Cl 5.1, 6.3, 6.10, 7.2 and 7.3 of the
                GBT.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">No scope for implied term</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     I start with Mr Omar’s submission that
                    there was an implied term in the Contract that the defendant had to provide its
                    services to the plaintiff in a “timely and expeditious manner”. In
                        <em>Sembcorp Marine Ltd v PPL Holdings Pte Ltd and another
                        and another appeal</em> [2013] 4 SLR 193 (“<em>Sembcorp</em>”), the Court of Appeal at [101] set out a
                    three-step process to ascertain whether a particular term could be implied into
                    a contract:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(a)    The first step is to ascertain how the gap in the
                            contract arises. Implication will be considered only if the court
                            discerns that the gap arose because the parties did not contemplate the
                            gap.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(b)    At the second step, the court considers whether it
                            is necessary in the business or commercial sense to imply a term in
                            order to give the contract efficacy.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(c)    Finally, the court considers the specific term to
                            be implied. This must be one which the parties, having regard to the
                            need for business efficacy, would have responded “Oh, of
                            course!” had the proposed term been put to them at time of the
                            contract. If it is not possible to find such a clear response, then, the
                            gap persists and the consequences of that gap ensue.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     The first step requires the court to
                    ascertain, as a preliminary point, whether there is indeed a gap in the
                    parties’ contract for an implied term to fill. After all, it is only to
                    fill a gap in the contract and thereby to give effect to the parties’
                    presumed intentions (<em>Sembcorp</em> at [29]) that the
                    court, in certain situations, will hold a term to be implied.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     The first hurdle which the plaintiff has to
                    surmount is Cl 4.10 of the GBT, which states:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<em>In general, Saxo Capital Markets shall act according to
                            instructions as soon as practically possible</em> and shall, as
                        far as practically possible and shall, as far as trading instructions are
                        concerned, act consistent with the bank’s Best Execution Policy.
                        However if, after instructions are received, Saxo Capital Markets believes
                        that it is not reasonably practicable to act upon such instructions within a
                        reasonable time, Saxo Capital Markets may defer acting upon those
                        instructions until it is, in Saxo Capital Markets’ reasonable opinion,
                        practicable to do so or notify the Client that Saxo Capital Markets is
                        refusing to act upon such instructions.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     Mr Omar submits that there is a gap in the
                    Contract because the phrases “[in] general” and “shall act
                    according to instructions <em>as soon as practically
                        possible</em>” are vague. The former fails to identify the
                    specific situations in which this obligation arises and the latter fails to
                    identify what is the standard expected of the defendant. Implying a term that
                    the defendant will provide its services to the plaintiff in a timely and
                    expeditious manner, Mr Omar argues, would fill this gap.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_50" id="Ftn_50_1"><sup>[note: 50]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     The first argument is a non-starter. Cl 4.10
                    deals with situations where a client of the defendant gives instructions to the
                    defendant – such as trading instructions – which the defendant is in
                    a position to carry out without further intervention from the client. This
                    clause is not apt to cover a situation where a client of the defendant tells the
                    defendant to expect incoming funds after he initiates a funds transfer involving
                    a number of intermediate steps. In any event, the phrase “in
                    general” when read in context clearly means that Cl 4.10 applies unless
                    there is some other more specific or more apt provision in the Contract. As for
                    the second argument, the phrase “as soon as practically possible”
                    has to be read together with Cl 5.1 and 6.3 of the GBT which contemplate that it
                    will normally take up to one business day for the defendant to give its clients
                    the benefit of any funds received in its trust account. The Contract, and in
                    particular Cl 5.1 and 6.3, therefore provide specifically for the situation at
                    hand: when a client can expect the defendant to give him the benefit of an
                    inward remittance of funds, even if the client has told the defendant to expect
                    those funds.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     Mr Omar also submits that the term that the
                    plaintiff seeks to imply does not contradict the express terms of the Contract
                    because nothing in the GBT says that the defendant does not owe a duty to its
                    client to provide its services in a timely and expeditious manner. I do not
                    agree. To the extent that the formula “timely and expeditious” is
                    used to argue that the defendant is under a contractual obligation to book funds
                    into a client’s trading account in less than one business day, that is, in
                    substance, <em>directly contradicted</em> by Cl 5.1 of the
                    GBT. The effect of Cl 5.1 is that it <em>cannot</em> be a
                    breach of the Contract for the defendant to book funds into a client’s
                    account at any time up to one business day after receipt. It may even be
                    possible to argue that Cl 5.1 allows the defendant in certain cases to take
                        <em>more</em> than one business day to book funds to a
                    client’s account. But the defendant did not push its argument on Cl 5.1
                    that far and did not need to do so.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     For the same reasons, the plaintiff fails to
                    surmount the second step of the three-stage process set out in <em>Sembcorp</em>. Cl 5.1 of the GBT gives the Contract clear
                    business efficacy without any need to imply an overarching term that the
                    defendant will provide its services to the plaintiff in a timely and expeditious
                    manner.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     This is sufficient to dispose of the
                    plaintiff’s case based on an implied term. However, for the sake of
                    argument, even if I accept that there is an implied term that the defendant will
                    provide its services to the plaintiff in a timely and expeditious manner, I am
                    satisfied that the defendant did not breach any such term. Mr Omar submits that
                    the defendant breached the term because the plaintiff did not get the benefit of
                    the funds at 15:08:56 but only at 15:12:34, 3 minutes 38 seconds later. However,
                    the plaintiff himself accepted that the defendant did not have – and had
                    no obligation to have – an automated processing system which would book
                    the funds into his Account <em>immediately</em> upon
                    receipt of the funds into the trust account. That concession means that, if any
                    such implied term existed, the defendant came under an obligation to comply with
                    it only at 15:08:56. This in substance boils down to an allegation that the 3
                    minutes 38 seconds which the defendant took between 15:08:56 and 15:12:34 was
                    neither timely nor expeditious.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a>58     Mr Omar submits that every second was crucial
                    to a customer subject to a margin call and it was therefore necessary for the
                    defendant to give the plaintiff the benefit of incoming funds as soon as
                    possible. He submits further that, because the plaintiff was subject to a margin
                    call, the defendant’s cash management team should have immediately
                    credited the plaintiff’s incoming funds to his account and postponed its
                    anti-money laundering checks. It was those checks which were being completed
                    when the defendant automatically closed out the plaintiff’s positions. In
                    support of this submission, Mr Omar relies on the concession by Mr Eugene Low, a
                    senior officer in the defendant’s cash management team, that the defendant
                    had the ability to postpone its anti-money laundering checks in a margin call
                    situation so that funds could be made available more quickly to a client who was
                    subject to a margin call. This submission, in my opinion, conflates the
                    defendant’s <em>ability</em> to postpone anti-money
                    laundering checks in a margin call situation with its <em>obligation</em> to do so. The defendant had no obligation to postpone
                    the anti-money laundering checks.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a>59     In truth, taking the implied term argument to
                    its logical conclusion exposes the weakness of the plaintiff’s case. The
                    defendant automatically closed out the defendant’s positions at 15:11:18.
                    Even if the defendant had credited the funds to the plaintiff’s account at
                    15:11:19, his positions would still have been automatically closed out. So the
                    logical conclusion of the plaintiff’s argument is that even if the
                    defendant had taken just 2 minutes and 23 seconds to book the funds into his
                    account (at 15:11:19 instead of 15:12:34), the defendant would still be in
                    breach of this implied obligation. Thus, the implied term contended for by the
                    plaintiff amounts to an argument that the defendant is in breach of its duty to
                    act in a timely and expeditious manner so long as a client fails to receive the
                    benefit of funds before his positions are closed out. The plaintiff’s
                    argument effectively subjects the defendant to a deadline for booking the funds
                    into a client’s account which varies from day to day with the particular
                    circumstances of each client. Implying such a term gives the Contract commercial
                    absurdity rather than commercial efficacy. I would expect the plaintiff, with
                    his background in the financial services sector, to understand that. The
                    defendant included Cl 5.1 in the GBT precisely to avoid such an imprecise and
                    ever-shifting obligation. In rejecting this implied term and its logical
                    conclusion, I also bear in mind that:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_59-p2_a"></a>(a)     The defendant was not in control of
                        when the plaintiff’s MUR would reach 150% since this depended purely
                        on market forces;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_59-p2_b"></a>(b)     The defendant was not in control of the time that HSBC would receive
                        the funds from SCB (the plaintiff in fact accepted in cross examination that
                        he had to take the risk of HSBC failing to receive the funds from SCB in
                            time);<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_51" id="Ftn_51_1"><sup>[note: 51]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_59-p2_c"></a>(c)     The defendant was not in control of the moment
                        HSBC chose to book these funds into the trust account;
                    and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_59-p2_d"></a>(d)     The defendant
                        did not have – and the plaintiff accepted that it had no obligation to
                            have<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_52" id="Ftn_52_1"><sup>[note: 52]</sup></a></span> – an
                        automated system that automatically and immediately attributed sums credited
                        to the trust account to the trading account of a particular client of the
                        defendant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a>60     Even if I were to assume that such a term
                    could be implied into the Contract, the plaintiff produced no evidence to show
                    that the booking of funds to a client’s trading account within 3 minutes
                    and 38 seconds of receiving notification of receipt in its trust account was in
                    breach of any industry norm. On the contrary, on the evidence before me, HSBC
                    also took around the same time to book the SGD 40,000 into the trust account and
                    inform the defendant of this by SWIFT after it received the funds from SCB (see
                    [40] above).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a>61     Therefore, even if there was an implied term
                    that obliged the defendant to book incoming funds to the plaintiff’s
                    account in a timely and expeditious manner, I found that the time of 3 minutes
                    38 seconds taken to do so did not amount to a breach of that implied
                    term.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The defendant was not negligent</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_62"></a>62     The content of any duty of care in tort which
                    required the defendant to provide its services to the plaintiff in a timely and
                    expeditious manner is shaped by the contractual framework governing the
                    parties’ relationship, including Cl 5.1 and 6.3 of the GBT: <em>Go Dante Yap v Bank Austria Creditanstalt AG</em> [2011] 4
                    SLR 559 at [46(c)]. In fact, Mr Omar clarified that the duty of care which the
                    plaintiff sought to impose on the defendant was on the same terms and scope as
                    the implied contractual term.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_53" id="Ftn_53_1"><sup>[note: 53]</sup></a></span> The plaintiff’s alternative claim in
                    tort therefore did not add anything to his claim in contract. Nevertheless, I
                    assume in the plaintiff’s favour that such a duty of care exists. Even on
                    that assumption, I find that the defendant did not breach any such duty of care.
                    I bear in mind that:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_62-p2_a"></a>(a)     The defendant would not be in breach
                        of the Contract if it booked the funds within one business day by virtue of
                        Cl 5.1 of the GBT;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_62-p2_b"></a>(b)     I cannot imply a term into the Contract that the defendant is obliged
                        to provide its services to the plaintiff in a timely and expeditious manner,
                        if that is a contractual duty more onerous than the Contract already
                        provides for; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_62-p2_c"></a>(c)     Even assuming there were such an implied term, the defendant did not
                        breach it when it took 3 minutes 38 seconds to book the funds into the
                        plaintiff’s account.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_63"></a>63     There is therefore no room left to find any
                    breach of any duty of care by the defendant.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The defendant is not estopped</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_64"></a>64     This left the plaintiff’s case resting
                    entirely on the doctrine of promissory estoppel and the doctrine of estoppel by
                    convention. The doctrine of promissory estoppel is often described as a
                    “shield” because it allows a promisee to prevent a promisor from
                    insisting on enforcing his strict legal rights. A promisee cannot use promissory
                    estoppel as a “sword” to found a free-standing cause of action, at
                    least on the orthodox view: <em>Oriental Investments (SH) Pte Ltd
                        v Catalla Investments Pte Ltd</em> [2013] 1 SLR 1182
                        (“<em>Catalla</em>”) at [82]. The same
                    can be said of the doctrine of estoppel by convention: <em>OCBC
                        Capital Investment Asia Ltd v Wong Hua Choon</em> [2012] 2 SLR 311 at
                    [90]. The plaintiff lacks a sustainable cause of action arising from an implied
                    term in contract or a duty of care in tort for the reasons I have given above.
                    That is fatal to the plaintiff’s case in estoppel. If the plaintiff has no
                    sword in contract or tort, it is abundantly clear that he is attempting to use
                    estoppel impermissibly as a sword.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_65"></a>65     However, even if the plaintiff is permitted to
                    raise the estoppel arguments as a sword, his claim still fails for the reasons
                    below.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Promissory estoppel: the law in general</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_66"></a>66     A promisee who relies on the doctrine of
                    promissory estoppel must establish three elements: first, that the promisor made
                    a clear and unequivocal promise, whether by words or conduct; second, that the
                    promisee relied on the promise; and third, that the promisee suffered detriment
                    as a result of the reliance: <em>Aero-Gate Pte Ltd v Engen Marine
                        Engineering Pte Ltd</em> [2013] 4 SLR 409 at [37]. It is also said
                    that a promisor is estopped by promissory estoppel only if it is
                    “inequitable” for him to resile from his promise: <em>Catalla</em> at [38]; <em>Centre for Creative
                        Leadership (CCL) Pte Ltd v Byrne Roger Peter and others</em> [2013] 2
                    SLR 193 at [134(c)]; <em>Lam Chi Kin David v Deutsche Bank
                        AG</em> [2010] 2 SLR 896) at [57].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_67"></a>67     The question of whether a promise is
                    sufficiently clear and unequivocal is a factual inquiry that must take into
                    account the exact contractual provision which is sought to be enforced and the
                    exact promise made in relation to that provision: <em>Chuan Hong
                        Petrol Station Pte Ltd v Shell Singapore (Pte) Ltd</em> [1992] 2
                    SLR(R) 1 at [60].</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Defendant made no unequivocal promise to the plaintiff</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_68"></a>68     Mr Omar’s case is that the defendant was
                    estopped from relying on Cl 5.1 and 6.3 of the GBT. I reproduce those clauses
                    again:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">5.1.</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">When the Client transfers money from an account

                            received the money…</span></p>

                            be cleared for trading when the funds are credited into the

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_69"></a>69     Cl 5.1 and 6.3 of the GBT make two things
                    clear. First, the defendant estimated that it would normally take one business
                    day for funds to be booked into a client’s trading account <u>after</u> the defendant had received the funds. It was
                    therefore implicit that it <em>cannot be a breach</em> of
                    the Contract if funds are booked to an account <u>within</u> one business day of receipt. Second, the plaintiff would
                    not have the benefit of inward remittances of funds until those funds were
                    received by the defendant <u>and booked</u> to his
                    account.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_70"></a>70     The second point was repeatedly brought to the
                    plaintiff’s attention. For example, the Checklist contained the following
                    statement:</p>

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_72"></a>72     Mr Omar relies on several facts to support his
                    submission that the defendant made a clear and unequivocal promise to the
                    plaintiff that he would be entitled to the benefit of the SGD 40,000 as soon as
                    the defendant received notice from HSBC at 15:08:56 that the funds had been
                    received in its trust account. I deal with each of them in turn.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_73"></a>73     First, Mr Omar refers to the 4 August 17:02
                    Conversation (see [27] above). He submits that in this phone call:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_73-p2_a"></a>(a)     Christin informed the plaintiff that
                        his positions would not be closed out if he transferred sufficient funds
                        into his account within one day of a margin call; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_73-p2_b"></a>(b)     Christin did not, at any time during
                        this conversation, inform the plaintiff that there would be a time lag
                        between the time the defendant received the funds and the time he would be
                        given credit for the funds, let alone that the time lag could take up to one
                        business day.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_74"></a>74     I fail to see how these two facts support Mr
                    Omar’s conclusion that Christin thereby promised the plaintiff,
                    unequivocally or otherwise, that the defendant would give him the benefit of the
                    SGD 40,000 as soon as HSBC informed the defendant that it had credited the funds
                    to the trust account. When the plaintiff suggested to Christin that what she had
                    told him meant that he had “two days to put in money” to beat the
                    47-hour deadline, he was clearly thinking in terms of the total time he had
                    available in which to satisfy the margin call. Seen in this context, it was
                    clear to me that when Christin responded “[e]xactly maybe one, just one
                    day”, she was giving the plaintiff an estimate of the time which he had
                    to <em>initiate</em> a telegraphic transfer of funds in
                    order for plaintiff to give him the benefit of the funds before the 47-hour
                    deadline elapsed. And all of this was subject to her express qualification that
                    there was still a compulsory close-out when his MUR reached 150%. This was a
                    point for, not against, the defendant: it supported the defendant’s
                    position that the plaintiff knew that he had to allow up to one day (or to be
                    precise, 23 hours out of the 47-hour grace period) after initiating a transfer
                    for all intermediate steps to be completed, subject always to an automatic
                    close-out at 150% MUR even before the 47 hours expired.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_75"></a>75     I was also satisfied that no promise, let
                    alone an unequivocal promise, could be inferred from Christin’s failure to
                    advise the plaintiff about the time lag. To my mind, the defendant had no
                    positive duty to provide the plaintiff with advice of this nature because the
                    potential time lag was already made clear in Cl 5.1 of the GBT.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_76"></a>76     Second, Mr Omar points out that the defendant
                    did not mention any time lag in:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_76-p2_a"></a>(a)     any of the margin call notification
                        emails received by the plaintiff overnight from 4 August 2011 to 5 August
                        2011 (see [29] above);</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_76-p2_b"></a>(b)     the 5 August 08:30 Conversation (see [31]
                    above),</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_76-p2_c"></a>(c)     the 5
                        August 09:41 Conversation (see [34] above)</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_76-p2_d"></a>(d)     the 5 August 13:26 Conversation (see [36]
                        above); and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_76-p2_e"></a>(e)     the
                        5 August 15:08 Conversation (see [39] above).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_77"></a>77     In none of these communications did the
                    defendant make any promise, let alone an unqualified promise, that the defendant
                    would give the plaintiff the benefit of incoming funds as soon as HSBC informed
                    the defendant that it had credited those funds to the trust account.
                    Furthermore, for the same reasons as those given in [75], there can be no
                    promise arising from the defendant’s silence on the issue when the GBT
                    provides expressly for a time lag.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_78"></a>78     Third, Mr Omar refers to the 5 August 08:30
                    Conversation and the following words said by Christin:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… Let me know once you get down to the bank and do this and I will
                        just let my cash management know that this is coming in. But otherwise you
                        are still expose[d] to anything that goes up at 150 ok? So, ehm, let me
                        know, ok as soon as possible.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_79"></a>79     Mr Omar submits that Christin gave the
                    plaintiff “the clear message… that he would still be at risk of
                    being closed out as long as… [the defendant] had not received the
                        funds.”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_56" id="Ftn_56_1"><sup>[note: 56]</sup></a></span> The basis for this submission is
                    that “[g]iven that Christin wanted to ensure that the plaintiff would be
                    transferring via Telegraph Transfer as the quickest way to obtain the benefit of
                    the funds, she must know that [the plaintiff] would certainly have wanted to
                    know of any such time lag.”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_57" id="Ftn_57_1"><sup>[note: 57]</sup></a></span> To my mind, this argument is misconceived.
                    Christin certainly did tell the plaintiff clearly that he continued to be at
                    risk until the funds came in. But that is not the same thing as promising him
                    unequivocally that he would <em>cease</em> to be at risk
                        <em>as soon as</em> the funds came in. Christin’s
                    point in this conversation was not whether there would or would not be a time
                    lag. All she was doing was pointing out to the plaintiff the three points I have
                    already referred to in [33] above in order to urge him to act quickly. I would
                    have expected the plaintiff to have grasped these points for himself and not to
                    need any such urging.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_80"></a>80     I also gave little weight to this submission
                    as it appears to be an after-thought. At no time after his positions were closed
                    out on 5 August 2011 and before he filed his Reply (Amendment No 2)<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_58" id="Ftn_58_1"><sup>[note: 58]</sup></a></span> in the current proceedings on 10 June 2013
                    did the plaintiff allege that he had relied on this promise by Christin. It was
                    also telling that this allegation did not appear anywhere in the
                    plaintiff’s description of the 5 August 08:30 Conversation in his
                    affidavit of evidence in chief.</p>

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis in bold and bold underline in original]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_83"></a>83     Mr Omar contends that the Settlement
                    Instructions provide that the defendant’s customer meets a margin call if
                    funds transferred by telegraphic transfer are “cleared and
                    received” by the defendant. He points out that there is no express
                    requirement that the funds need to be “booked into” a trading
                    account before a client receives the benefit of such funds. He contrasts this
                    with the instructions concerning payments by cheque which make express mention
                    of booking as a separate step. Mr Omar also points to the fact that the
                    Settlement Instructions do not say that there will be a time lag between the
                    defendant’s receipt of funds and its booking of funds.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_84"></a>84     This argument is flawed. The advisory in
                    relation to telegraphic transfers clearly says: “Payments into <em>your account</em> are deposited only on the condition that
                    such funds have been <em>cleared and received</em> by Saxo
                    Capital Markets.” [emphasis added]. The reference to “Payment into
                    your account” is clearly a reference to the funds being booked into a
                    client’s account. The purpose of this provision is clearly to protect the
                    defendant against payments into the trust account which HSBC later reverses,
                    whether because the payment was mistaken or otherwise, but which the defendant
                    has already credited to a trading account. In relation to the lack of any
                    warning about the time lag, it was clearly not the purpose of the advisory on
                    the Settlement Instructions to warn clients about this. The reasons set out at
                    [75] apply with equal force.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_85"></a>85     Fifth, Mr Omar relies on the 5 August 13:26
                    Conversation (see [36] above). He submits that Christin had this conversation
                    with the plaintiff to ensure that he had transferred the SGD 40,000 <em>via</em> telegraphic transfer and assured him that it would
                    “help with things”. He submits, further, that it could
                    “help with things” only if the defendant gave the plaintiff the
                    benefit of it on the same day, 5 August 2011. But, he points out, Christin did
                    not tell the plaintiff that there would be a time lag between when the defendant
                    received the funds and when the plaintiff would get the benefit of those funds.
                    Again, I cannot divine from this conversation any unequivocal promise to the
                    plaintiff that the defendant would give the plaintiff the benefit of the funds
                    as soon as HSBC informed the defendant that it had credited the funds to the
                    trust account. Quite the contrary, insofar as Christin assured the plaintiff
                    that he would get the benefit of the funds on the same day, that is precisely
                    what happened. Insofar as Mr Omar relies on Christin’s failure to tell the
                    plaintiff that there would be a time lag, I repeat the point set out at [75]
                    above.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_86"></a>86     Sixth, Mr Omar relies on the 5 August 15:08

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_87"></a>87     Mr Omar argues that in this context,
                    Christin’s use of the word “booked” can only mean booked
                    into the trust account and not booked into the plaintiff’s
                account.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_88"></a>88     Contrary to his submissions, however, it is
                    clear that Christin used the word “booked” in the manner that this
                    word was used in the Checklist (see [70] above) and the email confirming receipt
                    of the initial funds (see [71] above). In both these documents, the reference to
                    “booked” is a reference to an act by the defendant (not by HSBC)
                    of crediting funds into a client’s trading account (not the
                    defendant’s trust account with HSBC). The portion of the conversation
                    after the plaintiff’s positions had been automatically closed out makes
                    this clear:</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_89"></a>89     Christin was clearly drawing a distinction
                    between the defendant booking funds to a particular client’s trading
                    account and HSBC informing the defendant that funds had been received in the
                    trust account. She was also pointing out to the plaintiff that the former cannot
                    happen until the latter. This argument was therefore without any
                merit.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_90"></a>90     Finally, Mr Omar pointed out that the
                    plaintiff did not read the GBT (or any other provision of the GBT). This was
                    grasping at straws. The fact that the plaintiff did not read the GBT did not
                    make the contractual term any less binding him – the plaintiff accepted
                    this in cross-examination.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_61" id="Ftn_61_1"><sup>[note: 61]</sup></a></span> By signing the Application
                    Form, he accepted that the GBT applied to his trading relationship with the
                    defendant (see [6] above). In fact, his own pleaded case stated that the GBT
                    formed part of the Contract. He even relied on certain provisions of the GBT in
                    support of his claim.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_62" id="Ftn_62_1"><sup>[note: 62]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_91"></a>91     For these reasons, and subject to [64] above,
                    I reject the plaintiff’s contention that the defendant is estopped under
                    the doctrine of promissory estoppel from relying on Cl 5.1 and 6.3 to argue that
                    it was entitled it to take up to one business day to book the plaintiff’s
                    SGD 40,000 into his account.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Estoppel by convention</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_92"></a>92     In the alternative, Mr Omar seeks to argue
                    that the defendant is prevented from relying on Cl 5.1 by way of an estoppel by
                    convention. However, the plaintiff did not refer to estoppel by convention in
                    his pleadings. It was another afterthought. Assuming it is open to the plaintiff
                    to rely on estoppel by convention, I find that there is no such
                estoppel.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_93"></a>93     An estoppel by convention operates if the
                    following requirements are met:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_93-p2_a"></a>(a)     The parties act in their course of
                        dealing on an assumed and incorrect state of fact or
                    law.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_93-p2_b"></a>(b)     The assumption
                        is either shared by both parties pursuant to an agreement or something akin
                        to an agreement, or is assumed by one party and acquiesced to by the
                        other.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_93-p2_c"></a>(c)     It is
                        unjust or unconscionable to allow the parties (or one of them) to go back on
                        that assumption.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_94"></a>94     Mr Omar relies on the same facts at [73] to
                    [90] above to establish the estoppel by convention. I reject the submission. I
                    assume in the plaintiff’s favour that those facts led him to act on an
                    assumed and incorrect understanding of the defendant’s obligations under
                    the Contract. Even so, the plaintiff was the only party who was labouring under
                    any incorrect assumption. The evidence at trial showed that his assumption was
                    neither shared by the defendant nor acquiesced in by the defendant. Christin
                    proceeded throughout the course of her dealings with the plaintiff on the basis
                    that while the defendant would try to give him the benefit of any remitted funds
                    as soon as possible, the funds would not be booked to his account
                    instantaneously. And as far as the third requirement is concerned, it took some
                    audacity for the plaintiff to allege that it was unconscionable for the
                    defendant to falsify on his purported assumption. The only reason he arrived at
                    this assumed (and incorrect) understanding of the defendant’s obligation
                    under the Contract in the first place was because he had, in his complacency,
                    failed to the read the GBT.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Closing out the plaintiff’s positions once his MUR crossed
                100%</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_95"></a>95     In light of my findings at [68] – [94]
                    above, it is unnecessary for me to consider whether the defendant is estopped
                    from relying on Cl 6.10, 7.2 and 7.3 of the GBT to close out the
                    plaintiff’s open positions immediately and without warning upon the
                    plaintiff’s MUR crossing 100%. The plaintiff’s case based on
                    estoppel requires the defendant to be estopped <em>both</em> from relying on (i) Cl 6.10, 7.2 and 7.3 of the GBT
                        <u>and</u> on (ii) Cl 5.1 and 6.3 of the
                GBT.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_96"></a>96     For what it is worth, however, it does appear
                    to me that the defendant is estopped from relying on these clauses. The
                    defendant did promise clearly to the plaintiff through several conversations
                    that his positions would not be closed out automatically once his MUR reached
                    100% but that he would have a grace period of 47 hours or until his MUR reached
                    150% in which to meet a margin call. It is also clear that the plaintiff relied
                    on these promises, at least immediately after the 4 August 15:16 Conversation,
                    to let his MUR rise above 78% and approach 100%. But none of this assists the
                    plaintiff because the defendant fulfilled this promise: it closed the
                    plaintiff’s positions out <em>only</em> when his MUR
                    crossed 150%. It did not rely on Cl 6.10 to close out his positions as soon as
                    his MUR crossed 100% overnight from 4 August 2011 to 5 August 2011. The position
                    would be different, of course, if the defendant had been in breach of an express
                    or implied term of the Contract or in breach of its duty of care by booking the
                    funds to the plaintiff’s account at 15:12:34 and had to rely on Cl 6.10 to
                    justify its close-out.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Costs</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_97"></a>97     The plaintiff, having succeeded in this
                    action, is entitled to an order for its costs of and incidental to the action.
                    Mr Kumar argues that this is an appropriate case for me to award the defendant
                    costs on the indemnity basis. He does not assert a contractual entitlement to
                    indemnity costs. Instead, he invites me to exercise my discretion to award the
                    defendant indemnity costs under O 59 r 27 of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R5,
                    2006 Rev Ed). This discretion though unfettered must be exercised judicially. An
                    order for indemnity costs is appropriate only in exceptional circumstances:
                        <em>CCM Industrial Pte Ltd v Uniquetech Pte Ltd</em>
                    [2009] 2 SLR(R) 20 at [32]. The burden on a party who seeks an order for
                    indemnity costs as a matter of discretion is therefore a high one.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_98"></a>98     Order 59 r 5 sets out several factors which a
                    court should take into account in considering whether it is
                    “appropriate” to make an exceptional award of indemnity costs.
                    These factors include the conduct of the paying party before and during the
                    proceedings. However, the list in Order 59 r 5 is not exhaustive. In <em>Macmillan Inc v Bishopsgate Investment Trust plc</em> (10

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The power to order taxation on an indemnity basis is not confined to cases
                        which have been brought with an ulterior motive or for an improper purpose.
                        Litigants who conduct their cases in bad faith, or as a personal vendetta,
                        or in an improper or oppressive manner, or who cause costs to be incurred
                        irrationally or out of all proportion as to what is at stake, may also
                        expect to be ordered to pay costs on an indemnity basis if they lose, and
                        have part of their costs disallowed if they win. Nor are these necessarily
                        the only situations where the jurisdiction may be exercised; the discretion
                        is not to be fettered or circumscribed beyond the requirement that taxation
                        on an indemnity basis must be 'appropriate'.</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_99"></a>99     In <em>Three Rivers District
                        Council v The Governor and Co of the Bank of England (No 6)</em>
                    [2006] EWHC 816 (Comm), Tomlinson J (as he then was) gave some useful practical
                    guidance on how the discretion to award indemnity costs ought to be exercised
                    (at [25]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(1)    The court should
                            have regard to all the circumstances of the case and the discretion to
                            award indemnity costs is extremely
                            wide.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(2)    The critical
                            requirement before an indemnity order can be made in the successful
                            defendant's favour is that there must be some conduct or some
                            circumstance which takes the case out of the
                            norm.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(3)    Insofar as the conduct
                            of the unsuccessful claimant is relied on as a ground for ordering
                            indemnity costs, the test is not conduct attracting moral condemnation,
                            which is an a fortiori ground, but rather
                        unreasonableness.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(4)    The court can
                            and should have regard to the conduct of an unsuccessful claimant during
                            the proceedings, both before and during the trial, as well as whether it
                            was reasonable for the claimant to raise and pursue particular
                            allegations and the manner in which the claimant pursued its case and
                            its allegations.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(5)    Where a
                            claim is speculative, weak, opportunistic or thin, a claimant who
                            chooses to pursue it is taking a high risk and can expect to pay
                            indemnity costs if it fails.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(6)    A fortiori, where the claim includes allegation of dishonesty, let
                            alone allegations of conduct meriting an award to the claimant of
                            exemplary damages, and those allegations are pursued aggressively inter
                            alia by hostile
                            cross-examination.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(7)    Where the
                            unsuccessful allegations are the subject of extensive publicity,
                            especially where it has been courted by the unsuccessful claimant, that
                            is a further ground.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(8)    The
                            following circumstances take a case out of the norm and justify an order
                            for indemnity costs, particularly when taken in combination with the
                            fact that a defendant has discontinued only at a very late stage in
                            proceedings:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(a)    Where the claimant advances and aggressively
                                pursues serious and wide ranging allegations of dishonesty or
                                impropriety over an extended period of time;</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(b)    Where the claimant advances and aggressively
                                pursues such allegations, despite the lack of any foundation in the
                                documentary evidence for those allegations, and maintains the
                                allegations, without apology, to the bitter end;</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(c)    Where the claimant actively seeks to court
                                publicity for its serious allegations both before and during the
                                trial in the international, and national and local
                            media;</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(d)    Where the claimant, by its conduct, turns a
                                case into an unprecedented factual enquiry by the pursuit of an
                                unjustified case;</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(e)    Where the claimant pursues a claim which is,
                                to put it most charitably, thin and, in some respects,
                                far-fetched;</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(f)    Where the claimant pursues a claim which is
                                irreconcilable with the contemporaneous documents;</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(g)    Where a claimant commences and pursues
                                large-scale and expensive litigation in circumstances calculated to
                                exert commercial pressure on a defendant, and during the course of
                                the trial of the action, the claimant resorts to advancing a
                                constantly changing case in order to justify the allegations which
                                it has made, only then to suffer a resounding defeat.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_100"></a>100    I agree with Mr Kumar that the
                    plaintiff’s case was thin and ultimately irreconcilable with the
                    contemporaneous documents and indeed with the law. In fact, much of the
                    plaintiff’s case was merely an afterthought which was dispatched quickly
                    during cross-examination. A plaintiff in that position, as Tomlinson J said, is
                    taking a high risk and can ordinarily expect to pay indemnity costs when his
                    claim fails. However, on balance, I conclude in the circumstances of this case
                    that the plaintiff’s conduct as a whole does not rise to the level
                    necessary to make it appropriate to award indemnity costs against him. I say
                    this for two reasons:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_100-p2_a"></a>(a)     First, I accept that the plaintiff
                        had no ulterior motive in bringing these proceedings. He brought the action,
                        misguided though it was, in a good faith attempt to secure compensation for
                        his trading losses to which he genuinely, though perhaps optimistically,
                        thought he was entitled.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_100-p2_b"></a>(b)     Second, I am not satisfied that the plaintiff conducted
                        his case in an oppressive or unreasonable manner or caused costs to be
                        incurred irrationally or disproportionately. Mr Omar on the
                        plaintiff’s behalf conducted the plaintiff’s case with economy
                        (as of course did Mr Kumar for his client). Mr Omar did not protract the
                        cross-examination of the defendant’s witnesses by pursuing hopeless
                        aspects of his client’s case or side issues of marginal relevance. As
                        a result, Mr Omar was able to finish his cross-examination of the four
                        defence witnesses very efficiently in a little over a
                day.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_101"></a>101    For the reasons above, I order that the
                    plaintiff pay the defendant the costs of this action assessed on the standard
                    basis, such costs to be taxed if they cannot be agreed.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_102"></a>102    The plaintiff was clearly the author of his
                    own misfortune. He did not foresee the exceptionally volatile market conditions
                    from 4 August 2011 to 5 August 2011 which led to his positions deteriorating so
                    badly and so quickly that his MUR almost doubled from 78% to 150% in less than
                    24 hours. So he took his own time – almost two and a half hours
                        ­– to initiate the transfer of SGD 40,000 to his
                    account despite Christin’s call at 08:30 that morning.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_103"></a>103    The defendant for its part made the SGD
                    40,000 available to the plaintiff to reduce his MUR in a timely and expeditious
                    manner: 3 minutes and 38 seconds after being notified of receipt at HSBC. The
                    mere fact that the plaintiff’s MUR went above 150% within those 3 minutes
                    and 38 seconds cannot, in itself, mean that the defendant breached its
                    obligations in contract or breached any obligation it might have had in
                    tort.</p>
