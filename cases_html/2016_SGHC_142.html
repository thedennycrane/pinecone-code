The Internet defamation in the present case involves 12 articles posted on several foreign websites (“the Online Articles”). Separately, two articles with content similar to the Online Articles were published in Taiwan on 29 November 2013 in two newspapers (“the News Articles”). Both liability and damages are in issue.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 At its forefront, the Internet defamation in the present case underscores the anonymity the Internet provides to the Internet user who generates material and posts them on websites. This represents the “dark side” of Internet anonymity. As observed in Matthew Collins, <span class="font-italic">The Law of Defamation and the Internet </span>(Oxford University Press, 3rd Ed, 2010) (“<span class="font-italic">Collins</span>”) (at para 5.63):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Internet users can, if they so desire, publish defamatory material to the world at large with little or no risk of being identified or traced. Web-based services enable e-mail accounts to be freely opened in false names or ‘noms de web’. Material can be posted anonymously to bulletin boards, forums, or web sites from Internet cafés, where users pay a small fee for access to a computer which cannot be traced back to them. Many companies, particular in the United States, offer web hosting services which enable Internet users to establish and maintain web sites without having to disclose their true names or addresses. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">3 Any legal measure taken in response to those who knowingly publish false and defamatory information on the Internet, at least for now in Singapore, is confined to the Defamation Act (Cap 75, 2014 Rev Ed) and the common law principles concerning defamation. The element of publication in the law of defamation is bilateral. Consequently, publication in the context of the Internet involves two components. The first component of Internet publication has to do with the identity of the publisher. In the present case, therefore, there must be proof of the identity of the Internet user as well as that of the uploading or posting of the Online Articles, and this has to lead to the defendants. The plaintiffs, however, do not rely on electronic evidence to trace the publication of the Online Articles to the defendants. The absence of such evidence means that the publisher of the Online Articles has not been identified and remains anonymous. Thus, an issue for determination in this judgment is whether the publication element in defamation law can be inferred from the circumstances of the case. This judgment will examine whether, in the absence of direct electronic evidence to prove Internet publication, the plaintiffs have met the requisite civil standard of proof based on predominantly circumstantial evidence. Besides the quality of the circumstantial evidence, an examination of the nature and quality of a so-called admission by the second defendant, to the effect that the defendants are responsible for posting the Online Articles on the Internet, is required. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">4 Posting or uploading material on the Internet alone does not constitute publication for the purpose of Internet defamation. The second component of publication for the purpose of Internet defamation requires proof to the requisite civil standard that the offending material was downloaded from a web server by third party readers in Singapore. There is no presumption that material placed on a generally-accessible website has been published to a substantial number of persons (whether within the jurisdiction or elsewhere). In this case, the plaintiffs have limited their claims to publication of the Online Articles in Singapore. It is common ground that Internet defamation occurs in the jurisdiction where the impugned articles are downloaded and read by a third party. In this sense, publication and jurisdiction are linked and will be examined together. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">5 These aspects of the present case are what set it apart from most other local cases where the identity of the Internet user who posts the offending material is not in dispute. Examples include <span class="font-italic">Lee </span><span class="font-italic">Hsien Loong v Roy Ngerng Yi Ling</span> [2014] SGHC 230 and <span class="font-italic">Attorney-General v Au </span><span class="font-italic">Wai Pang</span> [2015] 2 SLR 352 (and the decision on appeal in <span class="font-italic">Au </span><span class="font-italic">Wai Pang v Attorney-General </span>[2016] 1 SLR 992), where the defendants were the owners and writers of the blogs where the offensive articles were posted and indisputably downloaded by a number of third party readers in Singapore.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">6 In brief, the main legal issue on liability for defamation in the present case is whether the defendants are responsible for the various defamatory publications in the print media and on the Internet. The defendants deny publication of the offensive material and, in so far as the Online Articles are concerned, urge the dismissal of the action in accordance with the abuse of process principles enunciated in <span class="font-italic">Jameel</span><span class="font-italic"> (Yousef) v Dow Jones &amp; Co Inc</span> [2005] QB 946 (“<span class="font-italic">Jameel</span>”). If the defendants’ submissions on publication are accepted, they would be dispositive of the whole case. It is only if the question of publication is answered in favour of the plaintiffs that the other elements that make up the tort of defamation – that the publication refers to the plaintiffs and conveys the pleaded defamatory meanings – need to be determined and, after liability is <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> established, the defence of justification and the question of damages arise for consideration. This judgment will adopt the approach outlined. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">7 The plaintiffs have filed a separate cause of action in conspiracy, but this is not strenuously pursued. This is not surprising since the outcome of their conspiracy claim is very much dependent on proof of the same facts needed to support the defamation claim.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The parties </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">8 The first plaintiff, Qingdao Bohai Construction Group Co., Ltd (“P1”), is a company incorporated in the People’s Republic of China (“PRC”) and was established in 1998 under the name Qingdao Century Decoration Co., Ltd. At all material times, P1 was and is in the business of construction and real estate development.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">9 The second plaintiff, Qingjian Group Co., Ltd (“P2”), is a company established in 1952 in the PRC. It was formerly known as Qingdao Construction Group Corporation. At all material times, P2 was and is in the business of construction, real estate development, capital management, logistics and design consulting. P2 was previously a state-owned enterprise but has since become privatised.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">10 The third plaintiff, Qingjian Realty (South Pacific) Group Pte. Ltd.

At all material times, P3 was and is in the business of building and construction, and has completed a number of projects in Singapore ranging from residential, civil engineering, commercial and institutional to industrial projects.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">11 The fourth plaintiff, Du Bo (“P4”), is a Singapore Permanent Resident who was and is at all material times a director of P1, P2 and P3.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">12 The fifth plaintiff, Yuan Hong Jun (“P5”), is a citizen of the PRC who was and is at all material times the Chairman of P1.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">13 The first defendant, Goh Teck Beng (“D1”), is a Singapore citizen and is the cousin of the second defendant, Ng Teck Chuan (“D2”), who is also a Singapore citizen.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">14 The plaintiffs are represented by Mr Lee Eng Beng <span class="font-italic">SC</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>(“Mr Lee”). Mr Quek Mong Hua (“Mr Quek”) represented the defendants.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The plaintiffs’ pleaded case</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">15 The plaintiffs’ pleaded case is that in or around 2002, P1 and P2 began developing various residential projects in the PRC with HuanYu (Qingdao) Development Co., Ltd (“HuanYu”). HuanYu is a joint venture company originally formed by Grandlink Group Pte Ltd (“Grandlink”) and Qingdao High-tech Industrial Park Economic Development and Investment Company. HuanYu’s first director is one Goh Chin Soon (“Goh”), a Singaporean who is the uncle of both D1 and D2. Goh holds indirect shareholding interests in HuanYu through his majority shareholding in Grandlink. Goh remains a director and general manager of HuanYu and the chairman and legal representative of a related entity, HuanYu Marina City (Qingdao) Development Co., Ltd (“HuanYu Marina”). It is further contended that D1 is also a shareholder of Grandlink and a director of HuanYu and HuanYu Marina. In or around 2007, HuanYu and P1 and/or P2 and their respective related entities became embroiled in a number of lawsuits which were commenced against HuanYu and HuanYu Marina (collectively, “the HuanYu Group”) in relation to a number of construction projects in the PRC. As of the date of the Statement of Claim (Amendment No. 2), the total debt owed by the HuanYu Group to P1 and P2 and their related and/or affiliated companies (collectively, “the Qingjian Group”) was approximately RMB 560 million. The plaintiffs plead that against the backdrop of the bitter legal disputes between the Qingjian Group and the HuanYu Group, D1 and Goh began publishing a number of defamatory articles pertaining to the plaintiffs, which have been posted on a number of websites and online forums. I pause to note at this juncture that according to the defendants’ computer forensic expert, Peter James Alfred Moore (“Moore”), the hosting location of these websites and online forums were, at the time of his report, in China, Hong Kong and the United States.

It is pleaded that in or around the period 21 to 22 November 2013, Xu Bin, the Chief Executive Officer of P2, had, through searches conducted on a number of search engines, discovered approximately 15,000 search results of online articles which were defamatory of the plaintiffs. Xu Bin subsequently wrote to the websites to ask that the defamatory articles to be taken down. Most of the websites responded by removing and/or deleting the defamatory articles. However, despite these measures, various online articles could still be accessed on the World Wide Web. The present suit concerns a total of 12 online articles (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the Online Articles) which were posted on various websites and which contain untrue, scurrilous and defamatory statements which disparage the character and/or damage the reputation of the plaintiffs.

<div class="FootnoteRef text-justify"> Peter James Alfred Moore’s AEIC, Exhibit PM-1, para 27.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">18 The plaintiffs plead that:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) various statements in Articles 1, 3, 9 and 10 are defamatory of all five plaintiffs;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) various statements in Article 2 are defamatory of P1, P2, P4 and P5; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) various statements in Articles 4, 5, 7, 8, 11 and 12 are defamatory of all five plaintiffs.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">19 The plaintiffs further plead that pursuant to and in furtherance of D1 and D2 acting jointly or severally, the defamatory words in the Online Articles were transmitted and/or caused to be transmitted and published by D1 and D2 and/or published by agents procured by D1 and/or D2 on the World Wide Web. Furthermore, D1 and D2 knew and intended that the Online Articles would be republished and/or that such republication was the natural and probable consequence of D1 and D2’s publication of the Online Articles on the World Wide Web.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">20 The plaintiffs plead that by reason of the publication of the Online Articles, the plaintiffs have had their reputation lowered in the estimation of right thinking members of the public. As for the alleged defamatory meanings of the Online Articles, they are described in the pleadings and are set out in Annex B of this judgment. For a quick appreciation of the defamatory meanings, it is useful to refer to paragraph 7 of the plaintiffs’ closing submissions which reads as follows:  </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… the offending articles allege explicitly various acts of criminal and unlawful conduct, corruption, abuse of position and dishonesty on the part of [P4 and P5]. They also allege that [P1, P2 and P3] have been mismanaged or manipulated by [P4 and P5], or that they have had their assets misappropriated or misused by [P4 and P5]. They further allege that [P1, P2 and P3] have been used by [P4 and P5] to implement a grand elaborate scheme of misappropriating state-owned assets.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">21 Separately, two newspaper articles (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the News Articles) with content similar to the Online Articles were published in Taiwan on 29 November 2013 in two newspapers. The News Articles were sent by courier to United Overseas Bank Limited (“UOB Bank”) on or about 23 December 2013 and to Oversea-Chinese Banking Corporation Bank (“OCBC Bank”) in or around end-December 2013. The plaintiffs plead that it is probable that the News Articles were sent to UOB Bank and OCBC Bank by D1 and/or D2 jointly or severally, or that either or both the defendants had procured a third party to do so.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">22 In addition to their claim in defamation, the plaintiffs also bring two alternative claims in conspiracy. In their claim for conspiracy by unlawful means, the plaintiffs plead that D1 and D2 had wrongfully, dishonestly and with intent to injure all or some of the plaintiffs by unlawful means, conspired and combined together to defame the plaintiffs. In their claim for conspiracy by lawful means, the plaintiffs plead that D1 and D2 had conspired and combined together wrongfully and with the sole or predominant intention of injuring the plaintiffs and/or causing loss to the plaintiffs by damaging or destroying the reputation and business interests of the plaintiffs.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">23 I pause at this juncture to mention that the plaintiffs’ closing submissions and evidence make reference to other online articles on 38 unique websites containing content similar to the Online Articles. Significantly, though, this is not precisely pleaded and, for this reason, I shall say no more about these 38 articles.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The defendants’ pleaded case</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 The defendants deny that they published the News Articles and the Online Articles. They plead that in or around October/November 2013, D1 had submitted an online report to the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection of the Communist Party of the PRC (“CCDI”) through the official website of the CCDI. The CCDI is the body within the PRC government charged with rooting out corruption and malfeasance among party cadres. D1 had, with the prior consent of D2, used D2’s name and NRIC number in the online report (“the CCDI report”). This was because D1 travelled frequently to the PRC and was concerned for his personal safety. The CCDI report concerned the conduct of P2, its group of related companies, and P4 and P5 generally, but did not contain all the details alleged in the Online Articles. D1 does not have a copy of the CCDI report as it had been submitted online directly through the CCDI website. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 In addition, the defendants deny that the Online Articles had been published in Singapore. The defendants’ other denial relates to the plaintiffs’ plea that various statements in Articles 1, 3, 9 and 10 as well as Articles 4, 5, 7, 8, 11 and 12 were defamatory of, and had referred to, P3. (Article 2 is not averred to in the pleadings to be defamatory of P3, while Article 6 was no longer accessible at the time of the Statement of Claim (Amendment No. 2) (see [31] below).) Furthermore, the defendants deny that the Online Articles contained statements that meant and/or were understood to bear and/or were capable of bearing the meanings pleaded by the plaintiffs, or any defamatory meaning. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 The defendants plead that if and in so far as the statements in the Online Articles meant and/or were understood to bear the meanings pleaded by the plaintiffs, they were true in substance and in fact. In this regard, relying on the defence of justification, the defendants plead that P4 and P5 had deliberately and systematically misappropriated the state-owned assets of P2 through various complicated schemes and a web of companies including: (a) P1 and P2; (b) Shandong Haiwei Real Estate Co., Ltd. (“Shandong Haiwei”) and Shanghai Heliyuan Investment Co., Ltd. (“Shanghai Heliyuan”); and (c) Guoqing Holdings Group Co., Ltd. (“Guoqing”).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 As for the News Articles, the defendants deny that they had jointly or severally sent the News Articles to UOB Bank or OCBC Bank, or had procured a third party to do so. They plead that the contents of the News Articles are not similar to the Online Articles published in the name of D2.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 Finally, the defendants deny that there was any conspiracy as pleaded by the plaintiffs.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The parties’ agreement</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 Following the close of the trial, parties reached an agreement on a number of points concerning the Online Articles and the News Articles. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 With regard to the Online Articles, the plaintiffs and defendants agreed that they shall be grouped into the following three categories, and that the contents and meaning of the articles within each category shall be deemed to be the same:</div><table class="table table-sm table-bordered"><tbody><tr><td><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-center"><span class="font-weight-bold">Category</span></div></td><td><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-center"><span class="font-weight-bold">Articles</span></div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-center"><span class="font-weight-bold">A</span></div></td><td><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-center">Articles 1, 3, 9 and 10</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-center">(with Article 1 being the representative article)</div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-center"><span class="font-weight-bold">B</span></div></td><td><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-center">Article 2</div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-center"><span class="font-weight-bold">C</span></div></td><td><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-center">Articles 4, 5, 7, 8, 11 and 12</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-center">(with Article 4 being the representative article)</div></td></tr></tbody></table><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31  So as not to unduly lengthen this judgment, I have annexed the substantive portions of the plaintiffs’ English translation of Articles 1, 2 and 4 as Annex A to this judgment. I note that Article 6 was not within the scope of the parties’ agreement, and this was probably because Article 6 was no longer accessible and its precise contents could not be retrieved. Indeed, there is no substantive content to Article 6 in the parties’ Agreed Bundle.

</div>
</div> There is only a message that states “Sorry, this topic does not exist or has been removed or is being assessed”. I also note that the plaintiffs’ claim concerning Article 6 is based on an extract of Article 6 which remains visible from a Google search and which appears to be replicated from Article 2.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 As regards the News Articles, the plaintiffs and defendants agreed that they shall be deemed to bear the same meaning as the articles in Categories A and C.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 In addition, the plaintiffs and defendants also agreed on the following:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) that the Online Articles and the News Articles shall be deemed to refer to P1 and P2; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) that the Online Articles and the News Articles shall be deemed to refer to, and be defamatory of, P4 and P5.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">The defendants in their closing submissions argue that the concession in (b) applies to only some but not every defamatory meaning pleaded by the plaintiffs. As I see it, this reservation does not assist the defendants. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Law of defamation: relevant principles</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 There are three requirements that the plaintiffs have to prove to establish the defendants’ liability for defamation: (a) the defendants must have published the material to a third party; (b) the material must refer to the plaintiffs; and (c) the material must be defamatory of the plaintiffs (Gary Chan Kok Yew, <span class="font-italic">The Law of Torts in Singapore</span> (Academy Publishing, 2nd Ed, 2016) (“<span class="font-italic">Gary Chan</span>”) at para 12.010; <span class="font-italic">Gatley</span><span class="font-italic"> on Libel and Slander </span>(Alastair Mullis &amp; Richard Parkes eds) (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 12th Ed, 2013) (“<span class="font-italic">Gatley</span>”) at para 6.1). If all the three requirements are proved to the requisite standard of proof (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the balance of probabilities), the defendants may then raise one or more defences, including the defence of justification, to defeat the plaintiffs’ <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> cause of action in defamation (<span class="font-italic">Gary Chan</span> at para 13.001). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 The main issue with the Online Articles as well as the News Articles in the present case is the publication element in the law of defamation. Generally, in order to prove that the defendant published the offending material, the plaintiff must establish that the defendant has, by any act, conveyed or communicated the material to at least one other person who has received it. As can be seen from the legal meaning here, publication for the purposes of the law of defamation is bilateral in nature. In <span class="font-italic">Golden Season Pte Ltd and others v </span><span class="font-italic">Kairos Singapore Holdings Pte Ltd and another</span> [2015] 2 SLR 751, the High Court cited (at [54]) <span class="font-italic">Dow Jones &amp; Co</span><span class="font-italic">mpany Inc v Gutnick</span> (2002) 201 CLR 575 (“<span class="font-italic">Gutnick</span>”)<span class="font-italic"> </span>(at [26]) for the proposition that publication is a bilateral act. Therefore, publication has two components: (a) an act that makes the defamatory material available to a third party in a comprehensible form (“the first component”); and (b) the receipt of the information by a third party in such a way that it is understood (“the second component”) (<span class="font-italic">Wayne </span><span class="font-italic">Crookes and West Coast Title Search Ltd. v Jon Newton </span>[2011] 3 SCR 269 at [55]). As the plaintiffs have brought the present suit in Singapore, it is also necessary for the publication to have occurred within Singapore (Doris Chia &amp; Rueben Mathiavaranam, <span class="font-italic">Evans on Defamation in Singapore and Malaysia </span>(LexisNexis, 3rd Ed, 2008) (“<span class="font-italic">Evans</span>”)<span class="font-italic"> </span>at p 59). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 To satisfy the requirements of the first component of publication in the context of Internet defamation, the plaintiff must establish, on the balance of probabilities, that the defendant as the Internet user had uploaded or posted the material on the Internet. In this sense, by uploading or posting the material on the Internet, the defendant had made the offending material available to a third party. This is the first component of publication.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 However, uploading or posting the material on the Internet alone is not publication for the purpose of the law of defamation. As observed in <span class="font-italic">Collins</span> (at para 5.04):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Where, however, an e-mail message has not been read by any person other than its author and the defamed person, <span class="font-italic">or a </span><span class="font-italic">web page, although technically accessible, has not been visited by any person other than its author and the defamed person</span>, then publication will not have occurred ...</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 This leads me to the second component of publication, which requires the plaintiff to establish, on the balance of probabilities, that a third party reader downloaded the material in Singapore. As noted in <span class="font-italic">Collins </span>(at para 5.05):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The claimant bears the burden of establishing publication. That burden can be discharged <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">directly</span>, by proving that <span class="font-italic">at least one person, other than the claimant, saw, read, or heard the communication</span>. In appropriate cases it may also be proved <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">indirectly</span>, by an inference that publication must have occurred. There is, however, <span class="font-italic">no presumption of law that matter appearing on the Internet has been published</span>. <span class="font-italic">There must be a substratum of fact to support an inference of publication</span>. It is not sufficient for the purposes of proving publication for a claimant simply to allege that defamatory matter was posted on the Internet and was accessible in the jurisdiction of the court. [emphasis added in italics and bold italics]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 In <span class="font-italic">Ng Koo Kay Benedict and another v </span><span class="font-italic">Zim Integrated Shipping Services Ltd</span> [2010] 2 SLR 860 (“<span class="font-italic">Benedict Ng</span>”), the High Court cited (at [26]) two cases – one from Australia and the other from England – on Internet publication for the purpose of defamation law. The cases are <span class="font-italic">Gutnick</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>and <span class="font-italic">Godfrey v Demon Internet Ltd</span> [2001] QB 201. As explained by Gleeson CJ, McHugh, Gummow and Hayne JJ in <span class="font-italic">Gutnick</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>(at [44]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">In defamation, the same considerations that require rejection of locating the tort by reference only to the publisher's conduct, lead to the conclusion that, ordinarily, defamation is to be located at the place where the damage to reputation occurs. Ordinarily that will be where the material which is alleged to be defamatory is available in comprehensible form assuming, of course, that the person defamed has in that place a reputation which is thereby damaged. It is only when the material is in comprehensible form that the damage to reputation is done and it is damage to reputation which is the principal focus of defamation, not any quality of the defendant's conduct. <span class="font-italic">In the case of material on the World Wide Web, it is not available in comprehensible form until downloaded on to the computer of a person who has used a web browser to pull the material from the web server. It is where that person downloads the material that the damage to reputation may be done. Ordinarily then, that will be the place where the tort of defamation is committed.</span> [emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 In <span class="font-italic">Al </span><span class="font-italic">Amoudi v Brisard and another </span>[2007] 1 WLR 113 (cited with approval in<span class="font-italic"> Benedict Ng </span>at [27]<span class="font-italic"> </span>and <span class="font-italic">Zhu Yong Zhen v AIA Singapore Pte Ltd and another</span> [2013] 2 SLR 478 at [44]), the English High Court held (at [32]–[37]) that following the general rule of publication, there was no presumption of law that there had been substantial publication and the plaintiff bore the burden of proving that the material in question had been accessed and downloaded. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 To summarise, publication on the Internet can be proved either directly or indirectly. There is no presumption of law that material appearing on the Internet has been published, and it is therefore insufficient for a plaintiff to simply allege that the defamatory material was posted on the Internet and was accessible in Singapore. The second component of the element of publication has to be satisfied. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The News Articles</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 I propose to first deal with the News Articles as this is a discrete point that can be disposed of fairly quickly. The plaintiffs’ claim as regards the News Articles does not pertain to the publication of the News Articles <span class="font-italic">per se</span><span class="font-italic">,</span> since these were published in Taiwan. Rather, the plaintiffs’ claim appears to be that it was D1 and/or D2 who had republished the News Articles by having couriered them to UOB Bank and OCBC Bank. In their closing submissions, the plaintiffs also refer to the News Articles having been sent to the Bank of China and one Xu Zhengpeng’s evidence to this effect. But this allegation is not pleaded in the Statement of Claim (Amendment No. 2) and, for this reason alone, I do not have to consider it.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 Generally, liability for defamation may arise when the defendant deliberately draws the attention of others to an existing libel (<span class="font-italic">Gatley</span> at para 6.12). Thus, to succeed in their claim, the plaintiffs have to show that the defendants are responsible for drawing the attention of UOB Bank and OCBC Bank to the News Articles. No evidence has been adduced as to how the News Articles got to OCBC Bank. There is only one courier slip before this court. The plaintiffs argue that the courier slip in question is evidence of publication to UOB Bank. They claim that: (a) the News Articles were sent to UOB Bank in Singapore on or about 23 December 2013; and (b) the courier slip was marked for the attention of one Mr Willie Cheng, a member of UOB Bank’s senior management. The plaintiffs rely on <span class="font-italic">Gatley</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>(at para 6.22)<span class="font-italic"> </span>for the proposition that evidence that a libellous letter was sent through post constitutes <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> evidence of publication to the person the letter was addressed to.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 In my view, this proposition does not assist the plaintiffs on the facts of this case. The proposition being relied upon by the plaintiffs is related to the second component of publication, namely, that a third party received and understood the defamatory information. More to the point, the plaintiffs have to prove that the defendants were the ones responsible for engaging the courier to despatch the News Articles to UOB Bank and OCBC Bank. In this regard, there is little or no direct evidence to support the element of publication of the News Articles to UOB Bank and OCBC Bank, and I so find.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 I now turn to what purports to be circumstantial evidence relied upon by the plaintiffs. In the plaintiffs’ Statement of Claim (Amendment No. 2), it stated that it was probable that the News Articles were sent by D1 and/or D2 jointly or severally, or that either or both the defendants had procured a third party to send the News Articles to UOB Bank and OCBC Bank, given:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) the fact that the content of the News Articles was similar to the Online Articles published in the name of D2;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) the proximity of dates between the sending of the News Articles with the issue of a court notice to the local authorities in the PRC, the publication of the Online Articles and an encounter with D2 on 17 December 2013; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) the use of fictitious contact details in the courier slip in relation to the News Articles sent to UOB Bank, which shows that the sender(s) had an ulterior motive in disguising their true identity.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46  The matters outlined in (a) to (c) are assertions or arguments, unless there are facts in evidence upon which an inference of publication by the defendants can be drawn. In other words, it will not suffice to merely plead the matters in (a) to (c) as they would be no more than bare assertions. There must be some evidence to support the matters in (a) to (c) and from which an inference can be drawn in relation to the element of publication by the defendants. With regard to (a), it is noteworthy that the plaintiffs’ claim concerning the News Articles is not about the defendants’ involvement in the publication of the News Articles <span class="font-italic">per se</span>. Without this “link”, the association that the plaintiffs seek to derive from the alleged similarities between the News Articles and Online Articles, in order to infer that the defendants are responsible for sending the News Articles to UOB Bank and OCBC Bank, is somewhat tenuous. As regards (b), the reference to the “court notice” in the pleadings is not clear; it does not give particulars of the court notice in question. Moreover, whether the Affidavits of Evidence-in-Chief (“AEICs”) filed by P4 and Xu Bin respectively support this averment is unclear as they do not identify the particular court notice averred to in the Statement of Claim (Amendment No. 2). References in the affidavits to various court notices add to the difficulty. Equally, the encounter with D2 on 17 December 2013 (which is elaborated on below) adds nothing to the alleged “proximity” of date argument. The date of the encounter is a neutral factor; it happened to be the date chosen by the plaintiffs’ representatives to visit D2. As for (c), I have already commented on the limited evidential value of the courier slip <span class="font-italic">vis-à-vis</span> the element of publication in the law of defamation. On a separate point, I note on the courier slip the sender’s name as “Li Li”, with the telephone number “13225969406” and the address “No. 6 Mei Ling Road Qing Dao”.

The main issue in dispute is the element of publication in the law of defamation.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Relevant principles on corporate plaintiff</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 Before proceeding further, however, a preliminary point should be dealt with. This concerns the fact that P1, P2 and P3 are corporations and not natural persons. In this regard, the defendants referred to <span class="font-italic">Jameel</span><span class="font-italic"> (Mohammed) and another v Wall Street Journal Europe Sprl</span> [2007] 1 AC 359 (“<span class="font-italic">Wall Street Journal</span>”) and <span class="font-italic">Atlantis World Group of Companies NV and another v </span><span class="font-italic">Gruppo Editoriale L’Espresso SPA</span> [2008] EWHC 1323 (QB) (“<span class="font-italic">Atlantis</span>”) for the proposition that a corporation must prove that it had a reputation in the jurisdiction at the time of publication as a prerequisite for pursuing a libel claim.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 The defendants accept that there is sufficient evidence that P2 and P3 had the requisite reputation in Singapore, but contend that P1 has failed to prove that it had any reputation in Singapore at the material time (which, in my view, clearly refers to the time of publication). On the other hand, the plaintiffs plead that P1 is the sole shareholder of Welltech Construction Pte Ltd (“Welltech”), a construction company in Singapore. As the holding company of a Singaporean subsidiary, P1 would admittedly have had some indirect connection to this jurisdiction. However, no authority has been cited by the plaintiffs to support the proposition that a connection to this jurisdiction <span class="font-italic">via</span> a wholly-owned Singaporean subsidiary is probative of the existence of a trading or business reputation in Singapore. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 It is trite that a corporate plaintiff in defamation actions cannot be injured in its feelings, and that it can only be “injured in its pocket” (<span class="font-italic">Basil Anthony Herman v Premier Security Co-operative Ltd</span><span class="font-italic"> and others </span>[2010] 3 SLR 110 at [65]; <span class="font-italic">ATU and others v ATY </span>[2015] 4 SLR 1159 at [28], both citing <span class="font-italic">Rubber Improvement Ltd. and Another v </span><span class="font-italic">Daily Telegraph Ltd.</span> [1964] AC 234 at 262). Unlike individuals, a corporate plaintiff is <span class="font-italic">not</span> presumed to have a reputation; it must prove that it has a reputation that is capable of being injured by the alleged libel. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 Thus, when it comes to damages, there is a threshold question of whether the corporate plaintiff had a trading or business reputation within the jurisdiction, at the material time of the alleged publication, to entitle it to an award of damages for libel (<span class="font-italic">Wall Street Journal</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [93]–[96]; <span class="font-italic">Atlantis </span>at [42]–[50]). This threshold question is a question of fact to be established by evidence (<span class="font-italic">Atlantis </span>at [49]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 <span class="font-italic">Gatley</span>’s comments (at para 8.16) on the right of trading corporations to sue in defamation actions are instructive:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">A trading corporation or company “has a trading character, the defamation of which may ruin it”. … Accordingly it may maintain an action of libel or slander for any words which have a tendency to damage it in the way of its business and it is not necessary for it to prove any special damage. … Although a company cannot be injured in its feelings, only in its pocket, and an injury must sound in money, the injury need not be confined to accrued loss of income, for the company’s goodwill may be injured. …</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 As pleaded, P1’s connection with Singapore is through its wholly-owned subsidiary, Welltech. As the parent company of a Singaporean subsidiary, would P1 have the requisite trading or business reputation in this jurisdiction to entitle it to an award of damages? From a survey of the case law on this issue, it would seem that this highly depends on the specific facts and circumstances in each case. However it seems that, <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span>, being a parent company of a subsidiary in the relevant jurisdiction would not, in itself, give rise to the requisite reputation to pass the threshold requirement.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 In <span class="font-italic">Atlantis</span>, the first plaintiff was a Netherlands Antilles company which brought a libel action with reference to an article published and circulated in England and Wales which was alleged to refer to it. The first plaintiff’s claim was dismissed as it had failed to show on the evidence that it had a trading or business reputation in the country at the date of publication. Sir Charles Grey held (at [49]) that it was <span class="font-italic">not fatal</span> to the first plaintiff’s claim that it did not trade and had never traded in the jurisdiction. However, it had to be shown that the first plaintiff had a trading or business reputation in the country at the date of publication. Based on the evidence led, the connection with the jurisdiction was “non-existent or at least exceedingly tenuous”. No actual or intended clients or investors or competitors were called to give such evidence.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 Similarly, a corporate plaintiff’s claim was dismissed in <span class="font-italic">Multigroup</span><span class="font-italic"> Bulgaria Holding AD v Oxford Analytica Ltd </span>[2001] EMLR 28 (“<span class="font-italic">Multigroup</span>”) on the basis that it had failed to show a pre-existing reputation within the jurisdiction. The plaintiff was a Bulgarian company which brought proceedings for libel in respect of two briefs published by the first defendant that contained various allegations of corruption on the part of the plaintiff’s subsidiaries with presence in capitals like London, Paris, New York and Zurich. The Bulgarian company was an intermediate holding company in the Multigroup conglomerate. Eady J dismissed the action on the basis that the plaintiff did not have the requisite reputation in the relevant four jurisdictions. He referred (at [28]) to Lord Keith’s holding in <span class="font-italic">Derbyshire County Council v Times Newspapers Ltd. and Others </span>[1993] AC 534 (at 547) that “a trading corporation is entitled to sue in respect of defamatory matters which can be seen as having a tendency to damage <span class="font-italic">it</span> in the way of <span class="font-italic">its</span> business” [emphasis added]. It was held in <span class="font-italic">Multigroup</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>(at [34]) that a mere holding company cannot recover in respect of allegations about how subsidiaries conduct their businesses. The highly factual nature of the inquiry was highlighted (at [37]) when it was noted that no particular evidence had been adduced to demonstrate that any one person within the four jurisdictions would have known of the plaintiff’s existence as one of the intermediate holding companies within the Multigroup conglomerate. Without further evidence of readers of the publication drawing any links between the conglomerate and the subsidiaries, any “inferential reference or damage” to the holding company because of “ostensible injury” to a subsidiary’s reputation was also rejected (at [38]). More importantly, it was noted that there was no evidence adduced to link the holding company’s activities to any of the jurisdictions in issue. Factually, the subsidiaries of the Bulgarian holding company had “distinct names and trading identities which reflect[ed] their different commercial activities” (at [40]). This was contrasted with the facts in the case of <span class="font-italic">Helen Marie Steel and David Morris v McDonald’s Corporation and McDonald’s Restaurants Ltd </span>(unreported, EWCA, Pill and May LJJ and Keene J, 31 March 1999) (“<span class="font-italic">McDonald’s</span>”).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 In <span class="font-italic">McDonald’s</span>, a case referred to by the defendants, a United States (“US”) parent company was able to prove a reputation in England where business was carried out through a local subsidiary under the McDonald’s brand. Both the American ultimate holding company, McDonald’s Corporation, and the local subsidiary, McDonald’s Restaurants Ltd, had brought libel claims in respect of a six-page leaflet referring to “McDonald’s” which was circulated in England. The English Court of Appeal held that a foreign parent company and its subsidiary may each have a distinct reputation and a distinct goodwill within a jurisdiction in which the subsidiary carries on day-to-day business. As McDonald’s was generally a well-known name, the use of and reference to “McDonald’s” in the English jurisdiction was held by the court to “import to the ordinary reader both the [US] corporation and (if they are different) whatever company runs the local restaurants”. Thus, both the US parent company and the local subsidiary were held to have related but distinct reputations in the jurisdiction.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 However, in the New South Wales Supreme Court case of <span class="font-italic">Palace Films Pty Ltd v Fairfax Media Publications Pty Ltd</span> [2012] NSWSC 1136 (“<span class="font-italic">Palace</span>”), a local shelf company, despite sharing the name of a business conducted by another company within the same corporate group, was held to be unable to bring a defamation suit to protect the business interest of the other company. Thus, <span class="font-italic">Palace</span> underscores the legal proposition that the reputations of different companies are distinct, even when the companies sharing the same trading names are within the same corporate group in the same jurisdiction. Thus, <span class="font-italic">Gatley</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>makes the point (at note 82 to para 8.16) that:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… Where several companies together form a group of companies with very similar names or where there is a holding company and several subsidiaries which share similar names, <span class="font-italic">identifying which company or companies should bring the claim is important</span> because unless the defamatory imputation reflects upon the company which brings the claim no action will lie … [emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 In a similar vein, the authors of Brian Neill <span class="font-italic">et al</span>, <span class="font-italic">Duncan and Neill on Defamation</span> (LexisNexis, 3rd Ed, 2009) express the same proposition (at para 10.02):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">A trading corporation or company may bring an action for defamation in respect of the publication of defamatory matter which affects its business or trading reputation. … A corporation, unlike an individual, is <span class="font-italic">required to establish that it has a reputation in this jurisdiction as a prerequisite</span> to pursuing a libel claim. … Where the publication relates to a business with a complex corporate structure care should be taken to bring the claim in the name of a company which (1) would be identified by reasonable readers as the subject of the allegations and (2) is apt to suffer damage to <span class="font-italic">its</span> <span class="font-italic">own</span> trading reputation as a result of the publication. [emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 Clearly, the inquiry in establishing the requisite reputation in the local jurisdiction is highly factual and has to be proven with evidence by the foreign corporate plaintiff on a balance of probabilities. From the survey of the cases above, the following non-exhaustive considerations would seem to be relevant as evidence of such requisite reputation: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) the evidence of actual or intended clients, investors or competitors (<span class="font-italic">Atlantis </span>at [49]);</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) knowledge of the existence of the foreign corporate plaintiff in the jurisdiction (<span class="font-italic">Multigroup</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [37]);</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) presence of international brand recognition in the jurisdiction (<span class="font-italic">McDonald’s</span>);</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) similarity of commercial activity and trading identity with related company in the jurisdiction (<span class="font-italic">Multigroup</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [40], <span class="font-italic">cf</span><span class="font-italic"> McDonald’s</span> and <span class="font-italic">Palace</span> at [36]–[37]); and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) the extent of management role by the foreign corporate plaintiff in the related company in the jurisdiction, as opposed to merely owning shares in them, for the alleged publication to be able to have damaged the plaintiff in the eyes of investors in the jurisdiction (<span class="font-italic">Multigroup</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [31]–[32]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 Thus, P1 has to prove in other ways that it had a pre-existing trading or business reputation in Singapore at the time of the publication. <span class="font-italic">McDonald’s</span> is distinguishable on the facts. In the present case, there is no common brand name to speak of. P1 is a construction company in Qingdao, PRC, and it has not persuaded this court that it has an international reputation. Although P1 and Welltech are in the same industry, Welltech does not use the “Qingdao Bohai” trading name and identity. P1 and Welltech, as separate legal entitles, have distinct and separate reputations. For P1 to have a reputation within the jurisdiction through Welltech, more than this tenuous connection would have to be established on a balance of probabilities. In short, P1 is unable to show that it had a trading or business reputation within the jurisdiction at the time of publication and its claim against the defendants fails on this basis.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Issue of publication: Did the defendants publish the Online Articles?</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 I now come to the main issue in dispute. The defendants deny publishing the Online Articles. On the other hand, the plaintiffs’ contention, as I understand it, is that the defendants published or caused to be published, on the Internet and to a substantial number of readers in this jurisdiction, the Online Articles. The reference to “substantial” is taken to mean a sufficient number to justify judgment for damages. It is understood that this formulation is adopted to counter the defendants’ argument that this is a suitable case for the claim to be classified as one of nominal publication, and which should be dismissed in accordance with the <span class="font-italic">Jameel</span> doctrine. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 In the case of Internet defamation, the plaintiffs bear the burden of proving that the Online Articles were uploaded or posted by the defendants (<span class="font-italic">ie</span><span class="font-italic">,</span> the first component of the element of publication) and that the Online Articles were accessed and downloaded by third party readers in Singapore (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the second component of the element of publication). It is well known that some facts are capable of direct proof, whereas others may be properly proved by inference from circumstantial evidence. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Moore’s expert report</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 Before proceeding further, I set out a summary of the key points in Moore’s report dated 24 July 2015. In this report, Moore provided his expert opinion on, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, whether it could be established that the defendants were the authors of the Online Articles and whether it could be established that the defendants were the persons who posted the Online Articles on the Internet. I note that Moore’s definition of “Online Articles” refers to more than just Articles 1 to 12. To the extent that his definition includes Articles 1 to 12, however, this difference in definition is largely inconsequential. I also note that Moore’s report had stated that Articles 1 to 12 were made up of 24 website links or URLs, when there were only 22 of these set out in the Statement of Claim (Amendment No. 2). Once again, however, as these 24 website links or URLs included the 22 which were pleaded, this is largely of little significance.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 The Online Articles were hosted on 19 domains or websites. Of these, four were blogs, 11 were forums, one was a website and three were categorised as “unknown” as they were not accessible. A user account was required to post a message on a forum or a blog.

The cogency of electronic evidence in identifying the Internet user who posted the offending material can be gleaned from the cases dealing with the kind of evidence required to establish the responsibility of the defendant.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 In <span class="font-italic">Takenaka</span><span class="font-italic"> (UK) Ltd and another v Frankl</span> (unreported, EWHC (QB), Alliott J, 11 October 2000) (“<span class="font-italic">Takenaka</span>”), the issue before the court was whether the plaintiffs had proved that the defendant was the real author and publisher of defamatory e-mails sent over the pseudonymous signature “Christina Realtor”. In finding against the defendant, Alliott J relied on the reports of an expert who had conducted a forensic examination and analysis of the laptop computer which the e-mails were traced to. This examination and analysis revealed evidence of the laptop computer’s use during the relevant period, and the expert concluded that, on the balance of probabilities, the defendant was the perpetrator. Indeed, the balance of probabilities had “been reached and exceeded by the evidence recovered from the laptop computer”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">71 In <span class="font-italic">Vaquero Energy Ltd. v Weir</span> [2006] 5 WWR 176 (“<span class="font-italic">Vaquero</span>”), defamatory messages were posted in a chat room, first by “napo9” and, subsequently, by “alec6”. The IP addresses for both napo9 and alec6 had undergone change, but the later IP address for alec6 was traced to the defendant’s laptop computer. The other IP addresses were traced to a router which hosted several companies, one of which was a company which the defendant shared office space with. Kent J found that all of the postings were done by the defendant: there was no doubt that most of the alec6 postings had come from the defendant’s computer and it was clear that those were of the same type and style of the napo9 postings (at [13]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">72 In <span class="font-italic">Applause Store Productions Ltd and another v Raphael</span> [2008] EWHC 1781 (QB) (“<span class="font-italic">Applause Store</span>”), the plaintiffs were one Mathew Firsht and his company, Applause Store Productions Ltd. On 19 June 2007, a Facebook profile was created in the name of Mathew Firsht. On the next day, a Facebook group called “Has Mathew Firsht lied to you?” was set up. The bulk of the defamatory material was contained in the group. Neither the profile nor the group was set up by Mathew Firsht. Both were set up using a computer with the defendant’s IP address. Only two computers could have used this IP address: the defendant’s desktop computer, and his girlfriend’s laptop computer, which he had often used. The issue before the court was whether the defendant was responsible for putting up the false profile and for creating the group. In finding that the defendant was responsible for the creation of the Facebook material, the court relied on, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, an activity log for the defendant’s IP address, which appeared to show a sequence of activity using the Facebook user identities of the defendant, his girlfriend and “M Firsht”. The defendant’s claim that the deed was done by one or more of the strangers who were at his flat at the relevant time was rejected.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">73 Finally, in <span class="font-italic">Warman</span><span class="font-italic"> v Grosvenor </span>(2008) 92 OR (3d) 663 (“<span class="font-italic">Warman</span>”), the plaintiff sought to stop the defendant’s two-year “campaign of terror” against him, achieved through postings on the Internet and personal e-mails. As the defendant had failed to file a Defence, he was noted in default under the relevant civil procedure rules, and this meant that he was deemed to have admitted the truth of all allegations of fact made in the Statement of Claim. Notwithstanding this, Ratushny J had some “initial concerns as to the reliability of the plaintiff’s identification of the defendant as the author of the postings and the e-mails” (at [12]). Nonetheless, he was satisfied on the evidence that the plaintiff had proved the defendant to be the author of the postings and the e-mails (at [13]), noting (at [14]) as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The following evidence is particularly persuasive. In 1996 by way of an Internet posting, a person who identified himself as William Grosvenor called on “mature ladies” to contact him at a certain address in Edmonton. This was the same address used to serve the Statement of Claim on the defendant with the same name. The defendant of the same name responded, giving this same address in his Notice of Intent to Defend. The e-mails began on January 16, 2008, which was the day after the Statement of Claim had been served on the defendant. The first of the e-mails repeated, in the same words, the invitation to others to harm the plaintiff and the links to the plaintiff's former home address combined with an aerial photograph, as had been contained in some of the previous postings. The further e-mails have continued some of the same patterns exhibited by the postings in terms of their style, content and obsessions.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">74 As can be observed, in three of the above cases, the defendant’s identity was established through the use of electronic evidence: <span class="font-italic">Takenaka</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>(forensic examination and analysis); <span class="font-italic">Vaquero</span> (IP addresses); and <span class="font-italic">Applause Store</span> (activity log for defendant’s IP address). That said, this does not mean that electronic evidence is the <span class="font-italic">only</span> means by which the responsibility of a defendant for material appearing on the Internet can be established. Indeed, electronic evidence was not relied on in <span class="font-italic">Warman</span>. However, as Alliott J cautioned in <span class="font-italic">Takenaka</span><span class="font-italic">,</span> cogent evidence is needed to meet the requisite standard of proof in order to discharge the burden of proof. Typically, the use of electronic evidence to link a defendant to any particular material appearing on the Internet would be the most obvious way to achieve this requirement of cogency, since such evidence is objective in nature. If a plaintiff chooses to rely on <span class="font-italic">other</span> evidence, then he must ensure that such evidence is similarly cogent.

The material posted on the Internet was never expressly nor clearly identified and the important differences among: (a) the plaintiffs’ translated transcript (above); (b) the defendants’ translated video transcript; and (c) the defendants’ audio transcript indicate that the court cannot be certain about what was being referred to. D2 had believed that he was being asked about the CCDI report, and not the Online Articles. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">79 I make two broad points in general. First, the inquiry into what transpired begins with an appreciation of the setting in which the conversation between D2 and the plaintiffs’ representatives took place. It was an unannounced visit to the coffee shop where D2 worked as a coffee shop attendant; it was not a meeting conducted in the context of an attempt to openly discuss or resolve a defamation dispute which both sides were fully aware of. No defamation dispute had arisen or been declared prior to 17 December 2013. It was only after the encounter on 17 December 2013 that the pre-litigation demand letters and Writ of Summons were issued. All in all, the context in which the conversation was recorded and all other surrounding circumstances would have an important bearing on the reliability of what has been characterised as D2’s admission that the Online Articles were posted on the Internet by D1 and D2. One consideration here appears to be whether or not the admission was ambiguous (Jeffrey Pinsler, <span class="font-italic">Evidence and the Litigation Process</span> (LexisNexis, 5th Ed, 2015) (“<span class="font-italic">Pinsler</span>”) at para 5.097). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">80 Second, the inquiry is whether the alleged admission is admissible in evidence under the Evidence Act (Cap 97, 1997 Rev Ed) (“EA”). Admissions are statements (oral or documentary) which suggest any inference about any fact in issue or relevant fact, and which are made by persons under certain circumstances (s 17(1) of the EA). These circumstances are mentioned in ss 18 to 20 of the EA. An admission may be proved as against the person who made them or his representative in interest (s 21 of the EA). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">81 For convenience, I now set out the relevant portions of ss 17, 18 and 21 of the EA:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Admission and confession defined</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">17.—(1)  An admission is a statement, oral or documentary, which suggests any inference as to any fact in issue or relevant fact, and which is made by any of the persons and under the circumstances hereinafter mentioned.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Admission by party to proceeding or his agent, by suitor in representative character, etc.</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">18.</span>—(1)  Statements made by a party to the proceeding or by an agent to any such party whom the court regards under the circumstances of the case as expressly or impliedly authorised by him to make them are admissions.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Proof of admissions against persons making them and by or on their behalf</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">21.</span>  Admissions are relevant and may be proved as against the person who makes them or his representative in interest …</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">82 Admissions are not conclusive proof although estoppels may be raised (s 31 of EA). <span class="font-italic">Pinsler</span> (at para 5.100) notes on s 31 that:</div><div class="txt-body text-justify">… The point here is that the party in a civil case or the accused in a criminal case is free to dispute the validity of the matters stated. The party in a civil case might allege that he was mistaken or that the facts are untrue. The accused might deny the truth of some of the details which he stated. <span class="font-italic">The weight of an admission is a matter for the determination of the court and is dependent on all the circumstances of the case.</span> … [emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">83 <span class="font-italic">Pinsler </span>(at paras 5.097 and 5.098) provides a simple and helpful illustration as to how these provisions work in conjunction with one another. The passage is long, but I set it out in full as it is instructive to the case at hand:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The connection between ss 17, 18 and 21 in civil proceedings may [<span class="font-italic">sic</span>] illustrated by the following example. <span class="font-italic">D</span> is sued for breach of contract for allegedly failing to deliver goods to <span class="font-italic">P</span> in the time stipulated in the contract. <span class="font-italic">D</span> apologised to <span class="font-italic">P</span> for being late. <span class="font-italic">D</span>’s employee tells <span class="font-italic">P</span> that delivery was late because transport could not be arranged. <span class="font-italic">D</span>’s apology may be regarded as a statement which suggests an inference as to a fact in issue, namely that he was in breach of contract for being late. Accordingly, the statement is an admission by virtue of s 17(1) and can be proved under s 21 against <span class="font-italic">D</span> because he is a party to the proceeding, a condition laid down by s 18(1). The admission is not conclusive of the facts admitted to, but in the absence of ambiguity it is likely to be given significant weight. Where ambiguity does arise, the court will determine the appropriate weight, if any, to be attributed to the evidence. …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">As to <span class="font-italic">D</span>’s employee’s statement (in the above example), the issue is whether it can be used against <span class="font-italic">D</span> at the trial. The court will have to determine whether the employee was ‘expressly or impliedly’ authorised by <span class="font-italic">D</span> to make this statement as required by s 18(1). If <span class="font-italic">D</span> told his employee to inform <span class="font-italic">P</span> of the reason for late delivery, this would be express authorisation and the statement could be proved against <span class="font-italic">D</span>. The situation is less clear with regard to implied authorisation and has given rise to a number of cases. Much depends on the position of the employee in <span class="font-italic">D</span>’s business concern and his relationship to <span class="font-italic">D</span>. … In <span class="font-italic">Edward v Brookes (Milk)</span>, it was held that the apparent authority of the maker of the statement may be a sufficient basis for the admission of the statement against the party. The effect of this would be that if someone holds himself out as having authority on behalf of a company or employer and the circumstances are not inconsistent with this representation, then any statements which he makes may bind the company or employer. In <span class="font-italic">D</span>’s case, his employee’s statement is unambiguous and, if admitted, may carry significant weight.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">84 It is clear from <span class="font-italic">Pinsler</span>’s illustration that adverse admissions are relevant facts and are hence admissible in evidence against the maker of the statements (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, D2) and no one else (such as D1). Pursuant to s 18(1) of the EA, D2’s statements can only be used against D1 if D2 was authorised by D1 to make those statements. In this case, there was neither suggestion nor evidence of this. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">85 I now come to the statements made by D2 that are offered as D2’s admission that D1 and D2 are responsible for posting the Online Articles. The defendants have characterised D2’s responses as a “misunderstanding” in that D2 was thinking that the plaintiffs’ representatives were asking about the CCDI report, and not the Online Articles. Irrespective of the terminology in the transcript, it is fairly clear from reading the excerpt of the transcript set out at [77] above that D2’s statements, which must be taken in their entirety, are ambiguous. This affects the reliability of the statements offered as admissions. Let me elaborate. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">86 D2 was at work in the coffee shop when the plaintiffs’ representatives came. I gather from Mr Lee that in “large parts” of the video recording, D2 was seen walking away from the plaintiffs’ representatives to attend to “other things”, and that there was no conversation during these moments.

Admissions must be clear if they are to be used against the person making them (Sudipto Sarkar &amp; V R Manohar, <span class="font-italic">S</span><span class="font-italic">arkar’s Law of Evidence in India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Burma &amp; Ceylon</span> (Wadhwa and Company Nagpur, 16th Ed, 2007) (“<span class="font-italic">Sarkar</span>”)<span class="font-italic"> </span>at p 422). In order to constitute an admission in law, the statement should be <span class="font-italic">ex facie</span> unequivocal and categorical and not vague (<span class="font-italic">Sarkar</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at p 425). Yet, these cannot be said of D2’s alleged admission. I now turn to examine this issue of ambiguity. In my judgment, D2’s alleged admission is ambiguous and is hence unreliable. Accordingly, no weight should be accorded to it.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">88 First, D2’s so-called admission is not clear as to D2’s role in the posting of the “article”.

However, this clarification in the witness box of <span class="font-weight-bold">Statement 1</span> does not improve the plaintiffs’ position.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">90 Besides <span class="font-weight-bold">Statement 1</span>, the court has to take note of what D2 had subsequently said in <span class="font-weight-bold">Statement 2</span> and <span class="font-weight-bold">Statement 3</span>. In <span class="font-weight-bold">Statement 2</span>, D2 said that it was D1 who “did most of the things” and that he himself “[had] no idea what it is about”. He said that he had consented to the “article” being posted in his name. I note that this part of <span class="font-weight-bold">Statement 2</span> is somewhat ambiguous: it is not clear if D2 was saying that his consent was to the article <span class="font-italic">being posted</span> or if he was saying that his consent was to the article being posted <span class="font-italic">in his name</span>. The difference here is one of emphasis and appears fine, but it is nonetheless significant as to its meaning. The later part of <span class="font-weight-bold">Statement 2</span> clarifies, however, that D2 had meant the latter (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, that he had consented to the article being posted<span class="font-italic"> in his name</span>). In <span class="font-weight-bold">Statement 3</span>, D2 then said that he had read the “article” and roughly knew its contents, but it was D1 who was “personally involved”. In <span class="font-weight-bold">Statement 2</span> and <span class="font-weight-bold">Statement 3</span>, D2’s responsibility <span class="font-italic">apropos</span> the “article” is much reduced. Indeed, all he could be said to be responsible for was consenting to the “article” being posted in his name.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">91 Simply put, D2’s so-called admission, when read as a whole, is neither clear nor categorical. It is equivocal as to what his role in the posting of the “article” was. Specifically, D2 had at one point (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, in <span class="font-weight-bold">Statement 1</span>) stated that he <span class="font-italic">had posted </span>the “article” (along with D1), but at other points (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, in <span class="font-weight-bold">Statement 2</span> and <span class="font-weight-bold">Statement 3</span>) stated that he had simply <span class="font-italic">consented</span> to the “article” being posted in his name and that it was D1 who presumably did everything else. From this analysis, there is merit in D2’s evidence that in his conversation with the plaintiffs’ representatives, he was thinking about the CCDI report and not the Online Articles. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">92 This leads me to the subject-matter of D2’s so-called admission. In this regard, I agree with the defendants that the subject-matter of the alleged admission was never expressly nor clearly identified. Even by the plaintiffs’ version of the English translated transcript, which I have excerpted above at [77], the “article” is never identified. This raises several matters that do not come with answers. For instance, was the “article” defamatory<span class="font-italic"> </span>to begin with? If it was defamatory, was it one of the Online Articles? If it was one of the Online Articles, which one was it? With these questions remaining unanswered, how can the requisite civil standard of proof, <span class="font-italic">vis-à-vis</span> the element of publication in the law of defamation, be satisfied? </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">93 To the defendants, the reference to the “article” in the transcripts is not even clear. The defendants have set out the differences in the three versions of the English translated transcripts in a table, and I reproduce the most significant portions below (with emphasis added):</div><table class="table table-sm table-bordered"><tbody><tr><td><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-center"><span class="font-weight-bold">Plaintiffs’ translated transcript</span>

</div> Whilst the plaintiffs acknowledge that this attribution is not conclusive proof that the defendants published the Online Articles, I do not accept that the “sign-offs” in D2’s name provide a reasonable basis to draw an inference that the defendants are responsible for posting the Online Articles (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the first component of the element of publication). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">101 As explained, there is no electronic evidence to trace the posting of the Online Articles on the Internet to the defendants, and if the defendants were out to harm the plaintiffs’ reputation, it would surely be incongruous and illogical for the defendants to leave a trail by mentioning D2’s name and particulars on the Online Articles. The plaintiffs suggest that there is nothing puzzling with the “sign-off” method as it would help to lend some credibility to the Online Articles if they were not anonymous and an identified person was willing to be named as their author and publisher. This reasoning is untenable: why should credibility be a concern to the author and publisher if, as the plaintiffs say, the articles are defamatory? The first component of publication is not about who is named in the Online Articles; it has to do with finding and identifying the person who posted the Online Articles for the purpose of the law of defamation. As I see it, no proper inference can be drawn from the “sign-offs” appearing on some of the Online Articles.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(3) Motive to publish</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">102 I now come to the plaintiffs’ contention that the defendants, in particular D1, had a motive to publish the Online Articles. To support this contention, the plaintiffs highlighted a number of points which can be summarised as follows:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) <span class="font-underline">Disputes between the Qingjian Group and the HuanYu Group</span>: The plaintiffs submit that the HuanYu Group was embroiled in a number of legal disputes with the Qingjian Group in the PRC. The HuanYu Group had apparently owed the Qingjian Group a debt of about RMB 560 million.

D1 was apparently a director of HuanYu from 1994 to 2004, and has been a director of HuanYu Marina from 1998. Further reliance was placed on: (i) two legal agreements which D1 had purportedly signed on behalf of HuanYu in 2004 and 2012; and (ii) D1’s purported commencement of court proceedings in 2005 to reinstate himself as chairman of HuanYu.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) <span class="font-underline">D1’s relationship with Goh</span>: The plaintiffs submit that Goh is the one controlling the business of the HuanYu Group. D1 and Goh “are not just related by blood as uncle and nephew, but have also had longstanding business dealings with each other from about 1994 to 2001”. Although there was some disagreement between D1 and Goh in the 2000s, the parties had since reconciled.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) <span class="font-underline">D1’s relationship with one Cai Youcang (“Cai”)</span>: The plaintiffs submit that D1 had a long-standing relationship with Cai, a director of HuanYu.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) <span class="font-underline">The defendants’ interests in Shin Hwa Cheong</span>: The plaintiffs submit that both defendants have had associations with a company known as Shin Hwa Cheong, which is related to the HuanYu Group.

Where the defendants are said to have revenge in mind, and this revenge is to be proved by inferences, the plaintiffs have to satisfy the civil standard of proof by showing that the inferences which appear from the circumstances outlined in [102(a)] to [102(f)] make revenge in the defendants’ minds at least more probable than not. I find that the “balance of probabilities” test is not satisfied.

</div> Although Mr Quek in closing submissions described D1’s relationship with Goh now as cordial, the former seems to be on better terms with Goh’s wife. In my judgment, D1’s relationship with Goh is not evidence to support the presence of motive to publish the Online Articles.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">109 As for D2, no real submission has been advanced <span class="font-italic">vis-à-vis</span> any motive on his part, except for his supposed interest in Shin Hwa Cheong. Indeed, D2 is a coffee shop attendant and he was unlikely to have either active involvement in the HuanYu Group or interest (whether pecuniary or proprietary) in the outcome of the dispute with the Qingjian Group. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">110 Evidence which shows that the defendants have a revengeful propensity is relevant. However, the fact of the matter is that these disputes, relationships and interests, <span class="font-italic">even if all true</span>, are simply insufficient to reasonably infer that the defendants felt aggrieved and vengeful against the plaintiffs such that they wanted to inflict harm on them. As stated, the plaintiffs’ turn of phrase in their closing submissions is a motive to “inflict revenge against the Qingjian Group and the [plaintiffs]”. There has to be evidence that singles out D1 (or D2) as the perpetrator. Having earlier rejected the evidentiary value of D2’s so-called admission, I find that there is nothing else which can identify D1 (or D2) for this purpose. In this regard, I have already concluded that there is no imputation to be made from the mere mention of D2’s name on some of the Online Articles (see [98]–[101] above). </div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(4) Other grounds relied on by the plaintiffs</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">111 The plaintiffs would be aware that they have to meet the requisite civil standard of proof, and have asked the court to take into consideration other series of facts, namely, the allegedly incredible account as to how D2’s name came to be used to file the CCDI report and the defendants’ reliance on the defence of justification. These facts, so the argument develops, give rise to an inference that the defendants must be the persons responsible for the publication of the Online Articles.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">112 The plaintiffs reject the defendants’ explanation as to how the defendants had come to lodge the CCDI report. The plaintiffs’ first point is that there is no evidence that D1 had been told of any serious or specific wrongdoing on the part of P4, and that there was no premise for his assumption that P4 had earned a modest salary. In this regard, D1’s account is that the impetus for him lodging the CCDI report was a dinner meeting with Cai, his former business associate. D1 describes what Cai had told him in his AEIC as follows:

It was only then that I was told [the HuanYu Group] projects had turned sour after I left [the HuanYu Group]. These projects had purportedly incurred very substantial losses such that [the HuanYu Group] was asked to contribute financially to these losses, instead receiving a share in the expected profits. Cai said that they could not believe this could happen because under the joint venture, [the HuanYu Group] contributed the substantial lands, and [P4], representing the PRC party, was in charge of the development and sale of the completed projects, which appeared to have been very successful.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Cai then asked if I knew that [P4] and [P2] were also seeking to expand aggressively into the Singapore market.

</div> and it is clear from this that he had thought that P4 was engaged in illegal conduct. As for D1’s assumption that P4 had earned a modest salary, I do not consider this to be so implausible and unreasonable an assumption that it should be disbelieved outright.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">114 The plaintiffs’ second point is that D1’s evidence on the contents of the CCDI report is unsatisfactory. There was no purpose in filing the CCDI report if the contents were as generalised as D1 testified to be so. Notably, however, the CCDI report was lodged close to two years ago, in late 2013, and it is not implausible that D1 is not able to now recollect the details. More importantly, the plaintiffs’ own evidence is that the CCDI had commenced investigations into the allegations made in the Online Articles.

</div> This, in my view, verifies and lends credence to the existence and submission of the CCDI report with enough information to warrant an investigation.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">115 The plaintiffs next highlight that if, as he claims, D1 was motivated to lodge the CCDI report out of his sense of patriotism to Singapore and his concern for the protection of the construction industry and the promotion of the public interest in Singapore, he should have then filed a report with the Singapore authorities rather than the CCDI. At trial, D1 explained his decision as follows:

The place of the illegal activities was in China, so of course the local government or the government where the activities had taken place would have the most authority or resources to investigate into the matter. That is my reason for doing so.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">I agree that there is a logical basis for D1’s explanation: if the alleged misappropriation had taken place in the PRC, then the CCDI would be the proper authority that should have been alerted.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">116 The plaintiffs then question the defendants’ reasons for using D2’s name for the CCDI report. They point out that D1 stated in his AEIC that this was because he was concerned not so much about himself but for his wife and extended family in the PRC. However, in the Defence (Amendment No. 1), it is stated that this was because D1 travelled frequently to the PRC and was concerned for his personal safety. I do not, however, consider this discrepancy to be material. The fact is that D1 was concerned over the possible ramifications of the CCDI report, to himself, his wife and her family, and he stated this in no uncertain terms at trial.

</div>
</div> In my view, this is not an incredulous excuse.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">117 Finally, the plaintiffs also raise the argument that the defendants had refused to ask Moore to retrieve a copy of the CCDI report, which is a piece of evidence which could potentially be very favourable to the defendants’ case. In a letter to the court dated 9 March 2016, which was after closing submissions were filed, the defendants’ lawyers wrote to court, highlighting that this request that Moore retrieve a copy of the CCDI report was first made by the plaintiffs’ lawyers in a letter to the defendants’ lawyers dated 26 August 2015, and that the defendants’ lawyers had replied on 2 September 2015. In their reply, the defendants’ lawyers had stated that the defendants were prepared to accede to the plaintiffs’ request on two conditions, one of which related to the payment of Moore’s charges. No reply was forthcoming from the plaintiffs until the middle of the trial on 30 September 2015, when the plaintiffs wrote back to say that they were not agreeable to the conditions. In brief, it is somewhat of a mischaracterisation to say that the defendants had “refused” to ask Moore to retrieve a copy of the CCDI report. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">118 The final ground which the plaintiffs rely on is the defendants’ reliance on the defence of justification. The plaintiffs argue that there is no plausible reason why the defendants would incur time, effort and expense to investigate and prove the truth of defamatory statements that they did not publish. On the other hand, D1 explains the defendants’ reliance on the defence of justification in his AEIC as follows:
                   <sup><button class="btn btn-link superscript-btn" data-target="#fn-84f83beb-8484-469a-8949-9737e057df03" data-toggle="modal" type="button">33</button></sup>

</div></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… I … consulted our first set of lawyers on how we could exonerate ourselves. At that point, I was advised that if we could find evidence showing that the meanings of the statements in the Articles were true in substance and in fact, we would then also be able to plead the defence of justification. This would be an alternative backup defence to our primary defence that we did not publish the Articles as alleged or at all. Upon learning this, I sought legal assistance in the PRC to carry out investigations into the conduct of the [plaintiffs] and the background to the Articles, since these were matters that occurred in the PRC.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">119 I make a few points. First, the plaintiffs’ argument conflates publication, which is an element of liability, with defences to libel, which arise only after a <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> case of liability is established. Second, the defence of justification is about the truth of the libel and telling the truth has nothing to do with good motive or good faith. In any event, the defendants’ reliance on the defence of justification is a result of the suggestion of their former lawyers.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">120 As a final point, I note that the plaintiffs also appear to suggest that the defendants’ position on the defamatory nature of the Online Articles is inconsistent with their case that they are not responsible for the publication of the Online Articles. This point, however, is not seriously pursued, and rightly so.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(5) Conclusion on the first component of publication</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">121 All things analysed and evaluated, I find that the defendants are not responsible for the first component of the element of publication. If anything, the grounds relied on by the plaintiffs, taken collectively, could raise some <span class="font-italic">suspicion</span> that the defendants could have been the ones responsible for the publication of the Online Articles. Notably, however, the civil standard of proof is not satisfied by evidence giving rise to a mere <span class="font-italic">suspicion</span>. With this conclusion, the plaintiffs’ claim in defamation against the defendants fails.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The second component of publication</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">122 Although my conclusion concerning the first component of publication is sufficient to dispose of the plaintiffs’ claim in defamation, I will nevertheless proceed to consider, for completeness, the second component of publication. As stated earlier, the plaintiffs cannot simply allege that the Online Articles were posted on the Internet and were accessible in Singapore. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">123 First, for there to be publication in traditional defamation law, the defamatory material must be communicated to a third party reader in a manner that it is comprehensible. In other words, the third party to whom the defamatory material is communicated must be capable of understanding it. As <span class="font-italic">Gatley</span> puts it (at para 6.1):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… It is not sufficient that the matter has been merely communicated to the third party: it is also necessary that it be communicated in such a manner that it may convey the defamatory meaning and that persons acquainted with the claimant could understand it to refer to him. If, therefore, a defamatory letter was handed to a person who could not read or who could not read the language in which it was written, there would be no publication … </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">124  In <span class="font-italic">Gutnik</span>, the High Court of Australia held (at [26]) that harm to reputation is done when a defamatory publication is comprehended by the reader; until then, no harm is done by it. In most cases, defamatory material is received by a third party using his eyes to read or view it. If the third party cannot understand it (for example, where the defamatory material is written in a foreign language), then that is a separate concern, one that would, on its own, bar a finding of publication. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">125 Second, and as stated earlier, there is no presumption of law that material appearing on the Internet has been published and, as such, the plaintiffs have to prove that the material in question had been accessed and downloaded by a third party reader (see the cases referred to at [40] above).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">126 Third, the tort of defamation is committed where publication takes place and the parties accept that material on the Internet is published at the place where it is downloaded. The parties have also proceeded on the basis that Singapore is the appropriate and convenient forum, and that the governing law of the tort is Singapore law. The location where the material was downloaded and read in this case were the same, and this is to be distinguished from a case where the material on the Internet was downloaded in one jurisdiction and then read later as a computer printout at another time and in another jurisdiction (see, generally, Dan Svantesson, “The ‘place of action’ defence – A model for cross-border Internet defamation” [2003] Australian International Law Journal 172).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">127 Moving on, I will first deal with direct proof of the second component of publication, and then indirect proof. As stated, the standard of proof is still the balance of probabilities. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(1) Direct proof of the second component of publication </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">128 The question in the present case is whether at least one person, other than the plaintiffs, had downloaded and accessed the Online Articles in Singapore. In this regard, the plaintiffs rely on the evidence given by five of their witnesses. However, not all of the five witnesses were able to testify to downloading the Online Articles. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">129 First, the plaintiffs rely on the evidence of one Li Guo Dong (“Li”), the Manager of the Human Resource department of P3.

Yet, Li could only say that he had come across articles with contents that were very similar to Articles 1, 2 and 4. Consequently, the inexorable conclusion is that even if I were to accept Li’s evidence in its entirety, the plaintiffs have not shown, on a balance of probabilities, that Li had indeed downloaded the Online Articles (or any of them) in Singapore.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">131 The second witness whose evidence is being relied on for direct proof of publication is one Ouyang Jing (“Ouyang”), the Head of Business Development of P3. Ouyang had joined P3 in 2011. His evidence is that he had first read the defamatory articles published online concerning the plaintiffs in or around November or December 2013. At that time, the Qingjian Group was considering a joint project with Surbana International Consultants Pte Ltd (“Surbana”), and a meeting was held in November 2013 between P4 and the Surbana management, which Ouyang attended. Ouyang had taken the initiative to conduct some due diligence on the meeting’s attendees following the meeting.

I will return to the <span class="font-italic">Jameel</span> doctrine below at [144]−[149].</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(2) Indirect proof of the second component of publication</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">136 The plaintiffs argue that publication of the Online Articles in Singapore can be inferred on account of: (a) their accessibility on the Internet; and (b) the results of using search terms on search engines. Again, the starting point in relation to the accessibility of the Online Articles on the Internet is that there is no presumption of law that material appearing on the Internet has been published, and it is therefore insufficient for a plaintiff to simply allege that the defamatory material was posted on the Internet and was accessible in Singapore by a substantial number of third party readers. There must be some facts in evidence to support an inference of publication in Singapore to a substantial number of third party readers.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">137 First, there is no evidence that the Online Articles were found on websites which were frequented by Singapore-based Internet users. Xu Bin’s evidence is that in or around December 2013, Article 2 had been read by 627 viewers, Article 8 by 363 viewers, Article 9 by 894 viewers and Article 11 by 256 viewers.

</div> These figures, however, do not indicate the number of viewers or readers from Singapore. But what is clear, in my view, is that these figures are insignificant in the grand scheme of the things that is the Internet, which would, presumably, have millions, if not billions, of users worldwide. Flowing from this, I agree with the defendants that the low number of viewers or readers renders it unlikely that any significant number of visits were from Singapore-based Internet users. This is all the more so when one considers the fact that none of the domains hosting the Online Articles were located in Singapore,

</div> suggesting that the websites were not even intended for a Singapore-based audience. In <span class="font-italic">Benedict Ng</span>, Lai Siu Chiu J noted (at [31]) that there was no evidence as to the number of Singapore-based subscribers for one of the websites in question (which was <span class="font-italic">designed for Singapore and Malaysia subscribers</span>) and its general viewership. On that basis, Lai J did not think it would be safe to draw an inference of publication in Singapore, as it would be “tantamount to recognising a rebuttable presumption of publication”. Given that the websites where the Online Articles were found were unlikely to have been designed for Singapore-based Internet users, Lai J’s reasoning applies <span class="font-italic">a fortiori</span> in the present case.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">138 As regards the other ground relied on by the plaintiffs, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the results of using search terms on search engines, two cases are relied upon by the plaintiffs. In <span class="font-italic">Steinberg v </span><span class="font-italic">Englefield and another </span>[2005] EWCA Civ 288 (“<span class="font-italic">Steinberg</span>”), Sedley LJ, with whom Longmore and Ward LJJ agreed, found (at [21]) the inference of substantial publication of a defamatory letter to be irresistible, given that it was accessible to anyone who fed the plaintiff’s name into a standard search engine and was also readable by anyone who accessed the defendant’s own professional website. In <span class="font-italic">Gregg v O’Gara</span> [2008] EWHC 658 (QB) (“<span class="font-italic">Gregg</span>”), King J, in an application for summary judgment, considered (at [52]) that any jury would draw the irresistible inference that the two defamatory articles in question, which had been posted online, had been widely published within the jurisdiction. King J relied on the fact that the defendant’s website containing the defamatory material was immediately accessible to anyone who fed the words “Yorkshire Ripper” into a standard search engine. He also highlighted that the Yorkshire Ripper was a topic of continuing interest to members of the public and that the plaintiff himself had been contacted by various people who had become aware of the defamatory allegations. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">139 In my view, however, these cases do not assist the plaintiffs. As pleaded by the plaintiffs, the Online Articles were all located by entering a <span class="font-italic">combination</span> of search terms into search engines. This is with the possible exception of Article 1, for which it is not clear how the plaintiffs had located it. In this regard, Li’s evidence is that he had “found no relevant information” (much less the Online Articles) when he used the search term “Du Bo” on its own.

</div> Similarly, Ouyang agreed that if he simply used the search term “Du Bo” on its own, he probably would not find anything about P4 because there are many people called “Du Bo” in China, and this was why he did not use the search term “Du Bo” on its own.

</div> The present case is therefore immediately distinguishable from <span class="font-italic">Steinberg</span>. There is no evidence that feeding any of the plaintiffs’ names, <span class="font-italic">individually</span>, into a standard search engine would reveal the Online Articles. At least in so far as P4 is concerned, the evidence is in fact to the contrary.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">140 But what then is the rule concerning the use of a combination of search terms? In <span class="font-italic">Benedict Ng</span>, there was evidence that the defamatory material could be found on the Internet by using both the plaintiffs’ name as one search term, and that conducting a search using the search term “dafni, benedict ng, rajathurai suppiah” would reveal the defamatory material on two major search engines. Lai J thought (at [31]) that in the case before her “it would be <span class="font-italic">highly unusual for any person to conduct a search by combining two or three names in the search field</span>” [emphasis added], and accordingly did not believe that such a fact warranted the inference that substantial publication had taken place in Singapore.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">141 In a similar fashion, <span class="font-italic">Gregg </span>is distinguishable from the present case. As was alluded to by Lai J in <span class="font-italic">Benedict Ng</span> (at [31]), that case concerned a search of the <span class="font-italic">subject-matter </span>of the defamatory material rather than the name of the plaintiff. Like in <span class="font-italic">Benedict Ng</span>, there is no evidence of such a search term having been used here.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">142 For the reasons stated, the second component of publication is satisfied in respect of Articles 1, 2 and 4 by virtue of the evidence of Xu Zhengpeng, a third party reader in Singapore. Be that as it may, the first component of publication is not satisfied. Consequently, the plaintiffs have not proved, on the balance of probabilities, that the defendants are responsible for the publication of the Online Articles in Singapore. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">143 My finding on a sole third party reader in Singapore leads me on to the <span class="font-italic">Jameel</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>doctrine. Before going there, however, I propose to briefly address the observation in <span class="font-italic">Collins</span> (at para 5.06) that “[w]here a claimant proves that matter appearing on the Internet has been published to one or more persons, it may be inferred that the matter was published more widely”. In my view, this observation does not assist the plaintiffs for the simple reason that the drawing of an inference in such a case must still be dependent on the existence of a substratum of fact(s) to support the drawing of such an inference. For the reasons stated at [137]–[141] above, no such inference can be drawn in the present case. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">(3) Abuse of process</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">144 I now come to the <span class="font-italic">Jameel</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>doctrine. In this regard, the defendants argue that there has been no real and substantial tort in so far as the Online Articles are concerned, and that for this reason the claim should be struck out as an abuse of process under the <span class="font-italic">Jameel</span> doctrine. Given my finding above, it is perhaps apposite to consider this argument in greater detail. In this connection, the plaintiffs have failed to show any real or substantial tort committed in this jurisdiction. Accordingly, the <span class="font-italic">Jameel</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>doctrine is another basis on which the plaintiffs’ claim in defamation may be dismissed. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">145 In the context of defamation, the abuse of process doctrine stemmed from the decision of the English Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Jameel</span>. That case proceeded on the basis that there were only publications to no more than five individuals, three of whom were part of the plaintiff’s camp, within the jurisdiction. The Court of Appeal struck out the plaintiff’s claim on the basis that there was no real and substantial tort, observing as follows (at [69]–[70]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">If the claimant succeeds in this action and is awarded a small amount of damages, it can perhaps be said that he will have achieved vindication for the damage done to his reputation in this country, <span class="font-italic">but both the damage and the vindication will be minimal. </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The cost of the exercise will have been out of all proportion to what has been achieved.</span> The game will not merely not have been worth the candle, it will not have been worth the wick.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">If we were considering an application to set aside permission to serve these proceedings out of the jurisdiction we would allow that application on the basis that the five publications that had taken place in this jurisdiction <span class="font-italic">did not, individually or collectively, amount to a real and substantial tort</span>. Jurisdiction is no longer in issue, but, subject to the effect of the claim for an injunction that we have yet to consider, we consider <span class="font-italic">for precisely the same reason</span> that it would not be right to permit this action to proceed. <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">It would be an abuse of process to continue to commit the resources of the English court, including substantial judge and possibly jury time, to an action where so little is now seen to be at stake</span><span class="font-italic">.</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>… </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added in italics and bold italics]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">146 In Singapore, <span class="font-italic">Jameel</span> was considered by the Court of Appeal, albeit in <span class="font-italic">obiter</span>, in <span class="font-italic">Yan Jun v Attorney-General</span> [2015] 1 SLR 752. The Court of Appeal cautioned (at [118]) that:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">It is also pertinent to note that since <span class="font-italic">Jameel</span> was decided under a set of procedural rules which are fundamentally different from those in Singapore … and because it entails – in part, at least – the (potentially far reaching) proposition that an action may be struck out on the basis that the <span class="font-italic">publication</span> of the defamatory material is <span class="font-italic">limited</span>, or the <span class="font-italic">amount</span> claimed as damages is <span class="font-italic">de </span><span class="font-italic">minimis</span>, the principle enunciated in that case should be approached with the <span class="font-italic">necessary circumspection</span> by the Singapore courts. … [emphasis in original]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">147 However, the Court of Appeal eventually acknowledged (at [120]) the applicability of the general principles of <span class="font-italic">Jameel</span> in Singapore, and proceeded to apply it to the facts of the case: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… In light of our decision above at [111]–[114], it is, <span class="font-italic">strictly speaking</span>, not necessary for us to decide whether the Judge was correct in following <span class="font-italic">Jameel</span>. That having been said, there is a relatively significant body of authority in England endorsing the general principle established in <span class="font-italic">Jameel</span>, <span class="font-italic">viz</span>, that a claim which discloses no real and substantial tort is liable to be struck out for being an abuse of process of the court, and the real concerns (as we have seen above) relate to its <span class="font-italic">application</span>. This last-mentioned point is not surprising in view of the fact that the line-drawing required is not only fact-centric but may also be difficult to effect in borderline situations. <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Further, and leaving aside the differences in the rules of civil procedure between England and Singapore, </span><span class="font-weight-bold">Jameel</span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic"> also contains some </span><span class="font-weight-bold">general principles</span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic"> that may be applicable in the Singapore context.</span> Hence, applying the principle in <span class="font-italic">Jameel</span> to the facts of the present case, we would be of the view that this was far from being a borderline situation and that the Judge was therefore correct in following and applying <span class="font-italic">Jameel</span> and holding that the Appellant’s claim in defamation did not disclose a real and substantial tort. This would have served as a <span class="font-italic">yet further</span> reason as to why the Appellant’s claim in defamation should fail. [emphasis in original in italics; emphasis added in bold italics] </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">148 In <span class="font-italic">Atlantis</span>, it was held, albeit in <span class="font-italic">obiter</span> (at [56]), that although abuse of process is more commonly a ground for striking out a claim <span class="font-italic">before</span> trial, it is open to the court in a suitable case to dismiss a claim <span class="font-italic">at</span> trial on the ground that it constitutes an abuse of process. Reliance was placed on the observations of the English Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Lonrho</span><span class="font-italic"> PLC. and Others v Fayed and Others (No. 5)</span> [1993] 1 WLR 1489 (at 1493D–F and 1502D–E).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">149 Given the conclusion reached above that the first component of the element of publication is not established on the balance of probabilities, there is no liability for the tort in the present case. Be that as it may, I venture to state that the <span class="font-italic">Jameel</span> doctrine can serve as an additional reason to dismiss the action since it can be said that no real and substantial tort was committed in this jurisdiction. The only proof of the second component of publication comes from the evidence of Xu Zhengpeng (and, furthermore, only in relation to Articles 1, 2 and 4). Consequently, the publication in Singapore would have been very exceedingly limited and restricted. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Issue of reference: Do the Online Articles refer to the plaintiffs?</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">150 As stated in [34], in order to establish liability, the Online Articles would have to refer to the plaintiffs. In this connection, the parties have agreed that the Online Articles refer to P1, P2, P4 and P5. Thus, a remaining issue on liability that affects P3 is whether the Online Articles refer to P3, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, Qingjian Realty (South Pacific) Group Pte. Ltd.. There is reference to “Qingjian Group Singapore company” in the Online Articles and the question is whether these words are reasonably capable of referring to P3. In the end, I find that the Online Articles do not refer to P3 and this finding is another reason for dismissing the action in so far as P3 is concerned. These are the reasons for my conclusion on the issue of reference.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">151 The plaintiffs allege that the articles in Categories A and C refer to P3. In Article 1 (the representative article in Category A) and Article 4 (the representative article in Category C), the reference in question is a reference to “Qingjian Group Singapore company”. For completeness, the plaintiffs do not plead that Article 2 (the only article in Category B) is defamatory of P3, and so no question of reference arises here. Further or alternatively, the plaintiffs plead that, by way of innuendo, “Qingjian Group Singapore company” meant and/or was intended to refer to P3. In this regard, they rely on two “facts”. First, they argue that readers of the statement, particularly readers in Singapore, would know that P3 is one of the more established affiliates of P1 and/or P2 in Singapore. Second, they claim that P3 is also known by the public at large to be actively involved in building a name for itself for mass-market condominiums and executive condominiums in Singapore under the “Qingjian Realty” brand.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">152 I agree with the defendants that the words “Qingjian Group Singapore company” are not capable of referring to P3, especially in the light of 18 other companies registered in Singapore with the name “Qingjian” at the material time. This means that P3 would have to rely on innuendo to establish the element of reference in the law of defamation. In other words, no reasonable reader without special knowledge would have understood “Qingjian Group Singapore company” to refer to P3.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">153 I am of the view that Articles 1 and 4 would not lead a reasonable reader to the conclusion that P3 is being referred to. The key allegation in Articles 1 and 4 is that P4 had relied on “Qingjian Group Singapore company” to obtain permanent residency in Singapore. In Article 4, reference is also made to “Qingjian Group Singapore company” being a “twin brother” of P2 in Singapore established by P4 and P5. In these contexts, however, a reasonable reader would be none the wiser even if he had knowledge of the two “facts” which are being relied on by the plaintiffs. In other words, even if these two “facts” were true, I do not consider that they go any way towards establishing that “Qingjian Group Singapore company” refers to P3.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">154 To my mind, “Qingjian Group Singapore company” was used in a <span class="font-italic">descriptive</span> sense. In other words, while the author had intended to refer to a specific company, he chose not to identify it by its actual name. Hence, “Qingjian Group Singapore company” can equally refer to <span class="font-italic">any one</span> of the 18 Singapore entities with the name “Qingjian” apart from P3.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">155 Even if “Qingjian Group Singapore company” was intended to identify a specific company, I agree with the defendants that a reasonable reader would conclude that this referred to a company by the name of Qingjian Group Co., Ltd. Singapore Branch instead, as the name of this company was closer to “Qingjian Group Singapore company” than any of the other “Qingjian” Singapore entities, including P3.

In <span class="font-italic">Gatley</span>, it is stated (at para 7.3) that:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Where the claimant is referred to in an indirect way or by implication it will be a question of degree how far evidence will be required to connect the libel with him. At one extreme, if there is a libel on “the Prime Minister” that officer does not need to produce witnesses to testify that they know who he is. At the other extreme, the claimant may only be identifiable by reason of extraneous facts which are not generally known, in which case there is no actionable publication unless it is shown that the words were communicated to persons with such knowledge. <span class="font-italic">Even in the latter type of case, however, it is not enough that the recipients of the statement did understand it to refer to the claimant: the issue is whether reasonable people with their knowledge would so understand it.</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…                                                                  </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">157 As I have already stated, Articles 1 and 4 would not lead a reasonable reader to the conclusion that they refer to P3. In my judgment, therefore, the articles in Categories A and C do not refer to P3. Consequently, P3’s claim in defamation against the defendants fails for this additional reason.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Issue of meaning: Are the Online Articles defamatory?</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">158 As stated in [34], the plaintiffs have to establish that the Online Articles are defamatory of the plaintiffs. The legal principles on defamatory meaning are not controversial. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">159 I begin with P3. It is not the plaintiffs’ pleaded case that Article 2 (the only article in Category B) is defamatory of P3. Given my conclusion that “Qingjian Group Singapore company” is not a reference to P3, the articles in Categories A and C cannot be defamatory of P3. However, even if I were to assume, for the sake of argument, that the words “Qingjian Group Singapore company” are a reference to P3, I find that the articles in Categories A and C are not defamatory of P3. I will elaborate on this point. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">160 The particular paragraph in Article 1 (the representative article in Category A) being relied on as regards P3 reads: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Relying on Qingjian Group Singapore company, [P4] has obtained Singapore permanent residency and his entire family has even migrated to Singapore. They own several mansions and their assets reach tens of billions. [P5] and other members have also completed migration procedure. According to research, the entire senior management of [P2] are the main investors of Qingjian Group Singapore company. Their assets have been transferred overseas and they own the citizenship of Singapore.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">Read in the context of the rest of Article 1, the paragraph quoted above is not defamatory of “Qingjian Group Singapore company”.  P4’s “reliance” on “Qingjian Group Singapore company” is left completely unexplained and could be innocuous. Similarly, that the entire senior management of P2 are the main investors of “Qingjian Group Singapore company” says nothing about the latter.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">161 <span class="font-italic"> </span>As regards Article 4 (the representative article in Category C), references to “Qingjian Group Singapore company” appear at two points. The first is that P4 and P5 have established a twin brother of P2 in Singapore. This says nothing about P3. As for the second reference, to the effect that P4 has obtained Singapore permanent residency by relying on “Qingjian Group Singapore company”, my conclusion in the preceding paragraph applies equally here. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">162 I now move on to the remaining plaintiffs, P1, P2, P4 and P5. It appears from the Statement of Claim (Amendment No. 2) that these plaintiffs rely only on the natural and ordinary meaning of the Online Articles in making out their case against the defendants. The substantive portions of the plaintiffs’ English translation of Articles 1, 2 and 4 are annexed to this judgment in Annex A, and the parts which are pleaded as defamatory are emphasised in italics and bold therein. In my view, the identified statements in the Online Articles are capable of conveying the defamatory meanings set out at [163]–[165] below.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Article 1 </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">163 I start by looking at Article 1 (the representative article in Category A). In my view, Article 1 was capable of conveying defamatory meanings. In its natural and ordinary meaning, Article 1 alleged that P4 and P5 had, through various means, dishonestly used P1 to misappropriate the state-owned assets of P2. P2 was formerly a state-owned enterprise but, as a result of this scheme, had become a personal company owned by P4 and P5 and others. In so far as P1 and P2 were concerned, the suggestion was that they were complicit in this scheme. As a corporate plaintiff with no trading or business reputation in Singapore, P1 cannot be defamed by Article 1. However, such allegations are defamatory of P2, P4 and P5 in so far as they plainly lowered P2, P4 and P5 in the estimation of right-thinking members of society generally. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Article 2</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">164 Moving on to Article 2 (the only article in Category B), Article 2 was capable of conveying defamatory meanings. In its natural and ordinary meaning, Article 2 alleged that the privatisation of P2 was a result of a scheme by P4 and P5 to misappropriate state-owned assets and that P1 and P2 were complicit in this scheme. Moreover, P4 and P5 had absconded or were planning to abscond by migrating to Singapore. The allegations were of unlawful conduct, corruption, abuse of position and dishonesty on the part of P4 and P5, as well as mismanagement or manipulation of P1 and P2 by P4 and P5. As a corporate plaintiff with no trading or business reputation in Singapore, P1 cannot be defamed by Article 2. However, such allegations clearly lowered P2, P4 and P5 in the estimation of right-thinking members of society generally and are therefore defamatory. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Article 4</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">165 As regards Article 4 (the representative article in Category C), I am of the view that in its natural and ordinary meaning, Article 4 alleged the same thing as Article 2, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, that the privatisation of P2 was a result of a scheme by P4 and P5 to misappropriate state-owned assets and that P1 and P2 were complicit in this scheme. Moreover, P4 and P5 had absconded or were planning to abscond by migrating to Singapore. The allegations were of unlawful conduct, corruption, abuse of position and dishonesty on the part of P4 and P5, as well as mismanagement or manipulation of P1 and P2 by P4 and P5. As a corporate plaintiff with no trading or business reputation in Singapore, P1 cannot be defamed by Article 4. Again, however, these allegations clearly lowered P2, P4 and P5 in the estimation of right-thinking members of society generally and are therefore defamatory. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Conclusion on the plaintiffs’ case with respect to the Online Articles</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">166 Based on the foregoing, the plaintiffs have failed to make out a <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> case of defamation against the defendants in so far as the Online Articles are concerned. With respect to the issue of publication, the plaintiffs have failed to establish the first component of publication. Moreover, while the second component of publication is technically satisfied, the plaintiffs’ claim in defamation falls to be dismissed pursuant to the <span class="font-italic">Jameel</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>doctrine. In addition to these reasons, which apply <span class="font-italic">vis-à-vis</span> all the plaintiffs, P1’s claim also fails as P1 has no trading or business reputation in Singapore. At the same time, P3’s claim also fails as the Online Articles do not refer to P3. In any event, the Online Articles are not defamatory of P1 and P3.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The Justification Issue</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">167 In light of my conclusions thus far on liability, it is, strictly speaking, not necessary for me to comment on the defence of justification which arises only after a <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> case of liability is made out. Nonetheless, I propose to comment on aspects of the defence of justification. The trial proper was dominated by this defence, and parties have also submitted at great length on it. I do not propose to comment on the issue of damages as this is generally only covered in submissions.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">168 It is not controversial that the burden of proof in establishing the defence of justification lies squarely on the defendant (<span class="font-italic">Gatley</span> at para 11.4; <span class="font-italic">Gary Chan</span> at para 13.003; <span class="font-italic">Evans</span> at pp 85–86). To successfully establish the defence of justification, the defendant need only prove the truth of the <span class="font-italic">substance</span> or <span class="font-italic">gist </span>of the offending words (as opposed to those parts of the offending words which do not add to the sting of the alleged defamation) (<span class="font-italic">Review Publishing</span><span class="font-italic"> Co Ltd and another v Lee Hsien Loong and another appeal </span>[2010] 1 SLR 52 at [134]). Thus, some leeway is given for exaggeration and error (<span class="font-italic">Chan Cheng </span><span class="font-italic">Wah Bernard and others v Koh Sin Chong Freddie and another appeal</span> [2012] 1 SLR 506 (“<span class="font-italic">Bernard </span><span class="font-italic">Chan</span>”) at [44]). However, in no way does this leeway suggest that the burden is easily discharged. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">169 The defence of justification is not established by showing tenuous circumstantial evidence and inferences (<span class="font-italic">Evans </span>at p 87). At the same time, while the standard of proof remains the balance of probabilities, the sting of the libel in this case is misappropriation of state-owned assets. Needless to say, such an accusation is a serious matter and cogent evidence is needed to establish, on the balance of probabilities, the truth of the accusation. The oft-quoted statement in the cases is that the more serious the allegation, the less likely it is that the event occurred. Consequently, the stronger the evidence must be before the event’s occurrence can be established on a balance of probabilities. Furthermore, in the context of defamation, the defence will not succeed if a materially less serious meaning is proved to be true (<span class="font-italic">Bernard Chan</span> at [43]). As explained in <span class="font-italic">Gary Chan </span>(at para 13.005):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… Where the defamatory imputation is that the plaintiff is guilty of a serious crime, the defendant will have to justify the statement by showing the plaintiff’s culpability in respect of that crime. If the defamatory imputation is one with a lower level of defamatory meaning, such as that the plaintiff is under suspicion of a crime, the defendant will be able to justify the statement by showing that the plaintiff had acted in a manner which would have caused a reasonable observer to be suspicious. …</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">170 In the course of their submissions, the defendants have referred to the evidential burden of proof shifting to the plaintiffs. As with most civil cases, the evidential burden would shift or alternate from one party to the other in the course of a trial according to the nature and strength of the evidence offered in support of or in opposition to the main fact to be established (see, for example, <span class="font-italic">Ong</span><span class="font-italic"> and Co Pte Ltd v Quah Kay Tee</span> [1996] 1 SLR(R) 782 at [19]). More importantly, however, the legal burden of the defence of justification remains squarely on the defendants. If the state of the evidence is such that at the end of the trial the court is left in an uncertain position, the court may rule that the assertions have not been made out (see, generally, <span class="font-italic">Rhesa</span><span class="font-italic"> Shipping Co. S.A. v Edmunds (“The Popi M”) </span>[1985] 1 WLR 948). It is open to the court to say that the evidence leaves the court in doubt as to whether the event occurred or not, and that the party who bears the legal burden of proving that the event occurred has failed to discharge that burden. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">171 The sting of the Online Articles is that P4 and P5 had in fact misappropriated state-owned assets and that P1 and P2 were complicit in the misappropriation. The defendants’ central case is that the P4 and P5 had deliberately and systematically misappropriated the state-owned assets of P2 through various complicated schemes and a web of companies including: (a) P1 and P2; (b) Shandong Haiwei and Shanghai Heliyuan; and (c) Guoqing. Before this court, the parties have dealt with the alleged misappropriation in various stages, and I propose to adopt the same approach. At the outset, I note that the defendants have, in their closing submissions, abandoned a number of allegations which they had pleaded in their Defence (Amendment No. 1). That being the case, I will focus on the defendants’ case as set out in their closing submissions.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">172 As my comments below will show, what the defendants have sought to do was to highlight a particular transaction, and then invite this court to draw an inference of illegality or impropriety by arguing that the defendants have done enough to shift the evidential burden to the plaintiffs but the plaintiffs have not adduced enough evidence to “pass back” the evidential burden to the defendants. The fallacy of this argument is dealt with in greater detail below.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">173 One point ought to be made at this juncture and this concerns the defendants’ repeated allegation that P4 and, to some extent, P5 had not given consideration for the shares they acquired. As will be seen below, this is a key fact relied upon by the defendants at various points. What must be remembered, however, is that the legal burden of establishing the truth of the allegation (<span class="font-italic">viz</span>., the non-payment for the shares) is on the defendants (ss 103–105 of the EA; see also the Court of Appeal's decision in <span class="font-italic">Cooperatieve</span><span class="font-italic"> Centrale Raiffeisen-Boerenleenbank BA (trading as Rabobank International), Singapore Branch v Motorola Electronics Pte Ltd</span> [2011] 2 SLR 63 (at [30]–[31]) and more recently in <span class="font-italic">SCT Technologies Pte Ltd v Western Copper Co Ltd </span>[2016] 1 SLR 1471 (at [16]–[18])).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Changes in shareholders of P1</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">June 1998: Founding and initial capitalisation of P1</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">174 P1 was registered on 18 May 1998 and had its business license issued on 2 June 1998.

This number of shareholders (total of 40) would make no sense if the informal shareholding arrangement did not exist. The defendants highlight that the original date of this document was 21 March 1999 and that this date had been struck out and replaced with 28 June 1998. The argument was that this “backdating” indicates that the informal shareholding arrangement was a later invention. In response, the plaintiffs submit that the more probable explanation is that the wrong date was typed, and the correct date was then inserted by handwriting.

The defendants contend that as this certificate post-dates the date on which the capital payments were made, it makes no sense unless P2 was “giving its blessing for funds which it had already contributed itself to be treated as the funds of P4 (either in his own right or as nominee for a group of employees)”. In response, the plaintiffs argue that the certificate was simply P2’s acknowledgment of its approval of the informal shareholding arrangement.

</div> According to this Capital Verification Report, out of P1’s registered capital of RMB 5 million, RMB 3 million was contributed by P4. According to Xu Ying, up till 2014, the Capital Verification Report was a document required by the PRC company registration authority for the formation and registration of a company and had to be issued by a PRC-qualified accounting firm in accordance with PRC accounting principles. The accounting firm would examine the capital account of the company and the wiring proofs to verify that the capital contributions were made through the shareholders’ accounts to the company.

The quality of this evidence is not enough to shift the evidential burden to the plaintiffs, let alone discharge the defendants’ legal burden. As against the defendants’ contention, the plaintiffs’ expert, Cao Jun, testified that since the rules and regulations pertaining to the administration of state-owned assets in force at that time did not expressly require the approval of the relevant authorities in charge of the administration of state-owned assets for this type of situation, this capital increase did not violate any mandatory rules under any law or regulation, and no approval from the relevant authorities in charge of the administration of state-owned assets was required for this capital increase.

In the informal shareholding arrangement, P4 was the appointed nominee and it is reasonable that the proceeds of the transfer were subsequently paid out to its members; indeed, it would be wholly unimaginable that the members of the informal shareholding arrangement were content to let P4 retain all the proceeds of the transfer despite their earlier contributions.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">193 What is also being alleged by the defendants is that P1 was simply handing out shares without consideration to favoured employees.

</div> This document is dated 21 April 2003 and it approves the transfer of P2’s shares to QCGRE. However, it states that P1 has a registered capital of RMB 10 million, of which P2 held 40% of the shares. The defendants argue that this document indicates that P2 had misstated its capital position, and that this misrepresentation is consistent with a reluctance on the plaintiffs’ part to let the authorities know that the state-owned interest in P1 had already been significantly diluted. On the other side, the plaintiffs’ position is that no such misrepresentation had been made to the authorities.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">195 The Reply Regarding Qingdao Zero Zero One Engineering Co., Ltd’s Transfer of State-Owned Shares does not further the defendants’ case. The point to be made is that this document was sent by the authorities and there is nothing to suggest that the mistakes as to P1’s capital position were a result of the misrepresentation of any of the plaintiffs. The mistake could equally have been a result of the authorities relying on old records. In this regard, I note that the document states P1’s name as Qingdao Zero Zero One Engineering Co., Ltd even though its name had already changed to Qingdao Construction Group Zero Zero One Engineering Co., Ltd as of 13 February 2003. Even if the mistake was a result of wrong information provided by the plaintiffs, this was probably inadvertent since, as Cao Jun pointed out, all information regarding P1’s share capital increase and shareholding interests were a matter of public record which the authorities in the PRC could easily verify.

The plaintiffs’ evidence, as set out above, is that it was the members of the SSC who had contributed the RMB 60 million in setting up QBI and that the situation which gave rise to the Decision on Administrative Penalty was an administrative error that was eventually rectified. To my mind, that the members of the SSC should be the ultimate owners of QBI is simply a continuation of the state of affairs from the SSC and the informal shareholding arrangement that preceded it, albeit in a slightly different form (in that the shares were now held by QBI and not by the SSC or in accordance with the informal shareholding arrangement).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">204 In any event, even if I were to take the defendants’ case at its highest, there still remains an obstacle for the defendants. It follows from [196] above that, by the defendants’ own case, P1 was, by this time, a fully private company. Thus, there were simply no state-owned assets to speak about by this stage, much less any misappropriation of the same.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">205 A so-called second string in the defendants’ bow is the allegation that the Share Transfer Agreements for this transaction make no mention of QBI or the three individuals giving any consideration for the shares they were to acquire. It is not clear how this is intended to sit with the defendants’ case that the transfer was ultimately funded by P1, since this latter case clearly contemplates consideration having been provided.

</div> The defendants’ case is that Shandong Haiwei had acquired its shares in P2 without paying any of the RMB 90 million it was supposed to contribute, and that P4 was able to bring this about through abusing his position. The plaintiffs’ position is that the payment of RMB 90 million was made by Shandong Haiwei. I should also note that while parties are at variance over the legality of the arrangement between Shandong Haiwei and the two American companies and have submitted on this at some length, this is largely unnecessary. The fact is that the arrangement never materialised. I will therefore focus my comments solely on the primary allegation in the defendants’ case, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, whether, through P4’s alleged abuse of position, Shandong Haiwei had acquired its shares in P2 for no consideration. I note at the outset that this allegation has not been expressly pleaded by the defendants. The defendants have two arguments in this regard.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">208 The defendants first submit that while the Capital Verification Reports purport to record Shandong Haiwei as having made the necessary payments in September 2007 and January 2008, they do not attach any receipts and are unreliable evidence. As I have mentioned earlier at [182], Xu Ying’s evidence is that while the accounting firm issuing the Capital Verification Reports did not have to inspect the original sources of funds, it would examine the capital account of the company and the wiring proofs to verify that the capital contributions were made through the shareholders’ accounts to the company.

While “impossible” may be putting the matter too far, there is certainly merit to this submission. I note, critically, that the SASAC appears to have been represented at this meeting.

</div>
</div>
</div> It is agreed that there was no material change in the ultimate shareholding of P2.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">215 In their pleadings, the defendants had originally alleged that Guoqing was used by P4 and P5 to “systematically” effect the transfer of P2’s assets out of the PRC to abroad, in particular to establish various entities in Singapore with the name “Qingjian”. This has been abandoned by the defendants in their closing submissions and, for this reason, it is not necessary for me to say anything more about it.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">P4 and P5’s move to Singapore</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">216 The defendants finally allege that P4 and P5 had made use of their positions in P2 in their respective applications for permanent residency in Singapore. I need not consider this allegation for the simple reason that, even if true, it does not go towards justifying the sting in the Online Articles. The reference to P4 and P5’s permanent residency application in Article 1 and Article 4 is in the context of their reliance on “Qingjian Group Singapore company”, and not P2. Likewise, the reference in Article 2 to the entire family of P4 having obtained permanent residency in Singapore makes no mention of P2. Moreover, this allegation plainly does not justify the imputation in Articles 2 and 4 that P4 and P5 had absconded or were planning to abscond by migrating to Singapore.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">P4 and P5’s involvement</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">217 Central to the defendants’ case is the claim that throughout the aforementioned stages from state-owned enterprise to private ownership, P4 and P5 had simultaneously held a number of powerful appointments in key organisations, including P1, P2, the SSC, QCGRE, QBI, Shandong Haiwei and Shanghai Heliyuan. The suggestion is that P4 and P5’s holding of these positions had allowed the various transactions to take place. The defendants’ submission is that given P4 and P5’s “remarkable nexus of power”, the possibility of shareholders, other directors or supervisors intervening to thwart their alleged plans “must have been so remote as to be negligible”, and that it is reasonable to infer that, where necessary, P4 and P5 were able to persuade others to join them in their alleged scheme.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">218 Plainly, the involvement of P4 and P5 in the aforementioned transactions is a critical part of the defendants’ case. These transactions alone would not justify the defamatory imputations of the Online Articles if they were carried out without the involvement of P4 and P5. However, having found above that the defendants have not even shown that these transactions were improperly carried out, it is not necessary for me to deal with P4 and P5’s involvement in the relevant organisations at the various stages. In any event, the defendants’ claims in this regard are unacceptably speculative, for there is no objective evidence showing P4 and P5 had indeed used their positions to put into effect these transactions.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Conclusion on the justification issue</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">219 In light of the assessment above, the defendants have not established the defence of justification.

What is clear is that the plaintiffs’ claims in conspiracy (both by unlawful means and by lawful means) are premised on the defendants having published the Online Articles and/or the News Articles. To succeed in these claims, the plaintiffs have to show that the defendants combined to publish and did publish the offensive material. As I have found that the defendants are not responsible for the publication of both the Online Articles and the News Articles, it follows that the claims in conspiracy must also fail. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">221 The plaintiffs’ action against the defendants is dismissed.

Many people were confused, why has this state-owned Qingjian Group, which is very well-known in China, become a private limited company? This privatization of Qingjian Group is attributable to a group under Du Bo and Yuan Hongjun. In mainland China, other than being the chairman and CEO of Qingjian Group, Du Bo was also dubbed with many titles, such as Vice President of Construction Industry Association of Shandong, PhD in Management, engineering technology application researcher, State Council specialist with special allowance, doctoral tutor of Tongji University, etc. and even (people’s representative) representing the people and fighting benefits for the people! <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">However, he played double roles inside and outside the country, planning with Yuan </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Hongjun for more than 10 years to embezzle the hundred billion state-owned assets!</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">In 1994, upon approval from Qingdao municipal government, Qingjian Group was established with state-owned status.
