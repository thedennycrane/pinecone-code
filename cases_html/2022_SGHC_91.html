The Prosecution relies on the conditioned statements and oral testimonies of V1 and V2 to establish, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the accused committed the offences in the proceeded charges. The Prosecution submits that the accused knew the young Victims would not report the physical and sexual assaults. The accused had abused the trust of PW1 and the Victims to commit the sexual acts in the proceeded charges.

V2 was sleeping in his bedroom when he was awoken by the accused who pulled down his shorts, powdered and masturbated his penis, and sucked it until it became erected.

During the time the accused lived with them, PW1 held various jobs and was often at work and not at home. The accused was often at home and would help her to care for the Victims until PW1 chased him out of the house over unrelated matters sometime in 2006. PW1 did not know about the sexual assaults until 12 December 2016.

Moreover, PW1 was not around the Victims for extended periods of time, which made the Victims turn to the accused for familial support.

The Defence argues that the time ranges in the proceeded charges are not sufficiently particularised. For instance, the timeframe of the alleged offences that occurred at Property 1, namely the first, second and third charges, spans over a range of close to two years. The Defence avers that the time ranges stated in the proceeded charges do not appear to be based on any substantive information provided by the Victims, save that the stated periods corresponded with the period of time when the family lived at the particular property.

</div> In <span class="font-italic">Lee Kwang Peng v Public Prosecutor and another appeal</span> [1997] 2 SLR(R) 569, the court held (at [60]) that:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… the trial judge retains the discretion under s 171 [of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 1985 Rev Ed)] to decide whether the degree of prejudice presented by a single trial justifies an order for separate trials. In such cases, <span class="font-italic">the judge must ask himself whether he would be so influenced by the evidence presented by both victims that he would be unable to preserve the sanctity of the rule against similar facts</span>.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 In this case even if one charge was proceeded against the accused, both the Victims would have to testify. If there was a joinder of charges against the accused, it is critical that the court ensures that each of those charges is proven beyond a reasonable doubt. If the accused is convicted of one charge, it cannot necessarily follow that the accused is also guilty of the other charges, unless the evidence in the other charges is also proven beyond a reasonable doubt. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 The parties agreed that s 133 of the CPC allows joinder of similar charges against the accused. The most pertinent consideration was whether the accused would be prejudiced or embarrassed in his defence by the joinder of charges. If the court was of the view that the accused would be prejudiced or embarrassed, then s 146 of the CPC empowers the court to disallow the Prosecution’s application for a joinder of charges against the accused. I was of the view that the accused would not be prejudiced or embarrassed by the Prosecution’s application to proceed on the first to third, fifth, sixth and ninth to eleventh charges against the accused. Furthermore, it would be perceived to be an abuse of the process to charge and try the accused on each of the similar charges separately and repeatedly on the basis that he has denied committing them. Besides, a joinder of charges would be an efficient and fair disposal of the charges against the accused.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 For the above reasons, I allowed the Prosecution’s application for a joinder of charges made at the pre-trial conference for this case.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">My decision</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 I shall now deal with the evidence pertaining to the proceeded charges. I am acutely aware that no one had witnessed the accused’s commission of the sexual acts on the Victims which occurred around 20 years ago. There is also no contemporaneous corroborative evidence of the Victims’ versions of the sexual events. The Prosecution’s entire case rests largely on the Victims’ testimonies of the alleged sexual abuse. In these circumstances, for the Victims’ testimonies to constitute proof beyond a reasonable doubt of the accused’s guilt, I must be completely satisfied, on a close scrutiny, that the Victims’ evidence is so “unusually convincing” as to overcome any doubts that may arise from the lack of corroboration (see <span class="font-italic">AOF v P</span><span class="font-italic">ublic Prosecutor </span>[2012] 3 SLR 34 (“<span class="font-italic">AOF</span>”) at [111]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 If the Victims’ evidence is not unusually convincing, a conviction may be unsafe unless there is some corroboration of the Victims’ account (<span class="font-italic">AOF</span> at [173]).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The applicable law</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 In <span class="font-italic">P</span><span class="font-italic">ublic Prosecutor v GCK and another matter </span>[2020] 1 SLR 486 (“<span class="font-italic">GCK</span>”), a case involving a charge of outrage of modesty, the Court of Appeal elaborated on the “unusually convincing” standard that applies where the witness’ uncorroborated testimony forms the sole basis for conviction. The Court stated at [88]–[90]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">88  The “unusually convincing” standard is used to describe a situation where the witness’s testimony is “so convincing that the Prosecution’s case [is] proven beyond reasonable doubt, solely on the basis of the evidence”: see <span class="font-italic">Mohammed </span><span class="font-italic">Liton </span>([32] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) at [38].

Sometimes what may appear to be discrepancies are in reality different ways of describing the same thing, or it may happen that the witnesses who are describing the same thing might have seen it in different ways and at different times and that is how discrepancies are likely to arise. These discrepancies may either be minor or serious discrepancies. Absolute truth is I think beyond human perception and conflicting versions of an incident, even by honest and disinterested witnesses, is a common experience. <span class="font-italic">In weighing the testimony of witnesses, human fallibility in observation, retention and recollection are often recogni</span><span class="font-italic">zed by the court …</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 Similarly, in <span class="font-italic">Jagatheesan</span><span class="font-italic"> s/o Krishnasamy v Public Prosecutor </span>[2006] 4 SLR(R) 45 (“<span class="font-italic">Jagatheesan</span>”) at [82], V K Rajah J (as he then was) stated that:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">It is trite law that <span class="font-italic">minor discrepancies in a witness’s testimony should not be held against the witness in assessing his credibility.

I am mindful that the alleged incidents, namely the alleged sexual assaults, occurred in the early 2000s and the offences were only revealed in 2016, many years later. Thus, out of an abundance of prudence, I approach the evidence with utmost caution, and subject the Victims’ evidence to microscopic scrutiny. This includes seeking corroborative evidence to support the Victims’ evidence. Realistically, I am aware that the Victims were made to recall events some two decades ago when they were young children. This means that their recollection of the events may suffer from some degree of imprecision at times. Accordingly, inconsistencies are to be expected in this case. Allowing some room for these inconsistencies is appropriate. However, it is critical that I evaluate each inconsistency and discrepancy and ascertain whether it is minor or serious. A minor discrepancy is acceptable. However, a serious discrepancy will cause the court to be wary and exercise careful caution in evaluating the reliability of the evidence. In my assessment, I also consider whether the inconsistencies highlighted are sufficient to raise a reasonable doubt about the veracity of the Victims’ evidence and their credibility as witnesses, such that their evidence falls short of the “unusually convincing” threshold. This is consistent with Yong Pung How CJ’s pronouncement in <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v Annamalai Pillai Jayanthi </span>[1998] 1 SLR(R) 305 at [12]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… the mere presence of several discrepancies in the Prosecution’s case cannot, <span class="font-italic">per se</span>, render its case manifestly unreliable.

V1 did not know what to do and pretended to be asleep. The accused then put his hand through one of the leg holes of V1’s shorts and used his hand to rub V1’s vagina directly on her skin. The accused then pulled one leg of V1’s shorts up and put his penis through that leg hole of V1’s shorts, before rubbing his penis against V1’s vagina, skin-on-skin, until she felt a wetness. The accused left the room shortly after.

It is clear from V1’s evidence that the accused attempted and intended to penetrate V1’s vagina with his penis without her consent. As V1 was below 12 years old at the time of the incident, she could not give consent under s 90(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the Penal Code.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">(4) </span>The fifth charge</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">97 </span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">This incident occurred sometime between 2003 and 2004 at Property 2 after S and her children moved out.

Menon CJ in <span class="font-italic">GDC v Public Prosecutor </span>[2020] 5 SLR 1130 (“<span class="font-italic">GDC</span>”) at [13] observed that in “assessing the credibility of the victim, the court must bear in mind that there is no prescribed way in which victims of sexual assault are expected to act” (citing <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v Wee </span><span class="font-italic">Teong Boo and other appeal and another matter </span>[2020] 2 SLR 533<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [55]). As explained below at [253]–[260] not all sexual assault victims behave or react the same way. The undisputed fact is that the accused admitted to showing V1 nude images of females from the laptop and then told her to perform the same acts as shown. Notwithstanding what the accused had done to her, and this is admitted by the accused, she had not disclosed the accused’s sexual acts to anyone. I find V1’s explanations for her silence (see [101] and [102] above) to be consistent with her evidence on her actions. These include her refusal to reply to the accused’s Facebook messages on 14 May 2010 and 6 August 2013 (see [168] below), which she explained was due to her disgust for the accused

</div> Second, V1 was a teenager when she posted about her experiences on her blog and deleted the blog post shortly after. I do not find this to be behaviour consistent with an “attention-seeking stunt”. If V1’s intention of posting about her experiences was truly to seek attention, she would not have deleted the post. Rather, her action appears to be the act of a teenager attempting to come to terms with traumatic past events. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">109 V1’s claim that she was afraid of being seen as impure is also consistent with her own evidence throughout the trial that she was ashamed by the incidents, and in her own response on how the accused’s sexual acts affected her:

It is clear that V1’s non-disclosure of the incidents resulted from a complex mix of trauma, insecurity and shame, all of which she was made to experience from a tender age. Her evidence paints a compelling and poignant picture of the emotional scars she suffered that stretched well into the future and caused her decades-long silence. This explains why V1 continued to maintain her silence even after the accused left the family in 2006.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">110 Considering all of the above in totality, I find V1’s actions and evidence to be consistent with someone who wished to forget and heal from the trauma inflicted on her as a victim of sexual abuse at a very young age. Her long silence for all those years does not undermine her credibility. Moreover, her evidence on why she did not tell PW1 about the abuse and that she only mentioned the abuse briefly to Faris is externally consistent with the evidence of PW6 and Faris. I, therefore, find that the internal and external consistencies of V1’s evidence on this issue of disclosure strengthen her credibility as a witness.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">V1’s act of sending a text message on the stand</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">111 On 19 January 2022, which was the second day of V1’s in-court testimony, V1 sent a text message to the Investigating Officer (“IO”) with her handphone while on the stand.

I am satisfied that the accused had the intent to outrage V2’s modesty and had intended and attempted to penetrate V2 without V2’s consent.

PW1 and the Victims did not discuss the details of the various sexual assaults that the accused had inflicted on the Victims before they went to the police station. If they had wanted to frame the accused, they would have thoroughly discussed and orchestrated their evidence amongst themselves before going to the police station. They went to the police station without knowing the details of the accused’s sexual abuse against each other. PW1, who by then had no contact with the accused for about ten years, insisted that the Victims make the police reports against the accused. If it had not been for PW1’s insistence, the Victims would not have reported to the police. Thus, it was not the Victims who initiated the making of the police reports although they were the victims who bore the brunt of the sexual assaults by the accused.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">153 It was on 12 December 2016 that the dark secrets committed by the accused were exposed for the first time after more than ten years. The police recorded the statements from the Victims separately. The Victims were not given any opportunity to exchange the details of the accused’s sexual assaults on them. The truth of the Victims’ revelations was first tested when the accused was subsequently arrested on 19 May 2019. The accused did not completely deny the sexual assaults on the Victims. He admitted showing nude images to V1 and telling her to follow suit but she refused. He also admitted to masturbating V2. However, he denied the other egregious sexual assaults on the Victims. Therefore, the Victims did not lie when they informed the police that the accused had sexually assaulted them when they were very young.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Medical evidence</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">154 The Prosecution called Dr Ong from the IMH to testify. Dr Ong conducted a forensic psychiatric evaluation on the accused when he was remanded. Dr Ong opined that the accused was not of unsound mind at the time of the offences. However, Dr Ong diagnosed the accused with Pedophilic Disorder. Her diagnosis was based on the criteria set out in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition published by the American Psychiatric Association (“DSM-5”).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">155 During the cross-examination, Dr Ong was questioned by the Defence counsel on why she diagnosed the accused with Pedophilic <span class="font-italic">D</span><span class="font-italic">isorder, </span>as opposed to mere pedophilic <span class="font-italic">sexual orientation. </span>The question arose out of the following sentence in DSM-5:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">However, if they report an absence of feelings of guilt, shame, or anxiety about these impulses and are not functionally limited by their paraphilic impulses (according to self-report, objective assessment, or both), and their self-reported and legally recorded histories indicate that they have never acted on their impulses, then these individuals have a pedophilic sexual orientation but not pedophilic disorder.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">According to Dr Ong, pedophilic sexual orientation is pedophilia, which refers to a “sexual interest in children”. Pedophilic sexual orientation is not a “diagnosable psychiatric mental disorder”. In contrast, Pedophilic Disorder is a “diagnosable psychiatric mental disorder”. Pedophilic sexual orientation becomes Pedophilic Disorder when all three diagnostic criteria in DSM-5 are met:

But in the course of discipline and in the course of me disciplining like for the first one, [V1], when I slapped her hand because she was fiddling around with her mother’s washing machine, the family’s washing machine and it was an expensive washing machine for us at that time, so I do not want it to---so---so I slapped her hand because she was fiddling with it, that is---to me is not a beating. <span class="font-italic">A beating is more severe than that.</span> To me, that is discipline. Same with [V2] when---on that---that night when---it was in front of [PW1], it was---it was--- [PW1] was around when she told me what he did wrong---</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"> …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"> … I beat [V2] on the shoulder---on the back or shoulder or the arm is more of a discipline, it’s not really beat, it’s just a---a---a small slap and [PW1] was around. So it was like I don’t consider those beatings. So that’s why when---when I instructed my counsel is that, <span class="font-italic">beatings to me is more physical where there’s real pain and there’s bruises </span>and there’s---those are called “beatings”. But for me, what I did on these two occasion to them individually, to me it’s called “discipline”, I mean---yah. If you were to call that---those are beatings, then---</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Q: Now, you see, [the accused], what was put to them is that you did not beat.

And a slap on the hand of the palm would cause nothing at all, not even an injury. Even the pain will just go away a few seconds later.</span> Whereas a beating, now that is something severe. When you say no, I got beat up, so that means I got beat up something like there would be marks and there would be pain and the pain would be large---much more longer than a few seconds. So if you ask me, counsellor[sic], a beating would be like more severe than just a slap. So that’s why I said to my counsel, I said because it was beatings and <span class="font-italic">I disagree when you say beatings, I beat them, no, I did not, there was no beatings, I don’t physically abuse them at all</span>.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">194 I find that the accused’s explanation that he believed a “beating” to be different from a “slap” or “hit” hurts his credibility.

His explanation on what he understood to be a “beating” raised many further inconsistencies, which were irreconcilable with his earlier evidence. In the circumstances, it is reasonable to infer that the accused made up his explanation on what he understood as a “beating” on the stand, in order to defend the notion that he was consistent in his position that he did not severely “beat” the Victims. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">196 The chameleonic nature of the accused’s evidence on this point of physical abuse is summarised by the Prosecution as follows:

The level of detail with which he could recollect the three licking incidents also renders any claim that he could not recollect ever licking V1’s anus when being evaluated by Dr Ong manifestly untenable.

Further, when Dr Ong and ASP Vimala Raj took the stand, the Defence counsel did not put to either witness that they omitted to record everything the accused told them. This lends support to the suggestion that the accused made up this explanation on the stand. Considering all these inconsistencies and the facts in totality, the accused clearly was not truthful when he was questioned on these sexual incidents regarding V1. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">207 As I mentioned above at [180], the accused’s admission to the sexual acts in the stood down charges is salient and relevant to the proceeded charges. The accused’s defence to the proceeded charges is a bare denial. Therefore, the material inconsistencies present in the accused’s account of the sexual acts he committed against the Victims feature substantially in my assessment of whether the accused’s credibility has been impeached.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">208 Further, the accused also made a few material admissions in his statements which contradicted the Defence’s case theory. The accused agreed that sexual acts could take place even if there were other people in the same room.

He was not in pain or shock that made him unable to give his statements to the police. He also did not inform the recorder that he was in dire back pain that made it impossible for him to give a statement. Indeed, his claim of poor recollection is fundamentally incompatible with the level of detail he gave in his Second Long Statement when he described the sexual acts he committed on V1 (see [199] above). Further, nowhere in any of the three long statements did the accused state he was unwell. On the contrary, in his First Long Statement and his Third Long Statement, the accused stated that he was “comfortable” to give his statements. I agree with the Prosecution that on the face of the evidence, it is also clear the accused had the clarity of thought to make multiple minute amendments in all his three long statements.

</div> From these facts, it is clear that the accused’s back pain, if any, did not trouble him enough to seek help for all those years. The accused’s behaviour in not seeking treatment is inconsistent with his claim that the pain he experienced in 2019 was so severe as to affect his recollection of the incidents. Thus, the accused’s claim that his back pain affected his recollection of the incidents conflicts with his own evidence on his behaviour and medical history.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">215 The evidence strongly suggests that the accused’s claim of back pain is an afterthought and was made up by him while on the stand. I further note that during the cross-examination of ASP Vimala Raj, it was not put to ASP Vimala Raj that the accused was suffering from back pain at the time the First Long Statement was recorded. This claim only materialised when the accused took the stand in his defence, after the Prosecution had closed its case and ASP Vimala Raj had testified as a Prosecution witness. At one stage I was concerned whether the accused was obliquely suggesting that his statements given to the police were involuntary when he alleged about his back pain and shock. Eventually, the accused affirmed that his statements were given voluntarily to the police.

When the accused was given an opportunity to account for the inconsistencies, his explanations raised even more doubt as they were implausible on the facts or incongruent with the evidence of other witnesses.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Second, the accused did not offer a convincing account for the omissions and inconsistencies in his previous statements <span class="font-italic">vis-à-vis</span> his in-court testimony and account to Dr Ong. The accused’s first assertion that both Dr Ong and ASP Vimala Raj omitted to mention the details of the sexual acts he admitted committing was completely unconvincing. His second assertion that he was in pain and shock at the time the statements were recorded and that this impaired his recollection was (i) contradicted by the evidence of three witnesses, namely Dr Lin, Dr Yak and ASP Vimala Raj, (ii) inconsistent with the level of detail in the statements, and (iii) irreconcilable with his own evidence. It was also raised belatedly on the second day of his in-court testimony. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Third, the accused came across as a witness who was very cavalier about the truth and accuracy of his in-court testimony, both of which were sacrificed in an attempt to festoon his answers with a cloak of confidence.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">218 In conclusion, I find that the accused’s credit is impeached. He is an unreliable witness whose testimony in court on his sexual abuse of the Victims simply could not be relied on. The accused’s statements given to the relevant persons such as the police and Dr Ong are more truthful than his testimony in court.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">219 I reiterate that the impeachment of the accused’s credit does not necessarily mean that all his evidence must be disregarded. The court must carefully scrutinise the whole of the evidence to determine which aspect might be true and which should be disregarded (see <span class="font-italic">Somwang</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [43]). His defence on the proceeded charges regarding the Victims was a bare denial. It does not follow that an automatic consequence of a successful impeachment is the complete rejection of the accused’s defence. Having found that the accused’s credit is impeached, I have to exercise caution when I evaluate his evidence.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Weighing the Victims’ evidence against the accused’s evidence</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">220 Notwithstanding my finding that the accused is an unreliable witness, there is a remarkable consistency between certain aspects of the Victims’ evidence and the accused’s version in his police statements and account to Dr Ong:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) V1 recalled that while at Property 1, the accused placed her naked “lying on the bed facing head down with [her] legs tucked under [her] like the Muslim prayer position”.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">222 The evidence of the stood down charges are relevant as it is intertwined with the facts and actions of the accused in the proceeded charges. Thus, it is not prejudicial or irrelevant for me to consider the accused’s admission to the stood down charges. However, I reiterate that the court must be satisfied that the evidence against the accused on each and every proceeded charge must be proven beyond a reasonable doubt before he can be found guilty on the proceeded charges. In this analysis, I have to assess the Victims’ testimonies against that of the accused. This is crucial where “the case turns on one person’s word against the other’s” (see <span class="font-italic">XP</span><span class="font-italic"> v Public Prosecutor</span> [2008] 4 SLR(R) 686 (“<span class="font-italic">XP</span>”) at [34]). In that regard, I consider both the consistent <span class="font-italic">and </span>inconsistent portions of the Victims’ and the accused’s testimonies.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">223 Thus, weighing the <span class="font-italic">totality </span>of the Victims’ testimonies against that of the accused’s, I conclude that the Victims’ evidence is unusually convincing to the extent that I “can safely say [the Victims’] account[s] [are] to be unreservedly preferred over that of [the accused’s]” (<span class="font-italic">XP </span>at [34]).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Conclusion on the accused’s evidence</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">224 Having considered the totality of the evidence before me, I find the accused’s evidence to be like shifting sands, inconsistent and unreliable, making it difficult to believe. Accordingly, the accused has failed to raise a reasonable doubt in the Prosecution’s case. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">225 In the final analysis, I accept both Victims’ accounts of the incidents and the surrounding circumstances. I find that the Victims’ evidence of the incidents in the proceeded charges is unusually convincing and safe to accept.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The Defence’s arguments</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">226 In the attempt to cast doubt on the Victims’ accounts in relation to the respective charges, the Defence questioned the Victims in great detail on the technicalities and logic of their accounts. I have already dealt with and dismissed these arguments above (at [79]–[81], [84]–[85], [91]–[92], [98], [100] and [123]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">227 I shall now consider the Defence’s arguments that seek to raise a reasonable doubt about <span class="font-italic">both </span>the Victims’ accounts. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The proceeded charges lacked particulars of date and time</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">228 The form and particulars of a charge are set out in the CPC. Section 124(1) of the CPC provides:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Details of time, place and person or thing</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">124.—(1)  The charge must contain details of the time and place of the alleged offence and the person (if any) against whom or the thing (if any) in respect of which it was committed, <span class="font-italic">as are reasonably sufficient to give the accused notice of what the accused is charged with</span>.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">229 Thus, in ascertaining whether the proceeded charges are sufficiently particularised in terms of the date and time, the relevant inquiry is whether the time ranges provided in the proceeded charges “are reasonably sufficient to give the accused notice of what the accused is charged with”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">230 I find that this test is clearly satisfied in the present case. I disagree with the Defence’s submission that the accused has been prejudiced as he has been deprived of the ability to meet the Prosecution’s case or put forth substantive defences (for example, by way of alibi or absence from the country or home).

In finding that the two framed charges contained particulars of time and place as were reasonably sufficient to give the accused notice of the matter with which he was charged, the court stated at [21]–[22]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">21 While it would be ideal if the time and date of an offence were stated in the charge, there may be occasions where a victim, <span class="font-italic">especially a young victim</span>, cannot remember the time and date of the offence. <span class="font-italic">This will be </span><span class="font-italic">all the more so if the victim does not mention the incident, whether out of fear or ignorance or some other reason, until much later</span>.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">22 Although it could be argued that an accused person would be prejudiced if the time and date of the offence were not stated because he might otherwise be able to raise an alibi defence, this argument would still apply even if the charge were to state that the offence was committed, say, in a particular month of a particular year. <span class="font-italic">Such an argument, if valid, would mean that very few cases of sexual abuse against young victims would ever proceed to trial since young victims may not report sexual abuse immediately and their concept of time may be less reliable</span><span class="font-italic">…</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">231 What is “reasonably sufficient” must be seen in context. In this case, the proceeded charges specify a timeframe of 20 months for the charges relating to V1, and one year for the charges relating to V2. In addition, as the court in <span class="font-italic">DU </span>recognised, young victims’ concept of time may be less reliable.

</div> Given the Victims’ young age and the fact that the alleged offences occurred so long ago, I accept that the details provided in the proceeded charges are the most that can be gleaned from the evidence. Considering the circumstances in totality, I find that they are sufficient to give the accused notice of the offences in the proceeded charges. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">233 Even if the Defence’s case is taken at its highest, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, there were insufficient particulars in the proceeded charges, s 127 of the CPC provides that omissions in the charge shall not be regarded as material unless the accused had been misled by such errors or omissions. It is clear from the accused’s testimony that he was aware of the offences with which he was charged. There is no evidence to suggest that the accused was misled by the allegedly insufficient particulars in the proceeded charges.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The accused’s admission to the stood down charges</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">234 The Defence highlights that two of the stood down charges, namely the seventh charge and the eighth charge, are offences under s 354 of the Penal Code. The first, second, fifth and sixth charges are also offences under s 354 of the Penal Code. The Defence argues that having admitted to the seventh and eighth charges, there is no reason for the accused to not admit to the first, second, fifth and sixth charges if he did commit the offences under s 354 of the Penal Code.

</div> I have already considered this argument on the Victims’ reactions in relation to the specific charges and dismissed it as unfeasible (see [81], [85] and [130] above). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">241 I wish to highlight and reiterate that there is no archetypal or standard reaction to sexual assault. Attempts to conventionalise the behaviour of sexual assault victims as the Defence seeks to do have been roundly rejected by the Court of Appeal, for instance in <span class="font-italic">Yue Roger Jr v Public Prosecutor </span>[2019] 1 SLR 829 (“<span class="font-italic">Yue Roger Jr</span><span class="font-italic"> CA</span>”)<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [3]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The trial judge accepted the victim’s explanation for her behaviour, and he was sensitive to the fact that people react in different ways to sexual abuse, including compartmentalising or rationalising their reactions. The trial judge was also particularly sensitive to the fact that a child may react very differently from an adult. We agree with the trial judge’s assessment.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">242 The Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">BLV</span><span class="font-italic"> v Public Prosecutor</span> [2019] 2 SLR 726 at [57] also affirmed the trial judge’s findings that the court should not expect there to be “an archetypal victim of sexual abuse, or … any standard as to how a victim of sexual abuse should or should not have aspects of his or her life visibly affected by the abuse”. The Court of Appeal also highlighted the Child Guidance Clinic psychiatrist’s evidence that “many sexual assault victims presented a calm demeanour as part of a defence mechanism to distance themselves from the trauma of the abuse”, which fittingly describes the Victims in this case.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">243 The above pronouncements by the Court of Appeal are particularly relevant to the facts of this case, which concern the sexual exploitation of two very young victims by a parental figure in a position of power over them. The Victims’ evidence on their seeming acquiescence is strengthened by the following:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The Victims’ evidence that they did not struggle or protest is consistent with their own accounts of the various incidents:</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(i) V1’s testimony on her response was consistent across all her evidence regarding the incidents in the first, second and fifth charges (see [81], [85] and [98] above); and</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(ii) V2’s testimony that he did not struggle or protest during the incidents giving rise to the ninth, tenth and eleventh charges is consistent with his testimony that he was afraid of the accused when they lived together (see [130] above). V2 also said he did not wish to sour the relationship between PW1 and the accused. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Following from the above, the Victims’ evidence that they did not struggle or protest is consistent with each other’s evidence that they were afraid of the accused.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">244 Further, I find that the Victims’ seeming acquiescence to the sexual assaults is consistent with the Prosecution’s argument that the Victims were conditioned to the accused’s sexual abuse.

The court explained that, instead, the explanations proffered by the complainant for his or her delay in reporting the offences to the police are to be considered by the court in determining the impact of the delay, if any, on the credibility of the complainant. We would add that <span class="font-italic">the requirement of examining the reasons proffered by the complainant applies not only to the complainant’s delay in reporting the offences to the police, but also to any delay in disclosing the assault to anyone else, such as to his or her family members</span><span class="font-italic">.</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">256 These observations were echoed by the High Court in <span class="font-italic">Yue Roger</span><span class="font-italic"> Jr HC</span> at [32]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… A child or juvenile complainant may not be expected to complain if he or she feels vulnerable, or is otherwise focused on matters other than protecting his or her modesty.

The thought processes and concerns of a child or juvenile may also continue to evolve and permutate as he or she matures, such that it may be some time before he or she is in a position to complain.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">257 Having regard to all of the above, I am unable to agree with the Defence’s submissions. The fact that the Victims did not report the abuse for more than ten years should not be held against them in these circumstances. The Victims gave reasonable, plausible and internally consistent explanations for their silence (see [101]–[110] and [135] above). Both Victims also testified that they were afraid and felt unsafe to speak up. In V2’s case, V2 testified that he was afraid he would get “scolded or beaten up”.

This is, however, not the situation in the present case. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">260 Considering the circumstances and the Victims’ stated reasons, namely their very tender young ages at the time of the incidents and that they were afraid and had no one to turn to, their non-disclosure, taken in context, is reasonable and believable. The Victims’ non-disclosure cannot be distilled down to one singular reason. As I have noted previously at [101] and [257] above, the non-disclosure of the Victims was due to a complex mix of not solely fear, but also shame and discomfiture of the sexual acts that were done to them by the accused. This is also supported by the Victims’ own testimony that they felt ashamed by the incidents. When the Victims were young, they did not fully appreciate the accused’s sexual acts on them. V2 said he initially did not find it “weird” that the accused touched his penis as he “thought this was what fathers and sons did.”

</div> When the Victims became adults, they did not wish to relive the shameful and embarrassing sexual assaults. Moreover, the accused no longer lived with them and was out of their lives. They were prepared to bury the past until 12 December 2016 when V2 briefly informed PW1 of the sexual assaults and she insisted that the Victims report to the police. Otherwise, the accused’s wrongdoings would have continued to be hidden.

In assessing the supporting evidence, the question then is whether this supporting evidence makes up for the weakness in the complainant’s evidence.

This sufficiently disposes of the Defence’s argument that the Victims’ credibility is diminished purely on the grounds that their testimonies are uncorroborated. To accept the Defence’s argument would be to ignore the reality that many sexual offences are committed in circumstances in which corroboration is difficult if not impossible to obtain (<span class="font-italic">GCK</span> at [95]). The sole question is whether the Victims’ evidence met the “unusually convincing” threshold so as to sustain the conviction (<span class="font-italic">GDC </span>at [12] and [14]). I found at [115] and [144] that both Victims’ evidence meets the “unusually convincing” threshold.

The Defence also asserts that the Victims were children when the offences occurred. Taken together with the fact that the complaints were first raised more than a decade after the offences, there is a risk that the Victims had concocted their accounts.

</div> the Defence fails to show that the Victims or PW1 had the motive to falsely implicate the accused. On the contrary, I find that the Defence’s argument is decisively rebutted by the evidence and behaviour of the Victims. The Victims’ hesitance in making the police reports constitutes evidence that they were prepared to bury the past and bore no grudge against the accused. The Victims were not seeking vengeance against the accused for taking advantage of them when they were young and vulnerable. The accused, who in the eyes of the Victims was their father, had violated their innocence and destroyed their temple of virginity by his sexual assaults. Despite the horrible acts done to them, the Victims were prepared to let bygones be bygones. The Victims’ evidence is not a fabrication or an embellishment as the accused has admitted to some of the less serious sexual assaults. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">272 My findings in the preceding paragraph are supported by the objective circumstances under which the police reports were made in 2016.
