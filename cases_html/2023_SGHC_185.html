</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">5 Pursuant to the LFA, the claimant agreed to provide funding and project support services to the defendant and RelCo to pursue their claims against two companies, Co1 and Co2, respectively. Project support services included, among others, assisting the defendant and RelCo with commercial and strategic issues, assisting with the identification and retention of service providers, and facilitating any alternative dispute resolution process (<span class="font-italic">eg</span>, negotiations, discussions, mediation, conciliation). In exchange, the defendant and RelCo agreed that the claimant was entitled, strictly as a first priority, to receive certain amounts out of any settlement or judgment sum obtained. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">6 The present proceedings concerned only the defendant’s claim against Co1. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">7 On 4 March 2020, the defendant commenced arbitration proceedings against Co1 (the “Arbitration”). The tribunal issued a final award on 16 September 2021 in favour of the defendant (the “Final Award”). The claimant paid for the costs of the Arbitration pursuant to the LFA. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">8 On 14 October 2021, Co1 applied to the English High Court to set aside parts of the Final Award. The application was dismissed by the English High Court on 11 January 2022. The claimant funded the costs incurred by the defendant in defending Co1’s application. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">9 Co1 and the defendant subsequently entered into settlement negotiations. The parties exchanged drafts of the settlement agreements between July 2022 and September 2022. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">10 On or around 21 September 2022, the defendant’s solicitors sent a draft settlement agreement (the “Draft Settlement Agreement”) to Co1’s solicitors. The terms of the Draft Settlement Agreement provided that Co1 would pay an agreed sum to the defendant in instalments. By an email dated 22 September 2022, Co1 agreed to the terms of the Draft Settlement Agreement. The claimant also agreed that the terms of the Draft Settlement Agreement were acceptable and appropriate. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">11 However, on 26 September 2022, the defendant informed the claimant that it would not enter the Draft Settlement Agreement unless the claimant was prepared to share the first instalment payment with the defendant. The claimant did not agree to the defendant’s proposal.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">12 On 11 October 2022, the claimant wrote to the defendant putting it on notice that its failure to promptly execute the Draft Settlement Agreement was a breach of the terms of the LFA, including General Term (“GT”) 4.1, which provided that the defendant must act in good faith in respect of its obligations to the claimant.

</div> The defendant explained that the commercial rationale for accepting the proposed instalment payment plan had evaporated, in light of its difficult financial predicament in the preceding few months. The defendant expressed its concern that under the instalment payment plan, it would not recover anything until the final tranche payment and that the risk of Co1 defaulting on that final payment was high. The defendant denied that it had committed an event of default under the LFA. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The dispute between the parties</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">14 Specific Term (“ST”) 3.3 of the LFA provided a mechanism for resolving disagreements between the claimant and the defendant over whether to agree to a settlement of the defendant’s claim against Co1. The first step involved the defendant’s lawyers providing a written opinion as to whether the proposed settlement was fair and reasonable. If the claimant and the defendant still could not resolve their disagreement, an independent counsel (either agreed between the parties or appointed by the “President of the Singapore Bar Association”) would provide a written opinion as to whether the proposed settlement was fair and reasonable. Under ST 3.4 of the LFA, the opinion of counsel instructed under ST 3 would be “final and binding” on the claimant and the defendant. The full text of ST 3.3 and ST 3.4 are set out in [26] below.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">15 According to the claimant, it was agreed on 20 October 2022 that pursuant to ST 3.3 of the LFA, the defendant’s lawyers would prepare a written opinion on whether the Draft Settlement Agreement was fair and reasonable. The defendant denied any such agreement. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">16 It was not disputed that the defendant’s lawyers did commence preparing an opinion as to whether the Draft Settlement Agreement was fair and reasonable. However, the defendant claimed that although its lawyers had commenced work on the written opinion, they were simultaneously advising the defendant as to whether the dispute resolution mechanism in ST 3.3 even applied. An email dated 21 November 2022 from the defendant’s lawyers to the claimant stated that the defendant had taken legal advice and that it was not required under ST 3.3 to instruct its lawyers to opine on whether the Draft Settlement Agreement was fair and reasonable.

</div>
</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">17 In summary, the defendant’s reasons for its position that ST 3.3 and ST 3.4 did not apply to the Draft Settlement Agreement were as follows:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) ST 3.3 and ST 3.4 concerned the settlement of “Claims” or “Proceedings”, which (as defined) would include recognition and enforcement proceedings only if the claimant had agreed to fund such proceedings in accordance with the terms of the LFA.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The Draft Settlement Agreement did not relate to the defendant’s claim against Co1 but related to the enforcement of the Final Award against Co1. It fell within the meaning of “Proceedings” only if the claimant had agreed to fund the enforcement proceedings in accordance with the terms of the LFA. Pursuant to GT 8.1 and GT 8.2 of the LFA, the claimant had to notify the defendant and its lawyers in writing that it was prepared to fund the enforcement proceedings. The claimant did not give any such notice to the defendant and its lawyers. Consequently, the Draft Settlement Agreement was not a settlement of “the Proceedings” within the meaning of ST 3.3. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">18 The claimant disagreed with the defendant and on 2 March 2023, the claimant filed OA 189 seeking, in substance, specific performance of ST 3.3. The claimant sought, among others, the following orders: </div><div class="mb-3"><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(a) The defendant to jointly (with the claimant) instruct an independent counsel to be agreed or otherwise to be appointed by the President of the Law Society of Singapore to provide his or her written opinion within seven (7) days from appointment as to whether the terms of the Draft Settlement Agreement were fair and reasonable in the circumstances. </div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(b) The defendant to take all necessary steps to execute the Draft Settlement Agreement if the independent counsel’s opinion is that the Draft Settlement Agreement was fair and reasonable. </div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(c) The defendant to disclose to the claimant’s solicitors, within seven (7) days of the Order to be made herein, the identity, address, and the contact details of the defendant’s secured creditors in order for a copy of the Order to be made herein to be served on the Creditors. </div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">19 On 27 March 2023, the defendant filed HC/SUM 860/2023 (“SUM 860”) for a stay of the whole action in OA 189 in favour of arbitration, pursuant to s 6 of the IAA or the court’s inherent powers of case management. The defendant relied on the arbitration agreement under GT 14 of the LFA. GT 14.1 provided that any dispute arising out of the LFA “which is not subject to Specific Term 3.3 and 3.4” must be resolved in accordance with GT 14. GT 14 provided for disputes to be resolved by way of good faith endeavours, mediation (if the parties so agree), and arbitration (if the dispute remained unresolved). The relevant provisions of GT 14 are set out in full in [25] below. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">20 On 12 April 2023, the AR dismissed the defendant’s application for a stay of proceedings. The issue before the AR was whether the anterior question as to whether ST 3.3 and ST 3.4 applied to the Draft Settlement Agreement fell within the scope of GT 14 or whether it had been carved out from GT 14. The AR held that the dispute as to whether the defendant should be compelled to obtain a written opinion from its lawyers in accordance with ST 3 had been carved out from the arbitration agreement in GT 14. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">21 On 18 April 2023, the defendant lodged the present appeal against the AR’s decision. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The law applicable to a stay application under s 6 of the IAA </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">22 A court hearing a stay application under s 6 of the IAA should grant a stay in favour of arbitration if the applicant is able to establish a <span class="font-italic">prima facie </span>case that: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) there is a valid arbitration agreement between the parties to the court proceedings; </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) the dispute in the court proceedings (or any part thereof) falls within the scope of the arbitration agreement; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) the arbitration agreement is not null and void, inoperative or incapable of being performed. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">Tomolugen</span><span class="font-italic"> Holdings Ltd and another v Silica Investors Ltd and other appeals </span>[2016] 1 SLR 373 at [63])</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">23 It was not contested that there was a valid arbitration agreement between the parties under GT 14 of the LFA, and that such arbitration agreement was not defective. The sole question before me was whether the defendant had established a <span class="font-italic">prima facie </span>case that the dispute in OA 189 fell within the scope of the arbitration agreement in GT 14. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Whether the dispute in OA 189 fell within the scope of the arbitration agreement in GT 14</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 The dispute in OA 189 was whether the claimant was entitled to enforce ST 3.3 and ST 3.4 with respect to the Draft Settlement Agreement. More specifically, the parties disagreed on the anterior question as to whether ST 3.3 and ST 3.4 were applicable to the Draft Settlement Agreement on the facts of this case. Thus, the specific question before me was whether the dispute as to whether ST 3.3 and ST 3.4 applied to the Draft Settlement Agreement fell within the scope of the arbitration agreement in GT 14.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 GT 14 of the LFA provided as follows: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">GENERAL TERM 14. DISPUTE RESOLUTION</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">14.1. Any dispute, controversy or claim in relation to or arising out of this Agreement, including any question about its existence, validity, meaning, performance or termination or the rights, duties and liabilities of any party to it and <span class="font-italic">which is not subject to Specific Term 3.3 and 3.4</span> (<span class="font-weight-bold">Dispute</span>) must be resolved in accordance with this General Term 14. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">14.2. If any party wishes to raise a Dispute then that party must promptly give a written notice of the Dispute to the other Party (<span class="font-weight-bold">Notice</span>). …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">14.4. The parties agree to meet to discuss, and endeavour in good faith to resolve, the Dispute within 28 days of the Notice being received.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">14.5. The parties may agree, within the time period referred to in General Term 14.4, to submit the Dispute to mediation …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">14.6. If the Dispute is not resolved within 28 days of the Notice being received (or if the parties have agreed in writing to mediate, within 70 days of the Notice being received), then either party may issue a notice referring the Dispute to arbitration. …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added in italics]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 ST 3.3 and ST 3.4 provided as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">SPECIFIC TERM 3. [CLAIMANT’S] INVOLVEMENT</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">3.3. In recognition of the fact that [the claimant] has an interest in the Resolution Sum, if the [defendant]: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">3.3.1. wants to Settle the Claims or the Proceedings for less than [the claimant] considers appropriate;

GT 18.1 contemplated that disagreements relating to ST 3.3 and ST 3.4 of the LFA should be submitted to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Singapore courts. This interpretation was consistent with the parties’ intention that disputes subject to ST 3.3 and ST 3.4 should be determined quickly without the need to go through the lengthy dispute resolution mechanism set out under GT 14.

</div></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">My decision</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 I agreed with the defendant that, as a matter of interpretation, a dispute as to whether ST 3.3 and ST 3.4 were even engaged was not a dispute that was “subject to ST 3.3 and 3.4”. In my view, the defendant had shown a <span class="font-italic">prima facie </span>case that such a dispute was not carved out from GT 14 and therefore fell within the scope of GT 14. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 ST 3.3 and ST 3.4 dealt with differences of opinion between the claimant and the defendant over whether to “Settle” a “Claim” or “Proceeding”. The resolution of these differences of opinion were carved out from GT 14 because parties intended that these differences should be resolved in the specific manner set out in ST 3.3 and ST 3.4, namely by way of a written opinion from the defendant’s lawyers, and if the claimant and the defendant still disagreed, by way of a written opinion from the independent counsel. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 However, the question as to whether ST 3.3 and ST 3.4 were even engaged in the first place was a separate and distinct one. Only disputes that were “subject to ST 3.3 and 3.4” were carved out from GT 14. In its ordinary meaning, a dispute that was “subject to ST 3.3 and 3.4” referred to a dispute over whether to “Settle the Claims or the Proceedings”. A dispute that was “subject to ST 3.3 and 3.4” presupposed that ST 3.3 and ST 3.4 were applicable in the first place. It did not and could not refer to a dispute over whether ST 3.3 and ST 3.4 were applicable. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 The claimant submitted that any dispute “subject to Specific Term 3.3 and 3.4” meant any dispute <span class="font-italic">relating to </span>ST 3.3 and ST 3.4. In my view, such an interpretation would require rewriting ST 3.3 and ST 3.4. This was clearly impermissible.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 In my view, the claimant’s reliance on GT 18.1 was misplaced. Parties to an agreement could decide to have certain types of disputes resolved by arbitration and others by litigation; so long as the agreement evinces such an intention, that intention should be given effect to: <span class="font-italic">Silverlink Resorts Ltd v MS First Capital Insurance Ltd </span>[2021] 3 SLR 1422 at [31]–[32]. Where parties evince a real intention to have matters resolved by arbitration, the court ought to give effect to that intention: <span class="font-italic">BXH v BXI </span>[2020] 1 SLR 1043 (“<span class="font-italic">BXH</span>”) at [60]. Ultimately, the question is one of interpretation of the relevant clauses in the agreement.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 In the present case, GT 18.1 was expressed to be “subject to General Term 14” (see [28(b)] above). Clearly, GT 18.1 was not intended to apply to disputes that fell within the scope of GT 14. The question remained whether a dispute as to whether ST 3.3 and ST 3.4 applied to the Draft Settlement Agreement fell within GT 14. GT 14 applied to “[a]ny dispute, controversy or claim in relation to or arising out of [the LFA]” and excluded only disputes that were “subject to ST 3.3 and 3.4”. The dispute as to whether ST 3.3 and ST 3.4 applied to the Draft Settlement Agreement was a dispute arising out of the LFA. That dispute therefore fell squarely within GT 14 unless it could be said to fall within the carve-out (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, that it was a dispute that was “subject to ST 3.3 and 3.4”). For reasons given in [36] above, such a dispute was not a dispute that was “subject to ST 3.3 and 3.4” and therefore was not carved out from GT 14. In the circumstances, GT 18.1 had no application. GT 18.1 should be interpreted to mean that disputes arising out of any arbitration commenced pursuant to GT 14 are to be resolved in the Singapore courts in the exercise of their supervisory jurisdiction: <span class="font-italic">BXH </span>at [59]–[60]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 The fact that ST 3.3 and ST 3.4 contemplated the speedy resolution of differences of opinion as to the settlement of claims or proceedings was neither here nor there and did not assist the claimant’s case. It begged the question as to whether ST 3.3 and ST 3.4 were even applicable in the first place. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 As for the fact that the defendant’s lawyers had commenced preparing the opinion pursuant to ST 3.3, in my view, the most that could be said was that the defendant was prepared at some point in time to commence the process under ST 3.3 but changed its mind after taking legal advice on the applicability of ST 3.3 and ST 3.4. This court still had to interpret the term “subject to ST 3.3 and 3.4” and decide whether a dispute as to whether ST 3.3 and ST 3.4 were applicable was a dispute that was “subject to ST 3.3 and 3.4”.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 Finally, I did not think that <span class="font-italic">Seeley </span>and <span class="font-italic">Maxx </span>assisted the claimant’s case. Those cases concerned the interpretation of the specific provisions that were before the court. In <span class="font-italic">Seeley</span>, the court declined the application to stay the proceedings because it was of the view that the parties had not agreed to submit the claim in question to arbitration (at [38]). The court was of the view that the parties’ agreement was to treat disputes to which cl 20.3 referred differently from the regime for arbitration (at [32]). In <span class="font-italic">Maxx</span>, the court found that on its plain wording, cl 54 imposed a legal obligation on the parties to refer their dispute to mediation, if negotiations failed (at [15]). Ultimately, I had to interpret the arbitration agreement in GT 14, specifically, the meaning of a dispute that was “subject to ST 3.3 and 3.4”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 Further, in <span class="font-italic">Seeley</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>(at [19]), the respondent submitted that cl 20.3 of the exclusive distribution agreement did not expressly refer to injunctive or declaratory relief being granted by a court but merely made it clear that an arbitrator may grant such relief. The respondent further submitted that cl 20 of the exclusive distribution agreement amounted to an arbitration agreement in respect of the matters in issue between the parties. The court rejected the respondent’s submissions. The court found (at [32]) that the parties’ agreement was to treat disputes to which cl 20.3 referred differently from the regime for arbitration. The court interpreted cl 20.3 to mean that it was part of the bargain between the parties as to how their disputes should be resolved where there was a threatened breach (encompassing conduct which one party asserted amounted to a breach and the other did not), a material breach or an <span class="font-italic">asserted </span>material breach (at [31]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 <span class="font-italic">Seeley</span> is quite different from the present case. In <span class="font-italic">Seeley, </span>the court found that disputes to which cl 20.3 referred were carved out from the arbitration agreement. The court’s view was that cl 20.3 was applicable where there was a threatened breach (encompassing conduct which one party asserted amounted to a breach) and also where there was a material breach or an <span class="font-italic">asserted</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>material<span class="font-italic"> </span>breach. In other words, the court’s interpretation of cl 20.3 meant that cl 20.3 applied even though the threatened breach or material breach were disputed<span class="font-italic">. </span><span class="font-italic">Seeley</span> is not authority for the claimant’s submission that where a contract contains a clear carve out from the arbitration mechanism in certain circumstances, the carve out would naturally encompass any dispute over whether the said circumstances apply.

</div>
</div> It is a matter of interpretation of the relevant provision in each case. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 In the present case, it was not disputed that only disputes that were “subject to ST 3.3 and 3.4” were carved out from the arbitration agreement in GT 14. The only disputes that were “subject to ST 3.3 and 3.4” were disputes over whether a proposed settlement should be accepted and did not include disputes over whether ST 3.3 and ST 3.4 were applicable to the proposed settlement (see [36] and [39] above). Thus, the dispute as to whether ST 3.3 and ST 3.4 applied to the Draft Settlement Agreement was not carved out from, and instead fell squarely within, the arbitration agreement. Indeed, if the claimant’s submission (that a carve out in certain circumstances would encompass disputes over whether the circumstances apply) was correct, that would have meant that the question as to whether ST 3.3 and ST 3.4 applied to the Draft Settlement Agreement would have been subject to the dispute resolution mechanism in ST 3.3 and ST 3.4. Clearly, that could not have been the parties’ intention and neither was it the claimant’s case.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 In any event, the court in <span class="font-italic">Seeley</span> noted (at [31]) that clearly, the dispute concerned what may be a material breach and the respondent did not contend to the contrary. The question as to whether cl 20.3 was engaged was therefore not an issue before the court.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 As for <span class="font-italic">Maxx</span>, the applicant’s case was not that parties had to mediate before commencing arbitration but that parties had to refer the dispute to both mediation and arbitration, so long as arbitration had not been concluded (see <span class="font-italic">Maxx</span> at [7]). The issue before the court was thus simply whether there was a legal obligation to mediate. The issue before the court was not whether the question as to whether there was a legal obligation to mediate had to be decided by arbitration.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 For the reasons above, I concluded that the underlying dispute in OA 189 was whether ST 3.3 and ST 3.4 were engaged in the circumstances. This was not a dispute that was “subject to ST 3.3 and 3.4” and thus was not carved out from GT 14. Instead, the dispute fell within the scope of the arbitration agreement in GT 14. Therefore, I allowed the appeal and ordered that OA 189 be stayed pursuant to s 6 of the IAA.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 I made the following orders on costs: </div><div class="mb-3"><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(a) The claimant was to pay the defendant’s costs of SUM 860 fixed at $10,391 (inclusive of disbursements); and</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(b) The claimant was to pay the defendant’s costs of RA 77 fixed at $10,750.80 (inclusive of disbursements). </div></div><table class="table table-sm table-borderless"><tbody><tr><td><div class="txt-body text-left">Chua Lee Ming<br/>Judge of the High Court</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-left"></div></td></tr></tbody></table><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Vergis S Abraham SC, Zhuo Jiaxiang and Veluri Hari (Providence Law Asia LLC) for the claimant;</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Aw Hon Wei, Adrian and Anand Shankar Tiwari s/o Sivakant Tiwari (Resource Law LLC) for the defendant. </div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"></div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
