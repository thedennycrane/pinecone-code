</div> It is apparent that many aluminium and/or metal sheets were also stored horizontally (lying flat) on stacked pallets elsewhere at the Site, arranged according to thickness. It also appears that aluminium sheets that were more than a certain thickness and accordingly which were especially heavy were always stored flat on account of their weight.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">14 Lim, who was present at the Site along with the Plaintiff and both sides’ counsel, demonstrated how a forklift could be used to provide support so that individual sheets could be retrieved from the balance stack more safely. In brief, the forklift could be “parked” in close proximity to the balance stack. The worker could then flip the aluminium sheets so that they rested or leaned against the body of the forklift whilst he was searching for the sheet that was required. The body of the forklift was essentially being used to support the aluminium sheets. Lim’s evidence was that he had informed the Plaintiff (and Hassan) that this was the proper way to support the aluminium sheets in the balance stack during flipping.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">15 Although Hassan was slated to testify as a witness for the Defendant on the second day of the trial, he was unable to attend court as he was hospitalised in Malaysia.

Lim testified that its employees had been clearly instructed to use a forklift to support the weight of the balance stack when flipping through it to look for aluminium sheets, and not to use their bare hands to support the weight of the sheets. The Defendant further contends that the use of a safety rack was impractical especially given the size of the aluminium sheets in question, and that the use of such safety racks is not common industry practice. Even if it is found to be negligent, the Defendant argues that the Plaintiff was contributorily negligent, such that the amount of damages recoverable is to be reduced according to the Plaintiff’s responsibility for the damage. In the Defendant’s view, an ordinary prudent person who was well aware of the weight of the stack and with the Plaintiff’s experience would not have attempted to support the aluminium sheets with his bare hands.

</div> However, I do not find these points to be of much significance to the trial on liability. I simply note that I accept that although Lim was not the one who had asked Hassan to retrieve the aluminium sheet in question, Hassan had done so as part of his work for the Defendant. I also accept that that a significant weight had fallen on the Plaintiff such as to cause his injuries. Although it appears that the stack would indeed weigh about a tonne or 900kg, not all of this weight fell squarely onto the Plaintiff’s body. The aluminium sheets were partly in contact with the ground. It would thus be difficult to determine the exact weight that fell on the Plaintiff, or the force or pressure exerted upon him. In any event, this is not an issue that is of much relevance to the present analysis.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Whether the Defendant was negligent</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">20 I shall begin with the main question of whether the Defendant was negligent.

The framework of the WSHA and its accompanying regulations intersects with the tort of negligence at the first two stages of this inquiry.

It was clearly unsafe for the balance stack of aluminium sheets to be leaned against the wall in such a manner, without any supporting structure or rack that could prevent or minimise the likelihood of an accident occurring while an individual sheet was being retrieved. This is especially so as the aluminium sheet required might be found in the middle of the stack or indeed it could be one of the last sheets in the stack.  The sheets were heavy and bulky, and their weight would certainly (in the sense that it was reasonably foreseeable) overwhelm a worker trying to support too many sheets with just his bare hands or body. The parties did not dispute that the function of the metal clamps present at the time of the accident (see [13] above) was not to prevent the stack from falling while someone was flipping through the stack.

</div> The clamps were simply used to hold the aluminium sheets in place as they leaned against the wall as described at [7] and [13] above.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 I agree with the Plaintiff that a safety rack designed to hold and support the aluminium sheets when stored and when individual sheets were being retrieved would have been a much safer way to store the loose aluminium sheets. Although Lim was sceptical about the practicality and effectiveness of the safety rack envisioned by the Plaintiff, which had a front bar to prevent upright sheets from toppling forward and to provide support, he conceded that it would at least have been possible to design and weld other more effective safety racks. For instance, a rack could store the sheets by placing them flat, much like the other sheets that were placed flat and horizontally on the pallets at the Site.

</div>, which has always been the practice according to the Defendant. In any case, even if a worker used the method demonstrated by Lim, a worker might still suffer cuts to his hands from the edges of the aluminium sheets as he flipped through the stack and extracted the required sheet. In any case, it does not appear to me that it would have been too cost-prohibitive for the Defendant to have acquired or designed or customised and welded a rack to fit its needs, especially given that this concerned the safety of its employees. Indeed, I note that there are many manufacturers and suppliers of racks and support stands for metal sheets in Singapore. Indeed, on the first day of the hearing, photographs of safety racks were introduced by the Plaintiff without objection from Defence counsel.

</div> As mentioned earlier, this was demonstrated to me during my visit of the Site. This entailed a worker driving the forklift to the front of the balance stack, and then flipping aluminium sheets onto the side of the forklift’s body. Essentially, any sufficiently sturdy object, such as a forklift or a bar of a safety rack, could fulfil this function.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 Although I accept that it is possible to use a forklift in such a “creative manner” and that the Plaintiff was aware that this method would have been much safer than using his hands or body to support the weight of the sheets, this nonetheless struck me as being a rather makeshift and temporary way of addressing the problem. It does not seem to me that it is accepted practice to use the body of the forklift to provide support for heavy objects to lean on or against. Indeed, the Plaintiff testified that he had not been taught this during his forklift operator course.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 Most importantly, despite its instructions, the Defendant must have expected or foreseen that its employees might be tempted, especially when facing time pressures to get their deliveries ready, to avoid going through the process of finding a forklift and driving the forklift over so that it could be used as support whilst the worker tried to find and retrieve a sheet from the balance stack. Indeed, whilst it is accepted that there was a forklift at the premises, it is unclear whether the forklift was nearby at the time.  Even though Lim’s evidence was that he did not know exactly when the drivers would set off to make deliveries after loading the lorries, there is little doubt that it was important that deliveries left the premises on time to reach customers. As the Court of Appeal articulated in <span class="font-italic">Parno v SC Marine Pte Ltd</span> [1993] 3 SLR(R) 377 (“<span class="font-italic">Parno</span>”) at [46], “[i]n devising a safe system, the employer should be aware that workmen are often careless for their own safety, and his system must, as far as possible, reduce the effects of an employee’s own carelessness”. It is upon employers such as the Defendant to ensure that they have taken all reasonable care to prevent accidents, even ones that could arise in part due to their employees’ lack of caution.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 In the context of the WSHA framework, the Defendant’s failure to have a proper safety rack/structure or work procedures in place to safely store and support the balance aluminium sheets amounts to a breach of reg 24(1)(<span class="font-italic">d</span>) of the General Provisions Regulations, under which the sheets should have been “stored, stacked or placed... in such manner, and using such supporting structures as may be necessary, to ensure [their] stability, and to prevent [their] collapse”. It also amounts to a breach of the Defendant’s duty to “take all reasonably practicable steps” to eliminate or minimise “any foreseeable risk” under reg 4 of the Risk Management Regulations.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 More broadly, the Defendant’s conduct fell below the standard of reasonable care for its employees’ safety. As there is no dispute that the Plaintiff suffered injuries that were caused by the accident, I find that all of the elements of the Plaintiff’s negligence claim have been met.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 Although the Plaintiff raised the issues of the Defendant’s liability as an occupier of the site and its vicarious liability over purportedly negligent acts by Hassan and/or Lim, I note that the parties’ submissions focused mainly on the Defendant’s duty to the Plaintiff as his employer. As I have found the existence and breach of a duty of care on the latter basis, there is no need for me to consider the parties’ cases on occupier’s liability and vicarious liability. In any case, it is undisputed that Lim is a director of the Defendant. It is also clear that Lim was the supervisor at the premises.

Contributory negligence is a statutory concept encapsulated in s 3(1) of the Contributory Negligence and Personal Injuries Act (Cap 54, 2002 Rev Ed), which provides:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Apportionment of liability in case of contributory negligence</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">3.</span>—(1) Where any person suffers damage as the result partly of his own fault and partly of the fault of any other person or persons, a claim in respect of that damage shall not be defeated by reason of the fault of the person suffering the damage, but the damages recoverable in respect thereof shall be reduced to such extent as the court thinks just and equitable having regard to the claimant’s share in the responsibility for the damage.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 In other words, contributory negligence provides a partial defence to a defendant who has been found negligent by reducing the quantum of damages payable to a claimant who has failed to take due care for his own safety and thus caused loss to himself (<span class="font-italic">Asnah bte Ab Rahman v Li Jianlin</span> [2016] 2 SLR 944 (“<span class="font-italic">Asnah</span>”) at [18]). As the Court of Appeal further stated in <span class="font-italic">Asnah</span>, “[a] person is guilty of contributory negligence if he ought to have objectively foreseen that his failure to act prudently could result in hurting himself and failed to take reasonable measures to guard against that foreseeable harm” (at [18]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 As with the standard of care in negligence, the standard expected of the claimant is measured against a person of ordinary prudence (<span class="font-italic">Asnah </span>at [20]). There is no need for the defendant to show that a claimant has breached a legal duty of care, as is necessary in a claim for negligence (<span class="font-italic">Asnah </span>at [19]; <span class="font-italic">Chen Qiangshi</span> at [204]). The defendant must nonetheless show that the claimant owes himself a duty to take care of his own safety in the prevailing circumstances of the case (<span class="font-italic">Asnah </span>at [19]).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Cases cited</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 The parties cited a number of cases on contributory negligence in the context of workplace accidents in their written submissions, and I will briefly examine them here.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 The Defendant cited <span class="font-italic">Sim Cheng Soon v BT Engineering </span><span class="font-italic">Pte Ltd and another</span> [2007] 1 SLR(R) 148 (“<span class="font-italic">Sim Cheng Soon</span>”). The appellant in that case was an experienced welder who suffered injuries after falling through an uncovered and unfenced opening in a working platform. The Court of Appeal held that the respondents were liable in negligence, but also found that the appellant was contributorily negligent in failing to observe the ordinary care which an ordinary prudent person would have taken for his own safety. The Court of Appeal observed that the immediate cause of the accident was the appellant’s failure to look at where he was going (at [40]). There was enough natural lighting and the appellant was familiar with the layout of the area (at [39]). The appellant was thus held to have been more blameworthy than the respondents as employer and occupier of the site, and the Court of Appeal apportioned liability at 40% to the respondents and 60% to the appellant by way of contributory negligence (at [40]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 Next, the Defendant cited <span class="font-italic">Parno</span>, a case in which the appellant was an experienced rigger who had been tasked to monitor the condition of a piling hammer. Upon noticing that a pin on the hammer had come loose, the appellant sought to rectify the situation by approaching the hammer to replace the pin. While he was doing so, his co-workers lowered a heavy piece of equipment and struck him. It was not disputed that the appellant knew that he should not have approached the hammer before the starter had come down. The Court of Appeal found the respondent negligent due to,<span class="font-italic"> inter alia</span>, the defective system of communication that the respondent had in place, inadequate instructions given to and supervision of the appellant, and inadequate inspection and maintenance of the piling machinery (at [49]–[55]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 While the trial judge in <span class="font-italic">Parno</span> had apportioned the responsibility in the proportion of 75:25 in favour of the respondent, the Court of Appeal reapportioned liability in the proportion of one-third to the appellant and two-thirds to the respondent (at [71]). The Court of Appeal found that the trial judge had significantly underestimated the degree of negligence on the respondent’s part while substantially misjudging the degree of blame on the appellant’s part when there was no “deliberate act of folly” but “only a momentary lapse” on his part (at [65] and [70]). The Court of Appeal reiterated the following at [66]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">In any event, it should be borne in mind that it was the respondent’s defective work system which provided the setting for the occurrence of the accident in the first place. The whole object of the law imposing a duty on employers to provide a safe system of work is precisely to protect an employee from his own inadvertence or carelessness.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 The Defendant also cited two cases for the proposition that the courts have generally apportioned liability equally in situations where the relative blameworthiness of the parties is uncertain:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) <span class="font-italic">Xu Ren Li v Nakano Singapore (Pte) Ltd</span> [2012] 1 SLR 729 (“<span class="font-italic">Xu Ren Li</span>”) was an appeal against a District Court decision in which the appellant was a construction worker employed by the respondent. The appellant was using a staircase in an uncompleted building when he lost his balance and fell. Chan Sek Keong CJ observed that the appellant had used the staircases in the building many times in the course of his work and ought to have been aware that they were in an incomplete state of construction and that there was minimal lighting at the staircases. Instead, the appellant had rushed down the stairs. However, “it was difficult to determine which party was more at fault” based on the limited evidence available, and Chan CJ apportioned liability equally between the parties.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) In <span class="font-italic">See Toh Siew Kee v Ho Ah Lam Ferrocement (Pte) Ltd and others </span>[2013] 3 SLR 284 (“<span class="font-italic">See Toh Siew Kee</span>”), the appellant was a service engineer who was injured by a crane barge’s fouled mooring wire. The Court of Appeal found that the combined negligence of the plaintiff and the third respondent had contributed to the accident, but was unable to say which party was more culpable. V K Rajah JA remarked at [111] that the actions of these two parties were “<span class="font-italic">causae sine quibus non</span> – in other words, the accident would not have happened but for the actions of both.” The Court of Appeal apportioned liability equally between the plaintiff and the third respondent.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 The Plaintiff cited the following cases in which the courts held the respective defendants fully liable in negligence:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) <span class="font-italic">Liu Yong Tao v Rich Construction Pte Ltd formerly known as China Construction Builders Pte</span> <span class="font-italic">Ltd</span> [2011] SGDC 207 (“<span class="font-italic">Liu Yong Tao</span>”) was a District Court decision in which the plaintiff was a construction worker who had been employed by the defendant. The plaintiff was injured after his co-worker accidentally knocked him, causing a metal plank which the plaintiff was carrying to drop onto his left hand. The defendant argued that the plaintiff had been contributorily negligent by failing to grip the metal formwork properly according to safety procedures, but failed to adduce any evidence to support this allegation (at [11]). The court thus found the defendant fully liable (at [21]).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) In <span class="font-italic">Soon Pook Seng Arthur v Oceaneering International Sdn Bhd</span> [1993] 2 SLR(R) 518 (“<span class="font-italic">Arthur Soon</span>”), the plaintiff and his co-workers were moving a cabinet using trolleys when one of the trolley’s wheels got stuck. While the plaintiff was investigating the cause, one or more of his co-workers withdrew support of the cabinet which fell onto the plaintiff. G P Selvam JC (as he then was) held that the withdrawal of support without regard to the plaintiff’s safety was a negligent act which caused injury to the plaintiff, and held the defendant solely liable (at [26]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 Finally, in <span class="font-italic">Chen Qiangshi</span>, the plaintiff was an experienced rebar construction worker who was severely injured when an incorrectly-positioned and improperly-rigged rebar cage collapsed on him as it was about to be lifted by a tower crane. The plaintiff was found to have rigged up the rebar cage in an improper and unsafe manner, and to have released the remaining wire ties holding the rebar cage (at [207]). The Court of Appeal affirmed these findings of fact and the finding of negligence against the defendants, but adjusted the plaintiff’s share of liability for contributory negligence from 50% to 20%. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 Although the Court of Appeal in the <span class="font-italic">Chen Qiangshi</span> case did not issue any written grounds, it noted three factors for this adjustment at the hearing. The first two factors were specific to the facts of the case – that the rigger must have appreciated that the rebar cage had not been properly done, and that it was known to everyone that the plaintiff was not a qualified rigger and should not have been asked to do the rigging in the first place. Finally, the Court of Appeal observed:
