<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       This is an appeal concerning the question
                    whether losses caused to a company by a fraudulent director (“the
                    Ex-MD”) are deductible for income tax purposes under section 14(1) of the
                    Income Tax Act (Cap 134, 2008 Rev Ed) (“the Act”). The Ex-MD had
                    misappropriated company funds and caused the appellant to incur a loss of
                    $12,272,917 (“the Loss”). A few years after the Loss, the
                    appellant lodged a claim with the respondent seeking relief for the Loss under
                    section 93A of the Act. The respondent rejected the appellant’s
                    claim.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       After hearing the parties and considering the
                    evidence and the submissions, I now dismiss the appeal. I will set out the
                    reasons for my decision after the outline of the relevant facts and the decision
                    from which this appeal arises.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Facts</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Background</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       The appellant is a company incorporated in
                    Singapore. It began as a sole proprietorship established by the founder,
                    Mr B (“the Founder”) in 1956. It was initially involved in
                    the trading of re-conditioned bearing products before becoming distributors of
                    bearings and seals. In 1973, the sole proprietorship was incorporated as a
                    company. On 10 November 1995, it was listed on SESDAQ. On 2 February
                    1998, it was upgraded to the SGX Main Board.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       Among the children of the Founder who took over
                    the management of the appellant was the youngest son Mr C (“the
                    Ex-MD”). The Ex-MD entered into a service agreement with the appellant to
                    hold office as Managing Director for three years commencing on 20 October
                    1995. The service agreement was renewed for a further term of three years from
                    20 October 1998. At all material times, he also served as a member of the
                    Board of Directors.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       On 1 December 1999, the Ex-MD was dismissed as
                    both Director and Managing Director for misappropriation of the company’s
                    funds as revealed by the investigations of the Commercial Affairs Department
                    (“CAD”). The Ex-MD was charged and tried in the District
                    Court.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The conviction of the Ex-MD</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       In <em>Public Prosecutor v Kwek
                        Chee Tong</em> in DAC 48461/99 (“<em>PP v
                        KCT</em>”), the District Judge (“the DJ”)
                    convicted the Ex-MD of 24 charges of criminal breach of trust under section 409
                    of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 1985 Rev Ed) and sentenced him to a term of
                    nine years in prison.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       During the trial, it was revealed that the
                    Ex-MD’s <em>modus operandi</em> was to make out false
                    purchase orders to the appellant’s suppliers for the purchase of bearings,
                    the appellant’s stock in trade. Based on these false purchase orders,
                    several cheques were issued to him or his nominees on his claim that he had
                    advanced money from his personal account to the appellant to make the purchases.
                    He also falsely claimed that he had made loans to the appellant’s
                    customers for their purchases against which he reimbursed himself from the
                    appellant’s funds.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       In reality, the Ex-MD used the misappropriated
                    company funds to pay for his gambling debts and for personal use (at [151]). The
                    DJ found at [284] that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The evidence revealed that no one questioned [the Ex-MD’s]
                        instructions. There was total trust reposed in the accused by virtue of his
                        senior management position. In evidence he said that he need not have to
                        tell anyone about, and (as a fact) he had complete control over, the usage
                        of [the appellant’s] funds. He had access to millions of dollars as
                        [the appellant] was a public listed company at the material time.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       The DJ also considered the following aggravating
                    factor at [288]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">There was another aggravating factor: the blatant way in which the monies
                        were siphoned from the company, some in the form of cash cheques, others as
                        company cheques, made out directly in the names of or given to, junket
                        operators, or individuals with no trade dealings with [the appellant]. In
                        most instances the company’s funds were used to repay the
                        accused’s gambling debts and feed his gambling habit. The effect on
                        the victim company (as well as the financial market) would be an erosion of
                        confidence.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The actions leading to the current proceedings</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     After the Ex-MD’s misappropriation came
                    to light, the appellant made provisions for doubtful debts of $12,410,141
                    inclusive of the Loss in its statutory accounts under Extraordinary items for
                    the year ended 31 December 1999. However, no claim for deduction for the
                    Loss was made for the Year of Assessment 2000 (“YA
                2000”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     In 2003, the appellant instituted legal
                    proceedings against the Ex-MD for the amount misappropriated and obtained
                    judgment against him. However, recovery proved fruitless and the Ex-MD was
                    subsequently adjudged bankrupt.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     On 15 December 2005, the appellant lodged an
                    “error or mistake” claim for the Loss under section 93A of the Act
                    with the respondent. By a letter dated 1 December 2008, the respondent made
                    a determination that relief could not be granted “as there is no error or
                    mistake within the meaning of Section 93A of [the Act]”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     The appellant then filed a Notice of Appeal to
                    the Income Tax Board of Review (“the Board”) on 5 December
                    2008. This was followed on 30 December 2008 by the Petition of Appeal
                    seeking an order (among other things) to direct the respondent to grant relief
                    to the appellant under section 93A of the Act and to allow the Loss as a
                    deduction for YA 2000 under section 14(1) of the Act.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The decision of the Income Tax Board of Review</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     The Board referred to the English approach in
                        <em>Curtis</em> (<em>HM Inspector of
                        Taxes) v J &amp; G Oldfield, Limited</em> (1925)
                    9 TC 319 (“the <em>Curtis</em>
                    test”) and came to the conclusion that the Loss sustained by the
                    appellant was not deductible under section 14(1) of the Act. The
                    appellant’s appeal was therefore dismissed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     In applying the <em>Curtis</em> test to the facts of the present case, the Board took
                    particular notice of the <em>power or control</em> the
                    Ex-MD had wielded in the appellant at [17]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Besides being the Managing Director the Ex-MD was a substantial
                        shareholder. Both directly and through his family company D Pte Ltd his
                        interest or deemed interest ranged between 12.8% to 14.9%. This is a
                        substantial shareholding. As a substantial shareholder and Managing
                        Director, and based on the evidence, the Ex-MD was in the language of
                        Rowlatt J <em>supra</em> “in a position to
                        do exactly what he likes”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     The Board reasoned that the Loss was not
                    deductible since the Ex-MD was “in the same position as the managing
                    director in the <em>Curtis</em> case”. The Board
                    further held that the <em>Curtis</em> test (as understood
                    and applied by the Board) is consistent with subsequent cases such as <em>The Roebank Printing Company Limited v The Commissioners of Inland
                        Revenue</em> (1928) SC 701, 13 TC 864
                        (“<em>The Roebank case</em>”) and
                        <em>Bamford (HM Inspector of Taxes) v ATA Advertising
                        Ltd</em> (1972) 48 TC 359 (“<em>Bamford</em>”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     The Board then went on to opine on the issue
                    of whether the appellant’s omission to set off the Loss in YA 2000 could
                    qualify as an “error or mistake” under section 93A(1) of the Act,
                    if the Loss were deductible. The Board held that the omission by the appellant
                    was not “due to oversight” as “it was a decision made after
                    due consideration that the Loss was not an allowable deduction under section 14
                    of the Act” (at [28]). However,
                    the Board agreed with the appellant’s argument that “[i]f the
                    decision was a mistake it was one of law and still a mistake falling within
                    section 93A of the Act”. Nonetheless, the Board held that this was an
                    academic point as it had already decided that the Loss was not
                    deductible.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The issues on appeal</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     Two issues arise on appeal:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_18-p2_a"></a>(a)     Did the Board err in holding that
                        the Loss incurred by the appellant was not wholly and exclusively incurred
                        by the appellant in its production of income under section 14(1) of the
                        Act?</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_18-p2_b"></a>(b)     Did the
                        Board err in holding that an erroneous opinion or a grossly negligent error,
                        such as a mistake of law, can constitute an “error or mistake”
                        under section 93A of the Act?</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Deducibility of losses incurred as a result of defalcation</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The Curtis test</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     Section 14(1) of the Act stipulates the
                    deductions a taxpayer is allowed to make against taxable income:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">For the purpose of ascertaining the income of any person for any period
                        from any source chargeable with tax under this Act (referred to in this Part
                        as the income), there shall be deducted all outgoings and expenses wholly
                        and exclusively incurred during that period by that person in the production
                        of the income...</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     Section 15(1)(b) reinforces section 14(1) by
                    emphasizing that any other types of disbursements or expenses “not being
                    money wholly and exclusively laid out or expended for the purpose of acquiring
                    the income” are not allowed as deductions.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     The statutory framework thus emphasizes that
                    the touchstone for deductibility of expenses is that they must necessarily be
                    incurred for the specific purpose of the production of income. The Court of
                    Appeal in <em>Pinetree Resort Pte Ltd v Comptroller of Income
                        Tax</em> [2000] 3 SLR(R) 136 stressed (at [47]) that section 14(1) “<em>requires a nexus</em> between the incurrence of the expense
                    and the production of income.” [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     The general requirement of a
                    “nexus” in the relevant statutory provisions, however, does not in
                    itself shed light on how losses sustained by a company due to the defalcation of
                    an employee is to be treated. When would losses resulting from defalcation have
                    sufficient nexus to be considered “wholly and exclusively incurred ... in
                    the production of the income”?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     In the seminal case of <em>Curtis</em> (<em>HM Inspector of Taxes) v J &amp;
                            G Oldfield, Limited </em>(1925) 9 TC 319 (“<em>Curtis</em>”), the managing director of the company was, up to
                    the time of his death, in control of its business in wines and spirits. An
                    investigation after his death revealed that many payments and receipts not
                    relating to the company’s business but to his private affairs had passed
                    through the company’s books. The amount was accordingly written off as a
                    bad debt. A dispute then arose between the company and the Revenue as to whether
                    the said loss had “arisen in the course of a company’s
                    trading” and therefore tax-deductible. The General Commissioners allowed
                    the company’s claim and the Revenue appealed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     The High Court reversed the General
                    Commissioners’ decision and agreed with the Revenue that the loss was not
                    a trading loss and thus not deductible from the company’s profits for
                    income tax purposes. The relevant portion of Rowlatt J’s judgment, or the
                        <em>Curtis</em> test, (at 330-331) is reproduced
                    here:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">When the Rule speaks of a bad debt it means a debt which is a debt that
                        would have come into the balance sheet as a trading debt in the trade that
                        is in question and that it is bad. It does not really mean any bad debt
                        which, when it was a good debt, would not have come in to swell the profits.
                        What the Commissioners have been misled by, in my judgment, quite clearly is
                        this. They have allowed themselves to act under the impression that they
                        were taxing the Company on what the Company in a loose way had made and
                        secured. In point of law they were engaged in assessing the profits of the
                        Company’s trade, not of the Company itself but of the Company’s
                        trade, and I have to consider whether there is the least ground for
                        supposing that losses of these sums resulting in this bad debt were losses
                        in the trade. I quite think ... that if you have a business (which for the
                        purposes of to-day at any rate I will assume) in the course of which you
                        have to employ subordinates, and owing to the negligence or the dishonesty
                        of the subordinates some of the receipts of the business do not find their
                        way into the till, or some of the bills are not collected at all, or
                        something of that sort, that may be an expense connected with and arising
                        out of the trade in the most complete sense of the word. But here that is
                        not this case at all. This gentleman was the Managing Director of the
                        Company, and he was in charge of the whole thing, and all we know is that in
                        the books of the Company which do exist it is found that moneys went through
                        the books into his pocket. I do not see that there is any evidence at all
                        that there was a loss in the trade in that respect. It simply means that the
                        assets of the Company, moneys which the Company had got and which had got
                        home to the Company, got into the control of the Managing Director of the
                        Company, and he took them out. It seems to me that what has happened is that
                        he has made away with receipts of the Company <em>dehors</em> the trade altogether in virtue of his position as
                        Managing Director in the office and being in a position to do exactly what
                        he likes.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     In the present case, the crux of the dispute
                    between the appellant and the respondent is as to how the <em>Curtis</em> test is to be understood and applied. The appellant
                    argued that in <em>Curtis</em>, the “real
                    reason” why the loss was not deductible was because the defalcations took
                    place <em>outside</em> the company’s trading or
                    income-earning activities, since the money had already been earned and was
                    simply passed through the company’s books into the pocket of the
                        director.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> The respondent, however,
                    understood the <em>Curtis</em> test as prohibiting the
                    deduction of losses incurred by a director who was “in a position to do
                    exactly what he likes”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     Since both parties have submitted extensively
                    on foreign authorities in support of their arguments, it is necessary that I
                    first set out how various Commonwealth jurisdictions have dealt with the issue
                    of the deductibility of losses sustained as a result of an employee’s
                    defalcation. I will then discuss the approach which I think our courts should
                    adopt.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The approach in different jurisdictions</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">United Kingdom</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     In <em>The Roebank
                        case</em>, the managing director was entitled to a commission on the
                    company’s profits at the end of each year and was authorised by the
                    directors to draw sums during the year in anticipation. He drew in excess of
                    commissions due. The company then claimed tax deduction on the basis that these
                    payments were made as remuneration of an employee for the purpose of and in
                    connection with its business and therefore deductible in arriving at the profits
                    of the company for income tax purposes.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     The General Commissioners applied the
                        <em>Curtis</em> test and refused the deductions
                    claimed. The company’s appeal to the Court of Sessions was dismissed. In
                    dismissing the appeal, Lord President Clyde expressed his understanding of the
                        <em>Curtis</em> test at 875-876 in the following
                    manner:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">“If it were legitimate for us to make an inference of fact from the
                        facts stated in the Case, I should be disposed to think that the managing
                        director was using the Company as his banker. But it is, I think, enough to
                        say that the financial indulgence shewn to him by the Company went far
                        beyond anything which could be justified by, or could be consistent with,
                        any trading interest of the Company. If so, then the loss resulting from the
                        granting of that indulgence cannot form a legitimate or proper deduction in
                        the ascertainment of the Company’s trading profits.”</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     Both <em>Curtis</em> and
                        <em>The Roebank case</em> were applied much later in
                        <em>Bamford</em>. In <em>Bamford</em>, the taxpayer’s trade consisted of advertising and
                    publicity work. It had a board of three members including a Major A.E. Newnham
                    (“Newnham”) who held a 50% shareholding in the company. The
                    financial matters were left in the hands of Newnham. In 1966, Newnham
                    misappropriated £15,000 by drawing a cheque on the account of the tax payer
                    in favour of another company which he also controlled. In the tax payer’s
                    accounts for the following year the £15,000 was written off as a bad debt.
                    However, the tax payer was assessed on the basis that the £15,000 was not
                    deductible.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     The tax payer appealed. The General
                    Commissioners decided in favour of the tax payer. However, on appeal by the
                    Inspector of Taxes, Brightman J reversed the decision of the General
                    Commissioners on the following grounds at 368:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Mr. Beattie [counsel for tax payer] submitted that there is no logical
                        distinction to be drawn between petty theft by a subordinate employee and
                        massive defalcation by a director. In my view there is a distinction. I can
                        quite see that the Commissioners might find as a fact that a £5 note
                        taken from the till by a shop assistant is a loss to the trader which is
                        connected with and arises out of the trade. A large shop has to use tills
                        and to employ assistants with access to those tills. It could not trade in
                        any other way. That, it seems to me, is quite a different case from a
                        director with authority to sign cheques who helps himself to £15,000,
                        which is then lost to the company. I find it difficult to see how such a
                        loss could be regarded fairly as “connected with or arising out of
                        the trade”. In the defaulting director type of case, there seems to
                        me to be no relevant nexus between the loss of the money and the conduct of
                        the company’s trade. The loss is not, as in the case of the dishonest
                        shop assistant, an incident of the company’s trading activities. It
                        arises altogether outside such activities. That, I think, is the true
                        distinction. In my view, the decision in the Roebank case did not depend on
                        the absence of fraud. I consider that it is a decision which I should
                        follow.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     In his learned judgment, Brightman J
                    appears to have settled once and for all what the “the true
                    distinction” is when applying the <em>Curtis</em>
                    test. However, as will be evident in the cases in the other Commonwealth
                    jurisdictions, there is still much to be said on what “the true
                    distinction” really is between defalcations which are deductible for
                    income tax purposes and those which are not.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Australia and New Zealand</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     The High Court of Australia also referred to
                        <em>Curtis</em> in <em>The Commissioner
                        of Taxation (New South Wales) v Ash</em> (1938) 61 CLR 263
                        (“<em>Ash</em>”). In <em>Ash</em>, the taxpayer was a solicitor who had to pay off certain
                    debts which were incurred due to the fraudulent misappropriation of a former
                    partner. Applying <em>Curtis</em>, Latham CJ
                    highlighted what in his opinion was the salient fact that the defalcating
                    partner had been “acting within his authority as a partner [and had]
                    received moneys as a principal for the firm” (at 274). This led the
                    learned CJ to hold that the losses sustained by the taxpayer were not
                    deductible, because (at 278):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">You cannot treat ... the depredations of a partner as if they were the
                        peculations of an office boy ... The partner was a proprietor, and whilst
                        all must sympathize with the taxpayer and deplore the wrong done to him by
                        this partner it is impossible to treat that wrong as a characteristic
                        incident of the carrying on of his profession...</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     
          <em>Ash</em> has been
                    cited with approval in <em>DR &amp; P v Comptroller of Income
                        Tax</em> (2001) 5 MSTC 293. The Singapore Income Tax Board
                    of Review understood <em>Ash</em> as establishing the
                    proposition that if the fraud was perpetrated by a partner <em>as
                        a partner</em>, no deduction would be allowed for the loss sustained
                    due to the fraud.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     When faced with the misappropriation by a
                        <em>book-keeper</em> (as opposed to a partner) of a
                    solicitor taxpayer, the New Zealand court in <em>Commissioner of
                        Taxes v Webber</em> [1956] NZLR 552 (“<em>Webber</em>”) had no difficulty distinguishing
                        <em>Ash</em>. Turner J held that “[t]he
                    case in which income is actually received and then misapplied by the proprietor
                    of a business is expressly distinguished ... from the case where a payment has
                    to be made for a regular and almost unavoidable incident of the business in
                    question” (at 561). The book-keeper had made false representations to the
                    taxpayer leading to the latter advancing a sum of money to the former. In Turner
                    J’s opinion, this type of loss represents “that kind of casualty,
                    mischance or misfortune which is a natural or recognized incident of the
                    carrying on of this solicitor’s kind of practice” (at 562) and was
                    therefore held to be deductible.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     In <em>W G Evans &amp; Co Ltd v
                        Commissioner of Inland Revenue</em> [1976] 1 NZLR 425
                        (“<em>Evans</em>”), the defalcator, who
                    held 100 out of 10,000 shares and was employed as the company’s secretary,
                    was subsequently appointed a director. The controlling shareholder, Mr E,
                    was away from office most of the time and had the habit of forwarding cheques
                    and accounts to the defalcator for banking and payment. Unknown to Mr E,
                    the defalcator was siphoning money from the company for five years. Casey J
                    held that the loss sustained due to the defalcations was a deductible
                    loss.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     In distinguishing <em>Curtis</em>, Casey J held that the defalcator “was in
                    nothing like the position of the managing director in <em>Curtis’s</em> case who could exercise an overriding control to
                    take the money independently of the company’s normal operations. Although
                    a director, [the defalcator] was nothing more than the company’s
                    accountant so far as these defalcations were concerned” (at 432).
                    Importantly, it was in this context that Casey J eventually concluded at
                    435:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The fact that he was also a director, shareholder and officer of the
                        company does not alter the fact that he misappropriated the money while
                        dealing with it as part of the company’s activities, and not by
                            <em>the exercise of overriding power or
                            control</em> outside those activities altogether, as did the sole
                        managing director in <em>Curtis’s</em> case. The
                        risk of such defalcations was inherent in the operations of the company
                        carried on by necessity in this way, and accordingly the resulting loss is
                        fairly incidental to the production of the assessable income and is
                        deductible. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Canada</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     Similar to <em>Evans</em>, the <em>Curtis</em> test was also
                    distinguished in the Canadian case of <em>Cassidy’s Ltd v
                        MNR</em> 89 DTC 686 (“<em>Cassidy</em>”). In <em>Cassidy</em>, the
                    defalcator, a chartered accountant, was the secretary-treasurer of the company
                    and was responsible for accounting procedures. He was subsequently promoted to
                    vice-president and general manager. It was revealed that the defalcator had
                    issued cheques from the taxpayer company (“Packer”) to his own
                    bank account, ostensibly for the company’s operations but in reality for
                    payment of his personal debts.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     In allowing these losses to be deductible, the
                    Tax Court of Canada first decided against the proposition that “simply
                    because a theft or defalcation was committed by a senior employee, the losses
                    resulting from such a commission are not deductible by the employer in computing
                    income for tax purposes” (at 691). From its understanding of the
                        <em>Curtis</em> test and subsequent cases, the court
                    abstracted the general principle that “case law distinguishes not so much
                    as to the level of the employee in the employer’s hierarchy but how and at
                    what stage in the income-earning process the money is stolen or
                    embezzled” (at 692).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     In determining “how and at what stage
                    in the income-earning process the money [was] stolen or embezzled”, the
                    court made the following observation at 693:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[The defalcator] commenced defrauding Packer in 1978 when he was
                        controller and before his appointment in October, 1981, to vice-president
                        and general manager of Packer. When he began his theft of funds he did not
                        have “complete discretion” over the operations of Packer and
                        was responsible to [the president of Packer]. Even after his appointment as
                        a general manager he was obliged to report monthly to, and follow rules
                        determined by, his superiors. Packer’s business was controlled by [the
                        defalcator’s] superiors. This is not a case like <em>Curtis</em> ... where the person defrauding his employer was in
                        sole control of the employer’s business.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     Following from the above observation, the
                    Canadian Tax Court concluded that because the defalcator “did not
                    defalcate money <em>qua</em> director or general manager of
                    Packer” (at 693), the losses sustained by Packer were
                    tax-deductible.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     Just a few months later, the Federal Court of
                    Canada sought to apply <em>Cassidy</em> to the facts before
                    it in <em>Parkland Operations Limited v The Queen</em> 90
                    DTC 6676 (“<em>Parkland</em>”). The company
                    had an operating line of credit with a bank and a “signature card”
                    had to be signed to draw down the credit. The court found as a finding of fact
                    that it was understood that two signatures – of the six shareholders
                    – were required on the “signature card”: one from either of
                    two ‘primary’ shareholders and the other from any of the four
                    ‘new’ shareholders. However, illegitimate withdrawals were soon made
                    by two of the ‘new’ shareholders without the knowledge or approval
                    of the rest.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     The court referred to <em>Evans</em> and <em>Cassidy</em> in coming to its
                    decision that the losses incurred by the two defalcating shareholders were
                    deductible. The court held at 6680:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[The defalcating shareholders] may have been minority shareholders for
                        Parkland, but they misappropriated the funds in question not in the capacity
                        as shareholders, but rather as thieves, <em>with neither the
                            knowledge nor consent of the other shareholders</em>. They
                        misappropriated the money while dealing with it in the course of the
                        company’s activities, and not by exercising some overriding control
                        over the funds which existed outside of those activities...The taxpayer is
                        entitled to the same relief where a minority shareholder, <em>oblivious to the plans or desires of the other shareholders</em>,
                        misappropriates funds as he would be where a senior employee was the thief.
                        [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     It must be noted that the fact that the
                    defalcating shareholders had acted “<em>with neither the
                        knowledge nor consent of the other shareholder</em>” is only
                    relevant because of the specific factual matrix in <em>Parkland</em>. The control given to the defalcating shareholders with
                    regard to their wrongful act had been circumscribed right from the start.
                        <em>Parkland</em> was not a case where the defalcating
                    shareholders could draw down the credit as and when they liked and then use the
                    money for their own illegitimate purposes. The fact that permission from other
                    shareholders had always been required before the drawing down of credit
                    adequately explains why the defalcating shareholders were held not to have
                    “[exercised] some overriding control over the funds” which they
                    had misappropriated.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">India</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     The <em>Curtis</em> test
                    has also been extensively discussed and applied in India. In <em>Badridas Daga v The Commissioner of Income-Tax</em> (1958) 45 AIR 783
                        (“<em>Badridas</em>”), the defalcator was
                    an agent of the appellant and was conferred extensive powers of management that
                    included the authority to operate bank accounts. While acting under such
                    authority, the agent withdrew money from the bank and used it for the discharge
                    of his personal debts. The Supreme Court of India held that the losses sustained
                    by the appellant were tax-deductible by discussing and then distinguishing
                        <em>Curtis</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     The court first distinguished <em>Curtis</em> on the basis that the <em>nature
                        of the defalcating act</em> with regards to the trade was different in
                    the two cases (at 788):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Now, in [<em>Curtis</em>] ... the trading has ceased
                        and [the] subsequent operations on the bank account are not incidental to
                        the carrying on of the trade. But here, we are dealing with a banking
                        business, which consists in making advances, realising them and making fresh
                        advances, and for that purpose, it is necessary not merely to deposit
                        amounts in banks but also to withdraw them. That is to say, a continuous
                        operation on the bank account is incidental to the conduct of the
                        business.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     Interestingly, the court also distinguished
                        <em>Curtis</em> on the basis that the <em>power or control</em> the defalcating employee possessed was
                    different in the two cases (at 789):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[In <em>Curtis</em>, the defalcator’s]
                        withdrawals would be more like a partner overdrawing his account with the
                        firm than an agent embezzling the funds of his employer, and it could
                        properly be held that such overdrawing has nothing to do with the trading
                        activities of the firm ... When once it is established that [the defalcating
                        agent] had authority to operate on the bank accounts, and that he withdrew
                        the moneys in the purported exercise of that authority, <em>his action is referable to his character as agent</em>, and any
                        loss resulting from misappropriation of funds by him would be a loss
                        incidental to the carrying on of the business. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     The two different bases on which <em>Curtis</em> was distinguished above have led to two different
                    conceptual views of the <em>Curtis</em> test, as evident in
                    the appellant’s and respondent’s submissions in the present case. Is
                    the <em>Curtis</em> test premised on the nature of the
                    defalcator’s act with regards to the trade (<em>i.e</em>. whether it occurred as part of or wholly outside the
                    trading activity), or is it premised on the power or control of the defalcator
                    with regards to the defalcating act (<em>i.e</em>. whether
                    the defalcator committed the act <em>qua</em>
                    director)?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     In <em>Sassoon J David
                        &amp; Co (P) Ltd v Commissioner of Income-tax</em> [1978] 98 ITR 50
                        (“<em>Sassoon</em>”), the defalcator was
                    a director in sole charge of the firm’s business. He withdrew a sum of
                    money from the firm’s bank account for his private purposes. The Income
                    Tax Tribunal held that because the defalcator’s withdrawals were
                    “more like a partner overdrawing his account with the firm”, the
                    overdrawing had nothing to do with the trading activities of the firm and was
                    thus not tax-deductible.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     The High Court of Bombay reversed the decision
                    of the Tribunal and held that such losses were deductible. <em>Curtis</em> was, once again, distinguished on the two different bases
                    as in <em>Badridas</em>. The court first held that
                        <em>Curtis</em> could be distinguished because the
                    defalcator had “[withdrawn] the amount as if the withdrawal was for the
                    purpose of the business of the company and then pocketed it” (at
                        [23]). This parallels the
                    “first basis” in <em>Badridas</em> where the
                    court inquires whether the defalcator acted <em>as if</em>
                    his act was part of the trade, or wholly outside it. However, the High Court of
                    Bombay also stressed that the defalcator “could [not] be said to be in
                    the position of a proprietor” with regards to the misappropriation (at
                        [37]). This parallels the
                    “second basis” in <em>Badridas</em> where the
                    court inquires whether the defalcating employee could commit the defalcation
                    only because of the <em>overriding power or control</em>
                    given to him.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">South Africa</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     The approach in South Africa is much more
                    straightforward as the <em>Curtis</em> test is not followed
                    there. The South African courts have held that all money lost by way of
                    embezzlement <em>cannot</em> be deducted for income tax
                    purposes because such losses are not incurred in the production of the
                    company’s income (<em>Lockie Bros Ltd v Commissioner for
                        Inland Revenue</em> (1922) 32 SATC 150 (”<em>Lockie Bros</em>”); <em>Income Tax Case No.
                        298</em> (1934) 8 SATC 58).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     It can be thus be said that the South African
                    courts have interpreted the “nexus requirement” in its equivalent
                    statutory provision – “<em>incurred in the
                        production of income</em>” – very strictly and literally.
                    As the “nature and scope of the [employee’s employment] was to
                    manage the company’s business and not steal its funds” (<em>Lockie Bros</em> at 155), losses resulting from defalcation,
                    by whomever and wherever committed, are not deductible for income tax
                    purposes.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The appellant’s submissions</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     The appellant put forward three main arguments
                    in support of its position that the Loss it has sustained should be
                    deductible:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_52-p2_a"></a>(a)     The Commonwealth cases support the
                        appellant’s understanding of the <em>Curtis</em>
                        test –
                        <em>i.e</em>. whether the misappropriation occurred in
                        the course of the appellant’s normal income-earning activities and not
                        outside them;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_52-p2_b"></a>(b)     The Board’s understanding of the <em>Curtis</em>
                        test –
                        <em>i.e</em>. whether the defalcator was “in a
                        position to do whatever he likes” - is undesirable both legally and
                        on policy grounds;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_52-p2_c"></a>(c)     Even if the Board’s understanding of the <em>Curtis</em> test is to be applied, the Ex-MD was not “in a
                        position to do whatever he likes”.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The respondent’s submissions</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     In response, the respondent submitted:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_53-p2_a"></a>(a)     The Commonwealth cases have
                        established the proposition that losses arising from embezzlement by a
                        director or partner are not deductible;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_53-p2_b"></a>(b)     The appellant’s understanding of the
                            <em>Curtis</em> test should not be adopted lest
                        financial indulgence is seen as being condoned;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_53-p2_c"></a>(c)     The Ex-MD of the appellant was not merely an
                        employee but was a person with overriding power or control similar to the
                        defalcating director in <em>Curtis</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The approach to be adopted in Singapore</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     Having surveyed the various approaches in
                    different Commonwealth jurisdictions, I have come to the view that the correct
                    understanding of the <em>Curtis</em> test was applied by
                    the Board. The correct understanding of the <em>Curtis</em>
                    test, in my view, is as follows: Did the defalcator possess an “overriding
                    power or control” in the company (<em>i.e</em>. in a
                    position to do exactly what he likes) and was the defalcation committed in the
                    exercise of such “power or control”? If so, the losses which
                    result from such defalcations are not deductible for income tax
                purposes.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     I recognise that this test which I adopt is
                    much narrower in allowing for the deductibility of defalcation losses as
                    compared to the test submitted by the appellant. I find the appellant’s
                    understanding of the <em>Curtis</em> test undesirably wide
                    and I do not think that it should be applied in Singapore.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The Commonwealth cases are, on the whole, in greater support of the
                “overriding power or control” test </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     Admittedly, the Commonwealth cases discussed
                    earlier appear to be somewhat inconclusive as to what the correct understanding
                    of the <em>Curtis</em> test is. Both parties in the present
                    case were able to find support for their respective understanding of the
                        <em>Curtis</em> test in most of the cited cases. As my
                    analysis of the Indian cases show (see above at <a href="#p1_44">[44]</a> –
                    <a href="#p1_49">[49]</a>), some cases clearly employ <em>both</em> approaches (of the appellant and the respondent in
                    the present case) in distinguishing <em>Curtis</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     Nonetheless, putting the Indian cases aside, I
                    am of the view that the UK, New Zealand and Canadian cases provide greater
                    support for what I have outlined as the correct understanding of the <em>Curtis</em> test – “Did the defalcator possess
                    an “overriding power or control” in the company and was the
                    defalcation committed in the exercise of such “power or control?”
                    – as compared to that put forth by the appellant.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">A.   Why the UK authorities do not support the appellant’s
                position</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a>58     In discussing the UK cases subsequent to
                        <em>Curtis</em>, the appellant cited <em>The Roebank case</em> for the finding that the defalcations committed
                    there “were not connected with the company’s
                        trade”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span> but
                    missed the importance placed by Lord President Clyde on (at 876):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">“...the <em>financial indulgence shewn to [the
                            defalcator] by the Company</em> [which] went far beyond anything
                        which could be justified by, or could be consistent with, any trading
                        interest of the Company. <em>If so</em>, then the loss
                        resulting from the granting of that indulgence cannot form a legitimate or
                        proper deduction in the ascertainment of the Company’s trading
                        profits.” [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a>59     As for <em>Bamford</em>,
                    the appellant concluded that “the true distinction” as articulated
                    by Brightman J was between a loss arising as an incident of the
                    company’s trading activity and a loss arising altogether outside such
                        activities.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span> In
                    my opinion, the appellant’s interpretation of Brightman J’s
                    holding is too general to be of any practical use and it does not do justice to
                    the nuanced context in which the learned judge saw the need to draw a
                    “true distinction”. It will be recalled that Brightman J said
                    (at 368):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I can quite see that the Commissioners might find as a fact that a £5
                        note taken from the till by a shop assistant is a loss to the trader which
                        is connected with and arises out of the trade. <em>A large
                            shop has to use tills and to employ assistants with access to those
                            tills. It could not trade in any other way</em>. That, it seems to
                        me, is quite a different case from a director with authority to sign cheques
                        who helps himself to £15,000, which is then lost to the company.
                        [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a>60     From the emphasized portion of the quote
                    above, it seems that Brightman J was compelled to draw a distinction
                    between different defalcations because of the necessity of certain trade
                    practices (e.g. a large shop having to employ assistants) which, in his opinion,
                    came with the <em>natural and inevitable</em> risks of an
                    employee’s defalcation. The learned judge then held that such defalcations
                    were to be treated as “arising as an incident of the company’s
                    trading activities”, as compared to a “defaulting director type of
                    case”. This nuanced context is, in my view, critical in understanding the
                    “true distinction” drawn in the <em>Curtis</em> test (see below at <a href="#p1_71">[71]</a> –
                    <a href="#p1_75">[75]</a>).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">B.   Why the New Zealand authorities do not support the
                appellant’s position</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a>61     The appellant was also of the opinion that
                        <em>Evans</em> supported its submission that the
                    “true test” should simply be whether the defalcation occurs in the
                    course of the normal income-earning activity of the taxpayer
                        company.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_5" id="Ftn_5_1"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span> In my opinion, the
                    appellant was too quickly drawn to Casey J’s <em>conclusion</em> that (at 435):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The fact that [the defalcator] was also a director, shareholder and
                        officer of the company does not alter the fact that he misappropriated the
                        money while dealing with it as part of the company’s activities, and
                        not by the exercise of overriding power or control outside those activities
                        altogether, as did the sole managing director in <em>Curtis’s</em> case.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_62"></a>62     This is because reading Casey J’s
                    conclusion in a vacuum only begs the question as to what it means for the
                    defalcator to have “misappropriated the money while dealing with it as
                    part of the company’s activities”. Crucially, Casey J had held
                    earlier (at 432) that the defalcator in <em>Evans</em>:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">...was in nothing like the position of the managing director in <em>Curtis’s</em> case who could exercise an overriding
                        control <em>to take the money independently of the
                            company’s normal operations</em>. Although a director, [the
                        defalcator] was <em>nothing more than the company’s
                            accountant so far as these defalcations were concerned</em>.
                        [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_63"></a>63     Reading Casey J’s judgment in totality,
                    the operative phrase which the appellant’s case hinges on –
                    “misappropriated the money while dealing with it as part of the
                    company’s activities” – cannot be interpreted so widely as to
                    cover any defalcation so long as it was committed <em>as
                        if</em> it were part of the company’s legitimate activities. The
                    court in <em>Evans</em> had held that the misappropriation
                    was “part of the company’s activities” only because the
                    defalcator was “<em>nothing more than the company’s
                        accountant so far as these defalcations were concerned</em>”.
                    For that reason, the precise power or control which the defalcator exercised in
                    committing the defalcation is similarly the crucial factor in New
                    Zealand.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">C.   Why the Canadian authorities do not support the
                appellant’s position</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_64"></a>64     Once again, <em>Cassidy</em> might appear at first glance to be in support of the
                    appellant’s submissions, given the Canadian court’s explicit
                    rejection of the proposition that “simply because a theft or defalcation
                    was committed by a senior employee, the losses resulting from such a commission
                    are not deductible by the employer in computing income for tax purposes”
                    (at 691).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_65"></a>65     However, the Canadian court also held that the
                    defalcator in <em>Cassidy</em> did not have complete
                    discretion over the taxpayer’s operations. The business was controlled by
                    the defalcator’s superiors and the situation in <em>Cassidy</em> was “not a case like <em>Curtis</em> ... where the person defrauding his employer was in sole
                    control of the employer’s business” (at 693).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_66"></a>66     Therefore, while the possibility exists that a
                    defalcation committed by a senior employee such as a director could be
                    deductible, the critical question is always, as the Canadian court accurately
                    articulated, whether the director did “defalcate money <em>qua</em> director” (at 693). If he did so, the loss is not
                    deductible. If he did not –
                    <em>e.g</em>. the defalcators in <em>Evans</em> and <em>Cassidy</em> - the loss is
                    deductible. This is consistent with the test I outlined earlier – did the
                    defalcator possess an “overriding power or control” in the company
                    and <em>was the defalcation committed in the exercise of such
                        “power or control”</em>?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_67"></a>67     The appellant also cited <em>Parkland</em> for the proposition that any defalcation committed
                    which is “oblivious to the plans and desires of the other
                    shareholders” should be deductible.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_6" id="Ftn_6_1"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span> But as mentioned in
                    the earlier discussion of <em>Parkland</em> (see above at
                        [43]), the lack of approval of the
                    other shareholders in <em>Parkland</em> was relevant in
                    that case only because it went towards proving that the defalcating shareholders
                    did not possess overriding power or control over the funds misappropriated.
                    Otherwise, it is never a relevant inquiry, for the purposes of income tax
                    deductibility, whether the defalcating act had “caused harm” to
                    other shareholders or directors, as the appellant submitted.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_7" id="Ftn_7_1"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_68"></a>68     Thus, it appears to me that most of the
                    Commonwealth cases have understood the <em>Curtis</em> test
                    as drawing the critical distinction, for the purposes of income tax
                    deductibility, between defalcations by a mere employee and defalcations by a
                    person who “in virtue of his position [of power or control was] in a
                    position to do exactly what he likes” (<em>Curtis</em> at 331). This is the approach that has in fact been
                    applied in Singapore (see <em>DR &amp; P v Comptroller of Income
                        Tax</em> (2001) 5 MSTC 293), and in my opinion, should continue to do
                    so.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The approach to be adopted is legally sound and justifiable in

<p class="Judg-Heading-4">A.   The appellant’s objections</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_69"></a>69     Notwithstanding the supporting authorities,
                    the approach which I intend to apply has been challenged by the appellant as
                    being “difficult, if not impossible, to apply as guidance to future
                        cases”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_8" id="Ftn_8_1"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span> The
                    appellant has argued that the “overriding power or control” test
                    is vague and imprecise<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_9" id="Ftn_9_1"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span> as
                    compared to its understanding of the <em>Curtis</em> test
                        (<em>i.e</em>. did the loss arise in the course of the
                    company’s normal trading activities?).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_10" id="Ftn_10_1"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span> The appellant then
                    concluded its critique with a probing question – “why should
                    deductibility be governed by the degree of control or the size of
                    shareholding?”</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_70"></a>70     I respectfully disagree with the
                    appellant’s arguments. In the paragraphs that follow, I will attempt to
                    show the reasons why I think the approach I intend to apply is both legally
                    sound and justifiable in policy.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">B.   The deductibility of losses resulting from defalcations is a
                common law exception </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_71"></a>71     I refer to my earlier observation (see above
                    at <a href="#p1_22">[22]</a>) that neither section 14(1) nor
                    section 15(1)(b) of the Act explicitly addresses the issue of whether losses
                    which result from defalcations should be deductible. The general requirement
                    that there must be a “nexus” between the alleged expense and the
                    production of income also does not explain how and why defalcation losses ought
                    to be treated as having a “nexus” with the production of income.
                    Strictly speaking, and as actualised in the South African courts, one could
                    maintain that all losses which result from defalcations should not be deductible
                    since there is no connection at all between a defalcation and the production of
                    income.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_72"></a>72     The <em>Curtis</em> test
                    should therefore be understood as a common law exception developed by the courts
                    to render certain defalcation losses as having sufficient “nexus”
                    with the production of income such that they could be deductible for income tax
                    purposes. This common law exception was perhaps developed in tandem with the
                    rise of larger partnerships and companies in the early
                        20<sup>th</sup> century. It is essentially a judicial
                    recognition of the increasingly difficult task for the large, modern firm to
                    have to monitor every activity of its lower echelon employees and to ensure that
                    all their acts necessarily contribute to the “production of
                    income”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_73"></a>73     The difficulty of doing so must have, at some
                    point, prompted the courts to recognise, as in <em>Curtis</em> (at 330), that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">...if you have a business (which for the purposes of to-day at any rate I
                        will assume) in the course of which you have to employ subordinates, and
                        owing to the negligence or the dishonesty of the subordinates some of the
                        receipts of the business do not find their way into the till, or some of the
                        bills are not collected at all, or something of that sort, that may be an
                        expense connected with and arising out of the trade in the most complete
                        sense of the word.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_74"></a>74     The rendering of certain defalcation losses as
                    being tax-deductible must therefore be properly understood as a common law
                    exception prompted by the realities of the commercial world to make sense of a
                    statute which, on plain reading, simply did not provide for the treatment of
                    such losses. Seen as an exception (rather than as a right) granted to the
                    taxpayer, it may be that the taxpayer is in no position to argue, as submitted
                    by the appellant, that there must be a “clear and precise” test to
                    constitute proper “guidance to companies and
                        investors”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_11" id="Ftn_11_1"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_75"></a>75     Indeed, commercial morality demands that the
                    taxpayer <em>be guided solely</em> by its duty to take all
                    reasonable efforts to ensure that defalcations by its employees are kept to a
                    minimum. The <em>Curtis</em> test seeks to alleviate the
                    hardship of the taxpayer by granting tax-deductibility to certain defalcation
                    losses but it cannot and should not provide a warped incentive for firms to
                    allow certain employees to do as they please and then claim that they had
                    “expected” the losses which result from the employees’
                    defalcations to be tax deductible.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">C.   The need to deter companies from leaving the powers of their
                directors and shareholders unchecked</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_76"></a>76     Seen in this light, the ‘narrower’
                    understanding of the <em>Curtis</em> test which has been
                    adopted in the present case is clearly justifiable. The distinction between
                    losses resulting from the defalcations of lower echelon employees and those who
                    possess an “overriding power or control” in the firm are justified
                    on two policy grounds.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_77"></a>77     First, the distinction drawn by the <em>Curtis</em> test as understood by the Board is as an
                    extension of sympathy to large firms in view of their inability to keep all their
                    employees, especially those of the lower echelon, in check. Second, and more
                    importantly, it functions as a form of deterrence to firms that do not provide
                    adequate checks on employees who possess such “overriding power or
                    control” that they are able to incur great financial and social damage.
                    As the respondent correctly submitted, deduction should not be given in the
                    latter scenario lest financial indulgence is seen as being condoned.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_12" id="Ftn_12_1"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_78"></a>78     Indeed, a firm which disregards its social
                    duty and allows a director or shareholder who has “overriding power or
                    control” over millions of dollars to “do exactly what he
                    likes” is justifiably penalized when the defalcation losses caused by the
                    said director or shareholder are considered an expense which is not
                    tax-deductible. This hopefully answers the appellant’s question –
                    “why should deductibility be governed by the degree of control or the
                    size of shareholding?”</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">D.   The <em>Curtis</em> test as being
                prescriptive of commercial practice</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_79"></a>79     In arguing against the Board’s
                    understanding of the <em>Curtis</em> test, the appellant
                    also submitted that it should not be faulted for granting the Ex-MD such
                    “overriding power or control” because this was “the way the
                    appellant conducted its business”, and that “run in this way, [the
                    appellant’s] business was successful”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_13" id="Ftn_13_1"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span> This appears to me to
                    disregard the deterrent nature of the <em>Curtis</em>
                    test.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_80"></a>80     As a deterrent tool, the <em>Curtis</em> test only makes sense if it is not only descriptive but
                    also prescriptive of commercial practice. This prescription is none other than
                    the recognition that it is a highly dangerous and irresponsible practice for
                    companies to leave the power of their directors or shareholders unchecked. For
                    that reason, the fact that “[the appellant’s] business was
                        successful”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_14" id="Ftn_14_1"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span> in
                    granting the Ex-MD overriding power or control is irrelevant in the light of the
                    prescriptive force of the <em>Curtis</em> test. The
                    non-deductibility of such defalcation losses is the risk a company like the
                    appellant must be made to undertake if it intentionally chooses, whether for
                    commercial reasons or otherwise, to leave the power of certain directors or
                    shareholders unchecked.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">E.   The appellant’s position on the <em>Curtis</em> test is not viable</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_81"></a>81     Since the “overriding power or
                    control” test is solely a question of fact, the appellant has a point in
                    submitting that such a test could result in uncertainty. However, I am of the
                    view that the appellant’s understanding of the <em>Curtis</em> test is clearly not a viable substitute.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_82"></a>82     According to the appellant’s
                    understanding of the <em>Curtis</em> test, the court should
                    simply ask whether “the loss arose in the course of the company’s
                    normal trading activities”. In application, this means that as long as
                    the fraudulent transactions, for example, arose out of dealings with suppliers
                    or customers, such defalcations must be deductible since “dealings with
                    suppliers or customers” are part of the company’s normal trading
                    activities. The appellant submitted that this approach would lead to greater
                    certainty than the one applied by the Board.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_83"></a>83     With respect, the appellant’s test may
                    have undesirable consequences. The effect of such a test may be to encourage
                    firms to turn a blind eye towards the power or control wielded by their
                    employees. This is because so long as their employees, especially the high-level
                    ones, “dress up” their defalcations as if they were part of the
                    company’s activities, the losses which they incur would be tax-deductible.
                    In other words, the more sophisticated the fraud, the better it is for tax
                    purposes. Such a result is completely antithetical to the historical, legal and
                    policy grounds which I have expressed earlier that underlie the <em>Curtis</em> test.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">What the test of being “in a position to do exactly what one
                likes” amounts to</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_84"></a>84     The appellant also argued that even if the
                    “overriding power or control” test should apply, the Ex-MD was not
                    in a position to do exactly what he liked and the Board’s comparison with
                        <em>Curtis</em> was therefore not
                        apposite.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_15" id="Ftn_15_1"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span> The appellant took pains to point
                    out that legally, the Ex-MD had no power to defraud the company and the fact
                    that the appellant’s Board of Directors removed him as soon as his
                    misconduct was discovered is clear evidence that he was not in a position to do
                    exactly what he liked.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_16" id="Ftn_16_1"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_85"></a>85     In my view, the appellant is mistaken in
                    assuming that the <em>Curtis</em> test is merely a test of
                    the legal arrangements within a firm. If the appellant’s definition of
                    being “in a position to do exactly what one likes” is adopted, the
                    effect would be not much different from the approach which I have rejected
                    –
                    <em>i.e</em>. did the loss arise in the course of the
                    company’s normal trading activities? A company could easily draw up legal
                    provisions which purportedly govern what its directors can or cannot do, but be
                    nonchalant in checking whether its directors abide by those
                provisions.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_86"></a>86     Therefore, the test of whether the defalcator
                    was “in a position to do exactly what he likes” should be a test
                    of the factual arrangements within the company. Thus, while it would be rare to
                    find listed companies like the appellant<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_17" id="Ftn_17_1"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a></span> legally giving its
                    directors unbridled power, the <em>Curtis</em> test should
                    be applied to pierce through such legal facades and penalize companies which
                    factually did give its directors unjustified overriding power or control. Only
                    when applied as such would the deterrent purpose of the <em>Curtis</em> test stated earlier (see above at <a href="#p1_77">[77]</a>) be fulfilled.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Application of the Curtis test to the facts</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_87"></a>87     Having agreed with the Board’s
                    understanding of the <em>Curtis</em> test, I am also of the
                    view that the Board correctly applied the test to hold that the Loss in the
                    present case should not be tax deductible. While the Ex-MD was not a sole
                    proprietor as in the <em>Curtis</em> case, it cannot be
                    seriously doubted that the <em>Curtis</em> test can extend
                    to other high-level employees who similarly possess overriding power or
                    control.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_88"></a>88     In the present case, the Ex-MD did possess an
                    overriding power or control in the company and the defalcations were in fact
                    committed in the exercise of such power or control.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_89"></a>89     The Board correctly relied on the finding of
                    fact by the DJ in the conviction of the Ex-MD (<em>PP v
                        KCT</em> at [284]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The evidence revealed that no one questioned [the Ex-MD’s]
                        instructions. There was total trust reposed in the [Ex-MD] by virtue of his
                        senior management position. In evidence he said that he need not have to
                        tell anyone about, and (as a fact) he had complete control over, the usage
                        of [the appellant’s] funds.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_90"></a>90     This is clear evidence that the Ex-MD did
                    possess an overriding power or control such that he could do exactly what he
                    liked. The “total trust reposed in the [Ex-MD]” by the appellant
                    factually gave the Ex-MD overriding power or control as he “need not have
                    to tell anyone about ... the usage of [the appellant’s]
                    funds”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_91"></a>91     The defalcations were also committed by the
                    Ex-MD in the exercise of his overriding power or control. In other words, the
                    defalcations were committed by the Ex-MD “<em>qua</em> director” (<em>Cassidy</em> at
                    693). In fact, it was probably only due to his “overriding power or
                    control” as a trusted director that he could execute, as the DJ found
                        (<em>PP v KCT</em> at [288]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">the blatant way in which the monies were siphoned from the company, some
                        in the form of cash cheques, others as company cheques, made out directly in
                        the names of or given to, junket operators, or individuals with no trade
                        dealings with [the appellant]. In most instances the company’s funds
                        were used to repay the [Ex-MD’s] gambling debts and feed his gambling
                        habit.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_92"></a>92     Therefore, because the Ex-MD did possess an
                    overriding power or control in the company and the defalcations were in fact
                    committed in the exercise of such power or control, I dismiss the appeal and
                    uphold the Board’s decision. The Loss due to the Ex-MD’s
                    defalcations does not qualify for deduction under section 14(1) of the
                    Act.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The definition of “mistake” in section 93A(1) of the
                Act</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Background of the dispute</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_93"></a>93     Given that my holding on the first issue
                    disposes of the appeal, there is strictly speaking no need for me to deal with
                    the second issue submitted by the respondent. Nonetheless, I will give reasons
                    to explain why I am of the view that the Board’s definition of an
                    “error or mistake” in section 93A of the Act is preferable to that
                    of the respondent’s.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_94"></a>94     Section 93A(1) reads:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">If any person who has paid tax for any year of assessment alleges that an
                        assessment is excessive by reason of some <em>error or
                            mistake</em> in the return or statement made by him for the
                        purposes of the assessment or, where he is exempted from liability to
                        furnish a return under section 62(2), in the notice of assessment served on
                        him, he may, at any time not later than 6 years (if the year of assessment
                        within which the assessment was made is 2007 or a preceding year of
                        assessment) or 4 years (if the year of assessment within which the
                        assessment is made is 2008 or a subsequent year of assessment) after the end
                        of the year of assessment within which the assessment was made, make an
                        application in writing to the Comptroller for relief. [emphasis
                        added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_95"></a>95     The appellant’s application for the
                    deduction of the Loss due to the Ex-MD’s misappropriation (incurred in YA
                    2000) was made only on 15 December 2005. Therefore, the appellant also had to,
                    on top of arguing that the Loss it incurred is deductible, justify its omission
                    in claiming for the deduction in the appropriate year.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_96"></a>96     Before the Board, the appellant first argued
                    that it had omitted to claim the deduction earlier “due to an
                    oversight”. This was rejected by the Board as the Board found that the
                    appellant’s decision was better characterized as one “made after
                    due consideration that the Loss was not an allowable deduction under section 14
                    of the Act”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_97"></a>97     Nonetheless, the Board was of the opinion that
                    “[i]f the decision [by the appellant] was a mistake it was one of law and
                    still a mistake falling within section 93A of the Act”. In its
                    conclusion, the Board also held that it did not find favour with the
                    respondent’s argument that “error or mistake under section 93A of
                    the Act does not include an erroneous opinion or grossly negligent error, but
                    ‘must be genuinely due to ignorance or
                inadvertence’”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_98"></a>98     Although the Board clarified that this point
                    is merely academic in the scheme of things, the respondent argued in its
                    submissions that the Board erred in rejecting the respondent’s argument
                    that error or mistake under section 93A of the Act must be genuinely due to
                    ignorance or inadvertence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_99"></a>99     Interestingly, the respondent did not submit
                    on whether it agrees that a mistake of law can constitute an “error or
                    mistake” under section 93A(1). The Board disagreed with the
                    respondent’s definition of “error or mistake” as it was of
                    the view that such a definition was too narrow and could not cover a genuine
                    mistake of law.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">A genuine mistake in law can constitute an “error or
                mistake” under section 93A(1)</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_100"></a>100    I agree with the Board’s decision that
                    an “error of mistake” under section 93A(1) should not be confined
                    to merely “ignorance or inadvertence” and should be wide enough to
                    cover genuine mistakes of law. There appears no good reason why genuine mistakes
                    of law (for instance, having received wrong advice from professionals on what
                    expenses are deductible or where the courts have re-interpreted what was thought
                    to be established law) are any less deserving of relief than genuine mistakes of
                    facts (such as computational or arithmetical errors). In both scenarios, the
                    taxpayer’s “error or mistake” pertains solely to the
                    computation of its taxable income and not some other extrinsic
                    considerations.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_101"></a>101    It is on this basis that the Board rightly,
                    in my opinion, distinguished the Hong Kong case of <em>Extramoney
                        Ltd v Commissioner of Inland Revenue</em> [1997] 2 HKC 38
                        (“<em>Extramoney</em>”). In <em>Extramoney</em>, the taxpayer had <em>deliberately</em> attributed profits of another company within the
                    group to itself in order to benefit either itself or other companies within the
                    group structure but that turned out (at least in the view of the liquidators) to
                    be an erroneous judgment call. Chan J held that the “error”
                    claimed did not constitute an “error” under the Hong Kong
                    equivalent of section 93A(1). The learned judge then so opined (at 50):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I do not think that a deliberate act in the sense of a conscientious
                        choice of one out of two or more courses which subsequently turns out to be
                        less than advantageous or which does not give the desired effect as
                        previously hoped for can be regarded as an error within [the equivalent of
                        section 93A(1)].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_102"></a>102    Indeed, if there was any
                    “error” made by the taxpayer in <em>Extramoney</em> to speak of, it was an error with regards to the
                    commercial advantage of attributing the said profits to itself. I agree with the
                    learned judge in <em>Extramoney</em> that such errors are
                    clearly outside the ambit of section 93A(1), which provides only for an
                    “error or mistake in the return or statement made by [the
                    taxpayer]”. It must follow then that genuine mistakes or errors made by
                    the taxpayer <em>in the filling up</em> of the return or
                    statement falls within section 93A(1) and this could have been caused by a
                    genuine mistake of law instead of fact.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">A caveat when dealing with mistakes of law</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_103"></a>103    There is, however, an important caveat to
                    the general rule established above that a genuine mistake of law can entitle a
                    taxpayer to relief. The caveat is found in section 93A(3) of the Act:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">No relief shall be given under this section in respect of an error or
                        mistake as to the basis on which the liability of the applicant ought to
                        have been computed when the return or statement was in fact made on the
                        basis of or in accordance with the practice of the Comptroller generally
                        prevailing at the time when the return or statement was made.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_104"></a>104    It would appear from section 93A(3) that
                    even if the taxpayer was operating under a genuine mistake of law, the taxpayer
                    would not be entitled to relief if the Comptroller, at the material time, was
                        <em>also operating under the same mistake</em>. While
                    not canvassed by the respondent, it seems to me that the respondent could have
                    easily proven that the “practice of the Comptroller generally
                    prevailing” in YA 2000 was to deem losses caused by the defalcations of
                    directors non-deductible under the Act (see <em>DR &amp; P v
                        Comptroller of Income Tax</em> (2001) 5 MSTC 293). It follows that the
                    appellant would not have been able to obtain relief because of section 93A(3) as
                    well. Nonetheless, since both parties did not submit on this point, I do
                    not propose to say anything more on this issue.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_105"></a>105    Thus, while I agree with the Board that a
                    genuine mistake of law is still a mistake falling within section 93A of the Act,
                    the appeal still fails as the appellant has not succeeded on the first
                    issue.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_106"></a>106    In conclusion, the appellant is unable to
                    claim relief under section 93A(1) of the Act because the Loss sustained was not
                    deductible under section 14(1). I therefore dismiss this appeal with
                    costs.</p>
