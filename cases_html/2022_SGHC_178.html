The WICA regime provides an “alternative remedy” to common law damages: <span class="font-italic">Pang Chen </span><span class="font-italic">Suan v Commissioner for Labour</span> [2008] 3 SLR 648 (“<span class="font-italic">Pang Chen </span><span class="font-italic">Suan</span>”) at [23]. To this end, s 33(1) of the WICA 2009 and s 63(1) of the WICA 2019 expressly limit an employee’s right to recover compensation, if the employee has already recovered damages in a court of law or has instituted an action to do so. Does the WICA regime, however, similarly bar an employee from recovering compensation where that employee has received a payment from his employer pursuant to a private settlement between him and his employer (a “settlement payment”) in respect of the same injury? And if there is no bar, does the Commissioner for Labour (the “Commissioner”) have the power to take into account such a settlement payment when assessing the sum of compensation payable by the employer? Further, what (if any) is the interplay between the WICA regime and other legislation such as the Merchant Shipping (Maritime Labour Convention) Act 2014 (Act 6 of 2014) (the “MLCA 2014”), where a settlement payment involving death benefits is concerned?</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 These were among the interesting questions that arose in HC/TA 8/2021, which concerned an appeal by the applicant, MTM Ship Management Pte Ltd, against the Commissioner’s decision to order the applicant to pay compensation to the respondents, despite the applicant having previously made a settlement payment to the first and second respondents.

Briefly, the Vessel was berthed at a loading terminal and about to commence loading a cargo of wheat. At the material time, Mr Gainady was at the forward section of the Vessel assisting to free a mooring rope that had become stuck between the Vessel and a fender at the loading berth. As the mooring rope was being heaved up, it suddenly came free, projected rapidly towards the Vessel and struck Mr Gainady in the face and chest with force. Mr Gainady passed away shortly after on 14 August 2020.

</div> However, the applicant highlighted that although Assistant Commissioner Loh had found the WICA 2009 to be the applicable legislation, the Certificate of Order had in fact been issued under the WICA 2019. This was apparent from the fact that the header on the Certificate of Order stated “Certificate of Order made under the Work Injury Compensation Act <span class="font-italic">2019</span>” [emphasis added].

Nr Ng Yuhui, counsel for the applicant, raised three arguments in support of this position. First, he submitted that the Commissioner was not <span class="font-italic">functus officio </span>after the issuance of the Certificate of Order, as the Commissioner retained residual powers under ss 25A, 25B and 25C of the WICA 2009 to set aside or vary the Certificate of Order, so long as it was just to do so.

In the present case, as the Settlement Sum exceeded the sum that the applicant had been assessed to be liable for (see [13] above), the Commissioner should have ordered that no further compensation was payable by the applicant to the respondents.

Moreover, despite the first respondent herself raising an objection to the Notice of Assessment and the Commissioner subsequently corresponding with the applicant to seek clarification on Mr Gainady’s average monthly earnings (see [11] above), the applicant did not use the opportunity to raise its objection.

Similarly, s 58(1) of the WICA 2019 provides that an order for compensation made by the Commissioner may only be appealed against if the appeal involves a substantial question of law, and the order is for the refusal or payment of compensation of S$1,000 or more. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 Accordingly, regardless of whether the WICA 2009 or the WICA 2019 was the relevant applicable legislation, the applicant had to first fulfil the threshold requirements of showing that (a) there was a substantial question of law involved; and (b) the Certificate of Order was for payment of compensation of a sum of at least S$1,000, in order to have a right of appeal against the Commissioner’s decision. I therefore first considered whether these threshold requirements had been met in this case. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 In my judgment, it is clear that the second requirement did not pose an issue on the present facts. The Certificate of Order directed the applicant to make payment of S$190,703.96, a sum well in excess of S$1,000. As for the remaining requirement that the appeal must involve a substantial question of law, the test for what constitutes a “substantial question of law” was summarised by Chan Seng Onn J in <span class="font-italic">Arpah</span><span class="font-italic"> bte Sabar and others v Colex Environmental Pte Ltd </span>[2019] 5 SLR 509 at [17]–[18], as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">17 As for the substantial question of law, the courts have described the following as constituting errors of law (<span class="font-italic">Karuppiah Ravichandran v GDS Engineering Pte Ltd</span> [2009] 3 SLR(R) 1028 (‘<span class="font-italic">Karuppiah</span>’) at [13], also cited in <span class="font-italic">Pang Chew Kim v Wartsila Singapore Pte Ltd</span> [2012] 1 SLR 15 (‘<span class="font-italic">Pang Chew Kim</span>’) at [20]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Errors of law include misinterpretation of a statute or any other legal document or a rule of common law; asking oneself and answering the wrong question, taking irrelevant considerations into account or <span class="font-italic">failing to take relevant considerations into account</span> when purporting to apply the law to the facts; admitting inadmissible evidence <span class="font-italic">or rejecting admissible and relevant evidence</span>; exercising a discretion on the basis of incorrect legal principles; giving reasons which disclose faulty legal reasoning or which are inadequate to fulfil an express duty to give reasons, and <span class="font-italic">misdirecting oneself as to the burden of proof</span>.

These must be ‘findings that no person would have come to if he had applied the law properly. It does not mean that every manifestly wrong finding of fact amounts to an error of law’ (<span class="font-italic">Karuppiah</span> at [16]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 In addition, I noted that a brief survey of the case law suggests that the requirement of a “substantial question of law” is also fulfilled where novel issues of statutory interpretation are present. For instance, in <span class="font-italic">Pang Chew Kim (next of kin of Poon Wai Tong, deceased) v Wartsila Singapore Pte Ltd and another</span> [2012] 1 SLR 15, Tay Yong Kwang J (as he then was) found that the issues on appeal raised substantial questions of law, partly because the issues to be determined involved a statutory interpretation of s 3(1) of the WICA 2009 – specifically, the meaning to be ascribed to the terms “accident” and “course of employment” (at [21]). Likewise, in <span class="font-italic">Kee </span><span class="font-italic">Yau Chong v S H Interdeco Pte Ltd</span> [2014] 1 SLR 189, George Wei JC (as he then was) considered that the appeal involved a substantial question of law, as one of the main points in contention pertained to how the terms “accident” and “arising out of and in the course of employment” under ss 3(1) and 3(6) of the WICA 2009 should be interpreted (at [19]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 The present case involved, among others, the question of whether the Commissioner has the power under the WICA 2009 or the WICA 2019 to take into account settlement payments made by an employer to an employee when assessing the amount of compensation payable by the employer. As noted above at [26], this was an important question that necessarily involved questions of statutory interpretation. In the circumstances, I was satisfied that a substantial question of law arose on the present facts, and that the applicant was entitled to appeal against the decision of the Commissioner.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Issue 2: Is the applicable legislation the WICA 2009 or the WICA 2019?</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 The next issue that arose for my determination was whether the applicable legislation in the present case should be the WICA 2009 or the WICA 2019. In my view, it was clear that the applicable legislation is the WICA 2009, and not the WICA 2019. Section 84(2) of the WICA 2019 provides as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Repeal and saving and transitional provisions</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">84.</span>— …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(2) … the [WICA 2009] continues to apply, as if [the WICA 2019] had not been enacted, to any personal injury caused by an accident to an employee, or disease contracted by an employee, if the date of the accident for that personal injury or disease is before the date of commencement of this section.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">Section 84(2) of the WICA 2019 came into force on 1 September 2020.

The objective evidence did not suggest, for instance, that Assistant Commissioner Loh had sought to issue the Certificate of Order in an exercise of his powers under the WICA 2019 rather than the WICA 2009, or that he had been under any misapprehension as to the powers available to him. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 In a similar vein, I disagreed with the applicant that it had been prejudiced because of the purported issuance of the Certificate of Order under the WICA 2019.

</div> While the applicant may have commenced the present appeal under s 58 of the WICA 2019, the applicant was clearly prepared to mount alternative arguments depending on whether I considered the WICA 2009 or the WICA 2019 to be the applicable legislation, as is evident from the summary of its case at [19]–[23] above. In any case, the applicant ultimately aligned itself with Assistant Commissioner Loh’s conclusion that the WICA 2009 was the applicable legislation.

</div> Accordingly, while the Certificate of Order erroneously referred to the WICA 2019, I did not consider this error to be material or fatal for the purposes of this appeal, and I was not prepared to set aside the Certificate of Order because of this technicality.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Issue 3: Should the Certificate of Order be set aside?</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Whether the Commissioner was functus officio after the issuance of the Certificate of Order</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 With the preliminary issues out of the way, I then turned to consider the main issue in this appeal, which was whether the Commissioner had erred in refusing to take into account the applicant’s belated objection.

Section 25B(4) grants the Commissioner the power to set aside or vary any compensation order that is made after a party defaults in complying with directions given <span class="font-italic">at a pre-hearing conference</span>. Lastly, s 25C(2) permits the Commissioner to set aside or vary an order made in the <span class="font-italic">absence </span>of a party concerned or affected by the order. It was apparent to me that none of these provisions applied to the present factual matrix. I therefore rejected the applicant’s argument that ss 25A, 25B and 25C of the WICA 2009 conferred residual powers upon the Commissioner to set aside or vary the Certificate of Order, such that he was not <span class="font-italic">functus officio </span>after its issuance.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 Next, I agreed with Assistant Commissioner Loh that he was “legally required” to disregard the applicant’s belated objection.

</div> This was in line with s 25(1) of the WICA 2009 (reproduced at [17] above), which provides that an employer or person claiming compensation “shall” give notice of his objection within 14 days after the service of the notice of assessment, or “such longer period as the Commissioner may, in his discretion, allow”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 It was not disputed that the applicant did not raise an objection to the Notice of Assessment during the 14-day period prescribed under s 25(1) of the WICA 2009, which was stipulated in the Notice of Assessment. While the Commissioner has a discretion under s 25(1) to extend the period for raising objections to the Notice of Assessment, s 25(2) makes clear that this discretion is not without limits. Section 25(2) provides that the Commissioner <span class="font-italic">shall </span>disregard any objections raised “outside of the period allowed for objections under subsection (1)”. In my view, the word “shall” means that once the period for raising objections has lapsed and a Certificate of Order is issued, the Commissioner <span class="font-italic">no longer </span>possesses any discretion to extend the period for raising objections, or to consider late objections. In the present case, by the time the applicant raised its objection to the Notice of Assessment on 4 March 2021 at 4.24pm, it is clear that the period for raising objections had by then <span class="font-italic">already </span>lapsed and that the Commissioner had issued the Certificate of Order (see [11]–[12] above). I therefore disagreed with the applicant that the power under s 25(1) to consider late objections remained available to the Commissioner at that point in time.

</div> Accordingly, the first respondent’s objection, which was raised on 9 February 2021, had been made after the prescribed 14-day period for raising objections and was late.

Unlike the applicant, the first respondent had raised her objection <span class="font-italic">before</span> the issuance of the Certificate of Order – that was a critical point of distinction. As explained at [46] above, this meant that it was still open to the Commissioner, at that point in time, to exercise his discretion under s 25(1) of the WICA 2009 to extend the time for the respondents to raise objections. Once the extension was allowed by the Commissioner, the extended deadline would then constitute the “period allowed for objections under [s 25(1)]”, <span class="font-italic">per</span> s 25(2) of the WICA 2009. By contrast, by the time the applicant raised its objection, the time for raising objections had lapsed <span class="font-italic">and</span> the Certificate of Order had been issued. The Commissioner was, in those circumstances, required under s 25(2) of the WICA 2009 to disregard the applicant’s objection, and the question of extending time to object had by then been rendered moot.

</div> Accordingly, it appeared to me that some latitude had been accorded to the first respondent, given that she could not have raised an objection to the Notice of Assessment at an earlier date, and that she had raised her objection promptly after receiving the Notice of Assessment on 5 February 2021.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 On the other hand, no satisfactory explanation was given for the applicant’s failure to raise its objection in a timely manner.

Nor did I agree that the applicant was in fact <span class="font-italic">required </span>to wait until the Certificate of Order had been issued, to disclose the payment of the Settlement Sum (see [21] above). As is clear from [45]–[46] above, both s 25 of the WICA 2009 and the Notice of Assessment expressly provide that any objections had to be raised within 14 days, or else be disregarded by the Commissioner.

The prescribed form for raising an objection, which had been attached to the Notice of Assessment, clearly allowed for such an objection, given that the section for indicating the grounds of an objection included an option labelled “[o]thers (please specify)”.

</div> Even if a settlement payment to a deceased seaman’s next-of-kin can be characterised as a payment of compensation under the MLCA 2014 regime (which is an issue I did not need to make a specific finding on in this case), the Commissioner is not obliged to take such a payment into account under the WICA 2009. Sections 20(<span class="font-italic">e</span>)–20(<span class="font-italic">f</span>) of the WICA 2009 provide that any compensation payable under the WICA 2009 will be reduced by compensation received under the MLCA 2014 in two specific instances, as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Special provisions relating to seamen</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">20. </span>This Act shall apply to seamen who are employees within the meaning of this Act, subject to the following modifications:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">e</span>) where a seaman has received payment under section 35 of the [MLCA 2014] <span class="font-italic">for the cost of medical treatment in respect of any injury</span> within the meaning of this Act, the amount of compensation payable to the seaman under section 14(2) for the cost of medical treatment in respect of that injury shall be reduced by the amount so received;</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">f</span>) where a seaman has received payment under section 36 of the [MLCA 2014] <span class="font-italic">for loss of earnings in respect of any injury</span> within the meaning of this Act, the amount of compensation payable to the seaman under section 14A <span class="font-italic">for any temporary incapacity resulting from that injury</span> shall be reduced by the amount so received…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 Neither of these provisions provide for a similar reduction in compensation payable under the WICA 2009 for the <span class="font-italic">death</span> of a seaman, where compensation has been paid under the MLCA 2014. Under the WICA 2009, compensation for medical treatment is distinct from compensation for a fatal injury. This much is clear from the Third Schedule to the WICA 2009, in which the amount of compensation for medical treatment is stipulated in para 5, whereas the amount of compensation for the death of an employee is stipulated in para 1. Likewise, compensation for temporary incapacity is covered separately in para 4 of the Third Schedule and is, by definition, different from compensation for a fatal injury. Sections 20(<span class="font-italic">e</span>)–20(<span class="font-italic">f</span>) of the WICA 2009 therefore do not oblige the Commissioner to reduce any compensation payable under the WICA 2009 for the death of a seaman, even if the seaman’s next-of-kin may have received compensation under the MLCA 2014 in respect of the same injury.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 Further, while s 33(1) of the WICA 2009 prevents an employee from obtaining double compensation under the WICA 2009 and at common law, settlement payments made out-of-court by the employer to the employee are unlikely to fall within the scope of this provision. Section 33(1) of the WICA 2009 provides:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Limitation of employee’s right of action</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">33.</span>—(1) Nothing in this Act shall be deemed to confer any right to compensation on an employee in respect of any injury if he has instituted an action for damages in respect of that injury in any court against his employer or if he has recovered damages in respect of that injury in any court from his employer.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 The word “court” in s 33(1) of the WICA 2009 is not “mere surplusage”: Ravi Chandran, <span class="font-italic">Employment Law in Singapore </span>(LexisNexis, 6th Ed, 2019) at para 7.227. It is also a trite canon of statutory interpretation that Parliament does not legislate in vain, and the courts should therefore endeavour to give significance to every word in a statutory provision: <span class="font-italic">Tan Cheng Bock v Attorney-General</span> [2017] 2 SLR 850 (“<span class="font-italic">Tan Cheng Bock</span>”) at [38]. I therefore agreed with the <span class="font-italic">amicus</span> that s 33(1) only prevents an employee from bringing a claim under the WICA 2009 where that employee <span class="font-italic">has</span> instituted an action against his employer or recovered damages from his employer <span class="font-italic">in court</span>. Accordingly, even if the underlying intent of s 33(1) is to prevent an employee from obtaining double compensation from his employer, s 33(1) does not<span class="font-italic"> </span>prevent an employee from bringing a claim under the WICA 2009 in addition to receiving an out-of-court settlement payment from his employer. Nor does s 33(1) of the WICA 2009 oblige the Commissioner to take the settlement payment into account, when assessing the sum of compensation payable. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 As noted above at [22], the applicant submitted that even if the Commissioner is not required to take settlement payments into consideration, the Commissioner nonetheless has the power to do so under ss 25B(5) or 9(1A)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the WICA 2009. Section 25B(5) provides as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Pre-hearing conferences to be held when directed by Commissioner</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">25B.</span>— …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(5) At any time during the pre-hearing conference where the parties are agreeable to a settlement of some or all of the matters for hearing, the Commissioner may record that settlement and make an order to give effect to the settlement.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 I found it apparent from the plain wording of s 25B(5) of the WICA 2009 that the provision pertains to the Commissioner’s powers to record a settlement reached between the parties in the context of a <span class="font-italic">pre-hearing conference</span>. Accordingly, s 25B(5) of the WICA 2009 was not relevant in the present case. I therefore turned to consider the applicant’s remaining argument, that the Commissioner is empowered under s 9(1A)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the WICA 2009 to take into account settlement payments made by an employer to an employee when assessing the compensation payable. As noted above at [29], the <span class="font-italic">amicus</span> agreed with this argument. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 Sections 9(1) and 9(1A)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the WICA 2009 provide as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Distribution of compensation</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">9.</span>—(1) Subject to subsection (1A), no payment of compensation in respect of an employee whose injury has resulted in death or permanent incapacity shall be made otherwise than by deposit with the Commissioner, and any such payment made directly to the employee or his dependant shall be deemed not to be payment of compensation for the purposes of this Act.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(1A) The Commissioner may —</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) take into account any amount paid otherwise than in accordance with subsection (1) in assessing the compensation payable under this Act if he considers it fair and reasonable to do so.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 I agreed with the applicant and the <span class="font-italic">amicus</span> that the Commissioner <span class="font-italic">does</span> have the power under s 9(1A)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the WICA 2009 to take into account settlement payments made by an employer to an employee when assessing the amount of compensation payable, if the Commissioner considers it fair and reasonable to do so. I reached this conclusion for three reasons, which I detail below.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Plain meaning of s 9(1A)(b) of the WICA 2009</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 First, it is well established that the first step of statutory interpretation is to ascertain the possible interpretations of the provision, having regard to the ordinary meaning of the words of the legislative provision: <span class="font-italic">Tan Cheng Bock </span>at [38]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 In my view, the ordinary meaning of s 9(1A)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) confers upon the Commissioner the discretion to take settlement payments into account – a payment made pursuant to a private settlement clearly constitutes a payment “made otherwise than by deposit with the Commissioner”, since it is a payment that would be made directly by an employer to an employee or the employee’s dependants. Moreover, the wording of s 9(1A)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) indicates that the Commissioner has a wide discretion in this respect, since he may take into consideration “any amount”, so long as he thinks it “fair and reasonable” to do so. To conclude otherwise would strain the plain meaning of the provision, since there is nothing on the face of the provision to suggest that settlement payments made by an employer to an employee (prior to an assessment of compensation by the Commissioner) should not<span class="font-italic"> </span>be taken into account.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 I was therefore prepared to find that based on the plain meaning of s 9(1A)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) alone, the Commissioner is entitled (but not obliged) to take into account settlement payments paid directly to an employee when assessing the sum of compensation payable under the WICA 2009.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Legislative history of s 9(1A)(b) of the WICA 2009</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 Second, I found that the legislative history of s 9(1A)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the WICA 2009 also supported my conclusion.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 The wording of s 9(1A)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the WICA 2009 first appeared as s 9(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the Workmen’s Compensation Act (Act 25 of 1975) (the “WCA 1975”). Sections 9(1) and 9(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the WCA 1975 are <span class="font-italic">in </span><span class="font-italic">pari materia </span>with ss 9(1) and 9(1A)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the WICA 2009, and state as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Distribution of compensation</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">9</span>.—(1) No payment of compensation in respect of a workman whose injury has resulted in death or permanent incapacity shall be made otherwise than by deposit with the Commissioner, and any such payment made directly to the workman or his dependant shall be deemed not to be payment of compensation for the purposes of this Act:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Provided that the Commissioner may —</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) take into account any amount paid otherwise than in accordance with this subsection in assessing the compensation payable under this Act if he considers it fair and reasonable to do so.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 There is no mention in the Explanatory Statement to the Workmen’s Compensation Bill 1975 (Bill No 5/1975) (the “WCA 1975 Bill”), or the corresponding parliamentary debates, of why s 9(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) was enacted in the WCA 1975. Section 9(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the WCA 1975 was subsequently re-numbered as s 9(1A)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) in the Workmen’s Compensation Act (Cap 354, 1998 Rev Ed) (the “WCA 1998”), and retained without amendment in the WICA 2009. However, there was likewise no mention of the legislative intent behind the enactment of s 9(1A)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) in the parliamentary debates for the bills tabled relating to the WCA 1998 or the WICA 2009.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 In the circumstances, I found it relevant to consider the legislative intent behind the enactment of the WCA 1975 as a whole. The WCA 1975 was enacted to, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, implement a new system of administration where the Commissioner would have greater responsibility and oversight over the process of quantifying compensation payable. Under the predecessor legislation to the WCA 1975, the Workmen’s Compensation Act (Cap 130) (the “WCA 1971”), both the employer and employee had to expressly agree to the Commissioner’s assessment of compensation payable. If any dispute arose over the employer’s liability or the quantum of compensation payable, the Commissioner would have to hold an inquiry to see if an agreement could be reached between the Commissioner, the employer and the employee, failing which the dispute would be referred to an arbitrator. The scheme under the WCA 1971 was explained at the second reading of the WCA 1975 Bill (<span class="font-italic">Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report</span> (26 March 1975) vol 34 at cols 1037–1038 (Mr Ong Pang Boon, Minister for Labour)) as such:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Under the 1971 Act, the Commissioner for Labour will assess the amount of compensation payable and this assessment is then sent to the parties concerned. Since the Act does not provide for a time limit for the employer to either object to the assessment or to pay the compensation, a great number of employers have in the past deliberately ignored the notice of assessment. It is only after repeated reminders that we get a response from the employer. <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The employer may further delay payment of compensation by disputing either the extent of his liability to pay compensation or the extent of dependency of the claimants on the earnings of the deceased worker.</span> Under the Act, full compensation is payable only if there has been full dependency and proportionate payment if there is partial dependency. <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">In either of the cases </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">that I have just mentioned, an inquiry has to be held by the Commissioner for Labour which is often a long-drawn affair.

Accordingly, the WCA 1975 was enacted to implement a new system that allowed for more expeditious payment of workmen’s compensation. As stated in the Explanatory Statement to the WCA 1975 Bill:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Part III of the Bill provides for an entirely new system of administration and enforcement instead of the existing system of recording of agreements and arbitration.</span> Clause 24 empowers the Commissioner to assess compensation and to make an order on the amount of compensation payable. If after service of a notice of assessment of compensation no objection is received within two weeks the assessment made by the Commissioner shall be deemed to have been agreed upon by the interested parties. No appeal will lie against an assessment to which both parties are deemed to have agreed upon. Clause 25 provides that if an objection is received with respect to the Commissioner’s assessment of compensation the Commissioner will as soon as practicable conduct a hearing of the case and will make such order after the hearing as he thinks just. Under clause 26 the Commissioner may appoint one or more persons possessing special knowledge of any matter to assist him. Clause 28 provides that an order made by the Commissioner as a result of the hearing will be enforced as a judgment of a District Court. Under clause 29 no appeal will lie therefrom to the High Court except on any substantial question of law where the amount in dispute is not less than one thousand dollars. <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The new procedure which is provided in this Part of the Bill will enable compensation to be assessed and paid to an injured workman more expeditiously than is possible under the existing system. </span>Clause 32 enables proceedings to be brought directly against an insurer who has issued a policy of insurance covering an employer against liability for workmen’s compensation.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added in bold italics]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 The legislative intent behind the enactment of the WCA 1975 was therefore to, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, give the Commissioner more autonomy and oversight over the assessment of compensation. While previously an arbitrator would be responsible for ultimately deciding any dispute over quantum or liability, under the WCA 1975, the Commissioner was responsible for both the initial assessment of compensation payable and the resolution of any disputes. Moreover, while the employer and employee previously had to expressly agree to the Commissioner’s assessment of compensation, the WCA 1975 provided that parties would be <span class="font-italic">deemed </span>to have agreed to the Commissioner’s assessment if no objections were raised within the stipulated timeline. Against this backdrop, the insertion of s 9(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) in the WCA 1975 might be seen as part of the general expansion of the Commissioner’s role and powers, to ensure that the Commissioner had sufficient latitude to achieve what he considered to be a fair and reasonable outcome depending on the facts and circumstances of the case before him.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 In the circumstances, if there was any doubt over whether s 9(1A)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the WICA 2009 should be interpreted such that the Commissioner has the power to take into account settlement payments when assessing the sum of compensation payable, I found that a broader and more expansive interpretation (<span class="font-italic">ie, </span>that the Commissioner <span class="font-italic">does </span>have such a power) better accorded with the legislative history of the provision and, in my judgment, should therefore be preferred.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">71 This broader interpretation of s 9(1A)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the WICA 2009 would also fit better with the comments of the then-Minister for Manpower, Mr Gan Kim Yong (“Minister Gan”), at the second reading of the Workmen’s Compensation (Amendment) Bill (the “2008 Bill”) on 22 January 2008. In response to a question on whether employees who are covered by multiple insurance policies would be entitled to double recovery, Minister Gan stated as follows (<span class="font-italic">Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report </span>(22 January 2008) vol 84 at col 294 (Mr Gan Kim Yong, Minister of State for Manpower)):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Dr Magad also asked whether employees who are covered under insurance, such as group term life and personal accident insurance, need to be additionally covered for work injury compensation as well. He also asked if double recovery from these various policies was possible. Sir, <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">there is no change to the current approach.</span> Employers are allowed to buy one or more insurance policies to cover all their liabilities under the Work Injury Compensation Act. <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">In assessing the amount of compensation payable under the Act, the Commissioner may </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">take into account other payments made by the employer to the employee for their injury.</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added in bold italics]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">72 As is clear from the above passage, the implication of Minister Gan’s response is that the Commissioner had the power, even <span class="font-italic">before</span> the passing of the 2008 Bill, to consider insurance pay-outs made by an employer to an employee when assessing the amount of compensation payable. While Minister Gan did not refer to any specific statutory provision in his response, the only provision in force at that time that appeared to confer such a power upon the Commissioner was s 9(1A)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the WCA 1998.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">73 As noted above at [66], s 9(1A)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the WCA 1998 was retained without amendment in the WICA 2009. Thus, it can be reasonably inferred that the Commissioner likewise has the power under s 9(1A)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the WICA 2009 to take into account payments made by an employer to an employee. While Minister Gan’s comments were made with reference to insurance pay-outs from an employer to an employee, I did not see any reason to differentiate between insurance pay-outs and settlement payments for present purposes, and none was suggested to me. In any case, as I have noted above at [8], the Settlement Sum represented the amount that the applicant was required to maintain by way of personal accident insurance coverage under the SOS CBA. Pursuant to cl 27.1 of the SOS CBA, the applicant was required to “effect a 24-hour insurance coverage” in accordance with Appendix IV to the SOS CBA, for payment of compensation to a seaman for any injury or death arising from an accident while in the employment of the applicant.

</div> Thus, the Settlement Sum would, in my judgment, fall squarely within the example of an insurance pay-out referred to by Minister Gan. In my view, the passage at [71] above bolstered the conclusion that the Commissioner is empowered under s 9(1A)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the WICA 2009 to consider settlement payments made by an employer to an employee, including the Settlement Sum in the present case, when assessing the compensation payable.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The legislative intent behind the WICA 2009</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">74 Finally, I was guided by the fact that none of the relevant sources suggests that the legislative intent of the WICA 2009 was to permit employees to avoid the principle of deductibility <span class="font-italic">by default</span>. As highlighted by the <span class="font-italic">amicus</span>, the principle of deductibility operates in common law claims such that any financial gain that would not have accrued to the plaintiff, but for the injury sustained by the plaintiff, would <span class="font-italic">prima facie </span>be deducted from the sum of damages payable: <span class="font-italic">Hussain v New Taplow Paper Mills Ltd</span> [1988] AC 514 at 527, applied in <span class="font-italic">The “</span><span class="font-italic">MARA”</span> [2000] 3 SLR(R) 31 (“<span class="font-italic">The M</span><span class="font-italic">ara</span>”) at [26]. Accordingly, it would stand to reason that if an employee were to bring a common law claim against his employer for an injury sustained in the course of his employment, any settlement payment made by the employer in respect of the same injury would ordinarily be deducted from any damages assessed to be payable, unless considerations of “justice, reasonableness and public policy” dictate otherwise (<span class="font-italic">The M</span><span class="font-italic">ara </span>at [29]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">75 As an aside, I note that there are certain recognised exceptions to the principle of deductibility. For instance, payments received by a plaintiff pursuant to an insurance policy that he has paid the premium for, as well as payments received as a result of the benevolence of third parties prompted by sympathy for the plaintiff’s misfortune, are not ordinarily deductible from the damages recoverable (<span class="font-italic">The M</span><span class="font-italic">ara </span>at [28]). Likewise, as the Court of Appeal held in <span class="font-italic">The M</span><span class="font-italic">ara</span>, an <span class="font-italic">ex gratia</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>payment from an employer will not be deductible where the evidence shows that the intent behind the payment was to confer a benefit upon the employee independent of any claim for damages in law (at [43]). I was not concerned with these exceptions for the purposes of the present case. These exceptions also do not detract from the basic rule that common law damages for negligence are meant to be compensatory in nature (<span class="font-italic">The M</span><span class="font-italic">ara </span>at [26]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">76 The WICA regime was enacted to serve a similar compensatory purpose. It was created as an alternative remedy to common law damages and designed to provide “a simpler and quicker way to settle compensation claims by avoiding protracted legal proceedings”, since proof of fault is not necessary: <span class="font-italic">Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report</span> (22 January 2008) vol 84 at col 259 (Mr Gan Kim Yong, Minister of State for Manpower). As stated by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Pang Chen </span><span class="font-italic">Suan </span>at [23]–[24]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">23 The objective of the Act is to provide no-fault compensation to injured workmen as an alternative remedy to common law damages which are invariably higher than workmen’s compensation. …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">24 …<span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The object of the Act is not to give to workmen the right of double recovery of compensation and damages for the same injury but to give them compensation even if the employers have not failed in their common law or statutory duties to provide them with a safe working environment, or if they themselves are negligent in the performance of their work.</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added in bold italics]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">77 In other words, the WICA regime provides employees with the option of claiming compensation in one of two scenarios:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) First, where the employee would otherwise have been able to obtain common law damages from his employer, the WICA regime provides an alternative and simpler route to obtaining compensation. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Second, where the employee would <span class="font-italic">not </span>have been able to obtain common law damages from his employer (<span class="font-italic">eg</span>, because the employer was not at fault), the WICA regime nonetheless provides a measure of compensation to the employee. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">78 Crucially, there is nothing to suggest that in either of these scenarios, the WICA regime was designed to provide a <span class="font-italic">more </span>generous measure of compensation than what would be recoverable at common law. In respect of the first scenario at [77(a)] above, the opposite is in fact true – precisely because claims under the WICA regime do not require proof of fault, the quantum of compensation available under the WICA regime is set lower than potential awards for common law claims: <span class="font-italic">Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report</span> (28 February 2007) vol 82 at col 2013 (Dr Ng Eng Hen, Minister for Manpower). In respect of the second scenario at [77(b)] above, claimants who fall under this scenario would recover more compensation by lodging a claim under the WICA regime than by instituting a common law claim (since by definition, the claimants under this scenario would not have a claim at common law). Nonetheless, there is nothing in the WICA regime or its legislative history that indicates that the WICA was enacted to provide a higher measure of compensation than what would hypothetically have been awarded to such claimants at common law, had their claims succeeded.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">79 In the circumstances, I found that the legislative intent of the WICA 2009 could not have been to allow an employee who has already received a settlement payment from his employer, to also<span class="font-italic"> </span>obtain compensation in respect of the same injury <span class="font-italic">as of right</span> and without exception. This would effectively allow the employee to avoid the principle of deductibility which would have applied to a claim for common law damages, and consequently, provide a more generous measure of compensation to the employee. Moreover, insofar as the principle of deductibility encourages employers to make payments to injured employees (see [31] above), I found that this cohered with the legislative intent behind the WICA regime. As I have explained at [76] above, the WICA regime was enacted to facilitate quicker payment of compensation to workmen. To the extent that the principle of deductibility also encourages employers to be proactive in making settlement payments to employees for work injuries suffered, rather than simply waiting and reacting to a claim, I found that encouraging such proactive conduct resonated with the purpose of the WICA regime. In my view, this afforded a further reason why the WICA 2009 should be interpreted consistent with, and not to the exclusion of, the principle of deductibility.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">80 For the above reasons, it would better accord with the overall legislative intent behind the WICA 2009 for s 9(1A)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) to be interpreted such that the Commissioner <span class="font-italic">does</span> have the power to take into account settlement payments when assessing the amount of compensation payable for an employee’s death. This, in my view, would permit the Commissioner to deduct settlement payments from any compensation assessed to be payable where he deems it fair and reasonable to do so on the particular facts of the case before him. In essence, the Commissioner would be able to exercise this discretionary power, where appropriate, in a manner similar to the operation of the principle of deductibility at common law.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">81 For the avoidance of doubt, while I have noted that the Commissioner is not required<span class="font-italic"> </span>under the WICA 2009 to take settlement payments into consideration (at [53] above), I did not consider this to be an indication that an employee is therefore <span class="font-italic">entitled </span>to recover work injury compensation <span class="font-italic">in addition to</span> receiving a settlement payment for the same injury, without any account being taken of the latter. The fact that the Commissioner is not obliged to take into account settlement payments <span class="font-italic">per </span><span class="font-italic">se</span>, simply goes to the discretion and latitude that the Commissioner has in determining what is “fair and reasonable” on the facts of each case. For instance, where the facts of the case indicate that the settlement payment received by the employee was intended by the employer to be independent of any compensation received by the employee under the WICA 2009, the Commissioner might decide to exclude such a payment from consideration. As I have explained at [68]–[69] above, it is the very intent and design of the WICA regime that the Commissioner should have broad powers to determine the appropriate measure of compensation in each case.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">82 To summarise this section, I found that the Commissioner <span class="font-italic">is</span> empowered under s 9(1A)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the WICA 2009 to take into account settlement payments when assessing the sum of compensation payable. Following from this conclusion, I turned to assess the appropriate sum of compensation payable by the applicant to the respondents in the present case. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The appropriate amount of compensation payable by the applicant under the WICA 2009</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">83 I found that the effect of the payment of the Settlement Sum to the first and second respondents was to reduce the amount of compensation payable by the applicant to nil. In my judgment, this was a fair and reasonable outcome in this case, given that the Settlement Sum in fact exceeded the compensation that the Commissioner had assessed to be payable by the applicant. As I noted above at [13], the Settlement Sum paid to the first and second respondents was the equivalent of US$144,000 in Indian Rupees, while the compensation the applicant had been ordered to pay under the Certificate of Order amounted to approximately US$139,213.89. Moreover, the available evidence did not suggest that the Settlement Sum was intended to be paid to the first and second respondents independent of any claim brought under the WICA 2009. In this regard, I found that the object of the SOS CBA was simply to ensure that the <span class="font-italic">minimum </span>compensation obtained by an employee (or his beneficiaries), in the event of an injury, would be the amount stated in Appendix IV to the SOS CBA. Accordingly, if an employee brought a claim under the WICA 2009 and the amount assessed to be payable was less than what was stated in Appendix IV to the SOS CBA, the applicant was obliged to supplement the difference pursuant to cl 27.4 of the SOS CBA (at [12] above). Conversely, if a settlement payment was made to an employee pursuant to the SOS CBA, prior to a claim being lodged under the WICA 2009, it followed that the settlement payment should stand as credit to any amount assessed to be payable under the WICA 2009. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">84 In any case, it was clear from the Deed and receipts signed by the first and second respondents that the Settlement Sum was paid in settlement of all potential claims they might have had against the applicant. As noted above at [9], the first and second respondents confirmed under the Deed that they no longer had “any claims or demands whatsoever” against the applicant, and likewise acknowledged under the receipts that they had received the Settlement Sum in “full and final payment, settlement and discharge” of any and all claims for compensation.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">85 I therefore found that the Settlement Sum provided fair and adequate compensation to the respondents in this case. Notwithstanding the tragedy that befell Mr Gainady, to allow the respondents to recover more under the WICA 2009 would, in my view, risk permitting double recovery. As I elaborated at [79] above, this was not the intention of Parliament in enacting the WICA 2009.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Whether the SOS CBA was the governing agreement</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">86 For completeness, I found that, contrary to the first respondent’s contention, the relevant agreement governing the payment of settlement sums by the applicant to the first and second respondents was the SOS CBA, not the ITF CBA. First, I noted that Mr Gainady’s employment contract with the applicant expressly refers to a document known as the “SMOU/SOS CBA”.

</div> However, there was no mention at all of the ITF CBA in Mr Gainady’s employment contract. Nor was the copy of the ITF CBA that was exhibited in the first respondent’s affidavit signed by anyone. In the circumstances, I found that the ITF CBA did not form part of Mr Gainady’s employment contract with the applicant.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Can settlement payments be taken into account when assessing the amount of compensation payable under the WICA 2019?</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">87 Given my finding above at [39] that the WICA <span class="font-italic">2009</span> was the applicable legislation in this case, I did not have to consider (a) whether the Commissioner has the power under the WICA <span class="font-italic">2019</span> to take into account settlement payments when assessing the sum of compensation payable; or (b) the question of the interplay (if any) between the MLCA 2014 and the WICA 2019. Nonetheless, I conclude by making some general observations about these issues.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">88 First, there is no provision in the WICA 2019 that is <span class="font-italic">in </span><span class="font-italic">pari materia </span>with s 9(1A)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the WICA 2009, or any provision that expressly allows the Commissioner to take into account settlement payments when determining the sum of compensation payable. However, there is also no mention in the relevant parliamentary debates as to the reason s 9(1A)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the WICA 2009 is absent from the WICA 2019. In the circumstances, I would hesitate to conclude that the absence of s 9(1A)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the WICA 2009 in the WICA 2019 necessarily means that Parliament intended to <span class="font-italic">remove</span> the Commissioner’s power to consider settlement payments when determining the sum of compensation payable. As elaborated on at [78]–[80] above, this would appear to detract from the overarching legislative intent behind the WICA regime and accordingly, is unlikely to be a legislative change that Parliament would make without express mention of its intent to do so.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">89 It may well be the case that the Commissioner’s power to take into account settlement payments has been subsumed under other provisions in the WICA 2019. In this regard, I noted that s 51 of the WICA 2019 provides as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Settlement of compensation</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">51.</span>—(1) Where a claimant and the employer or the employer’s insurer settle a claim for compensation under this Act, the claimant and the employer or employer’s insurer (as the case may be) may —</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) enter into a settlement agreement, stating the amount of compensation payable, whether as a lump sum or a periodical payment; and</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) apply for the settlement agreement to be recorded by the Commissioner as an order under subsection (2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>).</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(2) The Commissioner may —</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) record the terms of the settlement and make any order to give effect to the settlement; or</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) refuse to record the settlement and make a direction under section 50(1).</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">90 As noted above at [23] and [29], both the applicant and the <span class="font-italic">amicus</span> took the position that s 51(2) of the WICA 2019 permits the Commissioner to take into account settlement payments or a settlement reached between an employer and an employee, when determining whether any further compensation should be payable under the WICA 2019. In a similar vein, I also noted that s 54(1)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the WICA 2019 provides as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Powers of Commissioner</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">54.</span>—(1) The Commissioner has the power to do any of the following in determining the compensation payable under this Act:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) make an order for the payment of compensation or refusal of compensation, as the Commissioner thinks just.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">91 It remains a question open for future determination whether the phrase “make any order to give effect to the settlement”, as found in s 51(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the WICA 2019, or the Commissioner’s power in s 54(1)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) to make an order as he “thinks just”, can be read to encompass a power to take into account settlement payments when determining the compensation payable. A potential difficulty with relying on s 51(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the WICA 2019 is that under s 51(1), the settlement must be for a “claim for compensation under this Act”. As such, if a settlement payment is made at a point in time when no claim for compensation under the WICA 2019 has been lodged or contemplated, the provision may not apply if or when a claim under the WICA 2019 is subsequently made. Nonetheless, assuming it was not Parliament’s intention to exclude such a power from the WICA 2019 regime, I would hope that the relevant provisions in the WICA 2019 do indeed continue to encompass this power, or failing which, that Parliament will consider making appropriate legislative amendments. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">92 Second, ss 67(2)–67(3) of the WICA 2019 are <span class="font-italic">in </span><span class="font-italic">pari materia </span>with ss 20(<span class="font-italic">e</span>)–20(<span class="font-italic">f</span>) of the WICA 2009. The purpose of ss 67(2)–67(3) of the WICA 2019 is to prevent an employee from obtaining double recovery under the MLCA 2014 and the WICA regime for medical expenses, and/or payment for loss of earnings during a period of temporary incapacity: see the Explanatory Statement for cl 67 of the Work Injury Compensation Bill (Bill No 21/2019).
