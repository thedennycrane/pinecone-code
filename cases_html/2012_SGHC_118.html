<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       This case concerns the
                    aftermath of a joint venture deal that turned sour. The
                    plaintiff, Sembcorp Marine Ltd (“Sembcorp”),
                    and the first defendant, PPL Holdings Pte Ltd (“PPL
                    Holdings”) entered into a joint venture arrangement
                    in 2001 in order to capture a segment of the offshore oil
                    rig construction market. The joint venture company was the
                    second defendant in the counterclaim, PPL Shipyard Pte Ltd
                    (“PPL Shipyard”), with Sembcorp and PPL
                    Holdings each holding 50% of the shares in PPLS. In brief,
                    Sembcorp contended that PPL Holdings had acted in such a way
                    as to drop out of the joint venture arrangement, leaving a
                    Chinese company, Yangzijiang Shipbuilding (Holdings) Limited
                    (“Yangzijiang”), in its place. This would be a
                    highly undesirable situation for Sembcorp, because
                    Yangzijiang is a Chinese rig building company which wishes
                    to enter the Singapore market and which Sembcorp alleged to
                    be its competitor. Sembcorp’s case was that PPL
                    Holdings’ actions left Sembcorp in the unenviable
                    position of being a partner in a joint venture with a
                    competitor.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The issues that arise in
                    this case pertain mainly to the question of whether certain
                    terms can be implied into the agreements between the parties
                    and also other questions of contractual interpretation. The
                    reliefs claimed by Sembcorp include an order that PPLH
                    transfer to Sembcorp the shares in PPLS that PPLH had agreed
                    to transfer to Yangzijiang and declarations to the effect
                    that the joint venture agreement between the parties has
                    been terminated. In the counterclaim, PPLH claimed,
                        <em>inter alia</em>, declaratory
                    relief that certain resolutions passed by directors
                    nominated by Sembcorp to the PPLS board of directors be
                    invalidated.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The background</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The parties</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       Quite apart from the named
                    parties to this action, there were also a number of
                    companies and natural persons who played pivotal roles in
                    this case. The parties and their relationships listed here
                    are set out as around 2001 before the joint venture
                    arrangement was entered into between the parties and before
                    the ownership structure of some of the companies changed
                    significantly.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       Sembcorp Marine was a
                    publicly listed company incorporated in Singapore and in the
                    business of constructing oil rigs and ships. It was a
                    company linked to the Government of Singapore. Sembcorp
                    Marine was represented in many of its negotiations in
                    relation to the joint venture by its then President, Mr Tan
                    Kwi Kin (“TKK”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       PPL Holdings was a private
                    company incorporated in Singapore. Before the joint venture
                    arrangement was entered into between the parties in 2001,
                    PPL Holdings held 97% of the issued share capital of PPL
                    Shipyard. The remaining 3% share capital was held by
                    E-Interface Holdings Limited (“E-Interface”),
                    the second defendant. E-Interface was a private company
                    incorporated under the laws of the British Virgin Islands
                    and was a wholly-owned subsidiary of PPL Holdings. In other
                    words, prior to the joint venture arrangement, PPL Holdings
                    held 100% of PPL Shipyard’s shareholding; 97% directly
                    and 3% indirectly through E-Interface. There were only two
                    directors of PPL Holdings, one Dr. Benety Chang
                    (“Chang”) and one Mr. Anthony Aurol
                    (“Aurol”). As will be seen, Chang and Aurol
                    were the key figures in the events that were to follow. PPL
                    Holdings and E-Interface will be referred to jointly as
                    “the defendants”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       PPL Shipyard was in the
                    business of design and construction of offshore drilling
                    rigs. It was a private company incorporated in Singapore and
                    its day to day operations were managed by Chang, who was the
                    Executive Deputy Chairman, and by Aurol, the Executive
                    Director.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       On the same side of the
                    fence as PPL Holdings and PPL Shipyard were two other
                    companies, Baker Technology Limited (“Baker”)
                    and Saberon Investments Pte Ltd (“Saberon”).
                    Baker was a public company listed on the Stock Exchange of
                    Singapore. It owned the entire issued share capital of PPL
                    Holdings. Chang was the Chief Executive Officer of Baker and
                    Aurol was the Chief Operating Officer. Chang and Aurol also
                    served as two of the six directors of Baker. The
                    defendants’ position is that although Chang and Aurol
                    were the only directors of PPL Holdings (the first
                    defendant), the exercise of their powers was with reference
                    to the directors of the board of directors of
                Baker.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       Saberon held approximately
                    67% of the issued and paid up share capital of Baker. Chang
                    held 67% of the shares in Saberon and his wife, Doris Heng,
                    held another 15%. Aurol held 15% of the shares in Saberon.
                    The remaining 3% of Saberon was held by Tan Yang
                    Guan.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The events surrounding the joint venture
                agreement</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       On 9 April 2001, the
                    joint venture agreement (“the JVA”) was signed
                    between Sembcorp and PPL Holdings. At least part of the
                    motivation for the joint venture was the opportunity to
                    launch a strong joint vehicle to bid for a project put out
                    for tender by Santa Fe International Corporation to build
                    two semi-submersible drilling rigs. Neither party to the JVA
                    was believed to have been able to successfully bid for this
                    project on its own. The parties to the JVA were at the
                    outset a very complementary match for one another, although
                    in this litigation the parties dispute the extent to which
                    this was so. Sembcorp’s case is that PPL Holdings was
                    experienced in constructing drilling rigs but did not have
                    sufficient financial and other resources to successfully bid
                    for the semi-submersible project. Sembcorp on the other hand
                    was able to procure finance and provide corporate guarantees
                    for the joint venture and also had ample shipyard
                        space<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span>. PPL Holdings’
                    case was similar, save that it preferred to state that PPL
                    Holdings entered into the joint venture for Sembcorp’s
                    yard space and not its financial resources. Despite this,
                    PPL Holdings acknowledged that Sembcorp was a desirable
                    business associate because it was financially strong and was
                    a government linked company<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span>. Sembcorp claimed that
                    the whole chronology of events was relevant to the question
                    of the backdrop of facts for the implication of certain
                    terms into the JVA and the parties took care to state their
                    positions carefully.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     Chang, on behalf of PPL
                    Holdings, initially offered in a memorandum of
                    27 February of 2001 to TKK that the joint venture be
                    between the publicly listed Baker and Sembcorp<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span>, with PPL Shipyard as the
                    joint venture vehicle. Chang recognised that
                    Sembcorp’s concerns with this proposal were that Baker
                    as a listed company might be restricted in its flexibility
                    to make decisions and that the shareholders of Baker would
                    be able to dispose of their shareholding easily in the
                    market. To allay Sembcorp’s concerns, Chang was
                    willing to subject his entire shareholding of about 83% in
                    Baker to a moratorium on disposal and commit himself to a
                    management contract with the joint venture company. TKK, on
                    behalf of Sembcorp, rejected this proposal and preferred
                    that the joint venture be between Sembcorp and the private
                    company PPL Holdings, with PPL Shipyard as the joint venture
                    vehicle. Chang subsequently agreed to this.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     On 29 March 2001,
                    Sembcorp and PPL Holdings entered into a Sale and Purchase
                    Agreement (“S&amp;P”) by which PPL Holdings
                    agreed to sell, and Sembcorp agreed to buy, 10,000 shares
                    representing 50% of the issued share capital of PPL
                        Shipyard<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span>. The price of
                    the shares was about $16 million, which was calculated with
                    reference to PPL Shipyard’s Net Asset Value at that
                    time. Pursuant to cl 4(H) of the S&amp;P, Sembcorp and PPL
                    Holdings were obliged to enter into a joint venture
                    agreement which had as its main objective the expansion of
                    the business of PPL Shipyard.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     The JVA was entered into
                    between Sembcorp and PPL Holdings on 9 April 2001.
                    Several clauses of the JVA were highly relevant to the
                    proceedings at hand and they are set out in full below. A
                    significant part of Sembcorp’s case hinged on its
                    argument that the JVA was premised on the ongoing
                    participation of Sembcorp and PPL Holdings as equal business
                    partners holding equal shares in PPL Shipyard. In this
                    regard, cls 4 and 5 of the JVA were particularly relevant.
                    Sembcorp also alleged that PPL Holdings had breached cl 13,
                    which was entitled “Confidentiality”, and cl
                    24, which was entitled “Good Faith”.
                    Additionally, cl 11 was relevant as it set out
                    Sembcorp’s right of pre-emption over PPL
                    Holdings’ shares in PPL Shipyard.</p>

                    ownership, those provisions remained. Therefore, Sembcorp
                    and the defendants put forward two different versions of the
                    events leading up to the SA; Sembcorp’s version
                    supports its position that Chang behaved in such a way as to
                    force Sembcorp to enter the SA while the defendants’
                    version denies this.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     Sembcorp stated that Chang
                    approached TKK in late 2002 with the proposal that Sembcorp
                    purchase PPL Holdings’ entire interest in PPL
                    Shipyard, which was 50% of PPL Shipyard’s issued share
                    capital. This would give Sembcorp a 100% shareholding in PPL
                    Shipyard. TKK offered a counter-proposal for a two-tiered
                    staggered purchase of the PPL Shipyard shares, first 20% and
                    then 30%, with the total consideration being $17 million.
                    Chang agreed to this in principle. On 25 June 2003,
                    Chang met TKK and told him that Keppel Offshore &amp; Marine
                    Ltd (“Keppel”) had approached Chang with an
                    offer to purchase PPL Holdings’ entire shareholding in
                    PPL Shipyard for $21 million. Chang gave TKK 48 hours to
                    respond to this.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     On 30 June 2003,
                    Chang met TKK at the Starhub canteen at Cuppage Centre. At
                    this meeting, TKK revised Sembcorp’s offer for the PPL
                    Shipyard shares upwards to $21 million with the following
                    terms. Sembcorp would purchase 35% of PPL Shipyard’s
                    share capital immediately and oblige Chang and Mr TK Ong to
                    remain with the management of PPL Shipyard for another three
                    years, after which Sembcorp would purchase the remaining 15%
                    of PPL Shipyard’s share capital on the basis of a call
                        option<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_5" id="Ftn_5_1"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span>. At Chang’s
                    request, TKK agreed that Sembcorp would pay Chang interest
                    at the prevailing bank rates on the remaining 15% of PPL
                    Shipyard’s share capital and would grant Chang a right
                    to 15% of the undeclared profits of PPL
                Shipyard.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     In contrast, the
                    defendants’ denied that TKK offered Chang a two-tiered
                    staggered purchase of PPL Holdings’ shareholding in
                    PPL Shipyard and claimed that there was only an in-principle
                    agreement between Chang and TKK for the sale of 20% of PPL
                    Shipyard’s share capital as held by PPL Holdings,
                    without mention of an agreed price. The defendants say that
                    Chang met TKK on 20 June 2003 at TKK’s request.
                    TKK informed Chang that Keppel had offered to buy both
                    Sembcorp’s and PPL Holdings’ interests in PPL
                    Shipyard and that Chang should ignore Keppel’s offer.
                    The next day, Chang received a letter containing an offer
                    from Keppel to buy the defendants’ interest in PPL
                    Shipyard for $21 million. Chang informed TKK about this, to
                    which TKK responded by saying that Sembcorp wanted to
                    continue the business of PPL Shipyard and proposed that
                    Sembcorp proceed with the purchase of 20% of PPL
                    Shipyard’s share capital from PPL
                Holdings.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     On 30 June 2003,
                    Chang met TKK at the Starhub canteen at Cuppage Centre at
                    which Chang proposed that Sembcorp should match
                    Keppel’s offer, and purchase PPL Holdings’ 50%
                    shareholding in PPL Shipyard for $21 million. On 5 July
                    2003, the men met at TKK’s office and agreed that
                    Sembcorp would purchase 35% of PPL Shipyard’s share
                    capital from PPL Holdings, that Chang and Aurol would remain
                    with the management of PPL Shipyard for three years and that
                    PPL Holdings would have a put option in respect of the
                    remaining 15% PPL Shipyard shareholding exercisable after
                    three years and that the PPL Shipyard staff would receive
                    share options from Sembcorp. TKK agreed to pay Chang
                    interest on the remaining 15% of PPL Shipyard and agreed to
                    grant Chang a right to 15% of the profits of PPL
                    Shipyard.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     There are two main points
                    of difference between the parties’ accounts. The first
                    relates to the manner in which Chang and TKK were apprised
                    of the Keppel offer; Sembcorp said that Chang forced its
                    hand with the Keppel offer and the defendants said that TKK
                    was the one who told Chang about the Keppel offer. The
                    second relates to the nature of the option in respect of the
                    15% PPL Shipyard shareholding; Sembcorp said it should be
                    entitled to a call option but the defendants said they
                    should be entitled to a put option.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     In any event, the SA, as
                    it was signed on 5 July 2003, was in the form of a
                    letter addressed to TKK from Chang and it provided as

</p>
<p class="Judg-1">It is clear that the SA was for the sale and
                    purchase of 35% of PPL Shipyard’s share capital.
                    Clause 2 of the SA gave a put option to PPL Holdings and cl
                    4 of the same made it clear that the SA was supplemental to
                    the earlier JVA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     Sembcorp’s position
                    was that this letter was merely meant to reflect the main
                    heads of agreement relating to its purchase of additional
                    shares in PPL Shipyard and that TKK and Chang both
                    understood that subsequent to the SA, Sembcorp and PPL
                    Holdings would enter into a formal sale and purchase
                    agreement, amend the JVA and change the composition of the
                    PPL Shipyard board to reflect Sembcorp’s rights as a
                    majority shareholder.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     The defendants disputed
                    this. They denied the contention that what was agreed was no
                    more than the main heads of argument and that TKK and Chang
                    understood that further formalities were necessary.
                    According to the defendants, the entire agreement clause
                    contained in Clause 34.1 of the JVA applied to the SA and
                    operated to exclude any alleged agreement that fell outside
                    these documents<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_6" id="Ftn_6_1"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     Completion of the sale and
                    purchase of the PPL Shipyard shares took place on
                    9 July 2003 as stipulated in the SA. However, no formal
                    agreement in furtherance of the SA was ever entered into
                    between the parties and PPL Shipyard’s Articles of
                    Association were not formally amended to take into account
                    these changes. Sembcorp contended that it was implied in the
                    SA that once this change in ownership of PPLS occurred,
                    certain provisions of the JVA and PPL Shipyard’s
                    Articles that were premised upon the existence of equal
                    shareholding <em>ipso facto</em> ceased
                    to apply. Sembcorp cited two changes in PPL Shipyard which
                    it claimed showed that PPL Holdings acted in a manner
                    consistent with Sembcorp’s alleged 85% majority
                    control of PPL Shipyard.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     The first was that PPL
                    Shipyard was treated as a subsidiary of Sembcorp, which
                    implemented certain policies in order to bring PPL
                    Shipyard’s operations in line with those of
                    Sembcorp’s larger group of companies. These policies
                    included those relating to human resource, publicity and
                        finance<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_7" id="Ftn_7_1"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span>. PPL Holdings admitted
                    that most of these policies were indeed implemented but
                    stated that this was done in accordance with the terms of
                    the JVA and the Consequential Articles, and with the consent
                    of the directors nominated by PPL Holdings to the PPL
                    Shipyard board<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_8" id="Ftn_8_1"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     The second was that there
                    was also a change in the composition of the PPL Shipyard
                    board. Prior to the change in proportions of ownership,
                    Sembcorp and PPL Holdings each nominated three directors to
                    the board of PPL Shipyard board. After the change, Sembcorp
                    nominated an additional three directors to the board, which
                    left it with six nominated directors as compared to PPL
                    Holdings’ three. PPL Holdings did not dispute this
                    change but contended that the directors it had nominated
                    only agreed to this change in the belief that the allocation
                    of votes would remain as that stated in Clause 5.3 of the
                    JVA, namely three votes each for both sets of directors
                    nominated by Sembcorp and PPL Holdings, regardless of the
                    number of directors on each side.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Sembcorp’s claims</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     The catalyst for the
                    dispute in this case arrived on 17 April 2010 when
                    Baker made a public announcement that on 16 April 2010,
                    it had received a binding letter of offer from Yangzijiang
                    to purchase all the issued and paid up share capital in PPL
                    Holdings, which was a wholly owned subsidiary of Baker. PPL
                    Holdings’ assets at the time comprised some cash and
                    more importantly, from Sembcorp’s point of view at
                    least, 15% of the issued and paid up share capital of PPL
                    Shipyard. Solicitors for Sembcorp, Drew &amp; Napier LLC
                    (“Drew and Napier”) sent a letter dated
                    22 April 2010 to Baker seeking confirmation that Baker
                    would not accept the Yangzijiang offer. Baker replied
                    through its solicitors Straits Law Practice LLC
                    (“Straits Law”) by a letter dated
                    23 April 2010 (“the Straits Law letter”),
                    stating that it had already accepted the
                offer.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     On 15 May 2010,
                    Sembcorp filed this writ and Statement of Claim, alleging in
                    main part that PPL Holdings had breached two express and two
                    implied terms contained in the JVA and the SA. On
                    26 July 2011, Sembcorp applied to amend the Statement
                    of Claim for the third time to include a third implied term.
                    Sembcorp alleged that PPL Holdings breached the following
                    two express terms (the terms are excerpted at <a href="#p1_12">[12]</a> above). First, cl 13 of
                    the JVA entitled “Confidentiality” was
                    breached in that Aurol had wrongfully disclosed PPL
                    Shipyard’s accounts to Yangzijiang and Baker in order
                    that Yangzijiang could calculate the price for the offer
                    with reference to PPL Shipyard’s net book value for
                    the 2009 financial year. Second, cl 24 of the JVA entitled
                    “Good Faith” was also breached in that PPL
                    Holdings failed to exercise any reasonable efforts to uphold
                    the “spirit” of the JVA and ensure that the
                    offer from Yangzijiang was rejected by Baker.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     Sembcorp also alleged that
                    there was a breach by the defendants of the following terms
                    which were implied in the JVA and SA (which will be referred
                    to respectively as the First, Second, and Third Implied
                    terms):</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_28-p2_a"></a>(a)     that such of
                        their provisions as were premised upon the existence of
                        the equal shareholding of Sembcorp and the
                            1<sup>st</sup> Defendant in PPL
                        Shipyard would cease to apply and subsist upon either
                        party acquiring a majority of the issued and paid up
                        share capital in PPL Shipyard and the JVA would
                        terminate and the Consequential Articles would cease to
                        subsist or apply upon one party ceasing to hold any
                        beneficial interest in PPL Shipyard;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_28-p2_b"></a>(b)     that neither party
                        will, without offering its shares to the other, act in
                        any manner which would cause the other to end up being a
                        “partner” in PPL Shipyard with a party
                        owned or controlled by someone other than the principals
                        of the parties to the JVA; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_28-p2_c"></a>(c)     that each party
                        will ensure that its wholly owned subsidiary, its
                        holding company or the wholly owned subsidiaries of its
                        holding company (as defined in the Companies Act (Cap.
                        50)) would not do anything which would undermine the
                        benefits conferred on the parties by Clause 11.7 of the
                        JVA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     Based on these alleged
                    breaches, Sembcorp claimed the following reliefs which are
                    briefly stated here. First, a declaration that when the
                    change in the proportions of ownership of PPL Shipyard
                    occurred, the provisions of the JVA and the Consequential
                    Articles that were premised upon the existence of equal
                    shareholding ceased to apply. Second, an order that the
                    defendants transfer their 15% shareholding of PPL Shipyard
                    to Sembcorp against payment of the sum of $59,433.522 or,
                    alternatively, an order that the defendants offer their 15%
                    shareholding to Sembcorp pursuant to the put option
                    contained in cl 2 of the SA. Third, a declaration that
                    Sembcorp became the owner of 100% of PPL Shipyard and that
                    the JVA was terminated.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     The defendants filed a
                    counterclaim and claimed in the main several declaratory and
                    injunctive reliefs pertaining to resolutions passed by the
                    board of PPL Shipyard, in particular, certain resolutions
                    relating to the requested vacation of office of some members
                    of the board nominated by PPL Holdings. These claims will be
                    dealt with after the plaintiff’s claims have been
                    considered.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The issues</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     Sembcorp’s
                    allegations all related to its concern that it was placed in
                    a position of being a partner in a joint venture with its
                    competitor, Yangzijiang. If the Yangzijiang offer to Baker
                    were consummated, then although formally PPL Holdings still
                    remained Sembcorp’s partner in the JVA, in reality PPL
                    Holdings would be a wholly owned subsidiary of Yangzijiang
                    and would have to dance to its tune. The reliefs Sembcorp
                    claimed all appear to be premised on the need to avoid this
                    arrangement and put an end to such an unwanted union.
                    Therefore, Sembcorp prayed that the provisions in the JVA
                    relating to equal control and management be disapplied such
                    that Yangzijiang would not be able to influence its
                    management of PPL Shipyard and, further or alternatively,
                    that the JVA be terminated such that it would not need to
                    deal with Yangzijiang in PPL Shipyard at all.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     The first issue is whether
                    the defendants have to offer their 15% shareholding of PPL
                    Shipyard to Sembcorp. This would depend on whether the
                    Second Implied Term could be implied into the JVA and the
                    SA, whether it was breached by the defendants and whether
                    Sembcorp should be entitled to specific performance of the
                    same; alternatively whether the put option contained in cl 2
                    of the SA was triggered as Sembcorp contended. If this issue
                    is answered in favour of Sembcorp, then it would follow that
                    Sembcorp should be entitled to a declaration that it is the
                    owner of 100% of PPL Shipyard. The second issue is whether
                    the provisions in the JVA and the Consequential Articles
                    that were premised on equal shareholding ceased to apply
                    when there was a change in the proportions of ownership of
                    PPL Shipyard. The answer to this would depend on whether the
                    First Implied Term could be implied into the JVA and the SA
                    and whether the defendants breached this term. The third
                    issue is whether Sembcorp should be entitled to terminate
                    the JVA on the basis of a breach by the defendants of cl 13
                    or cl 24 of the JVA or of the Third Implied
                Term.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The first issue: Whether the defendants have to
                offer their 15% shareholding of PPL Shipyard to
                Sembcorp</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     The first stage of the
                    inquiry examines whether the Second Implied Term was implied
                    into the JVA and the SA, whether there was breach of this
                    term and what the relief for this breach should be. The
                    second stage of the inquiry examines whether the put option
                    in Clause 2 of the SA was triggered by the Straits Law
                    letter of 23 April 2010 informing Sembcorp that Baker
                    had already accepted the Yangzijiang offer, such that
                    Sembcorp had the right to purchase the remaining 15%
                    shareholding of PPL Shipyard from PPL
                Holdings.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-5" style="font-variant: small-caps;">The Second Implied Term</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     The Second Implied Term
                    reads:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_34-p2_b"></a>(b)     that neither
                        party will, without offering its shares to the other,
                        act in any manner which would cause the other to end up
                        being a “partner” in PPL Shipyard with a
                        party owned or controlled by someone other than the
                        principals of the parties to the Joint Venture
                        Agreement;</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-6" style="font-variant: small-caps;">The law on implied terms</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     The law on implied was
                    disputed by the parties. Since three terms have been put
                    forward for implication, it would be useful to discuss the
                    principles which are to apply to each. This case is
                    concerned with terms implied in fact, that is, terms which
                    are implied into particular contracts in particular cases,
                    and therefore does not create any precedent for different
                    cases in the future. This is to be distinguished from terms
                    implied in law, which are of no concern to the present case.
                    Such terms if implied in law, will be implied into all
                    contracts of a similar type in the future (see <em>Forefront Medical Technology (Pte) Ltd v
                        Modern-Pak Pte Ltd</em> [2006]
                    1 SLR(R) 927 at [41] and [42]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     The exercise of implying
                    terms into contracts is essentially one of inserting terms
                    into a contract that did not exist at the time the contract
                    was made. Frequently, the need for this arises where the
                    contract is silent as to what should happen in the event of
                    a particular contingency; which contingency eventuates and
                    the parties are caught in a bind because the contract does
                    not stipulate what should happen next. Lacking such
                    direction, the obvious answer is simply that nothing should
                    happen and the loss should lie where it falls. In that
                    sense, the contract is capable of functioning but it may not
                    “work” to give effect to the business purpose
                    of the contract as the parties had intended. This of course
                    would be an unsatisfactory answer to the party who has to
                    shoulder the loss, who would argue for the implication of a
                    term to redistribute the same. Overshadowing this exercise
                    are the principles of sanctity and freedom of contract. The
                    danger of implying terms too freely is that the court would
                    be <em>ex post facto</em> rewriting the
                    contract which the parties had written for themselves and
                    allowing a party to weasel out of a bargain (however badly
                    drafted) which it had struck.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     The long-standing tests
                    for the implication of terms are known as the
                    “officious bystander” and the “business
                    efficacy” tests (henceforth referred to collectively
                    as the “two traditional tests”). Both emanated
                    from decisions of the English Court of Appeal and both are
                    part of Singapore law (see for example <em>Forefront</em> at [29]–[32], <em>Ng Giap Hon v
                        Westcomb Securities Pte Ltd</em> [2009]
                    3 SLR(R) 518 at [36] and <em>Chua Choon Cheng

                        (“<em>Chua Choon
                    Cheng</em>”) at [63]). The officious bystander test was
                    stated by MacKinnon LJ in <em>Shirlaw v
                        Southern Foundries (1926) Limited</em> [1939]
                    2 KB 206 (“<em>Shirlaw</em>”) (affirmed,

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">...that which in any contract is left to be implied
                        and need not be expressed is something so obvious that
                        it goes without saying; so that, if, while the parties
                        were making their bargain, an officious bystander were
                        to suggest some express provision for it in their
                        agreement, they would testily suppress him with a common
                        ‘Oh of course!’”</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The business efficacy test was stated by Bowen LJ
                    (as he then was) in <em>The
                        Moorcock</em> (1889) 14 PD 64
                    at 68:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... an implied warranty... is in all cases founded on
                        the presumed intention of the parties, and upon reason.
                        The implication which the law draws from what must
                        obviously have been the intention of the parties, the
                        law draws with the object of giving efficacy to the
                        transaction and preventing such failure of consideration
                        as cannot have been within the contemplation of either
                        side... In business transactions such as this, what the
                        law desires to effect by the implication is to give such
                        business efficacy to the transaction as must have been
                        intended at all events by both parties who are business
                        men...</p>
<p class="Judg-1">In Singapore, the two traditional tests are
                    complementary and their relationship, as stated in <em>Forefront</em> at [36] and approved in
                        <em>Chua Choon Cheng</em> at
                        [63], is that
                    the officious bystander test is the practical mode by which
                    the business efficacy test is implemented.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     Notwithstanding the
                    vintage of these tests, Sembcorp argued that another
                    approach to the implication of terms in fact should be
                    adopted. This was stated by Lord Hoffmann in the Privy
                    Council decision of <em>Attorney General of
                        Belize and others v Belize Telecom &amp;
                        another</em> [2009] 1 WLR 1988
                        (“<em>Belize</em>”)
                    at [21] as
                    follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">...in every case in which it is said that some
                        provision ought to be implied in an instrument, the
                        question for the court is whether such a provision would
                        spell out in express words what the instrument, read
                        against the relevant background, would reasonably be
                        understood to mean.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     This test put forward by
                    Lord Hoffmann will be referred to as the “<em>Belize</em> test” or the
                        “<em>Belize</em>
                    statement” (to account for the view that it does not
                    strictly constitute a separate test). From Sembcorp’s
                    point of view, the difference that the <em>Belize</em> test would make to its case is
                    evident from its submissions, in that the <em>Belize</em> test would oblige the court to
                    consider principles of contractual interpretation, including
                    principles of admitting extrinsic evidence for this
                    interpretation, in the process of implying terms into the
                    agreements between the parties. Sembcorp’s submissions
                    on the facts were premised on the notion that more of the
                    “relevant background” would be under
                    consideration if the <em>Belize</em>
                    test was adopted. The precise points of difference between
                    the <em>Belize</em> test and the two
                    traditional tests will be considered in greater detail below
                    (see <a href="#p1_49">[49]</a>, <a href="#p1_56">[56]</a> and <a href="#p1_60">[60]</a> below). The difference
                    that the introduction of the <em>Belize</em> test would make to Sembcorp’s
                    case remains to be seen.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     Sembcorp’s arguments
                    for the adoption of the <em>Belize</em>
                    test were rather bare and relied on a decision of this court
                    in <em>Kim Eng Securities Pte Ltd v Goh
                        </em><em>Teng </em><em>Poh Karen</em> [2011] SGHC 201
                        (“<em>Kim Eng</em>”),
                    which Sembcorp claimed was an instance where <em>Belize</em> was applied in Singapore law.
                    In <em>Kim Eng</em>, the plaintiff
                    stockbroking firm sought, <em>inter
                        alia</em>, to imply a term, that the defendant
                    dealer was to indemnify the plaintiff for losses arising out
                    of share trades executed by the defendant, into the
                    defendant’s terms of employment. The precise <em>dicta</em> relied on were at [66] and [67]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">66    The plaintiff submitted that in
                            any case, the indemnity obligation constituted an
                            implied term of the employment based on the facts
                            here, especially by reason of the standard
                            requirement, practice and custom that was in place
                            since 2002 or so. It submitted, on the authority of
                                [<em>Belize</em>], that the
                            only question to ask is what the instrument, read as
                            a whole against the relevant background, would
                            reasonably be understood to mean...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">67    On this issue, I agreed with
                            the plaintiff. The evidence showed that the
                            requirement of an indemnity was applied to everyone
                            in the plaintiff performing the same tasks as the
                            defendant. Such a practice was obviously known to
                            the defendant and complied with by her when she
                            provided the security, when she accepted the terms
                            of the 2003 letter and when she signed the internal
                            memorandum in September 2008...</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     From the excerpt above, it
                    is clear that <em>Kim Eng</em> did not
                    constitute an application of <em>Belize</em> in Singapore law. <em>Belize</em> was merely cited in the
                    plaintiff’s submissions in that case and no comment
                    was made on the authority, with the court choosing to agree
                    with the plaintiff on the facts. The decision in <em>Kim Eng</em> did not engage in a
                    discussion of the <em>Belize</em> test
                    and ask what would be the relevant background and what the
                    instrument would reasonably be understood to mean. Instead,
                    it determined the issue based on the subjective knowledge
                    and actions of the defendant there at various points in
                    time, as would be appropriate in reliance on the traditional
                    tests. The question of whether <em>Belize</em> should be a part of Singapore law
                    therefore remains an open one.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     The defendants submitted
                    that <em>Belize</em> should not be
                    applied in the instant case and put forward two arguments.
                    First, that normatively, implication of terms and
                    interpretation of contracts should remain two separate
                    doctrines and <em>Belize</em> subsumed
                    implication into interpretation, thus liberalising the
                    process of implication beyond acceptable limits (the
                    defendants cited Paul Davies, “Recent Developments in
                    the Law of Implied Terms” [2010] LMCLQ 140
                        (“<em>Davie</em>s<em>’ article</em>”) and
                    Elizabeth Macdonald, “Casting Aside ‘Officious
                    Bystanders’ and ‘Business Efficacy’?
                    (2009) 26 JCL 97) (“<em>Macdonald’s article</em>”). Second,
                    the Singapore Court of Appeal in <em>MFM
                        Restaurants Pte Ltd and another v Fish &amp; Co
                        Restaurants Pte Ltd and another appeal</em> [2011]
                    1 SLR 150 (“<em>MFM</em>”) at [98] disapproved of the <em>Belize</em> test because it did not provide
                    normative guidance to the process of implication and would
                    result in much practical uncertainty. It should be noted
                    that <em>MFM</em> was a case about the
                    remoteness of contractual damages and the discussion on
                    implied terms, though highly instructive, would be, strictly
                    speaking, <em>obiter</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     Before determining the
                    applicability of the <em>Belize</em>
                    test to the present dispute, it should be determined what
                    the <em>Belize</em> test actually is
                    and how it differs from the two traditional tests. The facts
                    of <em>Belize</em> are not of real
                    interest and can be stated shortly. In <em>Belize</em>, what was at issue were the articles
                    of association of Belize Telecommunications Ltd, which was
                    founded as part of the process of the privatisation of
                    telecommunication services in Belize. The articles provided
                    for the nomination of certain directors by the holder of a
                    special share, if that holder also held a certain percentage
                    of a class of ordinary shares. Subsequently, the special
                    shareholder’s shareholding of the ordinary shares
                    dropped below the requisite percentage and the question was
                    what should happen to the directors it had previously
                    nominated since the articles were silent on this. The
                    defendants claimed that the director would be irremovable
                    and the claimants claimed that it should be implied into the
                    articles that a director appointed by virtue of a specified
                    shareholding should be removed if there was no longer such a
                    shareholding. Lord Hoffmann delivering the advice of the
                    Privy Council agreed with the claimants. <em>Belize</em> concerned articles of association but
                    the principles it cited and propounded were expressly with
                    reference to contracts as well.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     After stating the test in
                        <em>Belize</em>, Lord Hoffmann went
                    on to say (also at [21]) that the officious bystander and
                    business efficacy tests were really reformulations of the
                        <em>Belize</em> test as stated
                    above:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">...this question can be reformulated in various ways
                        which a court may find helpful in providing an
                        answer—the implied term must “go without
                        saying”, it must be “necessary to give
                        business efficacy to the contract” and so
                        on—but these are not in the Board’s opinion
                        to be treated as different or additional tests. There is
                        only one question: is that what the instrument, read as
                        a whole against the relevant background, would
                        reasonably be understood to mean?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     The learned judge then
                    went on to quote Lord Simon of Glaisdale in <em>BP Refinery (Westernport) Pty Ltd v Shire of
                        Hastings</em> (1977) 180 CLR 226,
                    282-283 on the conditions that must be satisfied for the
                    implication of a term in a contract (at [26] and [27] of <em>Belize</em>):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">“(I) it must be reasonable and equitable; (2)
                        it must be necessary to give business efficacy to the
                        contract, so that no term will be implied if the
                        contract is effective without it; (3) it must be so
                        obvious that it “goes without saying”[;]
                        (4) it must be capable of clear expression; (5) it must
                        not contradict any express term of the
                        contract.”</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">27    The Board considers that this
                            list is best regarded, not as a series of
                            independent tests which must each be surmounted, but
                            rather as a collection of different ways in which
                            judges have tried to express the central idea that
                            the proposed implied term must spell out what the
                            contract actually means, or in which they have
                            explained why they did not think that it did
                            so.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     The <em>dicta</em> quoted above would suggest that the
                        <em>Belize</em> test is really the
                    same two traditional tests combined into a minimalist
                    package. There has been some disagreement over this and
                    commentaries have stated that the <em>Belize</em> tests is in fact a new approach to
                    the implication of terms that stretches the doctrine into
                    the territory of the interpretation of contracts in a manner
                    that is unacceptable. The learned author of <em>Davies’ article</em> states (at
                    140) that the <em>Belize</em> test
                    “appeared to subsume implication of contract terms
                    within a broad , liberal doctrine of interpretation”;
                    and (at 143) that it suggests “that reasonableness is
                    crucial when deciding whether to imply a term.”
                    According to the author, this should not be welcomed because
                    interpretation and implication are two conceptually separate
                    doctrines and should remain that way. Interpretation
                    considers what the actual instrument means but implication
                    involves <em>adding</em> to the actual
                    instrument. Implication is a far more intrusive and powerful
                    doctrine and should be circumscribed narrowly. Furthermore,
                    under the <em>Belize</em> approach, the
                    “subjective intentions of a party are now irrelevant,
                    and [the] only matter of importance is what the reasonable
                    observer would understand the contract to mean” (at
                    144). The learned author also indicated that the threshold
                    for the implication of terms may be lowered and that
                    “Lord Hoffmann’s approach in <em>Belize</em> affords the court greater room to
                    alter the bargain made.... it may be difficult to control
                    the scope given to the term “reasonableness”
                    and its objective nature” (at 145). In other words,
                    the learned author’s main fears are that in the
                    process of implication, the parties’ subjective
                    intentions would have to yield to the objective meaning of
                    the contract and that <em>Belize</em>
                    would lower the threshold for the implication of
                    terms.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     The learned author of
                        <em>Macdonald’s article</em>
                    has as her main concern that the process of implication
                    should be based on the intention of the parties. The role of
                    the two traditional tests “has been to limit the
                    implication of terms in fact to try to ensure that the
                    courts do not go beyond the parties’ intentions and
                    ‘improve’ their bargain” and the tests
                    limit the implication to the “least disputable area
                    of the intention of the parties” (at 98). The
                        <em>Belize</em> test, in her view,
                    while reflecting the search for the intention of the
                    parties, did not also have any limiting effect on that
                    search.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     It is clear that in
                        <em>Belize</em>, Lord Hoffmann was
                    explicitly positioning the process of implication very
                    closely to that of interpretation. At [17], his Lordship
                    stated:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>17</b>
                The question of implication arises when the
                            instrument does not expressly provide for what is to
                            happen when some event occurs. The most usual
                            inference in such a case is that nothing is to
                            happen. If the parties had intended something to
                            happen, the instrument would have said so.
                            Otherwise, the express provisions of the instruments
                            are to continue to operate undisturbed. If the event
                            has caused loss to one or other of the parties, the
                            loss lies where it falls.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>18</b>
                In some cases, however, the reasonable addressee
                            would understand the instrument to mean something
                            else. He would consider that the only meaning
                            consistent with the other provisions of the
                            instrument, read against the relevant background, is
                            that something is to happen. The event in question
                            is to affect the rights of the parties. The
                            instrument may not have expressly said so, but this
                            is what it must mean. In such a case, it is said
                            that the court implies a term as to what will happen
                            if the event in question occurs. <em>But the implication of the term is not an
                                addition to the instrument. It only spells out
                                what the instrument means.</em> [emphasis
                            added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     This does not appear to be
                    an overhaul of the process of implication of terms. The
                    process of implication is closer to the process of
                    interpretation than might have been explicitly stated before
                        <em>Belize</em>, in that both
                    exercises aim to give effect to the meaning of the contract,
                    objectively assessed. Starting from first principles, it
                    would be uncontroversial to state that the contracting
                    parties make the bargain for themselves and the principle of
                    freedom of contract mandates that the court should not
                    rewrite the instrument which the parties have produced. This
                    is subject to at least one exception, that is, the
                    court’s ability to imply terms into the contract to
                    deal with contingencies for which the contract does not
                    provide.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     As mentioned above, at

                        [17] of
                        <em>Belize</em>, if the contract is
                    silent as to a particular contingency which eventuates, then
                    the most literal interpretation of the contract is that the
                    loss should lie where it falls. This however, cannot be the
                    outcome if it would contradict the common intention of the
                    parties as expressed in the words of the contract. It would
                    be an absurdity for the loss to lie where it falls if such a
                    situation clearly would not be coherent with the common
                    intention of the parties. If terms cannot be implied where
                    they would contradict the express terms of the contract,
                    then terms should not be implied where they would contradict
                    the overall scheme of the arrangement which the parties have
                    made for themselves or the business purpose of the contract.
                    Similarly, the loss should not lie where it falls if this
                    would contradict either the express terms of the contract of
                    the overall scheme of the same. As was stated by Bowen LJ in
                        <em>The Moorcock</em> at 68:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The implication which the law draws from what must
                        obviously have been the intention of the parties, the
                        law draws with the object of giving efficacy to the
                        transaction and preventing such failure of consideration
                        as cannot have been within the contemplation of either
                        side;...the law is raising an implication from the
                        presumed intention of the parties with the object of
                        giving to the transaction such efficacy as both parties
                        must have intended that at all events it should
                        have.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     When implying terms into a
                    contract, the court must necessarily interpret the contract
                    to ascertain the parties’ presumed common intention
                    before the court can determine what term to imply (if at
                    all) to give effect to such intention. Lord Hoffmann’s
                    statement that the implication of a term is not an addition
                    to the instrument must be understood in that sense. Of
                    course, formally, implication involves adding a term to the
                    instrument where none existed but in substance, the
                    implication of terms should not add to or vary the meaning
                    of the contract. The implied term should simply give effect
                    to what the contract must mean. The court should not
                    re-allocate the risk of the silent contract except to the
                    extent to which the parties would have done so themselves.
                    In order to figure out what the parties would have done, it
                    is necessary to ascertain their presumed common intention by
                    interpreting the contract and that common intention is given
                    effect to in the event of a contingency by implying the
                    relevant term. All Lord Hoffmann was saying was that the
                    term to be implied should accord with a reasonable
                    interpretation of the contract.</p>

                            contemplated. The implication [of the term in
                            question] must arise inevitably to give effect to

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     The process of implication
                    has always been an objective exercise. The parties’
                    presumed common intention is ascertained objectively and
                    this must be so in order to avoid interminable argument over
                    what the parties’ subjective intentions <em>really</em> were at the time of
                    contracting (see <em>Belize</em> at
                        [25]; <em>Chitty on Contracts Volume I
                        </em><em>General

                        Moorcock</em> at 68 excerpted at <a href="#p1_49">[49]</a> above; and <em>Forefront</em> at [41] (the determination of
                    the “<em>presumed</em> common
                    intention” of the particular contracting parties must
                    invariably adopt an objective approach)). Furthermore, the
                    inquiry into the parties’ subjective intentions is
                    really more a matter for the doctrine of rectification, in
                    which it is alleged that the parties at the time of
                    contracting had made a mistake and their subjective
                    intention is sought in order that this can be rectified (see
                    Sir Kim Lewison, <em>The Interpretation of
                        Contracts</em>, 5<sup>th</sup> Ed,
                    Sweet &amp; Maxwell 2011 (“<em>Lewison</em>”) at 6.01, p 272). The
                    parties’ subjective knowledge is only relevant insofar
                    as that provides the <em>relevant
                        background</em> against which the contract should
                    be interpreted and the term should be implied (see <em>The Moorcock</em> at 68–69). If the
                    term implied would require the parties to have knowledge
                    which they did not actually have at the time of contracting,
                    then such implication would be impossible.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     What then, of the
                    arguments that implication and interpretation should be kept
                    separate? The defendants pointed to Sir Bingham M.R.’s
                    (as his Lordship then was) caution in the English Court of
                    Appeal decision <em>Philips Electronique
                        Grand Publique SA v British Sky Broadcasting</em>
                    [1995] EMLR 472 at 481:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The court’s usual role in contractual
                        interpretation is, by resolving ambiguities or
                        reconciling apparent inconsistencies, to attribute the
                        true meaning to the language in which the parties have
                        expressed their contract. The implication of contract
                        terms involves a different and altogether more ambitious
                        undertaking: the interpolation of terms to deal with
                        matters for which, ex hypothesi, the parties themselves
                        have made no provision. It is because the implication of
                        terms is potentially so intrusive that the law imposes
                        strict constraints on the exercise of this extraordinary
                        power.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     Implication and
                    interpretation are indeed separate doctrines. Implication
                    sits precariously on the boundary between the parties making
                    their own contract and the courts making their contract for
                    them. This potential intrusion into the freedom of contract
                    must be narrowly circumscribed in order that the court only
                    implies those terms which would give effect to the
                    parties’ presumed common intention.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     While separate, the
                    doctrines are related and the relationship between the two
                    is very succinctly stated in <em>Belize</em>: the process of implication must
                    accord with the process of interpretation. It should also be
                    recognised that the interpretation of the contract is often
                    a preliminary step to the implication of a term. This must
                    be so because if the parties’ intention could not be
                    ascertained, it would be impossible to give effect to the
                    unknown. The discerning of intention is conducted via the
                    process of interpretation. The author of <em>Davies’ article</em> thinks it a mistake to
                    say that interpretation and implication are points on a
                    continuous spectrum (at 144). A wanton exercise of the power
                    to interpret a contract will inevitably reach the point
                    where the interpreter reads too much into the contract,
                    almost as if he were reading in terms that were not there.
                    Notwithstanding the creative extremes possible, the legal
                    doctrines of implication and interpretation remain separate
                    and distinct. Interpretation, if done correctly within the
                    confines of its principles, will not tip over into
                    implication and implication is circumscribed by such high
                    and tight boundaries that a term would not be easily implied
                    at all.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     In <em>Belize</em>, Lord Hoffmann explicitly preserved
                    the high threshold for the implication of terms into a
                    contract, stating (at [16]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The court has no power to improve upon the instrument
                        which it is called upon to construe, whether it be a
                        contract, a statute or articles of association. It
                        cannot introduce terms to make it fairer or more
                        reasonable.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">At [19],
                    his Lordship approved of Lord Pearson’s dicta in
                        <em>Trollope &amp; Colls Ltd v North West
                        Metropolitan Regional Hospital Board</em> [1973]
                    1 WLR 601 at 609:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">“...An unexpressed term can be implied if and
                        only if the court finds that the parties must have
                        intended that term to form part of their contract: it is
                        not enough for the court to find that such a term would
                        have been adopted by the parties as reasonable men if it
                        had been suggested to them: it must have been a term
                        that went without saying, a term necessary to give
                        business efficacy to the contract, a term which, though
                        tacit, formed part of the contract which the parties
                        made for themselves.”</p>
<p class="Judg-1">At [22],
                    his Lordship acknowledged that the business efficacy test
                    was a reformulation of the <em>Belize</em> test, which reformulation embodied
                    the requirement of necessity:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">...conveyed by the use of the word
                        “necessary”, is that it is not enough for
                        a court to consider that the implied term expresses what
                        it would have been reasonable for the parties to agree
                        to. It must be satisfied that it is what the contract
                        actually means.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a>58     The discussion above
                    should provide sufficient response to the criticism referred
                    to at <a href="#p1_46">[46]</a>–<a href="#p1_47">[47]</a> above. The subjective intention of the
                    parties is relevant only insofar as it can be objectively
                    ascertained but this was the longstanding approach in any
                    case. The threshold for the implication of terms would not
                    be lowered by <em>Belize</em> and would
                    definitely not be lowered to the threshold of
                    “reasonableness”: Lord Hoffmann took pains to
                    point this out twice at [19] and [22]. The threshold remains that of
                    necessity, subject to the qualification that this
                    necessarily implied term must <em>also</em> accord with a reasonable interpretation
                    of the contract (see also [23] of <em>Belize</em>).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a>59     How should one approach
                    the criticism in <em>MFM</em> that the
                        <em>Belize</em> approach provides
                    little normative guidance? Granted, the <em>Belize</em> test is bare and simple and following
                    the words of the test alone does not provide that much
                    direction. However, Lord Hoffmann did not purport to
                    supersede or render obsolete the traditional tests for the
                    implication of terms and in fact referred to them as
                    reformulations of the <em>Belize</em>
                    test which “a court may find helpful in providing an
                    answer” (at <a href="#p1_21">[21]</a>). Therefore, the guidance and direction of
                    the two traditional tests remain very much
                available.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a>60     If the above is true, then
                    it may be asked, what purpose does the <em>Belize</em> test serve? If it purports to state
                    nothing new, then why bother with it at all? The value of
                    the <em>Belize</em> test lies in its
                    clear elucidation of the relationship between interpretation
                    and implication, which relationship may have been a
                    necessary incident of all prior implications of terms in
                    fact but which did not find expression until <em>Belize</em>. The <em>Belize</em> statement is not so much a
                    stand-alone test as it is a final hurdle. If a term is
                    thought fit for implication on the satisfaction of either of
                    the traditional tests, <em>Belize</em>
                    demands that the term implied must be checked for consonance
                    with a reasonable interpretation of the contract. In
                        <em>Belize</em>, it was stated that
                    the officious bystander and business efficacy tests were not
                    to be treated as different or additional tests from the
                        <em>Belize</em> statement (at
                        [21]).
                    Notwithstanding that, it is clear that <em>Belize</em> has made explicit a process which
                    must have been impliedly carried out in all previous
                    instances where terms were implied in fact. The approach to
                    be adopted in this case will therefore proceed on similar
                    lines.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a>61     Before returning to the
                    facts of this case, the question of what should constitute
                    the “relevant background” must be answered. In
                        <em>Belize</em> at [16], Lord Hoffmann stated
                    this as:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">...to a reasonable person having all the background
                        knowledge which would reasonably be available to the
                        audience to whom the instrument is addressed: see
                            <em>Investors Compensation Scheme v
                            West Bromwich Building Society</em> [1998]
                        1 WLR 896, 912–913 [“<em>Investors</em>”].</p>
<p class="Judg-1">This relevant background was stated with reference
                    to his Lordship’s own words in <em>Investors</em> on the interpretation of express
                    terms of a contract.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_62"></a>62     In Singapore, the
                    interpretation of express terms adopts the <em>Investors</em> approach and goes one step
                    further. In <em>Zurich Insurance (Singapore)
                        Pte Ltd v B-Gold Interior Design Construction Pte
                        Ltd</em> [2008] 3 SLR(R) 1029 (”<em>Zurich</em>”) at [132] it was held that
                    extrinsic evidence of, <em>inter
                        alia</em>, pre-contractual negotiations and the
                    subsequent conduct of the parties was admissible as long as
                    it was relevant, reasonably available to the parties and
                    related to a clear context. This is in clear contrast to the
                    English position which prohibits the admission of such
                    extrinsic evidence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_63"></a>63     In <em>Zurich</em>, it was also pointed out that if the
                    court was satisfied that the parties intended to embody
                    their entire agreement in a written contract, no such
                    extrinsic evidence would be admissible to contradict, vary,
                    add to, or subtract from its terms. However, at the same
                    time, entire agreement clauses would not necessarily
                    preclude the implication of terms.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_64"></a>64     There is a clear
                    difference between the philosophies of <em>Zurich</em> and <em>Investors</em> and if the <em>Belize</em> statement was founded on the
                    philosophy of <em>Investors</em>, would
                    it mean that the <em>Belize</em>
                    statement should be confined to the principles of <em>Investors</em>? The difference between
                        <em>Zurich</em> and <em>Investors</em> relates to ascertaining
                    the express meaning of the contract, with which the implied
                    term must accord. The difference does not itself impact on
                    the doctrine of implication. Evidence of pre-contractual
                    negotiations, even if this skates a little close to the thin
                    ice of rectification, is admissible as is evidence of the
                    subsequent conduct of the parties, although some view
                    inconsistent subsequent conduct of the parties as a plain
                    and simple breach. <em>Zurich</em> and
                        <em>Belize</em> would therefore be
                    compatible. As always, the focus of the court is on the
                        <em>particular</em> factual matrix
                    before it (see generally, <em>Forefront</em>).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-6" style="font-variant: small-caps;">Whether the Second Implied Term should be implied
                into the JVA </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_65"></a>65     The structure of the
                    inquiry is as follows. The court has to ascertain whether
                    the particular factual matrix of the case (see <em>Ng Giap Hon</em> at [89]) gives rise to
                    circumstances that would make it necessary to imply the
                    Second Implied Term into the JVA and the SA, with reference
                    to the business efficacy, officious bystander, and <em>Belize</em> requirements. Satisfaction of
                    either the business efficacy or officious bystander tests
                    would suffice for the implication of the term and the
                        <em>Belize</em> statement requires
                    that the term implied be checked for consonance with a
                    reasonable interpretation of the JVA and the
                SA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_66"></a>66     The precise factual matrix
                    surrounding the claimed implication of the Second Implied
                    Term revolved around two issues put forward by Sembcorp.
                    First, that the identity of the parties was important to the
                    parties to the JVA. Second, that co-operation, trust and
                    confidence between the parties to the joint venture was
                    critical to the joint venture.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_67"></a>67     The identity of the
                    parties was critical because the joint venture was premised
                    on both Sembcorp and PPL Holdings contributing their
                    particular respective resources in order to achieve the
                    objectives of the joint venture, which were primarily to
                    expand the business of PPL Shipyard<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_9" id="Ftn_9_1"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span>.
                    Sembcorp pointed to cl 4(H) of the S&amp;P which stated that
                    the parties would combine the existing resources of PPL
                    Holdings with those of Sembcorp and cl 3 of the JVA which
                    stated that the parties would contribute marketing contacts,
                    facilities, financial backing and other resources. Clause
                    8.1 of the JVA purportedly required the parties to provide
                    reasonable support to PPL Shipyard with the consent of the
                    other party and cl 8.2 stated that the parties would provide
                    PPL Shipyard with reasonable goods, services and
                    equipment.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_68"></a>68     Sembcorp argued that its
                    expected contribution to the joint venture was essentially
                    to provide financial facilities, corporate guarantees and
                    yard space. On the other hand, PPL Holdings’ expected
                    contribution to the joint venture was the expertise and
                    experience of Chang, TK Ong, and Aurol. It cited the fact
                    that TKK had rejected Baker as a counterpart to the joint
                    venture for the precise reason that it would have been too
                    easy for Chang to sell his shares in a public company and
                    exit the joint venture. Furthermore, it relied on the many
                    instances in cross-examination in which it alleged that
                    Chang had admitted he was aware of Sembcorp’s concern
                    that he was to remain in control of PPL Holdings. According
                    to Sembcorp, Chang was aware of this to the extent that he
                    offered a moratorium on his shares in Baker if Sembcorp
                    would accept Baker as a counterparty in the JVA. Chang did
                    not offer a moratorium on his PPL Holdings shares because he
                    understood that he was to remain in control of PPL
                    Holdings.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_69"></a>69     Co-operation, trust and
                    confidence between the parties to the joint venture was
                    critical, according to Sembcorp, because it was inherent in
                    the nature of the rig building industry that extensive
                    investments of time and money were required for each rig
                    project and because the joint venture was entered into in
                    order to build a good track record for PPL Shipyard to
                    attract more business. Each party had the ability to veto
                    proposed actions of PPL Shipyard, given the equal
                    shareholding, Sembcorp also pointed to the deadlock clause
                    in cl 12 of the JVA which showed that the parties were
                    obliged to co-operate and cl 11.2 – 11.6 of the JVA
                    which, it alleged, were clauses on the parties’ rights
                    of pre-emption to the effect that a party who wanted to sell
                    its shares in PPL Shipyard first had to offer those shares
                    to the other party. That envisioned that the parties were to
                    have some control over their counterparty to the joint
                    venture. Lastly, Sembcorp relied on the good faith clause in
                    cl. 24 of the JVA and the “spirit” and
                    “interest” of the joint venture<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_10" id="Ftn_10_1"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_70"></a>70     In response to
                        this<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_11" id="Ftn_11_1"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span>, the defendants
                    contended that the JVA was a carefully crafted agreement,
                    the negotiations for which benefited from the input of the
                    parties’ legal counsel. Therefore, there should be a
                    presumption against the implication of terms. Furthermore,
                    cl 11 of the JVA expressly dealt with the subject of
                    restrictions of share dealings and expressly limited its own
                    ambit to dealings in the shares of PPL Shipyard itself
                    without extending to the shares of shareholders of PPL
                    Shipyard. No term should be implied where this would
                    contradict any express term. The simple reason why Chang had
                    not offered a moratorium of his PPL Holdings shares was
                    because he was not asked to provide one, even though he was
                    aware that Sembcorp wanted Chang to be committed to the
                    project.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_71"></a>71     The defendants maintained
                    that the Second Implied Term was in itself vague. It should
                    be obvious both that a term should be implied and the
                    contents of the term to be implied. The Second Implied Term
                    failed on both counts. The definition of
                    “controlled” and when such control would
                    change was nebulous. If Chang and Aurol, as the purported
                    principals of PPL Holdings at the time the JVA was signed,
                    were so important to the joint venture, then there should
                    have been every reason for them to sign the JVA in their
                    personal capacities. It was also not obvious that the issue
                    of a change of control of one of the parties to the JVA
                    should be addressed by allowing the other party the chance
                    to purchase that party’s shares, given that there were
                    other possible ways to do this and it was not obvious which
                    way the parties would have chosen. The Second Implied Term
                    did not provide guidance as to the price of the share offer
                    or any mechanism by which the price could be fixed and was
                    therefore too vague as to be legally enforceable. Finally,
                    the Second Implied Term was not limited as to time, which,
                    in the defendants’ view, unrealistically and
                    unreasonably expected Chang and Aurol to commit to the joint
                    venture for an indefinite amount of time.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_72"></a>72     The contrast between the
                    parties’ submissions is clear. On the one hand,
                    Sembcorp presses the more abstract, purposive elements of
                    the joint venture and the alleged shared understandings of
                    the parties surrounding the signing of the JVA. On the other
                    hand, the defendants did not mount an outright denial of
                    these abstract elements but chose to focus the mechanics of
                    the JVA and the Second Implied Term. In the final analysis,
                    even if both parties’ versions of the facts are
                    themselves accurate, the question really is which set of
                    arguments is more relevant to the implication of the Second
                    Implied Term. Here we are concerned with implying that
                    particular term into the particular document of the JVA. The
                    JVA itself, and the reasonable meaning it conveys, would be
                    of paramount importance. Sembcorp contends that the
                    purposive elements of the parties’ relationship are
                    also obvious from the terms of the JVA and to this I now
                    turn. The point of view to be adopted in this exercise is
                    that of a reasonable observer who is reading the JVA. As
                    mentioned above, we are searching for the presumed common
                    intention of the parties, objectively ascertained, not the
                    parties’ subjective intentions since that would amount
                    to rectification of the contract which is not the case
                    argued before me. When considering all the evidence relied
                    upon, it must always be borne in mind that the thrust of the
                    Second Implied Term was really to pre-empt a situation where
                    the principals of either party to the JVA were to lose
                    control of that party. What Sembcorp would have to show
                    therefore, is that the JVA conveyed the reasonable meaning
                    that the principals of both the parties were to remain in
                    control of those parties and that there was a gap in the JVA
                    because it did not provide for the situation where one such
                    principal lost control. The Second Implied Term suggests
                    that Sembcorp was concerned to vet the party it would go
                    into partnership with.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_73"></a>73     In the first place, cl
                    4(H) of the S&amp;P which Sembcorp relied on is unlikely to
                    be relevant because the S&amp;P is a document which is
                    external to the JVA and neither party argued for its
                    incorporation. Moving on to consider cls 3, 8.1 and 8.2 of
                    the JVA (see <a href="#p1_12">[12]</a>
                    above), it is clear that these clauses oblige the <em>parties</em> to the JVA to bear these
                    objectives in mind and provide the operational support. As
                    defined in cl 1.1 of the JVA, “Party” or
                    “Parties” refers to any of the parties named
                    in the JVA and their respective successors-in-title. The
                    only parties named in the JVA are Sembcorp and PPL Holdings,
                    without mention of the principals or personalities behind
                    these parties. How then, would these clauses convey the
                    reasonable meaning that the principals behind the parties
                    were to retain control of each party? Clauses 3, 8.1 and 8.2
                    may force the principals behind the parties to bear the onus
                    of ensuring that the parties comply with the obligations in
                    those clauses but they say nothing about the identity of the
                    principals themselves or the amount of control they were to
                    exert over the parties. In any event, the JVA itself seems
                    to contemplate that the identities of the parties to the JVA
                    could change, since “parties” included the
                    successors-in-title thereof. Further, cl 11 provided a
                    mechanism by which the parties could dispose of their shares
                    in PPL Shipyard.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_74"></a>74     What about the expected
                    contributions of the parties at the time the JVA was signed?
                    Sembcorp argued that PPL Holdings was expected to contribute
                    Chang and Aurol’s expertise and experience to the
                    joint venture. The inference is that there should be some
                    sort of understanding that Chang and Aurol were expected to
                    remain and contribute these. Chang also knew that TKK was
                    concerned about Chang easily exiting the joint venture and
                    he (Chang) even offered a moratorium of his Baker shares.
                    Therefore, Sembcorp suggested, Chang should have understood
                    that he was to remain in control of PPL Holdings. Two points
                    can be made here. The first is that Chang’s alleged
                    awareness of all these notions really is ambivalent. Even if
                    Chang was aware of these, was there a sufficient nexus of
                    thought between him and Sembcorp or TKK for this to
                    constitute a common intention of the parties? It is equally
                    plausible for Chang to believe that since Sembcorp was aware
                    of all these concerns and yet did not take any steps to
                    assuage them, Sembcorp did not see them as sufficiently
                    weighty concerns for inclusion in the terms of the JVA.
                    There were no express clauses in the JVA requiring Chang or
                    Aurol to remain for any specified period of time or to
                    subject their shares to a moratorium. There were no
                    conditions on the disposal of their shares. There was also
                    no allegation that Chang was aware that Sembcorp was
                    labouring under any sort of mistake as to the understanding
                    between the parties and that he sought to take advantage of
                    this.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_75"></a>75     The second point to be
                    made is that these expectations run counter to cl 11.7 of
                    the JVA. Clause 11 provides a mechanism for the disposal of
                    shares by the parties. If a transfer of all or part of a
                    disposing party’s shares was proposed to be made to a
                    third party, cl 11.2 requires the disposing party to first
                    offer the shares to the other party. However, cl 11.7 states
                    that this restriction did not apply if either party wanted
                    to divest all of its shares to a related company. Such
                    divestment could be done without the need for such an offer
                    and without conditions attached. This suggests that if PPL
                    Holdings were to divest all of its shares in PPL Shipyard to
                    a related company, it could do so without having to first
                    offer its shares to Sembcorp. This related company may not
                    necessarily be controlled by the same principals which
                    controlled PPL Holdings, namely Chang and Aurol. How then
                    could it be said that the parties to the JVA had signed it
                    on the premise that Chang and Aurol would remain in control
                    of PPL Holdings? Hypothetically, Sembcorp could argue that
                    the entire group related to PPL Holdings was ultimately
                    controlled by Chang and Aurol, since they together held a
                    significant proportion of the shares in Saberon, which could
                    be taken as the overall parent company of the group.
                    Although this was the state of affairs at the time the JVA
                    was signed, there was no warranty that it would be preserved
                    for the duration of the joint venture and neither were there
                    any provisions in the JVA to ensure that it would remain
                    unchanged.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_76"></a>76     Sembcorp also relied on
                    the proposition that co-operation, trust and confidence
                    between the parties to the joint venture was critical to its
                    success. That may be true, but this would be so no matter
                    who the principals of the parties were and the clauses
                    relied on, cls 11.2–11.6, 12 and 24, did not provide
                    that the principals of the parties would not be able to
                    divest their control of the parties. Nothing much changes
                    even if Sembcorp was able to show that at the time the JVA
                    was signed, the parties and their respective principals were
                    particularly able to co-operate with each other. That would
                    be good for the joint venture but there was nothing to
                    suggest that this situation must be preserved for the
                    future. Parties to a joint venture would have entered into
                    it because they thought they would be able to co-operate
                    with each other for the foreseeable future but it would be
                    difficult to infer from this premise that the parties’
                    principals should remain in control in order for that to
                    happen.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_77"></a>77     This would also contradict
                    the put option contained in cl 2 of the SA. If Sembcorp
                    could conceive of ending the joint venture by buying over
                    all of PPL Shipyard’s shares, then it seemed that
                    Sembcorp would have been happy for PPL Shipyard to function
                    without Chang and Aurol. It was not clear whether Sembcorp
                    was really anxious for Chang and Aurol to stay or more
                    anxious to preclude the entry of a competitor. It was more
                    likely that the latter was true.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_78"></a>78     Moving on to the
                    defendants’ submissions, I saw merit in their
                    contention that the court should be slow to imply terms into
                    the rather detailed JVA which comprised thirty-five clauses
                    and governed many aspects of the relationship between the
                    parties. As for the contention that the Second Implied Term
                    would contradict cl 11, which expressly dealt with the
                    subject of share transfers, I was a little less impressed.
                    Clause 11 addressed the situation where shares of PPL
                    Shipyard were proposed for disposal, not the shares of the
                    parties themselves which is a wholly different
                    consideration. If the shares of PPL Shipyard were disposed
                    of, the parties to the joint venture would change. It is
                    different to contemplate the situation where the principals
                    of the parties would change as a result of the disposal of
                    the parties’ own shares. It is not accurate to say
                    that the issue of share transfers in general was addressed
                    by cl 11. The nature and consequences of the different types
                    of share transfers still differed. In the light of the
                    conclusions reached below, it is not necessary to consider
                    the defendants’ submissions on the contents of the
                    Second Implied Term.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_79"></a>79     Looking through the haze
                    of facts and clauses, the final picture that emerges to the
                    reasonable observer is that the JVA and the circumstances
                    surrounding it pointed to the importance of the particular
                    parties to the joint venture remaining parties. However, it
                    was not obvious how important the principals of those
                    parties were. There was a gap in the JVA in that it did not
                    provide for the situation where one of the principals of the
                    parties lost control of that party but it would not occur to
                    the reasonable observer that the parties would have
                    necessarily have intended this to trigger a responsive
                    event. Sembcorp allegedly held the belief that Chang and
                    Aurol were important players in PPL Holdings and that their
                    presence was important but the Second Implied Term does not
                    quite sing the same tune. Rather, the Second Implied Term
                    suggests that Sembcorp wanted to vet the proposed new
                    principals of PPL Holdings and to decide if it wished to
                    continue the joint venture under those circumstances. If
                    Sembcorp really wanted Chang and Aurol to stay, the Second
                    Implied Term would have taken the form of a prohibition on
                    the disposal of their shares or an undertaking by the two
                    men to remain in the joint venture. Instead, the said Term
                    indicates that if Sembcorp was not fond of the proposed
                    changed principal, then it would buy up all the offered PPL
                    Shipyard shares and effectively terminate the joint venture.
                    Sembcorp would then have to fulfil all the outstanding rig
                    building contracts on its own without the expertise and
                    experience of Chang and Aurol. This ran contrary to its
                    rhetoric on PPL Holdings’ expected contributions to
                    the joint venture and the co-operation and trust between the
                    parties.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_80"></a>80     Given the black holes in
                    the factual matrix that Sembcorp put forth and therefore the
                    lack of a compelling case on the facts for the implication
                    of the Second Implied Term, it is clear what the conclusion
                    on this matter ought to be. There was little impetus to
                    proceed to the stage of applying the tests for implication
                    but they will be considered nevertheless. Should the
                    officious bystander have posed the Second Implied Term to
                    the parties at the time the JVA was entered into, it was not
                    obvious that the parties would have retorted in the
                    necessary “testy” manner. It did not go
                    without saying that they envisioned the change in control of
                    the principals of the parties to be an issue which needed
                    resolution or that the resolution was to be effected by a
                    share offer. Further, it was not necessary for business
                    efficacy that the Second Implied Term be read into the joint
                    venture. Even if the principals of the contracting parties
                    were to change, PPL Shipyard could still work effectively
                    towards its desired purpose of expanding its business and it
                    would still benefit from the financial resources and yard
                    space of Sembcorp coupled with the intellectual property of
                    PPL Holdings. Necessity must be assessed from the point of
                    view of both parties. It is uncertain that PPL Holdings
                    would have thought it necessary that the principals of
                    Sembcorp would remain. Notwithstanding that PPL Holdings had
                    considered Sembcorp an attractive counterparty because it
                    was a government-linked company, that situation did not
                    remain static and it did not mean that Sembcorp would be
                    considered an unattractive counterparty just because it
                    ceased to be linked to the government.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-6" style="font-variant: small-caps;">Whether the Second Implied Term should be implied
                into the SA</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_81"></a>81     The SA was a shorter but
                    no less detailed document which was incorporated into the
                    JVA by virtue of cl. 4 of the SA. The SA effected the sale
                    of 35% of the shares in PPL Shipyard by PPL Holdings to
                    Sembcorp and provided a put option for the sale of the
                    remaining 15% of the PPL Shipyard shares. Sembcorp’s
                    case was that the Second Implied Term should be implied into
                    the SA for two reasons<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_12" id="Ftn_12_1"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_82"></a>82     First, that the parties in
                    the course of the negotiations leading to the SA were aware
                    that it was important that Chang and the management team
                    remain with PPL Holdings even after the sale of 35% of the
                    PPL Shipyard shares. Sembcorp relied on evidence from
                    Chang’s cross-examination to show that he was aware
                    that Sembcorp was concerned to retain Chang after the sale
                    of the shares. There was also an email from
                        Chang<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_13" id="Ftn_13_1"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span>
                    containing his earlier proposal that Sembcorp purchase PPL
                    Holdings’ entire shareholding in PPL Shipyard, which
                    email contained certain proposals to satisfy
                    Sembcorp’s concern that Chang retain an interest in
                    the joint venture after the sale of the shares. This
                    included the proposals that Chang would use part of the sale
                    proceeds to purchase Sembcorp shares in the open market and
                    that he would offer a profit guarantee.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_83"></a>83     Second, that PPL Holdings
                    was aware that Sembcorp’s intention in entering into
                    the SA was to prevent the situation where Sembcorp was to be
                    a partner in the joint venture with a competitor. The SA for
                    the sale of the shares was entered into by Sembcorp at that
                    price allegedly to stave off an offer for the shares by
                    Keppel, also a competitor of Sembcorp (see above at
                        <a href="#p1_14">[14]</a> to <a href="#p1_16">[16]</a>). Therefore it must have
                    been clear that at least part of the purpose of the SA was
                    to avoid the situation where Sembcorp would have to be a
                    joint venture with a perceived competitor.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_84"></a>84     I was not convinced that
                    it was necessary to imply the Second Implied Term into the
                    SA. Even if Chang knew that Sembcorp was concerned to see
                    that he retain an interest in PPL Shipyard, this was no
                    basis for saying that Chang and PPL Holdings similarly
                    intended the same. TKK had made it clear to Chang that he
                    wanted Chang to remain. Unfortunately, there was little
                    provision for this in the SA. The only clause to that effect
                    is the put option in cl 2, which could be read as obliging
                    PPL Holdings to retain its 15% shareholding of PPL Shipyard
                    for at least 36 months. An alternative interpretation of the
                    ambiguous words of cl 2 would be that PPL Holdings could
                    sell its shares to a third party at any time but Sembcorp
                    would only be obliged to purchase those shares if PPL
                    Holdings gave them written notice of the same, 36 months
                    after the date of the SA. Sembcorp’s case is that both
                    parties were well aware of Sembcorp’s concerns. Yet,
                    if such concerns were already addressed by way of cl 2 only,
                    however weak a protection it might offer to Sembcorp, the
                    obvious inference to be drawn is that both parties had
                    intended to assuage Sembcorp’s concerns in such a
                    manner. Why should the court see any reason to imply
                    anything stronger? On Chang’s part, even if he knew
                    that Sembcorp was so concerned, all that he saw before him
                    was that Sembcorp agreed to a weak mode of protection by
                    including a put option instead of the stronger shield of a
                    call option (which was mentioned but not agreed
                to).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_85"></a>85     I was also not convinced
                    by Sembcorp’s allegation that the SA was entered into
                    to stave off competition from Keppel. The facts supporting
                    these allegations were hotly contested and even if
                    Sembcorp’s account could be accepted at face value,
                    the conclusion drawn in the preceding paragraph still
                    stands. If Sembcorp was so concerned to avoid partnership
                    with a competitor, why did it not protect itself in a better
                    way?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_86"></a>86     Finally, the terms of the
                    SA do not give reason to imply the Second Implied Term. The
                    strongest argument for implication would probably be based
                    on cl 2 of the SA, a put option which states that Sembcorp
                    shall purchase PPL Holdings’ remaining 15%
                    shareholding of PPL Shipyard as long as notice is given of
                    PPL Holdings’ intention to sell those shares at least
                    36 months from the date of the SA. However, the shares
                    referred to are clearly the shares in PPL Shipyard held by
                    PPL Holdings. It might even be said that since the term only
                    provided for that situation, a reasonable inference that is
                    to be drawn from reading the contract is that the parties
                    only thought it important to protect the disposal of PPL
                    Shipyard shares and not the disposal of shares of the
                    parties to the joint venture.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_87"></a>87     The officious bystander
                    suggesting the Second Implied Term to the parties at the
                    time the SA was signed would be likely to receive a mixed
                    response. Sembcorp might very well have answered “Oh
                    of course!” but Chang and PPL Holdings would be far
                    more likely to say “But of course not. Sembcorp may
                    have been concerned to avoid the sale of PPL Shipyard to a
                    competitor but this was all it agreed to in the SA. What is
                    more, Sembcorp’s concerns seem to revolve around the
                    sale of PPL Shipyard, not the sale of PPL Holdings.”
                    The Second Implied Term would also not be necessary for
                    business efficacy. The business purpose of the SA was to
                    effect the sale of PPL Holdings’ shares in PPL
                    Shipyard in a staggered manner. The SA would achieve its
                    purpose even without the Second Implied Term. Lastly, the
                    Second Implied Term did not accord with a reasonable
                    interpretation of the SA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_88"></a>88     Following from the
                    findings that the Second Implied Term should not be implied
                    into the JVA or the SA, it is unnecessary to consider the
                    issue of whether the defendants had breached this term or
                    whether Sembcorp should be entitled to specific performance
                    of the same. All that remains to be said is that the
                    defendants would not be obliged to offer their 15%
                    shareholding of PPL Shipyard to Sembcorp on the basis of the
                    Second Implied Term.</p>

                        offer.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">...</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_90"></a>90     Sembcorp supported its
                    case with the following evidence. First, a meeting took
                    place on 18 April 2010 between the representatives of
                    Sembcorp and PPL Holdings<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_15" id="Ftn_15_1"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span> in the wake of
                    the Yangzijiang offer. During this meeting, Chang allegedly
                    said that if Sembcorp “were to give a similar offer,
                    they would consider selling to [Sembcorp] instead”.
                    Sembcorp seized on this to claim that since Sembcorp was a
                    majority shareholder of PPL Shipyard and PPL Holdings was
                    not, that Chang must have been referring to the sale of the
                    PPL Shipyard shares. Second, the terms of the Yangzijiang
                    offer were telling. Yangzijiang required Baker to give proof
                    of PPL Holdings’ and E-Interface’s shareholdings
                    in PPL Shipyard and one of the conditions of the Yangzijiang
                    offer was that Chang and Aurol would not voluntarily leave
                    their positions as executive directors of PPL Shipyard for
                    two years from 1 January 2011. Third, Yangzijiang on
                    1 September 2010initiated another agreement between
                        <em>inter alia</em> Yangzijiang and
                    Baker which conditioned the sale of the PPL Holdings shares
                    on the outcome in this action. The agreement stated that if
                    a final judgment in this suit determined that Sembcorp was
                    entitled to the 15% shareholding in PPL Shipyard, Baker
                    would have to refund the consideration of US$116,250,000 to
                    Yangzijiang. Fourth, that Chang under cross-examination
                    purportedly conceded that the Yangzijiang offer was
                        <em>effectively</em> (my emphasis)
                    for the purchase of the PPL Shipyard shares. Fifth, that
                    Chang and Aurol allegedly behaved in a surreptitious manner
                    with regard to the Yangzijiang offer in that they did not
                    inform Sembcorp of the offer and were evasive about the
                    extent of the negotiations between themselves and
                    Yangzijiang that preceded the making of the
                offer.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_91"></a>91     Naturally, the defendants
                    disagreed. Their main contention was simple, namely that the
                    Straits Law letter was written notice of <em>Baker</em> selling its shares in <em>PPL Holdings</em>, not notice of
                        <em>PPL Holdings</em> selling its
                    shares in <em>PPL
                Shipyard</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_92"></a>92     This issue ultimately
                    rests on the interpretation of cl 2 of the SA. The main
                    sentence in cl 2 which is worth focusing attention on
                    reads:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The remaining Three Million (3,000,000) shares owned
                        by <em>us</em> shall be purchased
                        by Sembcorp immediately upon receipt of written notice
                        from <em>us</em> of our intention
                        to sell our remaining shares... [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">It is also very important to note that the SA was
                    in the form of a letter addressed to Sembcorp and TKK and
                    was signed off with “Yours faithfully –
                    <b>PPL Holdings Pte Ltd</b>”.
                    It was undisputed that the SA was an agreement entered into
                    by both parties to the JVA and those parties
                alone.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_93"></a>93     The clause on its face is
                    abundantly clear. In order for this clause to be triggered
                    such that Sembcorp would purchase the remaining shares,
                    there has to be written notice of an intention to sell the
                    remaining Three Million shares. This intention was to be
                    that of the writer of the letter, PPL
                Holdings.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_94"></a>94     On this point,
                    Sembcorp’s reliance on Chang’s statements at the
                    meeting of 18 April 2010 and his apparent concession
                    under cross-examination does not assist its case.
                    Chang’s intentions and knowledge cannot be attributed
                    to PPL Holdings. PPL Holdings was not run as a one man show
                    whose corporate veil could be pierced to reveal Chang. It
                    had a full complement of directors on its board. Any
                    intentions of PPL Holdings would have been likely to come in
                    the form of resolutions from the board or official releases,
                    not oral statements from one of its directors.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_95"></a>95     Sembcorp relied on a
                    decision of the English Court of Chancery, <em>Re Sedgefield Steeplechase Co (1927) Ltd,
                        Scotto v Petch </em><em>and
                        others</em> (“<em>Re
                        Sedgefield</em>”) [2001] BCC 889
                    as authority for the law on what would constitute an
                    “intention” to sell shares in the context of
                    pre-emption rights. <em>Re
                        Sedgefield</em> was a case which examined how the
                    pre-emption rights in the articles of association of a
                    company which owned a racecourse in England could be
                    triggered. These pre-emption rights operated in such a way
                    that if any shareholder intended to transfer his shares, he
                    would have to first give written notice to the board which
                    may then offer the shares to the other shareholders of the
                    company. The main question in that case was what sort of
                    intention was required to trigger the giving of this written
                    transfer notice. Lord Hoffmann held that a shareholder who
                    intended to transfer his shares but did not intend to
                    contravene the pre-emption provisions would not be obliged
                    by the pre-emption rights in the articles to serve the
                    transfer notice (at 220–221). Lord Hoffmann commented
                    on what it means to “intend” to transfer
                    shares; his Lordship cited a decision of Fox J in
                        <em>Owens v GRA Property Trust
                        Ltd</em> (10 July 1078, unreported) as
                    authority for the proposition that “a shareholder may
                    intend to transfer his shares within the meaning of the
                    pre-emption article although his ability to do so depends on
                    contingencies outside his control” (at 219). The
                    proposition is not strictly on point in relation to the
                    facts of this case since it states that a shareholder may
                    intend to transfer his shares for the purposes of the
                    pre-emption provision even if events conspire to make this
                    impossible. Nevertheless, the principles stated by
                    Fox J and approved by Lord Hoffmann on the nature of
                    “intention” are of some interest (at
                    218):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(i)    The word [intends] relates
                            exclusively to a state of mind.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(ii)  
              <em>It relates
                                to the state of mind of the transferor
                                only</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(iii)  The intention must be made
                            manifest in some way and must be
                        unequivocal.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(v)    The intention must be a
                            present intention</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_96"></a>96     On the strength of the
                    authority which Sembcorp put forward, its reliance on the
                    terms of Yangzijiang’s offer and the condition imposed
                    by Yangzijiang based on the outcome in this litigation was
                    shaken. The <em>transferor’s</em>
                    intention is relevant, not the <em>transferee’s</em>. The transferor in the
                    context of the Yangzijiang offer is Baker and its intention,
                    from the Straits Law letter anyway, is to dispose of its
                    shares in PPL Holdings. Whatever benefits Yangzijiang wished
                    to obtain out of the transaction cannot necessarily be
                    attributed to Baker’s intention to confer those
                    benefits.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_97"></a>97     We are thus left with
                    Sembcorp’s allegations of Chang’s and
                    Aurol’s surreptitious behaviour. This contention is,
                    at best, equivocal and, at worst, a personal attack. If
                    Baker was selling its shares in PPL Holdings, it would have
                    been courteous of Chang and Aurol to inform Sembcorp of this
                    development but there was no obligation on them to do so.
                    They were therefore entitled to be reticent about the
                    arrangement.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_98"></a>98     Given that the put option
                    in cl 2 was not triggered, Sembcorp was not entitled to the
                    15% shareholding in PPL Shipyard on that basis and the
                    cheque of S$59,433,522 that it tendered as consideration is
                    of no consequence. Under these circumstances, there is no
                    need for me to go on to consider the allegations made by the
                    defendants that Sembcorp had not calculated the price for
                    the consideration correctly.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The second issue: Whether the provisions in the
                JVA and the PPL Shipyard Articles that were premised on equal
                shareholding ceased to apply when there was a change in the
                proportions of ownership of PPL Shipyard</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-5" style="font-variant: small-caps;">Whether the First Implied Term should be implied
                into the JVA</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_99"></a>99     The gist of the First
                    Implied Term was twofold. First, that once the 50-50
                    shareholding in PPL Shipyard was upset, the provisions in
                    the JVA that were premised on equal shareholding would cease
                    to apply. Second, that the JVA and the Consequential
                    Articles would cease to apply once either party to the JVA
                    no longer held any shares in PPL Shipyard.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_100"></a>100    Sembcorp argued for the
                    implication of this term into the JVA on the basis that the
                    circumstances leading up to the signing of the JVA and the
                    terms of the JVA supported such an implication. Further,
                    such implication would avoid an absurd result. Oddly enough,
                    the two parts of the First Implied Term are not obviously
                    two halves of a whole and they stem from different premises.
                    The first part is premised on the notion that certain
                    provisions in the JVA were premised on equal shareholding
                    (“the equality provisions”) and the second is
                    premised on the notion that the JVA would only subsist for
                    so long as both parties to the JVA remained identical
                    without succession. Of course, this is not fatal to the
                    implication of the First Implied Term which would in any
                    event be severable. It remains to be seen whether the same
                    set of evidence can justify the implication of the two
                    parts. They will be referred to respectively as “part
                    one” and “part two”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_101"></a>101    According to Sembcorp,
                    in relation to part one of the First Implied Term, these
                    were the equality provisions in the JVA which would cease to
                    apply upon the cessation of equal shareholding, as set out
                    at para 15 of its Statement of Claim (Amendment No. 3). The
                    first set of such provisions was contained in cl 5 and
                    related to the involvement of both parties in the operation
                    of PPL Shipyard’s board of directors. In brief, cl 5
                    and its sub-clauses entitled the parties to nominate three
                    directors each, obliged the directors nominated by them to
                    co-operate in the nominating and removal of directors,
                    required that at least one director nominated by each party
                    be present to constitute the quorum at any meeting and
                    entitled the parties to nominate persons to different roles
                    on the board. The second set of provisions related to the
                    need for the participation of both parties for the operation
                    of PPL Shipyard. Clause 6.1 required that both parties be
                    present for the purpose of quorum at shareholders’
                    meetings. Clause 7 required that both parties consent before
                    PPL Shipyard could carry out certain actions and cl 9
                    required both parties to be signatories to PPL
                    Shipyard’s bank accounts. These provisions will be
                    examined in greater detail later.</p>

                    Sembcorp would need to cross for the implication of the
                    First Implied Term are several. In relation to part one of
                    the First Implied Term, it would not suffice to simply show
                    that the provisions above were premised on equal
                    shareholding. That is merely a bland description without
                    more. The provisions may have been included on the basis of
                    equal shareholding but Sembcorp would need to go one step
                    further and show that the provisions would only be <em>workable</em> insofar as there is equal
                    shareholding or that the provisions or the entire JVA would
                    be absurd otherwise. It would also suffice for Sembcorp to
                    show that an objective assessment of the parties’
                    intentions would show that they had <em>intended</em> that such provisions would cease to
                    apply. Sembcorp would also have to follow through with the
                    rest of its argument and show that, as a natural corollary,
                    if such provisions ceased to apply, there should be
                    something that would be able to supplant them. In relation
                    to part two, in similar fashion, Sembcorp would have to show
                    that the JVA and Articles were <em>unworkable</em> without either party’s
                    participation in the JVA or that the parties <em>intended</em>, objectively assessed, that
                    the JVA and Articles would terminate.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_103"></a>103    Sembcorp claimed that
                    the circumstances preceding the signing of the JVA
                    demonstrated that the equality provisions were premised on
                    the equality of shareholding between the parties. The
                    parties had entered into the entire JVA on the premise of
                    equal shareholding and on the strength of this premise, the
                    JVA expressly provided for the parties to have equal
                    management rights and required the parties to make equal
                    contributions to PPL Shipyard. Sembcorp pointed to
                    negotiations that took place in early 2001, during which
                    Sembcorp’s proposal to acquire more than 50% of PPL
                    Shipyard’s shares was turned down by Chang, who also
                    insisted that the directors nominated by the parties to the
                    PPL Holdings board should carry an equal number of votes in
                    order to reflect the equal shareholding and that Sembcorp
                    should not have a casting vote to break any
                deadlock.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_104"></a>104    Sembcorp also pointed to
                    the express terms of the JVA which it claimed were based on
                    an equal shareholding, namely recital (C) and cls 4.2–
                    4.3 describing the parties’ equal shareholding; cls
                    5.3 and 5.1 which described the parties’ equal
                    participation in the affairs of the PPL Shipyard board; cl
                    11 which stated that if either party’s shareholding
                    dropped below 50%, the parties would have to agree on the
                    number of directors that the selling party could nominate to
                    the board; and cls 8.4 and 8.6 which required the parties to
                    provide financing to PPL Shipyard in proportions which
                    corresponded to their proportions of shareholding in PPL
                    Shipyard and that the parties would have to bear the losses
                    incurred by PPL Shipyard in the same
                proportions.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_105"></a>105    Clause 5.1 in particular
                    was interesting because it provided that “Unless
                    otherwise agreed”, the parties may appoint three
                    directors each to the PPL Shipyard board, “so long as
                    they shall hold such number of shares...”, which read
                    together with cl 4.2, indicated that this number of shares
                    referred to the equal shareholding. In other words, this
                    suggested that the parties’ right to nominate three
                    directors to the board rode on the fact of equal
                    shareholding. This provision will be analysed in greater
                    detail below, especially in regard to the parties’
                    subsequent conduct in relation to this
                provision.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_106"></a>106    The absurd result that
                    Sembcorp claimed would occur if the First Implied Term was
                    not implied was derived in the hypothetical situation where
                    a majority shareholder were to acquire 19,999,999 shares, or
                    a 99.9999% shareholding of PPL Shipyard. According to
                    Sembcorp, if the First Implied Term were not implied, the
                    minority shareholder in that case would be able to block
                    action by the board simply be refusing to show up at board
                    or shareholder meetings because of the quorum requirement.
                    The directors it appointed would be able to block board
                    resolutions by simply voting against them. This would offend
                    commercial sense, especially in the light of cls 8.4 and 8.6
                    which premised the provision of finance and the shouldering
                    of loss on the percentage of shareholding. It could not be
                    that a minority shareholder who contributed very little
                    money and shouldered very little risk would be able to
                    derail the proposed activities of PPL
                Shipyard.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_107"></a>107    The defendants’
                    response to these contentions was that any changes to the
                    JVA had to be negotiated and recorded during the
                    negotiations for future changes to the proportions of
                    shareholding. This was supported by the wording of cls 4.2
                    and 4.3 of the JVA. Clause 4.2 stated that “unless
                    otherwise agreed in writing”, the parties were to
                    hold the shares of PPL Shipyard in equal proportions while
                    cl. 4.3 stated that these proportions were to be maintained
                    for the duration of the JVA, “unless otherwise agreed
                    to in writing.” Clause 26.1 of the JVA also provided
                    that any amendments to the JVA would have to be agreed to in
                    writing by both parties. The defendants also deprecated
                    Sembcorp’s suggestion that the equality provisions
                    should cease to apply the moment the proportions of equal
                    shareholding changed as itself not according with commercial
                    sense. The defendants also produced evidence of the minutes
                    of a meeting that took place on 29 September 2008, five
                    years after the conclusion of the JVA, during which
                    Sembcorp’s Executive Committee noted that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">..the [JVA] between [Sembcorp] and [PPL Holdings]
                        still provided for voting rights of the parties to be
                        equal although [Sembcorp’s] share was now 85%. It
                        was necessary to re-negotiate the Agreement as it was
                        unfair that [Sembcorp] did not have a majority voting
                        right. [A Sembcorp director] explained that the [JVA]
                        could not be negotiated at the time [Sembcorp] acquired
                        the additional 35% share as [PPL Holdings] was about to
                        sell their 50% stake to Keppel, and their 35% share had
                        to be purchased on an urgent basis.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_108"></a>108    I will turn to consider
                    Sembcorp’s contentions first. One thing that stood out
                    was that Sembcorp’s arguments took on an “all
                    or nothing” flavour. As long as there was no equal
                    shareholding, the equality provisions would necessarily
                    cease to apply. This lack of nuance and texture hampered
                    their submissions. The process of the implication of terms
                    is necessarily based on the particular factual matrix before
                    the court, in particular, the events which gave rise to the
                    alleged necessity for the implication of the terms. What
                    Sembcorp was essentially doing in this case was to run a
                    very abstract argument based on events that had happened in
                    the distant past, without showing why the fact of PPL
                    Holdings’ present 15% shareholding in PPL Shipyard
                    necessitated the implication of the terms. What Sembcorp was
                    inviting this court to do was to examine the logic of the
                    terms of the JVA against the background leading up to the
                    JVA and comment on the apparent inherent fallacy. However,
                    the court cannot improve the parties’ agreement
                    retrospectively just because it appears flawed on hindsight.
                    Sembcorp had to show why the facts as they stood made
                    implication a necessity.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_109"></a>109    Sembcorp’s
                    reliance on the pre-contractual negotiations of the JVA does
                    indeed indicate that the parties had entered into the JVA on
                    the premise that each was to have an equal shareholding in
                    PPL Shipyard. I can accept that the parties provided for
                    each other to have equal management rights and required each
                    other to make equal contributions to PPL Shipyard because
                    those were the proportions of shareholding at the time the
                    JVA was entered into. That does not carry its case any
                    further as it is merely descriptive. There is nothing
                    prescriptive to persuade me that because the parties had
                    premised the JVA on equal shareholding, the equality
                    provisions would necessarily cease to apply when the
                    proportions were upset, no matter how slight the upset might
                    be. Sembcorp could not show me how the equality provisions
                    were so inextricably linked to the initial premise of equal
                    shareholding that they became <em>unworkable</em> or necessarily went against the
                    grain of the entire argument read in context.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_110"></a>110    Although, in general,
                    consideration of hypothetical situations in the deliberation
                    process for the implication of terms should be frowned upon,
                    Sembcorp’s zero sum game arguments meant that the term
                    it sought to imply had to be capable of working in all
                    situations where the proportions of shareholding shifted
                    away from equal proportions, even if this shift was of a
                    very small percentage.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_111"></a>111    Perhaps Sembcorp’s
                    argument was a little different, in that since the parties
                    included the equality provisions on the basis of equal
                    shareholding, they had thereby intended for the provisions
                    to cease to apply otherwise. But this does not necessarily
                    follow and in any event this argument was not made out on
                    the facts put before me by Sembcorp.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_112"></a>112    Sembcorp then turned to
                    an absurd hypothetical situation in order to justify its
                    claim. The problem with this is that the implication of
                    terms is very much premised on the particular factual matrix
                    placed before the court and the reasons why this matrix has
                    shown that there is a gap in the parties’ agreement,
                    which gap there is impetus to fill by the implication of a
                    necessary term. If it were the case that Sembcorp held a
                    99.9999% shareholding in PPL Shipyard and PPL Holdings still
                    insisted on the application of the equality provisions, I
                    might be inclined to say that the equality provisions would
                    not make much sense under such circumstances. This was not
                    the case here. Every set of facts taken to its extreme will
                    appear absurd and sound ridiculously in need of a remedy.
                    However, I would be implying a term based on that extreme
                    hypothetical set of facts, not the particular facts which
                    are before me. In any event, as Chang pointed out, it was
                    rather inconceivable that Sembcorp would have agreed to
                    purchase all but one of the shares in PPL
                Shipyard.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_113"></a>113    Moving on to the
                    defendants’ contentions, there is merit in their
                    argument that the changes to the JVA were to be negotiated
                    at the point at which the shareholding of PPL Shipyard was
                    to change. Importantly, the words of the JVA indicated the
                    parties’ presumed common intention that the
                    proportions of shareholding in PPL Shipyard could change and
                    this was reflected in cls 4.2 and 4.3, cl 11 in general
                    which provided a mechanism for the transfer of shares in PPL
                    Shipyard and cl 11.10 in particular which provided that the
                    PPL Shipyard board would decide which directors were to
                    remain on the board in the event that one party did sell
                    part of its shares pursuant to cl 11.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_114"></a>114    It seemed rather
                    incongruous for the JVA to have contemplated the situation
                    where the parties’ shareholding in PPL Shipyard
                    changed but not provide as to how its terms would apply or
                    cease to apply in such event. Even if the parties had truly
                    not applied their minds to this possibility, it would be
                    unreasonable to imply a term that all the equality
                    provisions would cease to apply in such event. What then
                    would fill the void? How would the quorum for shareholder
                    meetings be constituted and how many directors should each
                    party be allowed to nominate to the board? Resolution of
                    these and the many other questions is not so simple or
                    obvious an issue as can be effected by an implication of
                    terms. The reason is because the precise change in the
                    proportions of shareholding is unpredictable. The
                    consequential amendments to the quorum and the number of
                    directors to be appointed entailed considerations of
                    proportion and are difficult to predict. For example, if
                    there was equal shareholding, it might make sense for each
                    party to nominate three directors each. If the proportions
                    of shareholding shifted to 75% and 25%, how many directors
                    should the minority shareholder be entitled to nominate?
                    “One” or “two” would be equally
                    plausible answers. It would be impossible to discern what
                    the parties had intended in the event the proportions of
                    shareholding were to change. It is impossible to devise a
                    “one size fits all” solution. Furthermore, the
                    contents of the provisions may not change in an automatic
                    fashion, such that the number of directors that one party
                    could nominate would automatically track the proportions of
                    its shareholding. The parties might individually evaluate
                    the provisions and modes of control and could be willing to
                    trade off certain terms to obtain their desired results. The
                    best that can really be said is that the parties would have
                    to renegotiate the terms of their agreement. The JVA is very
                    much capable of amendment, as cl 26.1 indicated, and as the
                    parties by the SA had done.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_115"></a>115    Given the discussion
                    above, there is no need to even resort to the two
                    traditional tests for implication. Suffice to say that the
                    first part of the First Implied Term was not necessary for
                    business efficacy and the parties would have replied to the
                    officious bystander with a “We are not agreed on what
                    would happen should the equal proportions of shareholding be
                    upset.”</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_116"></a>116    The discussion above
                    related to only the first part of the First Implied Term, on
                    which Sembcorp focussed the bulk of its submissions. This is
                    not to neglect the second part of the First Implied Term,
                    which can be dealt with very shortly. The definition of
                    “party” contained in cl 1.1 of the JVA is
                    “all or any of the parties named in this Agreement...
                    their respective successors-in-title and transferees who
                    acquire the shares in accordance with this
                    Agreement”. This must mean that any person who
                    acquires shares in PPL Shipyard in accordance with the JVA
                    is a party. The second part of the First Implied Term states
                    that if any one party were to lose its beneficial interest
                    in PPL Shipyard, the JVA would terminate and the
                    Consequential Articles would not apply. This should be
                    obvious. If one of the two parties loses its beneficial
                    interest, there is no longer any joint venture and there
                    would be no need for the JVA to govern the relationship
                    between the parties. If the Consequential Articles ceased to
                    apply, this would have to mean that PPL Shipyard’s
                    original set of Articles of Association would have to return
                    to fill the void. Given that the Consequential Articles were
                    amended for compliance with the JVA, it would make sense
                    that there would be no need for the Consequential Articles
                    to govern PPL Shipyard if there were no JVA
                    subsisting.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_117"></a>117    Perhaps the outcome that
                    Sembcorp was trying to achieve by seeking to imply the
                    second part of the First Implied Term was to disapply the
                    JVA and the Consequential Articles the moment PPL Holdings
                    lost its beneficial interest in PPL Shipyard. However, the
                    use of the word “party” in the second part of
                    the First Implied Term read with the definition of the same
                    in cl 1.1 of the JVA made this an impossible quest. I saw no
                    necessity to imply the second part of the First Implied Term
                    either, given that the facts did not throw up a situation
                    where there would be only one party holding 100% of the
                    shares in PPL Shipyard thus resulting in a collapse of the
                    joint venture.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-5" style="font-variant: small-caps;">Whether the First Implied Term should be implied
                into the Supplemental Agreement</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_118"></a>118    Sembcorp claimed that
                    the First Implied Term should also be read into the SA. As
                    the SA was incorporated into the JVA by virtue of cl 4 of
                    the SA, this would be tantamount to claiming that the First
                    Implied Term should be implied into the JVA. It seems that
                    Sembcorp’s real point was that the circumstances
                    surrounding the SA were persuasive as to this
                    implication.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_119"></a>119    Sembcorp rested its
                    claim on two points. The first was that the parties
                    allegedly had not regarded the SA as a final agreement and
                    contemplated that a more formal agreement would be entered
                    into subsequent to the completion of the sale and purchase,
                    which formal agreement would include several amendments to
                    the terms of the JVA. This, according to Sembcorp, was
                    evidence that the parties clearly understood that the
                    provisions in the JVA on equal rights of management and
                    control had ceased to subsist. Sembcorp claimed that the SA
                    was a sparse document which merely reflected the heads of
                    agreement between the parties and was signed with great
                    haste in order to stave off Keppel’s offer and Chang
                    and Aurol had allegedly acted in such a way as to pressurize
                    TKK into signing the SA urgently. There were also certain
                    alleged inconsistencies and inadequacies in the terms of the
                    SA which indicated that further negotiations were required.
                    There was also evidence of negotiations between the parties
                    conducted after the conclusion of the SA on the specific
                    terms that should be included in the new agreement. However,
                    these negotiations came to nothing. From the date the SA was
                    signed in 5 July 2003, the parties were allegedly in
                    negotiations all the way till late 2004. At this point, the
                    parties allegedly reached an <em>impasse</em> in the negotiations, in particular
                    with regard to the amendment of the terms in the JVA to
                    reflect Sembcorp’s purported rights as a majority
                    shareholder of PPL Shipyard. Sembcorp’s own case is
                    that it let the matter rest, in order not to antagonise PPL
                    Holdings and upset relations between the parties. This
                    matter rested all the way until 16 April 2010 when the
                    Yangzijiang offer surfaced.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_120"></a>120    The second point that
                    Sembcorp relied on was that subsequent to the signing of the
                    SA, the parties allegedly conducted themselves on the basis
                    that the equality provisions no longer applied. First,
                    Sembcorp nominated three more directors to the PPL Shipyard
                    board, bringing their total to six nominated directors as
                    compared to PPL Holdings’ three. According to
                    Sembcorp, Chang had apparently conceded that Sembcorp had a
                    “majority” on the PPL Shipyard board, although
                    under cross-examination he stated that despite the increased
                    number of Sembcorp nominated directors, the voting rights of
                    the parties remained equal. Second, a representative of
                    Sembcorp, Mr Ong Poh Kwee, who was one of the newly
                    appointed directors, was appointed Deputy Managing Director.
                    Third, after the SA, Sembcorp allegedly began to treat PPL
                    Shipyard as a subsidiary within its group of companies and
                    implemented various policies within it including those
                    relating to financial policy, publicity, human resource and
                    risk management. Lastly, after the SA, PPL Holdings itself
                    started to classify PPL Shipyard as an “associate
                    company”, rather than a “subsidiary” as
                    it had before. This apparently showed that PPL Holdings was
                    aware of its decreased shareholding and the accompanying
                    reduction in the rights of management and control in PPL
                    Shipyard.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_121"></a>121    In response, the
                    defendants argued that the SA was silent on the necessity
                    for further negotiations in order to amend the JVA and that
                    the indications for further negotiations referred to other
                    things like employee stock options. The defendants further
                    denied that a further formal agreement was required and
                    disputed Sembcorp’s evidence on this point. The
                    defendants claimed that the subsequent conduct of the
                    parties could not vary the JVA, since by cl 26.1 of the JVA,
                    it could only be varied by a written agreement of the
                    parties. Further, if, as Sembcorp claimed, the First Implied
                    Term introduced certain amendments to the SA, then why would
                    there be a need for the parties to negotiate on future
                    amendments? The defendants also adduced their own evidence
                    to the effect that the parties had conducted themselves
                    after the signing of the SA in accordance with the alleged
                    subsistence of the equality provisions.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_122"></a>122    Sembcorp’s first
                    point falls easily on the fact that the negotiations halted
                    in 2004 and never resumed. Six years passed before Sembcorp
                    realised that it needed to further the discussions to amend
                    the JVA when the Yangzijiang offer came along. Even if
                    Sembcorp was right that the parties at the time of signing
                    the SA contemplated that a new more formal agreement was
                    required, this does not necessarily indicate that the
                    equality provisions were to be disapplied. If no new
                    agreement was produced from the preliminary negotiations and
                    proposals of terms, how is the court to determine the
                    intentions of the parties? Both parties proposed and
                    counter-proposed different terms and no consensus was
                    apparent. In any event, the lapse of six years indicated
                    Sembcorp’s acquiescence to the status quo. The excuse
                    that Sembcorp did not wish to antagonise PPL Holdings was
                    not convincing and there is nothing for the court to infer
                    from its allegedly non-confrontational behaviour. Simply
                    put, Sembcorp did not protect its position in the way it
                    ought to have. It was also not disputed that the SA was
                    discussed in the morning but signed only in the afternoon
                    after TKK and Chang had returned from lunch. It was
                    therefore not signed in a great hurry as a temporary
                    measure.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_123"></a>123    Sembcorp’s second
                    point falls with similar ease. I am with the defendants in
                    that the subsequent behaviour of the parties could not
                    modify the JVA. In fact, it might be more accurate to say
                    that the parties were actually acting in breach of the
                    provisions of the JVA. In any event, subsequent behaviour of
                    the parties, being extrinsic evidence, is not admissible to
                    vary the contents of the agreement (see <em>Zurich</em> at [132]). Sembcorp may argue that the
                    subsequent behaviour of the parties should be an aid to
                    construing the JVA in such a way that it would be reasonable
                    to imply the First Implied Term. Closer consideration of
                    this behaviour does not convince me that it would be
                    reasonable, let alone necessary, to imply the same. The
                    shareholding of the parties had changed after the SA such
                    that Sembcorp owned 85% of PPL Shipyard. However, Sembcorp
                    proceeded to nominate 3 more directors to the board,
                    bringing its representation on the board to a 66% majority
                    (6 against PPL Holdings’ 3). How would it be possible
                    to infer from this that the parties were acting in
                    accordance with a 85% majority? I was not persuaded by the
                    appointment of Mr Ong Poh Kwee, since that did not
                    necessarily create an inference that the equality provisions
                    should be disapplied. Further, the fact that Sembcorp
                    implemented its own policies within PPL Shipyard is not
                    indicative of anything beyond the fact that PPL Holdings
                    must have consented to that. These policies do not strike at
                    the heart of the equality provisions, which relate to, in
                    the main, shareholder quorum, and board representation in
                    PPL Shipyard. Lastly, PPL Holdings’ treatment of PPL
                    Shipyard as an “associate company” rather than
                    a “subsidiary” is an entirely accurate
                    description of the fact of its reduced shareholding but does
                    not indicate that PPL Holdings conceded anything with
                    respect to the equality provisions.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_124"></a>124    In the circumstances, I
                    saw no reason to imply the First Implied Term in the SA. It
                    was not necessary for business efficacy and, if the
                    officious bystander had raised the matter, even if Sembcorp
                    would enthusiastically agree that it was obvious, PPL
                    Holdings would almost certainly have said something quite
                    the contrary.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The third issue: Whether Sembcorp should be
                entitled to terminate the JVA on the basis of the various
                breaches alleged to have been committed by the
                defendants</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_125"></a>125    Sembcorp alleged in the
                    alternative that the defendants had breached three important
                    terms amounting to conditions in the JVA and, on this basis,
                    Sembcorp should be allowed to terminate the same. The first
                    term was the confidentiality obligation contained in cl 13,
                    the second was the good faith provision in cl 24 and the
                    third was what is known as the Third Implied Term, the
                    thrust of which was that neither party would do anything to
                    the other which would undermine the benefits conferred on
                    the parties by cl 11.7 of the JVA. These terms will be
                    addressed in turn.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-5" style="font-variant: small-caps;">The confidentiality obligation in clause
                13</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_126"></a>126    Sembcorp claimed that
                    this was a condition of the JVA and that it was breached
                    because Aurol had wrongfully disclosed PPL Shipyard’s
                    accounts, which were purportedly confidential information,
                    to Yangzijiang and to Baker. With this information in hand,
                    in particular, the net book value of PPL Shipyard for the
                    financial year 2009, Yangzijiang was able to calculate the
                    price that it should offer for the shares in PPL Shipyard.
                    Sembcorp took pains to show that these accounts were
                    confidential information as they fell within the definition
                    of the same in cl 3.1 of the JVA. I accept that the accounts
                    were confidential although the defendants argued otherwise
                    on the basis of the nature of the information and the words
                    of cl 3.1.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_127"></a>127    What is more important
                    is whether the accounts lost their confidential nature as a
                    result of subsequent events. According to Sembcorp, this is
                    the chronology leading up to the disclosure of the accounts.
                    Sometime in March 2010, Ms Aw Seok Chin
                    (“Aw”), the company secretary of PPL Shipyard,
                    received a draft of the accounts dated 22 February
                    2010. On 31 March 2010, she circulated to PPL
                    Shipyard’s board, a directors’ resolution to
                    pass, <em>inter alia</em>, resolutions
                    relating to the approval of the accounts for submission at
                    PPL Shipyard’s forthcoming Annual General Meeting
                    (“AGM”) and to convene this meeting on
                    16 April 2010. Subsequently, on 12 April 2010, the
                    directors of PPL Shipyard approved the resolution and
                    pre-signed the attendance sheet and minutes of the AGM which
                    was to be held on 16 April 2010. One day later, on
                    13 April 2010, Aurol forwarded copies of the accounts
                    to Baker and Yangzijiang. The AGM was subsequently held on
                    16 April 2010 and the accounts were filed with the
                    Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority on
                    19 April 2010.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_128"></a>128    The defendants’
                    chronology of events was similar, save that they alleged
                    that the accounts had lost their confidential nature by
                    13 April 2010. They say that Aurol had collected the
                    accounts on that date and made copies of them. He asked Aw
                    to file a copy with ACRA and then forwarded the information
                    by email to Baker and to the broker who acted for
                    Yangzijiang. Interestingly, Aw was copied in that same email
                    because she was also the company secretary of
                Baker.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_129"></a>129    The defendants’
                    case was that Aurol acted in several different capacities on
                    the same day. In handing the accounts to Baker, he was
                    acting in his capacity as a director of PPL Holdings. As a
                    shareholder of PPL Shipyard, PPL Holdings was entitled to
                    receive a copy of the PPL Shipyard accounts. In handing the
                    accounts to Yangzijiang, Aurol was acting in his capacity as
                    a director of Baker.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_130"></a>130    In the final analysis,
                    the question really is whether the accounts had lost their
                    confidential nature by virtue of the approval of the
                    resolutions that took place on 12 April 2010.
                    Sembcorp’s case was that the minutes remained
                    confidential because the terms of the resolutions stated
                    that the approval for the accounts had only been given in
                    relation to the submission of the accounts at the AGM on
                    16 April. Notwithstanding that no physical AGM took
                    place on 16 April 2010, Sembcorp maintained that the
                    accounts were only approved on that date.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_131"></a>131    This contention was
                    questionable. The relevant resolution stated:</p>

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Dated: 22 February 2010</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_132"></a>132    A reading of the
                    document reveals that it contemplated that the resolutions
                    therein were passed on the date of the document. The
                    directors “AGREE AND CONSENT TO PASS THE FOLLOWING
                    RESOLUTIONS ON <em>THIS
                    DATE</em>”, and resolved that the accounts
                        “<em>be and are hereby</em>
                    approved for submission”. It seemed clear enough that
                    the accounts were approved and the only relation to the AGM
                    was that the accounts were also approved for <em>submission</em> at the AGM. For all
                    intents and purposes and on a plain reading of the document,
                    the resolutions were passed on the date of the document,
                    which was 22 February 2010. None of the directors who
                    signed appended the date of their signature, although the
                    parties did not seem to dispute that all directors had
                    signed by 12 April 2010 at the latest. There was no
                    indication that the directors had intended for the
                    resolutions to be approved at any date later than the date
                    of the document.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_133"></a>133    Sembcorp alternatively
                    contended that even if a document had been approved for
                    public release, the information remained confidential prior
                    to its publication. To support this contention, it relied on
                    a quotation from <em>Confidentiality</em> (London Sweet &amp; Maxwell,
                    2006) at p88 to the effect that the details of a patent told
                    to a person in confidence would retain the quality of
                    confidentiality until publication. The same reasoning was
                    applied to the government budget and a company’s
                    financial results.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_134"></a>134    Sembcorp next relied on
                    the cases of <em>Shelly Films Ltd v Rex
                        Features</em> [1994] EMLR 134 which
                    concerned disclosure of a film costume prior to the
                    film’s release and <em>Creation Records
                        Ltd v News Group Newspapers Ltd</em>
                    [1997] EMLR 444 which concerned the premature
                    publication of photographs for a music album sleeve. In both
                    these cases, it was said that the information was
                    confidential until its release into the public domain. These
                    case concerned common law obligations imposed to retain
                    confidentiality. In these cases, the information released
                    was time sensitive, in such a manner as to adversely affect
                    commercial interests which were backed by substantial
                    investments. Had the details of the film costume and music
                    album sleeve been prematurely released, the elements of
                    anticipation and surprise that would have otherwise
                    accompanied them would be severely compromised. In the
                    present case, the directors had expressly approved the
                    accounts for filing with ACRA, where they would enter the
                    public domain, before Aurol’s actions. Even if the
                    accounts were released by him a little later on
                    16 April 2010, there was no evidence that Yangzijiang
                    would have considered them to be any less valuable. There
                    was also no evidence that Yangzijiang would not have made
                    its offer if the accounts were disclosed on or after
                    16 April 2010. Obviously, just because the accounts
                    were not time sensitive does not mean that they were not
                    confidential.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_135"></a>135    The test for
                    confidentiality is found in the case of <em>Douglas v Hello! Ltd (No 3)</em>
                    [2006] QB 125 at 151 where the English Court of
                    Appeal stated that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">...information will be confidential if it is available
                        to one person (or a group of people) and not generally
                        available to others, provided that the person (or group)
                        who possesses the information does not intend that it
                        should become available to others.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The information contained in the accounts was
                    available to the directors of PPL Shipyard and they intended
                    that the accounts be approved, formally on 22 February
                    2010 or, at the latest, when they appended their signatures
                    to the resolutions on 12 April 2010. Their approval
                    signified that the accounts would be submitted to ACRA for
                    entry into the public domain and would thus become available
                    to others. The accounts therefore lost their confidentiality
                    by 12 April 2010 at the latest and it could not be said
                    that Aurol’s conveyance of the same to Baker and
                    Yangzijiang breached cl 13 of the JVA. Even if the accounts
                    were still confidential on 12 April 2010, they were
                    meant to become public information by 16 April 2010. In
                    any case, any such breach in these circumstances would be a
                    very minor technical one of a few days and certainly would
                    not justify the extreme remedy of termination of the JVA.
                    This was not a case of disclosure of information which was
                    never meant for the public eye and which brought detriment
                    to the owner of the information.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-5" style="font-variant: small-caps;">The good faith obligation in Clause 24</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_136"></a>136    Sembcorp alleged that
                    the disposal of Baker’s entire interest in PPL
                    Holdings to Yangzijiang breached the obligation of good
                    faith owed by PPL Holdings to Sembcorp pursuant to cl 24 of
                    the JVA. This clause obliged the parties to the joint
                    venture to do all things reasonably within their power to
                    give effect to the spirit and interest of the joint venture.
                    Sembcorp’s case was that the spirit of the joint
                    venture was that each of the parties would participate in
                    the expansion of PPL Shipyard’s business and that the
                    identity of the parties to the joint venture was to remain
                    the same on a long term basis.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_137"></a>137    I see no merit in this
                    contention. As discussed previously, such obligations
                    incumbent on the parties to the joint venture would bear on
                    PPL Holdings which remained very much a part of the joint
                    venture (albeit now in the ownership of Yangzijiang) and
                    would continue to contribute to the expansion of PPL
                    Shipyard. If Sembcorp was contending that Baker should not
                    have sold its shares to Yangzijiang, those arguments have
                    been canvassed and dealt with in the context of the Second
                    Implied Term.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-5" style="font-variant: small-caps;">Whether the Third Implied Term should be implied
                into the JVA</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_138"></a>138    Sembcorp claimed that
                    the Third Implied Term should be implied into the JVA. The
                    gist of this term was that the parties and their related
                    companies would not do anything to deprive the other of the
                    benefits of cl 11.7 of the JVA. The term “related
                    company” will be used here to refer to a wholly owned
                    subsidiary, holding company, or wholly owned subsidiaries of
                    the holding company, as per the definition in cl 11.7. This
                    clause was placed in the general share transfer provisions
                    of cl 11 and essentially provided that if either of the
                    parties wanted to transfer all of its shares in PPL Shipyard
                    to a related company, there was no need to first offer those
                    shares to the other party in the joint venture, in contrast
                    to the situation where one party wanted to transfer shares
                    to a third party. Sembcorp claimed that there were two
                    benefits to cl 11.7. First, it conferred on the parties the
                    right to decide whether they wanted to be in a joint venture
                    with any potential buyer. Second, if the transferee ceased
                    to be a related company, the JVA required that the shares in
                    PPL Shipyard were to revert to the transferor.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_139"></a>139    It was not entirely
                    clear what Sembcorp was asking for in this particular claim.
                    How would this differ from saying that the other party
                    should not breach cl 11.7? If they were the same, then it is
                    obvious that parties should not breach the contracts they
                    had entered into and there was no need to imply a further
                    term to this effect. Whatever particular and unique
                    “benefits” Sembcorp saw in cl 11.7 are
                    irrelevant. If a party breached cl 11.7, it would not have
                    performed its obligations under cl 11.7 and Sembcorp would
                    therefore not have the benefit of this performance. The
                    Third Implied Term was quite unnecessary for business
                    efficacy. It would be superfluous to imply this term into
                    the JVA.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion on the plaintiff’s
                claim</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_140"></a>140    For the reasons above, I
                    dismiss Sembcorp’s claim on all counts.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Counterclaim</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_141"></a>141    In counterclaim, the
                    defendants sought many forms of declaratory reliefs and
                    several forms of injunctions or orders for specific
                    performance. Seven of those reliefs related to declarations
                    premised on a successful outcome for the defendants on the
                    plaintiff’s case, such as a declaration that the JVA
                    has not been terminated and continues to have full force. In
                    the light of my decision above, no more need be said about
                    these. The remaining reliefs related to several board
                    resolutions passed by the PPL Shipyard board after the
                    Yangzijiang offer arrived, which the defendants sought to
                    declare invalid, the purported removal of Chang and Aurol
                    from the PPL Shipyard board and the purported removal of the
                    managing director and company secretary from PPL Shipyard,
                    which the defendants sought to prevent by injunction. The
                    defendants organised their counterclaim into four separate
                    issues. The first relates to whether the Sembcorp-nominated
                    directors on the PPL Shipyard board were entitled to request
                    any of the PPL Holdings-nominated directors to vacate their
                    directorships and thus, whether Aurol was validly removed as
                    a director. The second relates to whether certain
                    resolutions passed at a board meeting of 28 April 2010
                    were valid. The third relates to whether certain resolutions
                    passed at board meetings in May and June 2010 were valid. In
                    respect of the first, second and third issues, the
                    defendants also claimed relief under s 216 of the Companies
                    Act (Cap 50, 2006 Rev Ed). The fourth issue concerns the
                    question of the alleged conflicts between the JVA and the
                    Consequential Articles and whether they should be
                    rectified.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The first issue in counterclaim: Whether
                Sembcorp-nominated directors on the PPL Shipyard board could
                request PPL Holdings-nominated directors to vacate their
                directorships</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_142"></a>142    On 8 June 2010, a
                    letter addressed to Aurol was sent by the six directors that
                    Sembcorp had nominated to the PPL Shipyard board
                    (“the six Sembcorp directors”). This letter
                    was also copied to Chang and the other director that PPL
                    Holdings had nominated to the PPL Shipyard board,
                    Mr Douglas Tan. The letter stated<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_16" id="Ftn_16_1"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span>:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">2.    We note that you have admitted
                            disclosing [PPL Shipyard’s] financial
                            statements for the year 2009 (“<b>Financial
                            Statements</b>”) to [Yangzijiang]. At
                            the time of the disclosure, the Financial Statements
                            were confidential information belonging to [PPL
                            Shipyard] as they had not been filed with [ACRA]. We
                            are of the view that this constitutes a breach of
                            your fiduciary duties to [PPL
                        Shipyard].</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">3.    As stated in our letter to you
                            dated 6 May 2010, we consider this breach to
                            constitute serious misconduct. This is particularly
                            so in light of the fact that Yangzijiang is a
                            potential competitor of [PPL Shipyard]. We do not
                            agree with your position that the breach is merely
                            “technical”.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">4.    It is also significant that the
                            disclosure of the Financial Statements occurred at a
                            time when [Baker] was negotiating the purported sale
                            of its indirect shareholding in [PPL Shipyard] to
                            Yangzijiang. Given this, it is clear that you are
                            conflicted in your dual role as a director of both
                            [PPL Shipyard] and [Baker].</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">5.    This conflict appears to have
                            impacted your role as a director of [PPL Shipyard]
                            in other ways also. For instance, you, together with
                            the other [PPL Holdings] nominated directors, have
                            refused and/or neglected to attend directors meeting
                            (sic) after 28 April 2010. This is despite 2
                            directors meetings having been called. This
                            orchestrated attempt by you and the other PPL
                            Holdings nominated directors to stifle the operation
                            of the Board of [PPL Shipyard] is clearly not in the
                            best interests of [PPL Shipyard].</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">6.    In light of the above and after
                            consideration of how to appropriately discharge our
                            fiduciary duties, we have concluded that on balance
                            and to be prudent, notwithstanding the appointment
                            of Wong Partnership, it is in the best interests of
                            [PPL Shipyard] to require you to vacate your office
                            as a director. We are of the view that your position
                            has become untenable by virtue of your admitted
                            conduct and the present conflict. Accordingly, we,
                            as a majority of the directors of [PPL Shipyard],
                            hereby request that you vacate your office as a
                            director of [PPL Shipyard]. This request is made
                            pursuant to Article 90(g) of the Memorandum and
                            Articles of Association of [PPL Shipyard] and has
                            the effect of vacating your office as a director of
                            [PPL Shipyard] as at the date of this

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_143"></a>143    This letter from the six
                    Sembcorp directors purported to remove Aurol from his

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_144"></a>144    The defendants submitted
                    that the Sembcorp directors’ reliance on Art. 90(g)
                    was misconceived because it ran contrary to the overall
                    scheme of the Articles on two counts. First, a director
                    could only be appointed or removed with the consent of the
                    shareholder who had nominated him (and there were only two
                    shareholders, Sembcorp and PPL Holdings). The defendants
                    cited Articles 76A, 85 and 86(2) in support of this. Article
                    86(1) is included for the fuller picture:</p>

                            to fill a casual vacancy or as an addition to the

                            reason to be a Director. Each of the members agree

                    without the participation of at least one director from PPL
                    Holdings. The defendants cited Articles 98 and 101(a) in
                    support of this:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">98.    The Directors may meet

                            and determine the quorum necessary for the
                            transaction of business. Until otherwise determined
                            by the Board, two Directors shall constitute a

                            one PPLH Director and one Sembcorp Director shall be
                            present otherwise there shall be no quorum. At any
                            meeting of the Board, provided a quorum is present,
                            every Director shall be entitled to one vote save
                            that (a) if less than three PPLH Directors are

                            to an aggregate of three votes irrespective of the
                            number of PPLH Directors present, and (b) if less
                            than three Sembcorp Directors are present, the
                            Sembcorp Directors present at the meeting of the
                            Board shall collectively be entitled to an aggregate
                            of three votes irrespective of the number of

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">101(a)    A resolution in writing
                            signed by all of the Directors for the time being
                            shall be as effective for all purposes as a
                            resolution of the Directors passed at a meeting duly
                            convened, held and constituted. A written
                            notification of confirmation of such resolution in
                            writing sent by a Director shall be deemed to be his

                            purposes of this Article. Such resolution in writing
                            may consist of several documents, each signed by one
                            or more Directors.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_146"></a>146    According to the
                    defendants, in the light of the above Articles, and as a
                    matter of purposive interpretation, the operation of Article
                    90(g) should be impliedly subject to two qualifications,
                        <em>viz</em>, that a director can
                    only be removed with the consent of the shareholder who
                    nominated him and the phrase “majority of the other
                    directors” must include at least one director
                    nominated by PPL Holdings and by Sembcorp. The exercise
                    which the defendants invited this court to undertake is
                    similar to that which Lord Hoffmann in <em>Belize</em> undertook. His Lordship in <em>Belize</em> had to consider whether a
                    certain term should be implied into a company’s
                    articles of association, not a contract, and the eventual
                    implication of the term was grounded on the basis of the
                    overall scheme of the articles, not of close consideration
                    of the particular factual matrix before the Privy Council.
                    The implication of terms into articles of association as
                    compared to contracts is not necessarily a different
                    exercise and especially not in this case. Here, the
                    Consequential Articles were modified to take into account
                    the provisions of the JVA and the Consequential Articles
                    were essentially the product of an agreement between
                    Sembcorp and PPL Holdings as to how the relationship between
                    themselves in the joint venture company, PPL Shipyard, was
                    to be governed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_147"></a>147    The first point to note
                    is that the scheme of the Articles is such that the
                    directors of the PPL Shipyard board can only exercise their
                    powers as directors at a meeting with the requisite quorum.
                    Article 102 states:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">102.  A meeting of the Directors at
                            which a quorum is present shall be competent to
                            exercise all the powers, authorities and discretions
                            for the time being vested in or exercisable by the
                            Directors generally.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">A meeting of directors at which a quorum is
                    present shall be competent to exercise directorial powers.
                    It follows that a meeting of directors without quorum shall
                    not be competent to exercise directorial powers. It cannot
                    be that the Consequential Articles took the trouble to
                    specify the requirements for quorum if no quorum was
                    required anyway for the directors to exercise their powers.
                    If it were otherwise, Art 102 would be rendered
                    meaningless.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_148"></a>148    The second point to note
                    is that the individuals who constitute the board of PPL
                    Shipyard only have power in relation to PPL Shipyard insofar
                    as they act in their capacity as directors. If they are also
                    shareholders, they can also act in their capacity as
                    shareholders but that is not relevant to this issue. The
                    only power they can exercise is directorial power. They have
                    no other inherent or intrinsic power and their power flows
                    from the holding of their office. Therefore, the only
                    actions they can take in relation to PPL Shipyard must be a
                    result of the exercise of that directorial power. There is
                    no other nexus between their actions and PPL
                    Shipyard.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_149"></a>149    Logically, therefore,
                    the individuals on the PPL Shipyard board can only act in
                    relation to PPL Shipyard in their capacity as directors.
                    Their actions as such directors can only be effected at a
                    meeting with the requisite quorum.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_150"></a>150    How does this relate to
                    Art 90 (g) which states that a director can be removed
                    if he is requested to do so in writing by a majority of the
                    other directors? The removal of a fellow director
                    unquestionably falls within the ambit of an exercise of
                    directorial powers in relation to PPL Shipyard. Such removal
                    is a question of the management of the PPL Shipyard board
                    and thus of the management of PPL Shipyard itself. If the
                    other directors can only exercise their directorial powers
                    at a meeting with the requisite quorum, then such a meeting
                    must be constituted in order to remove a fellow
                    director.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_151"></a>151    The requirement of
                    writing should not be allowed to distract and should not be
                    thought of as a requirement that would legitimise any
                    purported action by the directors regardless of whether the
                    requirement of quorum was complied with. The requirement of
                    writing here does not appear to take on the significance
                    that it would, for example, in relation to contracts for the
                    sale of land.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_152"></a>152    Put simply, a director
                    of PPL Shipyard could only be removed by his fellow
                    directors if they took such action pursuant to a meeting at
                    which there was the requisite quorum. Both cl 5.3 of the JVA
                    and Art 98 of the Consequential Articles are clear that
                    quorum is constituted by the presence of at least one PPL
                    Holdings-nominated director and one Sembcorp-nominated
                    director.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_153"></a>153    On that note, although
                    the overall outcome of this reasoning may be favourable to
                    the defendants, I am not inclined to granting them the
                    specific reliefs that they asked for. I do not think it
                    necessary to imply that the phrase “the majority of
                    the other directors” must include at least one PPL
                    Holdings-nominated director because it is possible that
                    there could be a meeting at which the requisite quorum was
                    constituted and a majority of directors took the action to
                    remove a director but such majority did not include at least
                    one PPL Holdings-nominated director. Neither could I imply
                    that a director could only be removed by the shareholder
                    that had nominated him as the overall scheme of the Articles
                    did not appear to point in that direction.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_154"></a>154    In the result, the
                    letter from the six Sembcorp directors, written without a
                    directors’ meeting with the requisite quorum, did not
                    constitute a valid request for Aurol to vacate his office as
                    director of PPL Shipyard. PPL Shipyard should not be allowed
                    to treat him as having vacated his office. I do not think it
                    necessary to grant the injunctive reliefs asked for by the
                    defendants in respect of Chang and/or Douglas Tan, that this
                    court should prevent by injunction PPL Shipyard from
                    requesting Chang and/or Douglas Tan to vacate their
                    directorships and/or treating Chang and Douglas Tan as
                    having so done except with the defendants’ consent. It
                    should suffice to hold that any removal of any director has
                    to be done at a board meeting with the requisite
                    quorum.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_155"></a>155    One final point that was
                    raised by the defendants in relation to this issue was
                    whether Aurol’s service agreement as Executive
                    Director of PPL Shipyard had been validly terminated. This
                    termination was purportedly effected by a letter from Mr
                    Tang Kin Fei (a Sembcorp-nominated director) on 11 June
                    2010, on the basis that Aurol’s appointment as an
                    executive of PPL Shipyard was dependent on his remaining as
                    a director. In the light of my findings above, Aurol’s
                    executive appointment was not validly terminated because he
                    was not validly removed as a director of PPL
                    Shipyard.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The second issue in counterclaim: Whether the
                resolutions passed at the PPL Shipyard board meeting of
                28 April 2010 were valid</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_156"></a>156    The defendants claimed
                    that certain resolutions passed at a meeting of the PPL
                    Shipyard board on 28 April 2010 were invalid. These
                    resolutions purported to<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_17" id="Ftn_17_1"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a></span>:</p>

                        Secretary...</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_157"></a>157    The defendants submitted
                    that these were invalid for three reasons. First, they were
                    purportedly passed on the basis that the Sembcorp-nominated
                    directors had six votes and the PPL Holdings-nominated
                    directors had three votes. This, according to the
                    defendants, was erroneous. Second, the resolutions were not
                    passed <em>bona fide</em> in the
                    interests of PPL Shipyard. Third, and in the case of
                    resolution (c) only, the Consequential Articles did not give
                    the PPL Shipyard board any power to appoint joint company
                    secretaries.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-5" style="font-variant: small-caps;">Whether the resolutions are invalid on the
                grounds that sembcorp improperly asserted its six director votes
                to PPL Holdings’ three</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_158"></a>158    In relation to their
                    first reason, the defendants relied on cl 5.3 of the JVA,
                    the relevant portion of which provides:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">At any meeting of the [PPL Shipyard board], provided a
                        quorum is present, each party will have three (3) votes
                        irrespective of the number of directors present.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">In response, Sembcorp referred to Art 98 of the
                    Consequential Articles, the relevant part of which
                    states:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">At any meeting of the Board, provided a quorum is
                        present, every Director shall be entitled to one vote
                        save that (a) if less than three PPLH Directors are
                        present, all the PPLH Directors present at the meeting
                        of the Board shall collectively be entitled to an
                        aggregate of three votes irrespective of the number of
                        PPLH Directors present, and (b) if less than three
                        Sembcorp Directors are present, the Sembcorp Directors
                        present at the meeting of the Board shall collectively
                        be entitled to an aggregate of three votes irrespective
                        of the number of Sembcorp Directors present.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Sembcorp’s point was that Art 98 restricted
                    the provision for three votes each to Sembcorp-nominated
                    directors and PPL Holdings-nominated directors to the
                    situation where there were less than three directors from
                    each side present. If one side had more than three directors
                    present, those directors would be entitled to one vote
                    each.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_159"></a>159    The defendants then
                    pointed to cl 31.2 of the JVA, which provides:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In the event of any conflict between the terms of [the
                        JVA] and the Memorandum and Articles of Association, the
                        terms of the [JVA] shall, as between the parties hereto,
                        prevail...</p>
<p class="Judg-1">On the basis of this provision, the defendants
                    submitted that any provision in the JVA would prevail at all
                    times over any contradictory provision in the Memorandum and
                    Articles.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_160"></a>160    The keyword here is
                    “conflict”. If and only if the terms of the
                    JVA conflict with the words of the Consequential Articles,
                    the terms of the JVA would prevail. The question here then
                    is whether cl 5.3 and Art 98 conflict with each other.
                    Sembcorp’s contention would mean that on a plain
                    reading of Art 98, it is only if there are less than three
                    directors present from each party, that each party will be
                    entitled to three votes. If more than three directors are
                    present, then each director will be entitled to one vote
                    each. According to the defendants, however, on a plain
                    reading of cl 5.3, <em>irrespective
                        of</em> the number of directors present, each
                    party will be entitled to three votes. This means that the
                    number of directors present does not matter because the
                    entitlement of each party would be three votes in any event.
                    On the interpretation that the defendants advanced, even if
                    the number of directors exceeded three, each party would
                    still be entitled to three votes. On the defendant’s
                    case, therefore, the apparent difference between the two
                    provisions relates to what should happen in the event that
                    more than three directors from a party are present at the
                    meeting.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_161"></a>161    The objective of cl 5.3
                    of the JVA is to preserve adequate representation for both
                    parties on the PPL Shipyard board. Clause 5.3 itself states
                    the requirement for quorum of a board meeting, that there
                    must be two directors present, with at least one director
                    from each party. The concern here appears to be that each
                    party should have someone to represent its interests and
                    ensure that board resolutions are not passed in its absence.
                    In order for such concerns to be protected, each party is
                    given three votes. Bearing in mind that at the time the JVA
                    was signed in 2001, each party could only nominate three
                    directors to the board, it is clear that each party was
                    afforded the maximum amount of representation it was
                    entitled to and that one party could not act unilaterally if
                    the other party objected. This would be so even if the first
                    party had all three of its directors present and the other
                    party had only one in attendance.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_162"></a>162    It could not be that if
                    there are more than three directors present from one party,
                    something not contemplated anyway when the JVA was signed,
                    that that party would by sheer number of voters be able to
                    override the other party’s three votes. It is the
                    number of votes given to each party that matters, not the
                    number of voters present. Read in their proper context, I
                    see no conflict at all between cl 5.3 and Art 98. Both are
                    directed at the same outcome – three votes on each
                    side irrespective of the number of voters present from any
                    side. The only difference was in the expressions used, with
                    the essence of the agreement having been captured by cl 5.3
                    in a more succinct way than in Art 98. The resolutions of
                    28 April 2010, insofar as they purported to be passed
                    by six votes against three, would therefore be
                    invalid.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-5" style="font-variant: small-caps;">Whether the resolutions were passed <em>bona fide</em> in the interests of PPL
                Shipyard </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_163"></a>163    In respect of its second
                    reason, the defendants submitted that the relevant question
                    to be asked is whether the Sembcorp directors were acting in
                    what they honestly believed to be the best interests of PPL
                    Shipyard, or whether, as the defendants contended, they were
                    acting in order to scuttle the deal between Baker and
                    Yangzijiang.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_164"></a>164    At this point, Sembcorp
                    contended that the defendants were essentially alleging that
                    the Sembcorp-nominated directors, in not acting <em>bona fide</em> in the interests of PPL
                    Shipyard, had breached their fiduciary duties towards the
                    company. Sembcorp claimed that the defendants lacked
                    standing to seek relief in respect of the alleged breach of
                    fiduciary duties and only the company would be the proper
                    plaintiff to such an action. This principle was enshrined in
                        <em>Foss v Harbottle</em> (1843) 2
                    Hare 461: 67 ER 189 and applied in Singapore in <em>Ng Heng </em><em>Liat and
                        ors. v </em><em>Kiyue Co Ltd and
                        anor</em> [2003] 4 SLR(R) 218. The defendants in
                    this suit were mere shareholders of the company and were not
                    bringing a derivative action on behalf of PPL Shipyard under
                    s 216A of the Companies Act.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_165"></a>165    I agree with Sembcorp
                    that the duty in issue is owed by the directors to the
                    company on whose board they sit. Fiduciary duties are owed
                    to both the company and to their fellow directors. In this
                    suit however, PPL Holdings and E-Interface were neither and
                    thus lacked the requisite standing to enforce this duty. On
                    this basis, the defendants’ claim for relief on this
                    point fails.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-5" style="font-variant: small-caps;">Whether resolution (c) is invalid on the ground
                that the Consequential Articles did not give the PPL Shipyard
                board any power to appoint joint company secretaries</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_166"></a>166    The defendants claimed
                    that under the Consequential Articles, the Sembcorp
                    directors, or the board of PPL Shipyard in general, had no
                    power, to appoint two joint secretaries for PPL Shipyard.
                    Rather, the board was constrained to appointing one
                    secretary. According to the defendants, this was because
                    Arts 109 and 110 provide:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">109. The Company shall have a Secretary. The Secretary
                        and any joint secretaries or deputy or assistant
                        secretary or secretaries may be appointed by the
                        Directors for such term... A Director may be the
                        Secretary</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">110. A provision of the Act or these regulations
                        requiring or authorising a thing to be done by or to a
                        Director and the Secretary shall not be satisfied by its
                        being done by or to the same person acting both as
                        Director and as, or in place of, Secretary.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">From the language of the Articles, the defendants
                    claimed, it was obvious that a clear distinction was drawn
                    between “Secretary” and “joint
                    secretaries” and that it should not be possible for
                    the directors to appoint two persons as joint
                    secretaries.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_167"></a>167    With respect, it is
                    difficult to see the logic behind the defendants’
                    contention here. As Sembcorp rightly pointed out, Art 109
                    itself contemplated the appointment of joint secretaries by
                    the directors. The board could appoint one or more and
                    designate them in the way it deems appropriate. The
                    defendants’ challenge on this point similarly
                    fails.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_168"></a>168    The resolutions of
                    28 April 2010, insofar as they purported to be passed
                    by six votes against three, are invalid. The
                    defendants’ challenge to these resolutions fails on
                    the other two grounds raised above.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The third issue in counterclaim: Whether certain
                resolutions passed at board meetings in May and June 2010 were
                valid</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_169"></a>169    The defendants sought a
                    declaration that the resolutions passed at certain board
                    meetings of PPL Shipyard be declared invalid. These meetings
                    took place on 11 May, 3 June, 14 June and
                    21 June 2010 (“the impugned board
                    meetings”). According to the defendants, the quorum
                    required by Art 98 was not obtained because none of the PPL
                    Holdings-nominated directors attended those meetings,
                    contrary to the requirement that at least one director from
                    each party be present. This prayer for relief was related to
                    the decisions of Woo Bih Li J in <em>Tang Kin
                        Fei v Chang Benety</em> [2011] 1 SLR 568 and of
                    the Court of Appeal in <em>Chang Benety v
                        Tang Kin Fei</em> [2012] 1 SLR 274 which
                    overturned Woo J’s decision in part.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_170"></a>170    In the above cases,
                    these prayers for relief were before the court<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_18" id="Ftn_18_1"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a></span>:</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_171"></a>171    Woo J granted an order
                    in terms in respect of certain prayers (with no order on
                    prayer 1 on the basis that its substance was covered by the
                    resolution in prayer 2, at <a href="#p1_41">[41]</a>), thus holding that those resolutions
                    should be declared valid. Chang appealed and the Court of
                    Appeal agreed with him, to the effect that those resolutions
                    which Woo J declared valid should not have been, thus
                    refusing to validate those resolutions. The eventual outcome
                    was that Mr Tang Kin Fei was not entitled to any of the
                    reliefs he sought and none of those resolutions was declared
                    valid.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_172"></a>172    On that basis, the
                    defendants sought before me declarations that the
                    resolutions referred to above were invalid. They argued that
                    the earlier decisions were made on the basis that Art 98 was
                    subsisting and operative and I decide that Art 98 was indeed
                    so, such relief should be granted. Sembcorp’s reply to
                    this was that the JVA and Art 98 were no longer valid and
                    did not subsist. It contended that the parties and the
                    issues in both sets of proceedings were different and that
                    therefore no question of issue estoppel arose.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_173"></a>173    While acknowledging that
                    the parties to the proceedings were different, in that the
                    directors Chang and Mr Tang Kin Fei were before the
                    courts in the previous set of proceedings but the
                    shareholders of PPL Shipyard are before this court, I was of
                    the opinion that the issues decided by Woo J and the Court
                    of Appeal were materially the same as the issues before me.
                    I may not be bound by those decisions in the estoppel sense
                    but I saw no reason why they should not apply since
                    substantially the same facts and issues were canvassed in
                    the previous proceedings and the present one. This is
                    especially so in the light of my decision above (see
                        <a href="#p1_99">[99]</a> to <a href="#p1_124">[124]</a>) that the First Implied
                    Term could not be read into either the JVA or the SA and
                    that the equality provisions, including Art 98,
                    subsisted.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_174"></a>174    However, the point of
                    concern was whether the defendants, as mere shareholders of
                    PPL Shipyard, have sufficient standing to seek such
                    declaratory relief. Notwithstanding that the earlier set of
                    proceedings had already decided the merits of this issue,
                    the question here was whether the defendants here were in a
                    position to apply for orders consequential upon and further
                    to that decision. On the same basis as my decision above on
                    the second issue (see <a href="#p1_163">[163]</a> to <a href="#p1_165">[165]</a>), I would decline the relief claimed
                    by the defendants. If I am wrong on the question of whether
                    the defendants have sufficient standing here, I would grant
                    the declaration sought as the impugned board meetings were
                    clearly conducted without the requisite
                quorum.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The fourth issue in counterclaim: Whether the
                conflicts between the JVA and the Consequential Articles should
                be corrected</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_175"></a>175    The defendants included
                    in their Defence and Counterclaim (Amendment No. 3) a
                    document known as Schedule 2, which set out the various
                    provisions in the JVA and the Consequential Articles which
                    were allegedly in conflict with each other. On the basis of
                    cl 31.2 of the JVA (see <a href="#p1_159">[159]</a> above), the defendants contended that
                    the provisions of the Articles should be corrected to bring
                    them in line with the JVA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_176"></a>176    However, a detailed
                    examination of the alleged conflicts between the words of
                    the provisions is not a matter that should involve the
                    court. It would suffice to say that cl 31.2 is a clause that
                    subsists and that it still governs the relationship between
                    the parties. The parties should therefore correct any
                    conflict between the provisions by themselves as it is
                    really a contractual matter between them.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_177"></a>177    It should also be noted
                    that in Schedule 2, the first set of provisions which the
                    defendants requested this court to bring in line with each
                    other is cl 5.3 of the JVA and Art 98. For the reasons
                    stated above (see <a href="#p1_158">[158]</a>
                    to <a href="#p1_162">[162]</a>), these
                    provisions are not in conflict with each
                other.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The defendants’ claims under s 216 of the
                Companies Act</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_178"></a>178    In respect of the first,
                    second and third issues in the counterclaim, <em>viz</em>, the board resolutions of
                    28 April 2010 and the impugned board meetings, the
                    defendants also prayed for relief under s 216 of the
                    Companies Act which is a provision for relief for minority
                    shareholders on the ground of oppression.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_179"></a>179    There is no reason to
                    grant any further relief here. The prayer for relief under s
                    216 of the Companies Act could not be a device to circumvent
                    the defendants’ lack of standing for the second and
                    third issues. In respect of the second issue, the defendants
                    have not shown how the resolutions were unfair or
                    oppressive. In respect of the third issue, the substantive
                    issues have already been decided by Woo J and the Court of
                    Appeal.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_180"></a>180    For the reasons set out
                    above, I dismiss Sembcorp’s claims entirely and allow
                    the defendants’ counterclaim in part. Sembcorp is to
                    pay the defendants costs of this action and of the
                    counterclaim, with appropriate deductions to be made for the
                    issues which the defendants have failed in.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_181"></a>181    I make no order as to
                    costs in respect of PPL Shipyard in the counterclaim as its
                    participation in the proceedings was essentially confined to
                    that of holding a watching brief on the developments. It did
                    not call any evidence and did not cross-examine any witness
                    during the trial. Its closing submissions have not changed
                    or added to the issues in contention between Sembcorp and
                    the defendants. The costs of Wong Partnership for acting for
                    PPL Shipyard will have to be resolved between the law firm
                    and Sembcorp or the Sembcorp-nominated directors on the
                    board of PPL Shipyard.</p>
