        V K Rajah JA (delivering the judgment of the

<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       Civil Appeal No 124 of 2009
                    (“CA 124”) which is brought by Lim Hsi-Wei Marc
                    (“ML”) and Civil Appeal No 127 of 2009
                    (“CA 127”) which is brought by Orix Capital Limited
                    (“Orix”) arise from the decision of a High Court judge
                    (“the Judge”) in <em>Orix Capital Ltd v Personal
                        Representative(s) of the Estate of Lim Chor Pee (deceased) and
                        others</em> [2009] 4 SLR(R) 1062 (“the
                    HC Judgment”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The appeals raise knotty issues with respect to
                    the authority of a partner or sole proprietor to bind his salaried partners, and
                    the extent to which a retired salaried partner may continue to be held
                    responsible for liabilities of a firm. More specifically, an issue arises as to
                    whether a partner or sole proprietor of a law firm has the apparent authority to
                    bind his salaried partners when he borrows a substantial amount of money not
                    just to finance the lease of office equipment but largely for the purpose of
                    easing the firm’s cash flow problems. In the course of determining these
                    issues, we would also have to consider what acts are within the course of the
                    usual business of a law firm.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The facts</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       Chor Pee &amp; Partners (“CPP”)
                    was founded in 1997 by Lim Chor Pee (“LCP”). At all material
                    times, he practised as an advocate and solicitor under that name. He was also,
                    until his demise in 2006, CPP’s principal decision maker –
                    administering it with a firm hand, usually without reference to his other
                    colleagues.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       ML, LCP’s son, joined CPP as a legal
                    assistant on its inception and continued working under that name until its
                    dissolution following LCP’s demise. In 2001, he was elevated to the status
                    of a “salaried partner” by a letter of appointment signed by LCP.
                    The terms of appointment stipulated that except for the remuneration set out in
                    a schedule attached to the letter, ML’s new status was to be
                        “<em>without any other participation in the profits or
                        loss and assets and liabilities of the firm</em>”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> [emphasis added]. ML testified
                    that he only handled legal work and was never involved in the administrative and
                    financial affairs of the firm. Orix does not dispute this.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       In 2003, Rebecca Marie Stephanie Tai-Yeo Hsiu
                    Erh (“RY”) joined CPP on a special “profit sharing”
                    basis. She did not receive a fixed salary from the firm. Instead, she received a
                    percentage of profits on files that were: (a) handled wholly or partly by
                    her; (b) referred by her to the firm; and/or (c) referred by the firm
                    to her. She also contributed to the payment of the salaries of the staff that
                    worked with her, with CPP paying the balance. She affirmed that her arrangement
                    with CPP was akin to that of a “consultant” but at the material
                    time, she did not have the requisite number of years of post-qualification
                    experience required for consultant status under the professional guidelines.
                    She, therefore, joined CPP as a nominal salaried partner instead. There was no
                    partnership agreement entered into between RY and LCP. Instead, a document
                    captioned “<font style="text-transform: uppercase;">Profit Sharing Agreement Between Chor
                        Pee &amp; Partners (CPP) &amp; Rebecca Tai-Yeo
                        (“Partner”)</font>” was e-mailed by LCP to
                        her<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span>. The document provided that
                    she, like ML, would be a salaried partner “<em>without
                        participation in the assets and liabilities</em>”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span>
                    [emphasis added] of the firm. Unlike ML, however, RY did not remain with CPP
                    until it was dissolved. By 18 May 2005, RY ceased to work on a
                    profit-sharing basis and assumed the position of a senior associate of the firm.
                    She left CPP entirely on 31 July 2005.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The Newcourt Agreement</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       On 1 August 2001, prior to the appointment
                    of ML and RY as salaried partners, CPP had entered into a lease agreement
                    (“the Newcourt Agreement”) with Newcourt Financial (Singapore) Pte
                    Ltd (“Newcourt”) for the use of four black-and-white copiers
                    (“the Newcourt copiers”)<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span>.
                    The terms of the Newcourt Agreement provided that CPP was to pay 60 monthly
                    instalments of $2,955 between 1 August 2001 and 31 July 2006. The
                    total amount due under the Newcourt Agreement was $177,300. Pursuant to
                    Art 26 of the Newcourt Agreement, in the event of early termination, CPP
                    would pay, <em>inter alia</em>, “the total amount of
                    the rent payable under [the Newcourt Agreement] for the entire term” and
                    a sum of $46,640 as “agreed liquidated damages”.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The Amended Newcourt Agreement</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       Presumably because of a default (or at least a
                    request) by CPP, the parties amended the Newcourt Agreement by a letter dated
                    5 February 2004<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_5" id="Ftn_5_1"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span>. This took place
                    after ML had been appointed a salaried partner (see <a href="#p1_4">[4]</a> above), though he denied any contemporaneous knowledge of
                    the amendment, claiming that he had only learnt of it in 2007. In consideration
                    of a payment of $300 by CPP, Orix extended the lease to 4 February 2010
                    (“the Amended Newcourt Agreement”). Also, in addition to the rent
                    of $88,650 that had already been paid under the Newcourt Agreement (<em>ie</em>, the original agreement) over the last 30 months,
                    further payments were due from 5 February 2004 onwards in accordance with
                    the following amended schedule<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_6" id="Ftn_6_1"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span>:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">LEASE TERM RENTALS:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Month 01-12: S$1,800.00 monthly rental,</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Month 13-24: S$2,000.00 monthly rental,</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Month 25-36: S$2,200.00 monthly rental,</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Month 37-48: S$2,400.00 monthly rental,</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Month 49-60: S$2,600.00 monthly rental and</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Month 61-72: S$2,653.76 monthly rental.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(plus any applicable taxes and duties)</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The amendment to the payment schedule increased CPP’s overall
                    liability under the Newcourt Agreement by a further $75,195.12, while reducing,
                    in the short term, the amount of rent payable monthly from $2,955 to $1,800 for
                    the first 12 months of the amended payment schedule. Plainly, the new payment
                    schedule was purely intended to ease CPP’s short-term cash flow, as it, at
                    the same time, resulted in a not insignificant increase of the firm’s
                    overall liability in the medium to long term.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The Original Agreement with Orix</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       On the evidence, it would seem that CPP was, for
                    several years preceding its eventual dissolution, in dire financial straits.
                    Susanna Soh (“Soh”), the office manager of CPP, testified that
                    “[LCP] was worried about his overheads”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_7" id="Ftn_7_1"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span> There is also evidence that on
                    at least one occasion, LCP desperately asked RY for contributions towards the
                    salary of an employee (who was not working with or for her) because he could not
                    afford to retain that employee without a financial contribution from RY. LCP,
                    however, never had any candid discussions with ML and RY on the state of
                    CPP’s financial problems. That CPP had serious cash flow difficulties is
                    an important consideration in this matter as it helps explain why in 2004 LCP
                    was willing to enter into the subject transaction with Orix (we will elaborate
                    on this in the immediate paragraphs below) which was otherwise commercially
                    insensible.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       Sometime in July 2004, Dora Loh
                    (“Loh”), a senior sales consultant of Canon Singapore Pte Ltd
                    (“Canon”), proposed to Soh, that the four pre-existing copiers
                        (<em>ie</em>, the Newcourt copiers) be replaced by two
                    new Canon copiers (one model was to be black-and-white, and the other was to be
                    a colour copier) (“the Canon copiers”). After ascertaining from
                    Newcourt that CPP would have to pay a sum of $164,144.34 to prematurely
                    terminate the Amended Newcourt Agreement, Loh secured an agreement between Canon
                    and Orix in which the latter would essentially provide financing for the Canon
                    copiers. This agreement had the following key features: (a) Canon would
                    sell to Orix the Canon copiers for $231,500 (excluding Goods and Services Tax
                    (“GST”)); and (b) in turn, Orix would lease the Canon copiers
                    to CPP over a period of six years. To add some perspective to this transaction,
                        <em>it is noteworthy that the ordinary sale price of the
                        (two) Canon copiers was just $65,025.66</em>. This transaction would
                    eventually result in CPP undertaking a liability to Orix which was almost four
                    times more than the ordinary sale value of the Canon copiers. At the trial, an
                    internal credit approval document, belatedly disclosed by Orix, revealed that
                    the true purpose of the facility of $231,500 was twofold – to purchase the
                    Canon copiers as well as to permit a “rollover” of $120,000
                    payable by CPP. The relevant portions of that document state<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_8" id="Ftn_8_1"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span>:</p>

                                    loan.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In view of the above, this application is recommended for approval.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added in italics]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Danny Lee (“Lee”), a former sales executive with Orix,
                    who administered this transaction, acknowledged during cross-examination that
                    Orix had known that Loh’s proposal to extend financing to CPP based on the
                    sum of $231,500 included a large amount to be paid to a prior financier. In
                    fact, Lee also revealed that Loh had informed him that the estimated amount that
                    had to be settled was $110,000. The arrangement, in short, was that Orix would
                    pay $231,500 to Canon for the Canon copiers and Canon would in turn settle the
                    early termination sum payable to Newcourt.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     Having secured Orix’s agreement to
                    extend the facility of $231,500, Loh conveyed the proposal to Soh. As CPP was
                    then paying Newcourt $1,800 each month, Loh proposed that the rental payments
                    under the lease from Orix ought to initially remain at $1,800 per month but
                    would subsequently be increased after the lapse of every two-year period. She
                    was well aware from her prior discussions with Soh that CPP was anxious to
                    improve its cash flow and was unlikely to agree to upgrade its copiers if this
                    would result in additional monthly expenditure for the firm. Her proposal from
                    an immediate cash flow point of view would have been extremely attractive to the
                    financially beleaguered LCP as over the next three to four years it would
                    require even smaller rental payments than the existing Newcourt arrangement.
                    Moreover, certain minimum copying charges payable under the existing Newcourt
                    arrangement would also be dispensed with under the proposal.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     After discussing the proposal with only LCP,
                    Soh signed an agreement dated 15 July 2004 with Canon on behalf of CPP. Loh
                    signed on behalf of Canon. The key terms of this agreement mirrored those Loh
                    secured from Orix on behalf of Canon (see <a href="#p1_9">[9]</a>
                    above).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     Thereafter, Orix prepared a lease agreement in
                    respect of the Canon copiers. While there might have been in all a few reasons
                    prompting LCP to sign this lease, it clearly emerged in cross-examination that
                    the key consideration was an acute desire to keep overheads down while replacing
                    the dated Newcourt copiers.</p>

<p class="Judg-1">The total rent payable over six years was $305,400

                    increase in the rental amounts due over time even as the Canon copiers
                    depreciated in value. Upon the expiration of the lease, the printers would be
                    returned to Orix at the lessee’s expense. The lessee also bore the burden
                    of maintaining the copiers and repairing any malfunction. In this document, the

<p class="Judg-1">LCP and ML were the only signatories to the lease, and their

                    LCP or Orix of the existence of this lease that included her name.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     Between July and August 2004, the Canon
                    copiers were delivered to CPP. Meanwhile, on 3 August 2004, after Orix paid
                    it, Canon made payment of $172,351.56 (inclusive of GST) for the early
                    termination of the Newcourt arrangement, settling CPP’s outstanding
                    obligations under the Amended Newcourt Agreement.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     CPP kept up with the monthly rental due under
                    the Original Agreement until April 2005 before defaulting. This led Orix to
                    issue a letter of demand for the entire unpaid rental on 7 July
                        2005<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_13" id="Ftn_13_1"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span>. The amount claimed was $306,632.59.
                    In the letter, addressed only to CPP, the firm was notified that the unpaid rent
                    constituted an “event of default”, pursuant to which the agreement
                    was “<em>deemed to have been
                        repudiated</em>”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_14" id="Ftn_14_1"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span>
                    [emphasis added]. On 22 July 2005, Orix’s solicitors sent a second
                    letter of demand, reiterating that the Original Agreement had been repudiated,
                    and that Orix accepted that repudiation. A demand was made for a larger sum of
                    $307,627.98, taking into account, <em>inter alia</em>,
                    interest due. This letter, unlike the first letter issued by Orix, was addressed
                    to LCP, ML and RY. There is no evidence, however, that ML or RY ever received
                    this letter or were aware of its contents. Further, it is significant that well
                    before the subject demands had been sent, RY had ceased to work as a salaried
                    partner of CPP (see <a href="#p1_5">[5]</a> above).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Reinstatement of the Original Agreement - A new contract</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     It is common ground that RY had no knowledge
                    of the Orix leasing arrangements and CPP’s difficulties in servicing the
                    monthly instalments. ML was also unaware of the defaults. LCP continued, after
                    RY’s departure, to be solely involved in negotiations with Orix regarding
                    the unpaid rent and the reinstatement of the Original Agreement. Further, it
                    does not appear that either ML or RY received a letter dated 5 August 2005,
                    which Orix’s solicitors sent to CPP. This letter was addressed to both of
                    them and LCP. In that letter, Orix agreed to the lease being
                    “reinstated” provided, <em>inter alia</em>,
                    that the outstanding amounts were paid and that monthly payments were made by
                    GIRO thereafter<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_15" id="Ftn_15_1"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span>. On 29 August
                    2005, Orix received payment of the outstanding amounts and from then on, it
                    treated the Original Agreement as having been reinstated. No official letter was
                    sent confirming the reinstatement. Orix claimed that it was then not aware that
                    RY had left the firm. Be that as it may, it did not take any steps to ensure
                    that ML and RY had consented to, or at least were aware of, this new
                    arrangement.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Events leading to the trial</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     After LCP’s demise on 5 December
                    2006, another default in the payment schedule occurred on 1 January 2007.
                    Orix promptly treated the default as repudiatory conduct and terminated the
                    lease on 18 January 2007. In a letter addressed to the personal
                    representatives of LCP, ML and RY, it demanded payment of
                        $263,589.80<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_16" id="Ftn_16_1"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span>. On 24 April 2007, the
                    Canon copiers were repossessed by Orix and later sold for the paltry sum of
                    $3,150. Soon after, Orix commenced these proceedings to recover the losses and
                    damages arising from the repudiation of the lease. The estate of LCP, ML and RY
                    were named as defendants. The estate of LCP has accepted liability and final
                    judgment has already been entered against it. It does not appear that the estate
                    has sufficient funds to satisfy Orix’s claim, hence the determined pursuit
                    of its claims against ML and RY.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The decision below</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     On the basis that once a contract has been
                    terminated it ends and is not capable of being revived even by the
                    parties’ agreement, the Judge below held that the Original Agreement with
                    Orix could not be “reinstated” post-termination. Instead, a fresh
                    contract had been created (“the August Agreement”) (see the
                    HC Judgment at [30]–[31]). It was found by the Judge that (the
                    HC Judgment at [30]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">what [Orix] called the “Reinstatement Agreement” actually
                        became part of the <em>new contract</em> for the lease
                        of the [Canon copiers] and [the August Agreement] comprised the new terms
                        set out in [Orix’s] solicitors’ letters and the other terms
                        contained in the terminated lease [<em>ie</em>, the
                        Original Agreement]. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">She held that it was the August Agreement that Orix was suing on, and
                    not the Original Agreement concluded in 2004 (see the HC Judgment at [33]).
                    All the parties in both CA 124 and CA 127 have accepted this approach
                    as correct. Because of this consensus and Orix’s pleadings, we will accept
                    this view of the August Agreement for the purposes of the present appeals,
                    although the legal proposition that a contract once terminated cannot be
                    revived, even by agreement, might be questionable.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Vis-à-vis ML</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     Regarding the issue of ML’s liability,
                    the Judge held that at the time of the conclusion of the August Agreement, ML
                    was still being held out as a partner of the firm. Therefore, when LCP spoke to
                    Orix’s representatives, he was still acting on ML’s behalf. As
                    ML’s status as a salaried partner had not changed, he had not withdrawn
                    from LCP the authority to represent him as a partner of the firm. The August
                    Agreement that LCP had contracted in the name of the firm therefore bound ML
                    (see the HC Judgment at [45]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     The Judge did not accept any of ML’s
                    defences. She did not agree that the Original Agreement and the August Agreement
                    were sham transactions and were therefore null and void (see the
                    HC Judgment at [52]). This was because although the repayment obligation
                    was disproportionate to the value of the Canon copiers considered in isolation,
                    the parties had intended and did in fact create a legal relationship between
                    them and had acted according to the apparent purpose and tenor of their
                    concluded agreement, which was for a lease (see the HC Judgment at
                    [59]–[60]). Further, none of the parties were deceived as to the terms of
                    the transaction between them (the HC Judgment at [60]). She also did not
                    agree that the Original Agreement and the August Agreement were harsh and
                    oppressive transactions, and therefore unconscionable (see the HC Judgment
                    at [69]). She declined to take the view that Orix was exploiting CPP’s
                    allegedly precarious financial position on the basis that there was no evidence
                    that Orix was apprised of this fact. The Judge also did not accept that the
                    Original Agreement and the August Agreement were in fact money-lending
                    transactions (see the HC Judgment at [76]). She pointed out that despite
                    allegations regarding the exorbitant nature of the rent agreed to, it ought to
                    be borne in mind that there was already a pre-existing liability in the form of
                    the Amended Newcourt Agreement (the early termination of which would cause CPP
                    to have to pay a substantial sum (see <a href="#p1_6">[6]</a>
                    above)). Orix was in the business of leasing out office equipment and the lease
                    was part and parcel of its usual business and could not be considered a
                    money-lending transaction.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     In CA 124, ML appeals against the
                    Judge’s decision to hold him liable for Orix’s claim.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Vis-à-vis RY</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     Having found that ML was liable, the Judge
                    turned to the issue of RY’s liability. The Judge held that RY could have
                    been held liable under the Original Agreement (see the HC Judgment at
                    [104]). RY had consented to be held out as a partner and ought to have been
                    aware that she would become liable for the transactions of the firm in the
                    course of its usual business. However, in relation to the August Agreement,
                    which was the subject of the claim, the Judge found that RY had no liability
                    (see the HC Judgment at [110]). As she had left the firm before the August
                    Agreement was concluded, LCP had no authority to act as her agent and to bind
                    her to the August Agreement. Even if LCP made representations that she was still
                    a partner, Orix’s remedy lay in suing him (or his estate) for the
                    misrepresentation, and not in a claim against RY who had not authorised the
                    representation.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     The Judge also held that s 36 of the
                    Partnership Act (Cap 391, 1994 Rev Ed) (“PA”), which
                    governs the rights of persons dealing with a firm against apparent members of
                    the firm, did not make RY liable to Orix (see the HC Judgment at [111]).
                    She based her decision on two grounds. First, RY had only been at best an
                    ostensible partner. She was at no time in law a true partner of the firm. As
                    such, even when she left, there was no change in the constitution of the firm;
                    as this is one of the elements required under s 36 of the PA, that
                    provision could not apply to render RY liable. Second, the Judge held that as
                    the Original Agreement had been terminated and Orix was not continuing to do
                    business with CPP on the “old basis” but on the basis of a fresh
                    agreement (the HC Judgment at [111]), RY did not have to give notice of her
                    withdrawal from the firm in order to be relieved of liability.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     In CA 127, Orix appeals against the
                    dismissal of its claim against RY.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Issues arising out of the present appeals</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     Although a number of other peripheral
                    questions had been raised during the proceedings below, the real issues that
                    surfaced in the present appeals were just the following three issues:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_25-p2_a"></a>(a)     whether the intended lessee of the
                        Original Agreement and, more crucially, the August Agreement, was CPP as a
                        firm or LCP, ML and RY in their personal capacities;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_25-p2_b"></a>(b)     whether the Original Agreement and the
                        August Agreement were transactions entered into in the usual course of
                        business of CPP; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_25-p2_c"></a>(c)     whether RY, after having left CPP, was liable under the August
                        Agreement pursuant to s 36 of the PA.</p>
<p class="Judg-2">We will now address
                        each of these issues in turn.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Our decision</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Issue 1: Who were the parties to the Original Agreement and the
                August Agreement?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     The description of the lessee in the Original
                    Agreement has already been set out above at <a href="#p1_13">[13]</a>. On a literal reading, the words used in the description
                    give rise to an ambiguity as to whether the intended lessee was CPP as a firm,
                    or LCP, ML and RY in their personal capacities. The words “practicing
                    under” suggest that Orix might not have been contracting with CPP as a
                    firm, but rather directly with the three individuals named who all happened to
                    be “practising under” the same firm at the material time. For the
                    purpose of comparison, if the more common expression “practising
                        <em>in the name of</em> (or “<em>as</em>”) [firm’s name]” had been used instead,
                    it would have been clear that it was CPP as a firm that was the intended lessee
                    and not just the three individuals named.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     After carefully considering the available
                    evidence as a whole, we think it likely that the Original Agreement was intended
                    to be with CPP as a firm whose composition could change from time to time rather
                    than directly with LCP, RY and ML in their personal capacities, though we also
                    acknowledge that this view has been arrived at with some
                difficulty.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     
          <em>First</em>, it is a
                    trite rule of construction that contracts are to be construed <em>contra proferentum</em> if an ambiguity arises. RY and ML are
                    entitled to have any inherent ambiguities in the language employed by Orix
                    resolved in their favour. <em>Second</em>, the description
                    of the lessee in the Original Agreement is to be contrasted with a letter dated
                    16 July 2004, where Orix originally informed Canon of its intention to
                    enter into a lease transaction concerning the Canon copiers, in which the name
                    of the intended lessee was clearly spelt out as “<font style="text-transform: uppercase;">Chor Pee &amp; Partners</font>”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_17" id="Ftn_17_1"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a></span>. <em>Third</em>, and perhaps most significantly, it is not the
                    ordinary practice in Singapore for all the names of the partners in a firm to be
                    spelt out in a contractual agreement. Usually, a reference to the firm name
                    alone is the method of describing the group of persons associated together in
                    business who have entered into the contract. Pertinently, even Orix’s
                    assistant general manager, Goh Hock Leong, acknowledged that it would be quite
                    remarkable for a larger law firm, with say 50 partners, to laboriously list out
                    the names of all its partners whenever it enters into contractual
                        arrangements<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_18" id="Ftn_18_1"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a></span>. Instead, in practice, the
                    managing partner would usually alone sign an agreement on behalf of the
                    partnership. To ensure that the contract binds the firm (and all the partners),
                    the counterparty would require sight of a copy of the partnership agreement to
                    ensure that the managing partner has the requisite authority. In the Newcourt
                    Agreement, for example, no mention of the names of the supposed partners of CPP
                    was made. CPP alone was cited as the lessee. This oddity in the Original
                    Agreement warrants inquiry into why the names of the partners needed to be spelt
                    out if it were CPP as a firm that Orix intended to bind to the lease. Orix, we
                    note, had never required LCP to produce a partnership agreement. Apparently,
                    there was none but Orix did not then know this. We pause to note, had Orix taken
                    this usual commonsense precaution, the extent of LCP’s actual authority to
                    bind his colleagues (or the lack of thereof) would have been readily apparent.
                    Perhaps, to Orix, the benefit of an arrangement of contracting with each of the
                    named individuals would have been the certainty of knowing which parties it had
                    remedies against in the event of default. This reading is arguably buttressed by
                    the fact that in the credit proposal mentioned above at <a href="#p1_9">[9]</a>, under the heading of “Personal Guarantee”,
                    the names of the three individuals were inserted. However, we accept that it
                    could also be said, with some force, that it was Orix’s intention from the
                    outset to hold all three individuals liable. But how was this communicated to
                    CPP and the three individuals concerned? There is a troubling sparseness of
                    written communications on this.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     Lastly, it also bears highlighting that even
                    though the names of all three individuals were listed as lessees, RY was not
                    asked to sign the Original Agreement. Could this apparent
                    “oversight” be understood in the light of the disquieting results
                    revealed to Orix (just prior to the entering into of the Original Agreement) by
                    the Enhanced Individual Searches (“EIS”) run on QuestNet (an
                    information portal giving access to company and individual records and reports
                    from multiple public sources) on the three individuals? The EIS showed that RY
                    had not only recent bankruptcy proceedings initiated against her for the sum of
                    $14,742.79 (albeit those were withdrawn at the time of the checks) but was then
                    still facing earlier court proceedings for: (a) claims relating to personal
                    overdrafts and credit facilities for the sum of $8,993.54; and (b) a motor
                    insurance claim of $3,514.10. We note that Orix has not given any satisfactory
                    response why it did not insist on RY’s signature despite naming her as a
                    lessee.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     Nevertheless, notwithstanding the difficulties
                    mentioned and given the reasons above, the Original Agreement was likely to have
                    been entered with CPP as a firm and would certainly bind LCP and ML (who were
                    both signatories to the Original Agreement) though its reach <em>apropos</em> RY appears to us more ambiguous as she was named as a
                    signatory but never signed it. However, we need not definitively resolve this
                    problematic issue as the Original Agreement is no longer of any legal relevance.
                    As mentioned earlier, Orix terminated this and substituted it with the August
                    Agreement which is the contract it now relies on in these proceedings (see
                        <a href="#p1_18">[18]</a> above). Turning then to the August
                    Agreement, there is no evidence that ML and RY were aware of the termination of
                    the Original Agreement, let alone the entry into of the August Agreement. In
                    particular, the Judge made no ruling on whether Orix’s letters of demand
                    and the agreement to reinstate were received by all three parties and not just
                    LCP. It was for Orix to prove this. In the absence of their assent, in our view,
                    the August Agreement entered into with CPP by LCP could not bind ML and RY (see
                    also <a href="#p1_56">[56]</a>–<a href="#p1_57">[57]</a>, <a href="#p1_59">[59]</a>–<a href="#p1_61">[61]</a> and <a href="#p1_62">[62]</a>–<a href="#p1_64">[64]</a>

<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Issue 2: Whether the Original Agreement and the August Agreement were
                transactions entered into in the usual course of business</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     We are also of the view that it could be of no
                    real consequence that the intended lessee all along was CPP and not some
                    combination of the three individuals directly because: (a) the Original
                    Agreement and the August Agreement were not transactions made with actual
                    authority; and (b) further, they could not bind RY if they were not
                    transactions entered into in the usual course of business. This reasoning
                    applies with the same force to ML as regards the August Agreement.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The applicable law</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(1)   Section 5 of the PA</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     A partner, acting with authority in the same
                    manner as an authorised agent, can bind the firm comprising of all the partners
                    (see generally Yeo Hwee Ying, <em>Partnership Law in
                        Singapore</em> (Butterworths Asia, 2000) (“<em>Yeo</em>”) at p 102). This position is encapsulated by
                    s 5 of the PA, which provides:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Every partner is an agent of the firm and his other partners for the
                        purpose of the business of the partnership; and the acts of every partner
                        who does any act for <em>carrying on in the usual way
                            business of the kind carried on by the firm</em> of which he is a
                        member bind the firm and his partners, unless the partner so acting has in
                        fact no authority to act for the firm in the particular matter, and the
                        person with whom he is dealing either knows that he has no authority, or
                        does not know or believe him to be a partner. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The PA is actually the Partnership Act 1890 (c 39) (UK) that has
                    been incorporated into Singapore by virtue of the Application of English Law Act
                    (Cap 7A, 1994 Rev Ed). The English legislation is essentially a
                    codification of existing common law at the date of enactment. We note that
                    several common law jurisdictions such as Australia, New York and Hong Kong have
                    statutes that are in <em>pari materia</em> to the PA as
                    their provisions have also been adopted from the same landmark English
                    legislation.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     Essentially, s 5 comprises two distinct
                    limbs. As observed by the Australian High Court in <em>Construction Engineering (Aust) Proprietary Limited v Hexyl Proprietary
                        Limited and Others</em> [1984–1985] 155 CLR 541 at
                    547:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The first deals with actual authority. It provides not that every partner
                        is <em>deemed to be</em> an agent of the firm and his
                        other partners for the purposes of the partnership business but that every
                        partner <em>is</em> an agent of the firm and his other
                        partners for that purpose. The actual authority to which it refers is,
                        however, but prima facie in that it may be negated or qualified by contrary
                        agreement of the partners ...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The second limb of s. 5 deals with ostensible authority. Even though
                        actual authority be lacking, the act of every partner who does any act for
                        carrying on in the usual way business of the kind carried on by the firm of
                        which he is a member binds the firm and his partners unless the other party
                        “either knows that he has no authority, or does not know or believe
                        him to be a partner”.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis in original]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The first limb applies as between actual partners with actual
                    authority to act such that the partner is the agent of the firm and his other
                    partners for the purpose of the business of the partnership. An act done by a
                    partner on behalf of the firm and within the scope of his <em>actual</em> authority will bind the firm, whether or not the act was
                    done in carrying on the partnership business in the usual way (see
                    R C I’Anson Banks, <em>Lindley &amp; Banks on
                        Partnership</em> (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 18th Ed, 2002)
                        (“<em>Lindley</em>”) at para 12-10).
                    The second limb applies to situations of <em>ostensible</em> (also known as <em>apparent</em>) authority where persons are in partnership but have acted
                    beyond the actual authority that has been conferred on them for the purpose of
                    the business of the partnership. The classic articulation of ostensible or
                    apparent authority is found in the judgment of Diplock J in <em>Freeman &amp; Lockyer (A Firm) v Buckhurst Park Properties (Mangal)
                        Ltd and Another</em> [1964] 2 WLR 618 at 636:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">An “apparent” or “ostensible” authority
                        … is a legal relationship between the principal and the contractor
                        created by a representation, made by the principal to the contractor,
                        intended to be and in fact acted upon by the contractor, that the agent has
                        authority to enter on behalf of the principal into a contract of a kind
                        within the scope of the “apparent” authority, so as to render
                        the principal liable to perform any obligations imposed upon him by such
                        contract. To the relationship so created the agent is a stranger. He need
                        not be (although he generally is) aware of the existence of the
                        representation but he must not purport to make the agreement as principal
                        himself. The representation, when acted upon by the contractor by entering
                        into a contract with the agent, operates as an estoppel, preventing the
                        principal from asserting that he is not bound by the contract. It is
                        irrelevant whether the agent had actual authority to enter into the
                        contract.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">In other words, the second limb embraces situations where the members
                    of a firm have conducted themselves in a way that leads a third party to believe
                    that a partner has the authority to act on their behalf, even though the partner
                    has in reality exceeded the actual authority conferred upon him by the
                    partnership. An act done by a partner on behalf of the firm in the course of
                    carrying on the partnership business in the usual way will <em>prima facie</em> bind the firm, even if the partner acted without
                    actual authority, unless the third party with whom he dealt knew of that lack of
                    authority or did not know or believe him to be a partner (see <em>Lindley</em> at para 12-10). <em>However, if the
                        act is not done in the usual way, and the partner had no actual authority,
                        the other partners of the firm will not be bound if they do not subsequently
                        ratify that act</em> (see also <em>Lindley</em>
                    at para 12-10)<em>. In such a matter, the partner who
                        carried out the transaction will alone be personally liable to the third
                        party</em>.</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     In <em>Bank of Scotland v Henry
                        Butcher &amp; Co and others</em> [2003] 1 BCLC 575 at [89],
                    Chadwick LJ opined:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The inquiry under the second limb — in a case where it is necessary
                        to invoke that limb — is whether A's act is an ‘act for carrying
                        on in the usual way business of the kind carried on by the firm’. That
                        requires consideration of two elements: (i) what business is ‘business
                        of the kind carried on by the firm’; and (ii) is A's act ‘an act
                        for carrying on in the usual way’ that business. Where those two
                        elements are present, the person with whom A is dealing is entitled to treat
                        the act as done for the purpose of the business of the partnership unless he
                        knows that A has in fact no authority, or does not know or believe A to be a
                        partner.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">However, whether a transaction is “an act for carrying on in
                    the usual way” requires not just consideration of the <em>nature</em> of the business of the firm, but also the <em>manner</em> in which the act is carried out. In other words,
                    showing that a partner’s act is in the “usual way” of
                    “business of the kind carried on by the firm” such that the other
                    partners of the firm are <em>prima facie</em> liable under
                    the second limb of s 5 of the PA requires inquiry into:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_34-p2_a"></a>(a)     what business is “business of
                        the kind carried on by the firm”;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_34-p2_b"></a>(b)     whether the act of the partner falls within the
                        usual <em>nature</em> of the business of the firm;
                        and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_34-p2_c"></a>(c)     even if the
                        act falls within the usual nature of the business of the firm, whether the
                            <em>manner</em> in which the act is carried out is
                        usual of the kind of business carried on by the firm.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The
                    second and third inquiries are but constituent parts of the second element
                    referred to by Chadwick LJ.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     The inquiries above are clearly questions of
                    fact and law. In <em>Lim Kok Koon v Tan Cheng Yew and
                        another</em> [2004] 3 SLR(R) 111 at [34], it was correctly
                    observed:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[W]hether a particular act is done “in the ordinary course of
                        business” of the partnership, is a question of law. If the act is
                        legally capable of being performed within the ordinary course of the
                        partnership business, the next question of whether the act was so performed
                        was a question of fact.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">This applies equally to the question of whether an act is in the
                    “usual way” of “business of the kind carried out by the
                    firm”. In determining whether an act is in the “usual way”
                    of “business of the kind carried out by the firm”, it must be
                    considered whether on the facts represented, a reasonably careful and competent
                    person of the same kind as the third party would have concluded that the act
                    appeared usual (<em>United Bank of Kuwait Ltd v Hammoud and
                        Others</em> [1988] 1 WLR 1051 (“<em>United Bank of Kuwait</em>”) at 1059 and <em>JJ Coughlan Ltd v Ruparelia</em> [2004] PNLR 4
                        (“<em>Coughlan</em>”) at
                [22]).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-6" style="font-variant: small-caps;">(A)   The nature of the kind of business carried on by the firm
                and acts falling within the usual <span class="ToggleRoman" style="font-style:normal">nature</span> of the
                business of the firm</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     While there are no hard and fast rules, it
                    must be borne in mind that the nature of businesses may evolve over time and old
                    decisions in this regard must be read cautiously in the light of modern
                    developments (see <em>Shannon and Others v Whiting and
                        Another</em> (1901) 7 ALR 49 at 57 and <em>United Bank of Kuwait</em> at 1063). Nevertheless, some typical
                    transactions are, as a matter of law, generally regarded as capable of and
                    commonly falling within the “usual” nature of the business of most
                    if not all partnerships. For example, it is generally not unusual for a partner
                    to render an account in respect of a partnership transaction that will bind the
                    firm (see <em>John Hutchinson Fergusson v David Fyffe and
                        Another</em> (1840–41) 8 Cl &amp; F 121). Partners also
                    have authority to purchase goods reasonably incidental to the business (see
                        <em>Bond v Gibson and Jephson</em> (1808) 1 Camp
                    185), although as <em>Lindley</em> incisively points out
                    with its accustomed clarity, the mere fact that a partner has authority to
                    obtain goods or services on credit does not, of itself, authorise him to borrow
                    money, since the two acts are quite different. Lord Lindley himself had
                    long ago emphasised (see <em>Lindley</em> at
                    para 12-55):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The difference consists in this, that he who possesses power to borrow on
                        the credit of another, has a much more extensive, and therefore more easily
                        abused, trust reposed in him that one who is empowered only to pledge the
                        credit of another for value received, when the pledge is given. <em>A power, therefore, to incur debt, which is necessarily
                            incidental to almost every partnership, by no means involves a power to
                            borrow money</em>. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">In addition to the above, it is generally not unusual for partners to
                    receive performance of obligations due to the partnership such as the payment of
                    a partnership debt (see <em>Jacaud v French</em> (1810)
                    12 East 198, but the rule does not apply if the debt was owed not to the
                    firm but to one of the partners unless the firm has been authorised by the
                    partner to receive the money (see <em>Powell v
                        Brodhurst</em> [1901] 2 Ch 160)) and to open a bank account
                    in the firm’s name (see <em>The Alliance Bank, Limited v
                        Kearsley</em> (1871) LR 6 CP 433). The commonality
                    between these acts is that they are generally necessary, and not just
                    convenient, for the smooth running of a partnership of any nature.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     Conversely, it is not usual for a partner to
                    bind the firm by deed (see <em>Harrison v Jackson, Sykes and
                        Rushforth</em> (1797) 7 TR 207, 101 ER 935) though
                    it might be said given the less venerated view of deeds prevailing today, this
                    line of cases may merit reconsideration. Neither is it usual for partners
                    generally to give a guarantee in the firm’s name in the absence of a trade
                    custom (see <em>Hirst v Etherington and Anor</em>
                    [1999] Lloyd’s Rep PN 938 (“<em>Hirst</em>”)), accept shares in lieu of money as satisfaction
                    of a debt due to the firm (see <em>Niemann v Niemann</em>
                    (1889) LR 43 Ch D 198) or unilaterally submit a dispute
                    to arbitration (see <em>Bannatyne v D &amp; C MacIver</em>
                    [1906] 1 KB 103), although, in the context of the last case, it has
                    been suggested in <em>Lindley</em> at para 12-44 that
                    a distinction should now be drawn between contractual and <em>ad
                        hoc</em> references (the former would refer to a situation where a
                    partner properly enters into a contract in the usual way of business, under
                    which it is provided that all disputes arising from the contract are to be
                    resolved by arbitration) and that, in the former case, the firm would be
                    bound.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     Additionally, in relation to the acts of a
                    partner that are in the usual nature of business of the firm, a traditional
                    bright line has been drawn between what is typical to the nature of trading
                    partnerships and what is typical to non-trading partnerships. Partners in
                    trading partnerships have a much wider ostensible authority than partners in
                    non-trading partnerships.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     While, there is no exhaustive definition of a
                    trading firm, in <em>Wheatley v Smithers</em> [1906]
                    2 KB 321 at 322, Ridley J suggested that trading necessarily
                    implies a buying or selling (although Ridley J’s decision was
                    reversed on appeal, this definition was not disapproved of by the Court of
                    Appeal (see <em>Wheatley v Smithers</em> [1907]
                    2 KB 684)). Similarly, in <em>Higgins v
                        Beauchamp</em> [1914] 3 KB 1192, Lush J held that a
                    trading business was one which depended on the buying and selling of goods and
                    concluded that a firm carrying on the business of cinematographic theatre was
                    not a trading firm. The ambit of the term “trading firm”, however,
                    appears to have been given a more generous interpretation locally, so as to
                    include businesses giving credit and not just those that buy and sell. In
                        <em>Chettinad Bank Limited v Chop Haw Lee and Chop Lee
                        Chan</em> (1931) 7 FMSLR 31, the meaning of a trading firm was
                    also interpreted to include businesses such as banking, money-lending and
                    pawnbroking – all of which involve the extension of credit.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     In addition to the transactions above at
                        <a href="#p1_36">[36]</a>, a partner in a trading
                    partnership, unlike one in a non-trading firm, may generally pledge or sell the
                    partnership property, buy goods on account of the partnership, borrow money,
                    contract debts and pay debts on account of the partnership. He may also draw,
                    make, sign, indorse, accept, transfer, negotiate and procure to be discounted
                    promissory notes, bills of exchange, checks and other negotiable paper, in the
                    name of and on account of the partnership (see <em>The Bank of
                        Australasia v Thomas Chaplin Breillat, Chairman of the Bank of
                        Australia</em> (1847) 6 Moo PC 152 at 193–199, 13 ER
                    642 at 658–659 and <em>Chop Cheong Tuck v Chop Tack Loong
                        and others</em> [1934] MLJ 176). The rationale behind this
                    distinction is that the sudden exigencies of a trading firm involved in the
                    buying and selling of goods require constant inventory purchases, which have to
                    be funded by credit facilities. Hence, it would be the life blood of the trading
                    firm’s usual business to borrow money and create debts. For non-trading
                    firms, however, borrowing money and giving negotiable papers are not considered
                    necessary or ordinary incidents of the business (<em>Yeo</em> at p 116). It must be said though, that some of the
                    older cases dealing with this issue merit critical reconsideration, as it is not
                    uncommon these days for non-trading firms to borrow for business reasons. This,
                    however, if the amount is substantial, will ordinarily be a partnership decision
                    rather than that of a single or minority group of partners.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     One classic form of a non-trading partnership
                    is the law firm. A law firm’s business is to provide legal services. It
                    does not buy, sell or trade in goods; neither does it engage in the business of
                    extending credit. Although like other partnership businesses in general, it is
                    usual for a partner to buy goods reasonably incidental to the law firm’s
                    business, <em>the individual partners of a law firm (or even the
                        managing partner) generally have no ostensible authority to, inter alia,
                        borrow money, enter into financial commitments or give
                    guarantees</em>. Such a power must be expressly conferred by the
                    partnership articles to bind the firm and its partners or impliedly given by
                    clear and incontrovertible conduct. The borrowing of money by a partner in a
                    non-trading firm is not usual conduct unless the firm’s business is of
                    such a kind that it cannot be carried on in the usual way without such a power
                    (see <em>Lindley</em> at para 12-52). Plainly, a law
                    firm does not satisfy this criterion.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     In relation to the services provided by a law
                    firm, it is generally unusual for a partner to accept an appointment as a
                    trustee (or act as to make himself a constructive trustee) (see <em>Re Bell’s Indenture</em> [1980] 3 All ER 425 at
                    437). It is also unusual for him to give guarantees, even though the giving of
                    investment advice may in special circumstances be part of the firm’s
                    business (see <em>Polkinghorne v Holland and Another</em>
                    (1934) 51 CLR 143). <em>Neither is it generally usual
                        for a partner to compromise a debt owing to the firm without receiving
                        payment (see</em> Lindley <em>at para 12-62). As a
                        corollary, it must follow that it is not usual for a partner to settle or
                        compromise a claim that may prejudice his other partners</em>.
                    Furthermore, while undertakings can also fall within the ambit of a law
                    firm’s business (see <em>United Bank of Kuwait</em>
                    at 1059 and 1063–1064), a mere assurance by a solicitor that his
                    undertaking is given in the usual course of business is not sufficient to bind
                    his partners where, on an objective view, the undertaking had not been given in
                    relation to an underlying transaction of a kind which was part of the usual
                    business of a solicitor (see <em>Hirst</em> at
                945).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     The party seeking to make the partners of the
                    firm liable under the second limb of s 5 of the PA bears the onus of
                    showing, as a matter of fact, that the act is usual in relation to the kind of
                    business carried on by the firm. However, once a certain act is established as a
                    typical activity of the kind of business carried on by the partnership (such as
                    by reference to the categories above), the burden will then fall on the party
                    asserting otherwise to show that the act is unusual in nature (see <em>Yeo</em> at pp 110–111). Thus, in <em>Lek Peng Lung v Lee Investments (Pte) Ltd and others</em>
                    [1991] 2 SLR(R) 635 at [30]–[31], Warren
                    L H Khoo J took cognisance of the fact that the loan business was
                    a common activity of pawnbrokers before 1989 and the defendants were not able to
                    escape liability by a bare allegation that the particular partner had not been
                    given the authority to undertake that activity.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-6" style="font-variant: small-caps;">(B)   The manner of the act carried out by the partner</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     It must be stressed, however, that even if a
                    partner’s actions are <em>ex facie</em> within the
                    scope of the usual nature of the business of the firm, the transaction will not
                    bind the partnership unless the <em>manner</em> in which it
                    is carried out would also appear to a reasonably careful and competent person of
                    the same kind as the third party to be in the “usual way” (see
                        <a href="#p1_34">[34]</a>–<a href="#p1_35">[35]</a> above). An extreme example of when the manner in which a
                    transaction is carried out would not appear to be usual is the case of <em>Coughlan</em>. There, the proposed transaction was that in
                    return for the transfer of $500,000 and without risk to that sum, the claimants
                    would within one month receive $2,500,000. The conditions of the transaction,
                    which were described by a judge as “preposterous” (<em>Coughlan</em> at 67 and 68), took the partner’s actions
                    out of the ambit of the usual manner in which the business of the partnership
                    firm was carried out such that the court did not even go on to consider whether
                    the partner’s actions could fall within the nature of the firm’s
                    business.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     In addition to the above, <em>for the manner of an act to be usual in a particular kind of business, it
                        must be reasonably necessary and not just convenient for the carrying on of
                        that type of business</em>. Thus, in <em>The Union Bank
                        of Australia v Fisher and Others</em> (1893) 14 LR (NSW) Eq
                    241, the contention that it was in the usual course of a solicitor’s
                    business in acting for a vendor in the sale of a property for a member of a firm
                    to borrow the original documents of title to land from the mortgagee’s
                    solicitor so as to prepare an abstract of title was rejected on the ground that
                    although solicitors might find such a practice convenient, the usual <em>method</em> of effecting such a transaction was for the
                    vendor’s solicitor to obtain copies or extracts taken from the original
                    deeds from the mortgagee’s solicitor without disturbing the
                    mortgagee’s possession of the original deeds (at 248).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     As with showing that the act is usual in
                    nature (see <a href="#p1_43">[43]</a> above), the party invoking
                    the second limb of s 5 bears the burden of proof to show that an act was
                    carried out in a usual manner. In order to discharge the burden of proof, expert
                    evidence on what is usual in a particular business is ordinarily adduced. The
                    party seeking to uphold the transaction can also show that it made the
                    appropriate enquires to reasonably assure itself that the manner of the
                    transaction was in the “usual way” although, as Pill LJ
                    rightly observed in <em>Hirst</em> at 945, what enquiry is
                    appropriate depends on all the circumstances. If the partner is not forthcoming
                    with information that the third party is entitled to, the third party has to
                    draw his own conclusion and either not proceed or take a risk with the
                    transaction. The third party is not always entitled to rely on the
                    unsubstantiated assertions of the partner (see <em>United Bank of
                        Kuwait</em> at 1065–1066). Therefore in <em>Hirst</em> (at 945), the “contracting” party was held
                    not to be entitled to rely on the bare assertion of a partner of a law firm that
                    the undertaking given was in the normal course of the firm’s business. It
                    was held that features of the transaction, including the high rate of interest
                    on the loan, ought to have given cause for concern, and this would have
                    warranted the making of further enquiries (see <em>Hirst</em> at 945).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-6" style="font-variant: small-caps;">(C)   The relevance of benefit to the firm to liability under the
                second limb of s 5 of the PA</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     For the avoidance of doubt, we would add, at
                    this juncture, that for the purposes of establishing whether or not the act of a
                    partner was in the “usual way” of “business of the kind
                    carried on by the firm”, it is immaterial that the firm may have received
                    either a direct or indirect benefit from a contract that is outside the scope of
                    the actual or ostensible authority of the partner entering into it. The typical
                    cases where this is an issue are the borrowing of money or the procurement of
                    the supply of goods or services. <em>Lindley</em> at
                    paras 12-201–12-202 notes:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">When considering liability in respect of a contract entered into by a
                        partner <em>otherwise</em> than on behalf of the firm,
                        it is wholly irrelevant that the firm may have received some direct or
                        indirect benefit under or by virtue of the contract …</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">If a partner borrows money without the actual or implied authority of his
                        co-partners, he and not the firm will enter into the contract of loan and
                        the nature of that contract will not be altered or affected by the manner in
                        which he chooses to apply the money borrowed. Accordingly, the lender cannot
                        seek repayment from the firm merely because the money has been applied for
                        its benefit; however, he may enjoy an equivalent right by way of an
                        equitable form of subrogation.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis in original]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Any rights of the lender arising from subrogation are entirely
                    distinct from the issue of the partnership’s liability pursuant to
                    s 5 of the PA.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-6" style="font-variant: small-caps;">(D)   The knowledge and belief of the party dealing with the
                partner </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     As mentioned at <a href="#p1_33">[33]</a>, even if the partner’s act was “usual”
                    to the kind of business carried on by the firm, the other partners of the firm
                    will not be bound if:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_48-p2_a"></a>(a)     the third party the partner dealt
                        with knew that the partner had no authority to act;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_48-p2_b"></a>(b)     the third party the partner dealt with
                        did not know that the partner was a partner; or</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_48-p2_c"></a>(c)     the third party the partner dealt with did not
                        believe that the partner was a partner.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     As the above were not points of particular
                    controversy in these proceedings, it will suffice to say that the exceptions can
                    be explained by the reasoning that in these situations, the third party did not
                    place any reliance on the partner’s position in the firm and thus cannot
                    look to the other partners of the firm to remedy the actions of the partner that
                    he dealt with. These exceptions do not apply to LCP in relation to CPP. The sole
                    question here is whether his dealings with Orix bound ML and RY.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(2)   The nexus between ss 5 and 14 of the PA</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     In addition to s 5, s 14 of the PA
                    also provides that persons who hold themselves out or who allow themselves to be
                    held out as partners can be held liable as if they were in truth partners of the
                    firm. Section 14 of the PA reads as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-Heading1">
<b>Persons liable by
                            “holding out”</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>14</b>.    Every one who by
                            words spoken or written or by conduct represents himself, or who
                            knowingly suffers himself to be represented, as a partner in a
                            particular firm, is liable as a partner to any one who has on the faith
                            of any such representation given credit to the firm, whether the
                            representation has or has not been made or communicated to the person so
                            giving credit by or with the knowledge of the apparent partner making
                            the representation or suffering it to be made:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Provided that where after a partner’s death the partnership business
                        is continued in the old firm-name, the continued use of that name, or of the

                        executors or administrators, estate or effects liable for any partnership
                        debts contracted after his death.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">This provision is to be distinguished from the second limb of
                    s 5. Section 14 applies to circumstances where a person is not a
                    partner in truth but has held himself out or has allowed to be held out as a
                    partner. Like the second limb of s 5, it is premised on ostensible
                    authority. Thus, if a person has held himself out or allowed himself to be held
                    out as a member of the firm, he will be liable as a partner <em>vis-à-vis</em> third parties who have relied on such holding out even
                    though he is not a true partner. However, if, for example, a legal associate has
                    been held out as a partner of the firm (without his consent), he cannot be held
                    liable as a member of the firm under s 14 of the PA. If it is established
                    pursuant to s 14 of the PA that a person has held himself out or allowed to
                    be held out as a partner of a firm, then he can be held liable for the acts of a
                    (true) partner of that firm if the act of the latter falls under one of the two
                    limbs of s 5 of the PA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     It ought to be explained at this juncture that
                    while a person does not automatically become liable under s 14 of the PA
                    just by virtue of being a “salaried partner”, those who style
                    themselves “salaried partners” would do well to bear in mind the
                    risk that they may be exposing themselves to liability as if they were true
                    partners of the firm. As was correctly pointed out in <em>Stekel
                        v Ellice</em> [1973] 1 WLR 191 (“<em>Stekel</em>”), a “salaried partner” cannot, as a
                    matter of law, be said necessarily to be, or not to be, a partner in the true
                    sense, for the term is not a term of art and the question depends on what was
                    the substance of the relationship on the facts of each particular case.
                    Megarry J opined at 199–200:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">If, then, there is a plain contract of master and servant, and the only
                        qualification of that relationship is that the servant is being held out as
                        being a partner, the name “salaried partner” seems perfectly
                        apt for him; and yet he will be no partner in relation to the members of the
                        firm. At the other extreme, there may be a full partnership deed under which
                        all the partners save one take a share of the profits, with that one being
                        paid a fixed salary not dependent on profits. Again, “salaried
                        partner” seems to me an apt description of that one: yet I do not see
                        why he should not be a true partner, at all events if he is entitled to
                        share in the profits on a winding up … there could well be cases in
                        which a salaried partner will be a true partner … . <em>It may be that most salaried partners are persons whose only
                            title to partnership is that they are held out as being partners; but
                            even if “salaried partners” who are true partners, though
                            at a salary, are in a minority, that does not mean that they are
                            non-existent</em>. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">A person, liable under s 14 is jointly liable with the actual
                    partners of the firm on the implied promise of personal liability as a partner.
                    Therefore if it is established that a person is a “salaried
                    partner” who has held himself out or allowed himself to be held out
                    within the meaning of s 14 of the PA, he will be liable for the acts of the
                    other members of the firm under s 5 of the PA but only in an identical
                    manner that a true partner of the firm would be. The provision has the effect of
                    attaching but not enhancing liability as a
                “partner”.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Application of the law to the facts</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     Would and could a reasonable entity in the
                    same business as Orix (<em>ie</em>, a leasing company),
                    have come to the conclusion that LCP’s and ML’s actions <em>vis-à-vis</em> the Original Agreement (as mentioned, both LCP
                    and ML were signatories to this agreement (see <a href="#p1_13">[13]</a> above)) and LCP’s actions <em>vis-à-vis</em> the August Agreement were “usual” to the
                    type of business carried on by CPP (<em>ie</em>, a law
                    firm)? The issue here is not one of merely giving a label to the transaction but
                    rather of examining the substance of it and assessing whether it can be fairly
                    said to be the type of transaction that a law firm would usually enter into.
                    Even if we assume that ML and RY had held themselves out as ostensible partners
                    of CPP pursuant to s 14 of the PA (see <a href="#p1_50">[50]</a> above), we are not persuaded that the Original Agreement
                    and, subsequently, the August Agreement with Orix could be construed as being
                    simply an ordinary lease transaction entered into as part of the usual business
                    of a law firm.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(1)   Whether the Original Agreement was “usual” in
                nature</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     In our view the Original Agreement was in
                    substance a <em>composite</em> arrangement that encompassed
                    both substantial borrowings creating a very significant financial liability for
                    CPP as well as a lease transaction for the use of the Canon copiers. Orix would
                    certainly have been aware that it was not an ordinary lease of equipment. In
                    coming to the conclusion that the Original Agreement effectively included an
                    arrangement for significant borrowings, we took into account a number of facts.
                        <em>First</em>, and foremost, we consider the
                    difference between the real value of the Canon copiers and the total amount
                    payable under the Original Agreement to be crucial (see <a href="#p1_9">[9]</a> above). <em>Second</em>, Orix was well
                    aware that a large part of the borrowings (at least between
                    $110,000–$120,000) was going towards the repayment of amounts due to
                    Newcourt rather than towards the purchase price of the Canon copiers, even
                    assuming <em>arguendo</em> it did not have detailed
                    knowledge of the precise nature of the cash flow problems CPP was facing at the
                    material time. <em>Third</em>, we note as pointed out
                    earlier (see <a href="#p1_13">[13]</a> above), under the Original
                    Agreement the rent payable would substantially increase even as the Canon
                    copiers significantly depreciated in value. A final payment of $47,400 was
                    scheduled for September 2010 when the Canon copiers would be practically
                    worthless, assuming that they were still usable. It must have been readily
                    apparent to Orix that CPP already had prior problems servicing the outstandings
                    to Newcourt as despite the fact that the Newcourt copiers had already reached
                    the end of their working life, a large amount remained due. The even larger
                    facility extended by Orix could only increase the overall financial burden of
                    (what would have been obvious to any objective lender) a firm with apparent cash
                    flow problems. <em>Fourth</em>, we note that that was a
                    very different arrangement from the leasing arrangements some equipment
                    manufacturers/distributors directly enter into with end users incorporating as
                    part of the lease, upgrades and repairs. We note that the Judge had held that
                    Orix did not have “knowledge” of CPP’s cash flow problems
                    (the HC Judgment at <a href="#p1_69">[69]</a>). With
                    respect, we have to disagree. First, we are of the view that Orix which is in
                    the business of leasing, <em>inter alia</em>, equipment,
                    must have known the real cost of the Canon copiers, and even if it did not, it
                    would have been prudent of Orix to have checked. Second, it would have been
                    aware that the lion’s share of the base sum of $231,500 less the real cost
                    of the Canon copiers was going towards satisfying CPP’s obligations to
                    Newcourt upon terminating the Amended Newcourt Agreement with the remainder
                    going towards Canon as profit. It seems to us rather obvious that the fact that
                    CPP was seeking even more advantageous cash flow arrangements (even at the cost
                    of incurring rather substantial outstandings due to Newcourt) would have both
                    loudly and clearly signalled to any objective lender that CPP was suffering from
                    financial distress.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     Having determined that the Original Agreement
                    was a composite agreement of a loan arrangement of substantial borrowings and a
                    lease transaction, the question remains as to whether such an arrangement was
                    “usual” in nature for a law firm.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     The transactions “usual” to the
                    business of a law firm are naturally not confined to the provision of legal
                    services. Law firms necessarily have to enter into other routine transactions to
                    create the proper infrastructure to support the provision of legal services.
                    Such transactions are incidental to its main business of providing legal
                    services. Thus, the purchase of office equipment necessary for its operational
                    needs would be usual to the business of a law firm. By extension, we are also
                    prepared to accept that the typical straightforward leasing of office equipment
                    necessary for the proper administration of a law firm is also likely to be
                    assessed as usual to a law firm’s business.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     Having considered the above, however, the
                    question here is not whether a direct lease transaction is usual to a law firm
                    but whether a composite loan-cum-lease is “usual”. Whether a usual
                    transaction has been modified to such an extent as to make it unusual is always
                    a question of fact. <em>At the risk of stating the obvious, when
                        specially customised rather than standard arrangements are entered into, it
                        is likely that the transaction will not be considered as part and parcel of
                        the “usual” business of a partnership</em>. In such a
                    case, the onus is on the party asserting “usualness” to establish
                    the prevalence of such transactions (see <a href="#p1_43">[43]</a> above). In our view, Orix has not discharged its burden of
                    proof of showing that the composite loan-cum-lease transaction in the present
                    instance is usual to the business of a law firm. It failed to adduce any
                    evidence that showed it is usual or commonplace for law firms to enter into such
                    kinds of transactions, <em>ie</em>, similar composite
                    loan-cum-lease transactions incorporating a very substantial loan facility, as
                    part of their usual business.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     
          <em>In our view, the
                        transaction in the present case could not be said to be usual for the simple
                        reason that it incorporated substantial borrowings that were effectively
                        several times the value of the equipment leased and this was known to
                        Orix</em>. As the Judge pertinently pointed out, the repayment
                    obligation under the transaction was “<em>disproportionate</em>” [emphasis added] to the value of the
                    Canon copiers (see the HC Judgment at [52]). It is trite that a partner in
                    a law firm has no ostensible authority to borrow money on behalf of the firm or
                    to impose through borrowings liability on it (see <a href="#p1_41">[41]</a>–<a href="#p1_42">[42]</a> above).
                    Here, ML and RY had never conferred on LCP authority to borrow money for CPP on
                    their behalf. The truth of the matter is that CPP was a sole proprietorship and
                    LCP was not obliged to consult the others. He did as he pleased when he pleased.
                    As LCP ran CPP in an opaque manner, it is no surprise that ML and RY were in the
                    dark in so far as CPP’s ongoing difficulties with Newcourt and Orix were
                    concerned.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a>58     In fairness to the Judge, we would point out
                    at this juncture that ML’s and RY’s submissions below appear to have
                    been incorrectly focused on the “<em>sham</em>” nature of the transaction rather than its <em>unusual</em> features <em>apropos</em>
                    s 5 of the PA. We note that the very stark difference between the value of
                    the Canon copiers in relation to the total amount of rental due under the
                    Original Agreement “<em>did concern</em>”
                    [emphasis added] the Judge (see the HC Judgment at [52]) but she was not
                    properly assisted in developing this line of enquiry. This explains why this
                    aspect of the transaction was not adequately considered by the Judge. As an
                    aside, we ought to mention that we also agree with the Judge that ML’s and
                    RY’s contentions that the Original Agreement and the August Agreement were
                    unenforceable for a variety of imaginative reasons ranging from
                    unconscionability to contravention of the Moneylenders Act (Cap 188,
                    1985 Rev Ed) were entirely misguided.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(2)   Whether the manner in which the Original Agreement was
                transacted was unusual</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a>59     Even if we were to hold that the Original
                    Agreement was just a plain vanilla lease transaction, we, nonetheless, think it
                    is doubtful that a reasonably careful and competent leasing company would have
                    reasonably concluded that the manner the transaction was entered into was in the
                    “usual way”. We doubt that the manner in which the Original
                    Agreement was transacted was reasonably necessary and not merely convenient for
                    the carrying out of CPP’s business as a law firm (see <a href="#p1_45">[45]</a> above). In ascertaining whether an action was
                    carried out in the “usual way” the court can look at the
                    particular business and at the actions of others in similar businesses (see
                        <em>Mercantile Credit Co Ltd v Garrod and Another</em>
                    [1962] 3 All ER 1103 at 1106). Even if the action by the partner is within
                    the scope of the business carried on by the firm, if it is carried on in an
                    unusual manner, the other partners may not be bound. Therefore, in <em>Goldberg v Jenkins &amp; Law</em> (1889) 15 VLR 36, the
                    actions of a partner who purported to borrow money for the firm at over 60%
                    interest when the comparable rates at the time were 6%–10% were considered
                    not to be in the usual way of business.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a>60     Besides the disparity in the value of the
                    Canon copiers and the facility being extended (see <a href="#p1_57">[57]</a> above), there were several other peculiar features of the
                    Original Agreement that Orix was aware of that takes it outside the ambit of
                    s 5 of the PA. For instance, CPP did not procure any insurance to cover
                    risks of breakdown, quite certainly to save money, even though cl 11 of the
                    Original Agreement obliged the lessee to insure the Canon copiers<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_19" id="Ftn_19_1"><sup>[note: 19]</sup></a></span>.
                    Orix, for its part, did not enforce the requirement of insurance. Furthermore,
                    if even a default of a single instalment took place, the entire amount initially
                    scheduled to be paid over six years would be accelerated and become immediately
                    due. This could have resulted in the entire amount due under the Original
                    Agreement, <em>viz</em>, the sum of $305,400, being
                    immediately payable if there was a default on the very first instalment even
                    though the interest on the principal loaned had not been earned. This, in
                    particular, was a remarkable term even after taking into account the supposed
                    short-term advantages CPP would gain as pointed out in <a href="#p1_10">[10]</a> above. Orix is a well established entity in the business of
                    leasing. It has, nevertheless, not adduced any satisfactory evidence to
                    establish that that the structure of this transaction was usual for law firms
                    (or indeed other professional service firms) (see <a href="#p1_43">[43]</a> above). Further, it has not been explained why Orix did not
                    require CPP to produce its financial statements (see <a href="#p1_9">[9]</a> above) beyond the bare assertion that it did not feel the
                    need to as its previous experience with financing lawyers and professionals had
                    been good.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_20" id="Ftn_20_1"><sup>[note: 20]</sup></a></span> Had this
                    elementary (and obvious) precaution been taken, Orix quite certainly would not
                    be confronted with its present predicament. Apparently, Orix ultimately made its
                    decision to extend the facilities merely on the basis of the “profile and
                    long history of the firm”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_21" id="Ftn_21_1"><sup>[note: 21]</sup></a></span> that
                    CPP could service the loan (see <a href="#p1_9">[9]</a> above).
                    This was a far from convincing reason to make a substantial loan to a law firm
                    quite obviously facing cash flow problems.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a>61     In light of the above, even if RY had held
                    herself out as a partner for the purposes of s 14 of the PA, LCP and/or ML
                    could not have concluded the Original Agreement on behalf of RY without first
                    seeking her consent. They had no authority to do so (even under s 5 of the
                    PA) as it was not an arrangement that could be objectively said to be in the
                    usual course of a solicitor’s business. Only LCP and ML, who both signed
                    the Original Agreement, were bound by it.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(3)   Whether the August Agreement was “usual” to
                the business of a law firm such as CPP</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_62"></a>62     As a corollary, the August Agreement could
                    only bind LCP and not ML or RY as the latter two had not given actual consent to
                    the reinstatement of this unusual financing arrangement after Orix had
                    unilaterally terminated it. As we had pointed out earlier (see <a href="#p1_18">[18]</a> above), the parties have accepted that the
                    August Agreement was a new contract and that it is the only contract Orix now
                    seeks to enforce. In addition, we would state that as a matter of general
                    principle, once a substantial claim is made against a partnership, in the
                    absence of specific provisions in the partnership agreement, the express consent
                    of its partners would have to be sought to resolve the claim if this would
                    prejudice them in any way (see also <a href="#p1_42">[42]</a>
                    above). This is because once a claim is made against the firm the prior business
                    relationship with the claimant morphs from the ordinary into the extraordinary
                    –
                    <em>it becomes an adversarial one</em>. It is no longer
                    business as usual. On the contrary, the very fact that the business relationship
                    has soured and resulted in a claim with potentially adverse consequences to the
                    partners takes it outside the usual course of business. It surely cannot be
                    argued that the receipt of an adverse claim is in the usual course of a
                    responsible law firm’s business.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_63"></a>63     On the facts, it is clear that LCP had not
                    informed or involved ML and RY about Orix’s claim or the negotiations to
                    resolve it. The claim itself was a joint and several one for the sum of
                    $307,627.98 (the initial sum claimed was $306,632.59) (see <a href="#p1_15">[15]</a> above). Orix was dealing with the three
                    individuals and the firm on an entirely different footing once it terminated the
                    Original Agreement. Before entering into the August Agreement, it ought to have
                    ensured that all three persons had consented to the agreement if it wanted to
                    hold all of them jointly and severally responsible. The August Agreement had two
                    components. It was to settle the personal claims that Orix had made against the
                    three individuals as well as to resolve the status of the Canon copiers and
                    outstandings due under the Original Agreement. In short, it would be a stretch
                    to say that the entry of the August Agreement was business as
                usual.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_64"></a>64     We also note that even though the
                    reinstatement letter of 5 August 2005 was addressed to all three
                    individuals (see <a href="#p1_16">[16]</a> above), Orix did not
                    ensure it was delivered and brought to the attention of each of them. Orix has
                    now to accept the consequences of its rather cavalier approach in dealing only
                    with LCP despite its professed intention to bind ML and RY as well. <em>If Orix is to be believed, it buried its head in sand throughout
                        its dealings with CPP never once asking for the relevant financial
                        statements and partnership documents</em>. It did not even take the
                    elementary precaution of ensuring through direct enquiries who the actual
                    partners of CPP at the material points of time were. Was it concerned about
                    offending LCP by making direct enquiries? Why did it not know that CPP was a
                    sole proprietorship? Why did it not attempt to ascertain why such a large sum
                    was due to Newcourt? We do not know the answers to all these questions because
                    Orix has not made its position clear in the proceedings below. We can,
                    nevertheless, deduce that Orix took no obvious precautions or made any relevant
                    enquiries, beyond making some cursory credit searches (see <a href="#p1_75">[75]</a> below), before it entered into the new
                    contract, <em>viz</em>, the August Agreement. As mentioned
                    at <a href="#p1_46">[46]</a>, what enquiries are appropriate
                    depends in each case on all the circumstances. Here, Orix has not demonstrated
                    that it reasonably believed that this was the type of transaction a law firm
                    usually enters into (see <a href="#p1_43">[43]</a> and <a href="#p1_46">[46]</a> above). It has not adduced any evidence, let
                    alone expert evidence, to discharge its burden of proof. Neither has it shown
                    that it made reasonable enquiries. In <em>Hirst</em>, the
                    third party was not entitled to rely on the bare assertion of a partner of a law
                    firm that the undertaking given was in the normal (or usual) course of the
                    firm’s business (see <a href="#p1_46">[46]</a> above). In
                    our view, Orix has in presenting its case fallen well short of establishing that
                    it behaved reasonably in purporting to rely on LCP’s representations.
                    Pertinently, it also failed to adduce any objective or independent evidence of
                    industry practice to show that it had acted reasonably. It merely relied on the
                    bare assertions of its staff to feebly assert that such transactions were not
                    unusual. Orix cannot therefore now complain that ML and RY are not legally bound
                    by an unusual borrowing arrangement that LCP entered into without reference to
                    the other members of his firm, particularly when it had all along decided to
                    turn a blind eye to the actual goings-on in CPP.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Issue 3: Whether RY could be bound to the August Agreement under
                s 36 of the PA</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_65"></a>65     Having dealt with the above, we turn now to
                    Orix’s main argument in CA 127 against RY that as she had not given
                    notice of her retirement from CPP, it was entitled to treat her as still being a
                    member of the firm as at the time of the August Agreement pursuant to s 36
                    of the PA. For completeness, we would state that Orix could not have succeeded
                    on this ground as well.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The applicable law</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_66"></a>66     A partner is liable for the debts acquired by
                    the partnership during the period of his participation in the firm. He may even
                    be liable for debts incurred after he retires. The ambit of his liability in
                    this respect is encapsulated in s 36 of the PA, which provides:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>36</b>. —(1) Where a person deals
                        with a firm after a change in its constitution, he is entitled to treat all
                        apparent members of the old firm as still being members of the firm until he
                        has notice of the change.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(2)    An advertisement in the <em>Gazette</em> shall be notice as to persons who had no
                            dealings with the firm before the date of the dissolution or change so
                            advertised.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(3)    The estate of a partner who dies, or who becomes
                            bankrupt, or of a partner who, not having been known to the person
                            dealing with the firm to be a partner, retires from the firm, is not
                            liable for partnership debts contracted after the date of the death,
                            bankruptcy or retirement, respectively.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_67"></a>67     Sub-sections (1) and (2) of the provision
                    address the possible liability of persons who were partners at one time but who
                    have ceased to be partners at the time of the dealing upon which it is sought to
                    make them liable. Sub-section (3) provides some limits to that liability.
                    It provides that a partner has no liability for debts contracted after the event
                    of his death or bankruptcy, or after his retirement if he was unknown to the
                    creditor that is bringing a claim against the firm in respect of debts
                    contracted after he retired.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_68"></a>68     In order to establish the liability of a
                    retired partner under s 36(1) of the PA, it must first be shown that the
                    claimant had dealings with the firm prior to the change in its constitution.
                    Having crossed that threshold, the second requirement is that at the time of
                    those prior dealings, the partner must have been an apparent member of the firm.
                    In <em>Tower Cabinet Co Ld v Ingram</em> [1949]
                    2 KB 397 at 403, the term “apparent members” has been
                    explained as meaning:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">members who are apparently members to the person who is dealing with the
                        firm, and they may be apparent either by the fact that the customer has had
                        dealings with them before, or because of the use of their names on the
                        notepaper, or from some sign outside the door, or because the customer has
                        had some indirect information about them.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">It ought to be noted that dormant or silent partners would usually not
                    appear to third parties as apparent members of the firm (see also <a href="#p1_69">[69]</a> below). Third, it must be shown that the
                    partner gave no or insufficient notice of his withdrawal prior to the dealings
                    upon which it is sought to make him liable.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_69"></a>69     There is no general rule as to what
                    constitutes notice except as provided in sub-section (2). However, as
                    Prichard J, quoting from <em>Lindley on
                        Partnership</em> (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 9th Ed, 1924) at
                    pp 291–293, observed in <em>Re Siew Inn Steamship Co;
                        Ex Parte Ho Hong Bank, Ltd (In Voluntary Liquidation) In The Issue; Tan Boon
                        Cheo v Ho Hong Bank, Ltd</em> [1934] MLJ 180:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<em>When a dormant partner retires, he need give no notice
                            of his retirement in order to free himself from liability in respect of
                            acts done after his retirement. The reason is that, as he was never
                            known to be a partner, no one can have relied on his connection with the
                            firm, or truly allege that, when dealing with the firm, he continued to
                            rely on the fact that the dormant partner was still connected
                            therewith</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<em>But when an apparent partner retires, or when a
                            partnership between several known partners is dissolved, the case is
                            very different; for then those who dealt with the firm before a change
                            took place are entitled to assume that no change has occurred until they
                            have notice to the contrary. And even those who never had dealings with
                            the firm, and who only knew of its existence by repute, are entitled to
                            assume that it still exists until something is done to notify publicly
                            that it exists no longer. An old customer, however, is entitled to a
                            more specific notice than a person who never dealt with the firm at all;
                            and in considering whether notice of dissolution or retirement is or is
                            not sufficient, a distinction must be made according as the person
                            sought to be affected by notice was or was not a customer of the old
                            firm</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis in original]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">In other words, creditors who have had dealings with the partnership
                    are entitled to actual notice of the reconstitution of the firm, those who have
                    had no previous dealings with the firm but who were aware of the firm’s
                    reputation (in that they had known of the apparent partners) would be entitled
                    to notice via an appropriate announcement in the Singapore Gazette or a similar
                    publication; and new creditors who had never known of the retiring
                    partner’s position until after the reconstitution are not entitled to
                    notice.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_70"></a>70     Liability imposed under s 36 of the PA is
                    no more than the application of a facet of agency law – the
                    agent/partner’s authority continues until revoked and notice of revocation
                    has been received by the third party. An alternative explanation is based on the
                    doctrine of estoppel. As the retired partner has been known to be a partner of
                    the firm, this state of affairs amounts to a holding out that the retiree
                    continues to be a partner. The onus is therefore upon the retiree to notify
                    others that he is no longer a partner, failing which third parties are entitled
                    to assume that he is still a partner.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Application of the law to the facts</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_71"></a>71     While it is settled law that a retiring
                    partner may continue to be held liable for the firm’s transactions if he
                    does not give notice to the firm’s existing customers, we do not think
                    that s 36 means that the retiring partner’s exposure is without limit
                    as long as no notice has been given. For example, it would be absurd if a
                    retired partner could continue to be liable for the negligent acts of an
                    employee of his former firm years after his withdrawal just because he had for
                    one reason or another not given notice of his retirement.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_72"></a>72     That being said, we do not agree with the
                    Judge’s reasoning that RY could not be held liable under s 36 of the
                    PA because when she left the firm, there was no real change in the constitution
                    of the firm as she was never in truth a partner. The purpose of s 36 of the
                    PA is clearly to protect the interest of third party creditors who rely on the
                    partner’s continuing relationship with the firm. To adopt a literal
                    reading of the phrase “a change in its constitution” would go
                    against the purpose of the provision. As held in <em>Stekel</em> (at 198):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Quoad the outside world it often will matter little whether a man is a
                        full partner or a salaried partner; for a salaried partner is held out as
                        being a partner, and the partners will be liable for his acts
                        accordingly.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">We would add that the converse is also true, and a salaried partner
                    will be accordingly liable for the acts of the actual partners <em>quoad</em> the outside world so long as the holding out
                    provisions under s 14 of the PA are fulfilled. Once a person is established
                    to have held himself out or allowed to be held out as a partner under s 14
                    of the PA, the other provisions of the statute would also apply to him as if he
                    were in truth a partner unless the statute provides otherwise.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_73"></a>73     We, however, agree with the Judge’s
                    alternative ground for finding that RY should not be held liable, <em>ie</em>, because Orix was dealing with the firm on the basis
                    of the August Agreement, which was a <em>new</em> contract.
                    It could not thereafter rely on s 36 to render RY liable. The present
                    matter is easily distinguishable from cases such as <em>Wood v
                        Fresher Foods Ltd</em> [2008] 2 NZLR 248, where the debt of
                    the firm was incurred after the partner retired but the distribution agreement
                    upon which the debt was founded was concluded <em>before</em> the partner’s retirement. As mentioned above, the
                    traditional rationale underlying the liability imposed under s 36 is that
                    as a rule of the law on agency, the partner’s authority continues until
                    revoked. While the retired partner may be liable for debts accruing after his
                    withdrawal in respect of contracts entered into while he was a partner, it does
                    not follow that the retired partner is also liable for debts arising from
                    contracts concluded after he left the firm. This is because by retiring from the
                    firm, the partner has terminated the authority of his fellow partners to
                    continue concluding agreements that would bind him.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_74"></a>74     A remaining partner in the firm (in this case
                    LCP) can have no basis on which to make new agreements on the retiring
                    partner’s (in this case RY) behalf except in extenuating circumstance such
                    as where the partner has retired but somehow knowingly continues to allow
                    himself to be held out as being still a part of the firm (which was not the case
                    here). Similarly, applying the estoppel analysis, by retiring from the firm, RY
                    has ceased to hold herself out as a partner and subsequent contracts concluded
                    on the misrepresentation that she is a partner should not bind her. Although
                    Orix might have had prior dealings with CPP, it was suing on a fresh contract
                    entered into <em>after</em> RY’s retirement. Orix
                    should not have simply assumed that the composition of CPP remained the same. In
                    fact, it never inquired into whether CPP was still made up of the same partners
                    as when the Original Agreement was entered into. As such, Orix cannot succeed
                    against RY on this ground.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_75"></a>75     In addition, one other point of interest is
                    that even prior to the Original Agreement being entered into, none of the
                    searches Orix made were targeted at establishing that LCP, ML and RY were
                    partners of CPP. Orix inspected CPP’s website which did not give the names
                    of the firm’s partners. It also searched for the names of the three
                    individuals on the Law Society’s website which confirmed that they worked
                    at CPP but made no mention of their designation. In addition to the EIS, it ran
                    property searches to assess the financial status of the three individuals. Yet,
                    it <em>never</em> ran any search, or more, importantly made
                    direct enquiries with CPP, that might reveal who the partners of CPP were.
                    Instead, it relied entirely on an email from Loh, an employee of Canon and not
                    CPP, to establish that LCP, RY and ML were partners of CPP. This was confirmed
                    in the cross-examination of Lee<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_22" id="Ftn_22_1"><sup>[note: 22]</sup></a></span>. <em>Orix had
                        precipitately made its bed. It was without any solid underpinning. Now, it
                        must lie in it</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Some observations</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_76"></a>76     Given our findings on the three issues above,
                    there is no need to go further to consider issues relating to representation and
                    reliance. There are nevertheless some other concerns that have arisen that we
                    think merit comment.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_77"></a>77     First, pursuant to r 9 of the Legal
                    Profession (Naming of Law Firms) Rules (Cap 161, R 16, 1997
                    Rev Ed) (“the LP(NLF)R”), “[t]he name of a firm
                    … shall not … be … misleading”. We think that sole
                    proprietorships registering themselves as “[name] &amp; Partners”
                    and holding out as partnerships are likely to be in breach of the above rule.
                    Such registration allows a sole proprietorship to mislead the public into
                    thinking that it is something other than what it really is. We note that
                    pursuant to the LP(NLF)R, quite rightly, the firm name can contain the name of a
                    former proprietor or partner only with the approval of the Council (r 6).
                    However, it appears that there is no requirement to seek the Council’s
                    approval to maintain the firm name when a firm that starts out as a partnership
                    between two or more persons and is registered as “[name] &amp;
                    Partners” subsequently becomes a sole proprietorship so long as the
                    person whose name the firm bears remains a part of the firm. Why should a sole
                    proprietorship be permitted under any circumstances to masquerade as a
                    partnership? If it has not done so, it is necessary that the Law Society resolve
                    this unsatisfactory anomaly to ensure that only true partnerships can hold
                    themselves out as such.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_78"></a>78     Second, we note that, even today, third
                    parties have to write in to the Law Society to ascertain who the partners of a
                    law firm are. One would now expect that such information is readily accessible
                    to the public and kept up to date on the website of the firm or the Law
                    Society’s website to facilitate background checks by members of the public
                    or those who deal with law firms. The Law Society should consider maintaining a
                    public register, accessible to the public through the Internet, of all partners
                    of a law firm or limited liability law partnership as well as directors of a law
                    corporation.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_79"></a>79     Third, the quaint requirement in s 36 of
                    the PA for notices in relation to partnerships to be published in the Government
                    Gazette seems to be rather out of step with present day business practices. A
                    more practical and convenient means of publicising partnership changes ought to
                    be stipulated.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_80"></a>80     For the above reasons, we allow CA 124
                    with costs to ML and dismiss CA 127 with costs to RY. We also order that ML
                    is only entitled to half of the costs of the proceedings below in view of the
                    unnecessary time spent on several unmeritorious defences. The usual
                    consequential orders are to follow.</p>
