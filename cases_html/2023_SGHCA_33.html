Mdm Chee described the IHC Dividend Agreement in the following terms:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) When IHC was listed in July 2013, one of its substantial shareholders HMC distributed a special dividend of 82.29 IHC shares <span class="font-italic">in specie</span> from HMC’s shareholding in IHC for every 1,000 shares held by a shareholder of HMC. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) At that time, OOL had already transferred 401m HMC shares to Mr Fan between July 2009 and June 2011. As such, Mr Fan became entitled to and did receive some 33.03m IHC shares by way of an <span class="font-italic">in specie </span>dividend from HMC. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) In July 2013, Mdm Chee, in her capacity as OOL’s agent, orally agreed with Mr Fan that he would hold these 33.03m IHC shares on trust for OOL. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">17 The Judge found that there was never an agreement to this effect. He reasoned, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, that if the 33.03m IHC shares worth $15.8m were beneficially owned by OOL, that should have been reflected in OOL’s balance sheet as at 4 November 2013.

The Judge set out five reasons for his conclusions on the POASL (at [69]–[82] of the Judgment) and we summarise them briefly below: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) First, Mr Fan’s and Mdm Chee’s admitted propensity for creating and falsely backdating self-serving documents meant that the Judge accorded only the slightest weight to their oral evidence and documents emanating from them. In relation to the POASL, the Judge found that they had every incentive to lie to avoid liability and to minimise the scope of their deception after it was revealed that the SLA and SAMP were unauthentic documents.

These documents were also not disclosed in the initial round of disclosure in February 2019.

In this regard, the Judge found it highly improbable that OOL and Mdm Chee managed to foresee that exactly 301,359,748 additional HMC shares would be transferred, allotted, declared by way of scrip dividend, or vested by way of a rights issue or bonus shares in OOL between February 2010 and June 2011.

This was especially since Mdm Chee’s case was that the POASL captured in an enforceable contract all six of the key terms of the supposed agreement which the parties to it reached in February 2010.

Mdm Chee’s position in the proceedings below was that these four documents were created, signed, and stamped on four different dates between 2010 and 2015. On the evidence, the Judge accepted that OOL had another company stamp in use during this period in which its name was spelled with initial capital letters only. In the Judge’s assessment, the fact that four documents said to have been created at different times over a span of five years used the same version of OOL’s two (or possibly more) company stamps suggested that these four documents were, in fact, created, signed, and stamped on a single occasion. That, in turn, suggested to the Judge that all seven documents were created on one occasion and falsely backdated.

Pursuant to Order 19 Rule 25 of the Rules of Court 2021, she was obliged to serve her notice of appeal “on all parties who have an interest in the appeal”.

He found the sale to be a fraudulent conveyance (the Judgment at [293]–[302]) and a transaction at an undervalue (the Judgment at [303]–[306]).

OOPL was once wholly owned by Mr Fan, but in February 2016 he transferred his ownership of OOPL to Gateway Plus (which was in turn owned by OOL) for nominal consideration of US$1.

That involved Mdm Chee and Mr Fan presenting a false narrative seeking to deceive the trustees and the court, with Mdm Chee and Mr Fan creating, signing, and falsely dating two agreements, the SLA and the SAMP, and creating and signing several falsely dated notices purporting to have been issued over a period of four years (the Judgment at [54]–[55]). The Judge’s order of indemnity costs was amply justified.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 The Judge did not include criticism of the POASL in that section of the Judgment, but he also found that POASL was not authentic, falsely backdated, not authentic, and in any event a sham.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 On appeal, Mdm Chee did not rely on the SLA and the SAMP (which had already been abandoned at first instance), but she still relied on the POASL which fared no better than the SLA and the SAMP – that was still dishonest of her. Moreover, her appeal contentions largely comprised bare assertions of her position and did not engage with much of the Judgment against her.
