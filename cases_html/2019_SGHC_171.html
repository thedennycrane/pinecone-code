</div> More fundamentally, the point that invoices were issued only after Novellers was in good financial stead to contribute runs against Btech’s own case that Novellers was to contribute to its costs “on a monthly basis”, and in fact supports Novellers’ case that any contributions were to be subsequently agreed on a case-by-case basis depending on defendant’s financial ability to contribute. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 Btech’s second explanation, put forth after abandoning the first explanation at trial, was that Novellers was obliged to pay – and had in fact been paying for – the said costs and expenses <span class="font-italic">from the beginning</span>, albeit on “a contra basis”.

</div>
</div> Seeing as Novellers only ever operated from the Premises, these “rental” expenses could only have been incurred in respect of the Premises. On this basis, it is argued that the date the invoices were issued ought not to be given much weight; the invoices were issued in 2015 on Brian Lim’s initiative shortly after he joined Novellers as Finance Manager sometime in 2014, and were issued as a mere formality to regularise payments which had already been made.

Mr Ang made no mention of the “rental” expenses allegedly paid by Novellers, whether in his AEIC or on the stand. This is unsurprising, considering that the itemised breakdown of what was billed to Novellers does not even have a rental component. Instead it comprises property and equipment leasing (property mortgage loan, equipment loans, vehicle loans, property tax and maintenance), miscellaneous expenses (such as water and refuse removal bills, foreign worker levies, phone bills and petrol costs), as well as cash outflows for staff payroll.

</div> While Dr Huang was asked about these rental expenses, it was never put to him that the rental expenses recorded in Novellers’ financial statements were in fact those same sums owing under the invoices issued by Btech.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 I also find it disingenuous of Btech to suggest that the invoices were issued to regularise payments that Novellers had been making <span class="font-italic">from its incorporation</span>, when invoices were only issued in respect of expenses incurred <span class="font-italic">from July 2014 onwards</span>. The “rental” expenses were also recorded in the preceding two annual financial statements, and yet no explanation was offered for why invoices were not issued to “regularise” the “rental” expenses incurred before July 2014. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 Secondly, the lack of regularity with which Novellers was invoiced by Btech when it eventually did so is revealing. As detailed above, Btech issued invoices for July to December 2014 in February 2015, then issued invoices for monthly billings from February 2015 (for the month of January) to August 2015 (for the month of July). Subsequently, <span class="font-italic">no invoices were issued</span><span class="font-italic"> until 22 January 2016</span>, when Btech issued a slew of five invoices (for August to December 2015) to Novellers on the same day. Given that there was as yet no dispute between the parties at that point, there would be no reason for Btech to hold back on issuing monthly invoices or for Novellers to refuse to pay the same. Between 22 January 2016 and 24 August 2016 there were again no invoices issued, before Btech issued on 24 <span class="font-italic">August </span>2016 one consolidated invoice for January to <span class="font-italic">September </span>2016 – in other words, this invoice purported to bill Novellers for expenses <span class="font-italic">prospectively</span> (insofar as it referred to expenses for <span class="font-italic">September</span> 2016). All this indicates that was no agreement for monthly payments but only, at best, an <span class="font-italic">ad hoc </span>arrangement.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 Thirdly, Novellers’ conduct in allowing the unpaid invoices to go unpaid and Btech’s conduct in failing to demand payment or object to the same supports the view that there was no agreement for monthly payment. The first of the unpaid invoices was issued on 1 August 2015 but Btech made no demand for payment until the statutory demand of 26 August 2016. Mr Ang confirmed this on the stand and added that Btech simply continued to invoice Novellers for further amounts, seemingly without heed to the outstanding amounts previously invoiced.

</div> In response, Btech argues that any benefit it gained in the form of profit margin came not from its Oral Agreement with Novellers, but from the arrangement between Btech and Preseal and/or Systemaz.

</div> In my view, this argument ignores the substance of the arrangement, whereby Preseal and/or Systemaz were merely intermediaries; and, in any case, intermediaries wholly owned by Mr Ang’s wife. Even if one were to close one’s eyes to the obvious connections between Preseal and/or Systemaz and Btech, it is a trite principle of contract law that while consideration must move from the promisee (Novellers), there is no requirement for such consideration to move to the promisor (Btech); consideration may move from the promisee to a third party (Preseal and/or Systemaz) (<span class="font-italic">The Law of Contract in Singapore</span> (Andrew Phang Boon Leong gen ed) (Academy Publishing, 2012) at para 04.021).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 Btech also argues that it would have been a breach of his duties as a director for Mr Ang to have entered into an arrangement whereby Btech essentially makes gratuitous payments to Novellers, and that entry into such an agreement would be an act <span class="font-italic">ultra vires</span> of the company and therefore void. For the reasons stated above, I am of the view that Novellers had provided adequate consideration for Btech’s promises under the Oral Agreement, and that Btech’s promises were not gratuitously made. In any case, even if a director causes the company to enter into a transaction in breach of his duties, that does not mean that the said transaction was entered into <span class="font-italic">ultra vires</span>. The doctrine of <span class="font-italic">ultra vires</span> applies only where a company acts in excess of limitations imposed on it in its constitution, and even so, such an act would be valid vis-à-vis third parties dealing with the company in good faith: see s 25B(1) of the Companies Act.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 In sum, for the reasons stated above, I reject Btech’s contention that Novellers was obliged to reimburse it for the costs and expenses enumerated at [7(d)] above under the Oral Agreement on a monthly basis. That was not a term of the Oral Agreement. Instead, any contributions made by Novellers would be made on an <span class="font-italic">ad hoc</span> basis, by subsequent agreement of the parties, and in this regard it cannot seriously be disputed that Novellers never agreed to pay the sums claimed under the unpaid invoices.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 It follows therefore that Novellers is not liable for the sums claimed under the invoices.

</div> At the trial, Mr Ang was referred to one such occasion, where Mr Ang had placed an urgent order to be delivered by 15 January 2014 but was told by Mr Anthony Soh, an employee of Novellers, that the order could only be fulfilled two days later on 17 January 2014. Mr Ang agreed that the correspondence showed that the delivery date for each order was subject to Novellers’ approval.

The first is the public interest in the expeditious administration of justice, which pulls in favour of robust enforcement of court orders. The second is the principle that a party should not ordinarily be denied adjudication on his case on its merits because of procedural defaults. This second principle finds expression in the court’s general discretion to extend time, though the option of extending time for disclosure obviously falls away in cases where the documents for which discovery is sought have been destroyed or are otherwise no longer in existence (<span class="font-italic">Singapore Civil Procedure 201</span><span class="font-italic">9</span> vol I (Justice Chua Lee Ming editor-in-chief) (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 2019) at para 24/16/1). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">95 Although the general test is whether there is a real or substantial risk that the default will render the fair trial of the action impossible, cases involving contumacious conduct – such as the deliberate destruction or suppression of a document or the persistent disregard of an order of production – may nevertheless warrant an order for striking out even if a fair trial is still possible (<span class="font-italic">Mitora Pte Ltd v Agritrade International (Pte) Ltd</span> [2013] 3 SLR 1179 (“<span class="font-italic">Mitora</span>”) at [48]). Thus, in <span class="font-italic">Manilal and Sons (Pte) Ltd v Bhupendra K J Shan (trading as JB International)</span> [1989] 2 SLR(R) 603, the plaintiff’s action was struck out for non-compliance with an “unless” order for discovery, the court finding that the non-compliance was either deliberate or arising out of “gross negligence … such as to amount to wilfulness” (at [64]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">96 In this regard, where the application is interlocutory in nature, affidavits of discovery generally are conclusive as to whether or not the discovery obligation had been breached, and striking out would only be appropriate where the breach is admitted or clear on the face of the documents, affidavits or pleadings put forward by the party in default (<span class="font-italic">Cepheus Shipping Corporation v Guardian Royal Exchange Assurance Plc (The “Capricorn”)</span> [1995] 1 Lloyd’s Rep 622 (“<span class="font-italic">The Capricorn</span>”) at 646.

I have more than a little doubt whether that can be so. <span class="font-italic">The right view of </span>Fayed v.

</div> Mr Ang was cross-examined on his affidavit of 19 July 2017, and was afforded every opportunity to satisfy the court of his efforts at preserving the documentary records.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">98 Yet, Mr Ang’s explanations for the paucity of documents preserved were not only wholly unsatisfactory but, at points, quite troubling. In his affidavit of 19 July 2017, he blamed the “inevitable loss that comes with the passage of time” and “circumstances outside of [his] control” for the loss of documents. As to the first explanation – loss due to the “effluxion of time” – it bears emphasising that barely nine months had elapsed from the time the Premises was shuttered on 25 August 2016 to Novellers’ notice to produce (dated 15 May 2017). In fact, I would have expected the materiality of the documentary records to have been apparent to Btech from the time Novellers’ defence and counterclaim was first filed on 10 October 2016. Perhaps most pertinently, proceedings were commenced <span class="font-italic">by </span><span class="font-italic">Btech</span> on 15 September 2016 – just a month after the locks were changed. By that time, Btech ought to have been keenly aware of the need to preserve the documentary records left at the Premises on account of the proceedings it itself had commenced. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">99 Turning to his second explanation – loss due to circumstances outside of Mr Ang’s control – I failed to see how there could have been circumstances outside of his control resulting in the loss of documents. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The documentary records had been left at the Premises when Novellers was essentially evicted on 25 August 2016, and thereafter it was Btech who occupied and operated from the Premises. Perhaps anticipating some difficulty on this score, Mr Ang explained (on affidavit) that the circumstances beyond his control included “unsatisfactory document retention when <span class="font-italic">moving of premises</span> et al” [emphasis added] (see [92] above). However, this explanation was completely discredited when he later conceded under cross-examination that Btech had never moved from the Premises.

When confronted with the incredulity of the explanations in his affidavit, Mr Ang attempted to pin the blame on a cleaning contractor that had been hired “to clean out the whole place”.

</div> is not stated in his affidavit of 19 July 2017, and in any case does not account for the loss of the supplier records, which would have borne Novellers’ letterhead.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">100 In sum, by Btech’s own evidence, documentary records such as Novellers’ purchase requisition forms, purchase orders, delivery orders and records of cheque payments were kept at the Premises, and were present at the Premises <span class="font-italic">at the time the locks were changed</span>. Yet, the documents disclosed pursuant to a direct request made for the documentary records kept at the Premises were but a fraction of what must have remained on the Premises as at 25 August 2016. Mr Ang could give no coherent reason for the paucity of documents, and in fact contradicted the explanations he had given on affidavit with admissions made during the trial. In the circumstances, I agree with Novellers that the foregoing founds an irresistible inference that Btech had suppressed, misappropriated or destroyed the documentary records, and that this was either deliberate, or borne of gross negligence such as to amount to wilfulness.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">101 The suppressed documents would be highly relevant to Novellers’ counterclaim for conversion of its equipment and tools, since Btech joins issue with Novellers on the question of ownership. In the determination of this issue, the purchase requisition forms and purchase orders would indicate whether and which equipment had been ordered by Novellers. The delivery orders would indicate whether the equipment had been delivered <span class="font-italic">to the Premises</span>. The cheque records would show whether Novellers had indeed paid for the said equipment. The suppression of these documents would make it extremely difficult, if not impossible, for Novellers to prove its case, especially given that Btech’s defence to the claim was that Novellers had not proven that the equipment and tools belonged to it.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">102 In my view, given Btech’s deliberate suppression of the documentary records, as well as the materiality of those records to Novellers’ counterclaim <span class="font-italic">in respect of the equipment and tools left at the Premises</span>, this is an appropriate case for the making of an order under O 24, r 16(1) of the ROC. As was mentioned, O 24, r 16(1) confers upon the court wide powers to make such order as would be fair and just in the circumstances. Seeing as the documentary records would be relevant to Novellers’ counterclaim for the equipment and tools <span class="font-italic">specifically</span>, and not its other counterclaims, I do not think it would be fair to strike out Btech’s defence to counterclaim <span class="font-italic">in toto</span>. I therefore order that para 9 of Btech’s Reply and Defence to Counterclaim (Amendment No 2) be struck out (being the paragraph stating its defence to Novellers’ counterclaim for the equipment and tools (see Defence and Counterclaim (Amendment No 2) at para 11)), and I give judgment substantially in favour of Novellers on that claim, subject to the point I discuss at [105] below.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">103 As regards Novellers’ request for an order for delivery up of the documentary records, such a claim must be brought in an action for detinue, and not conversion. The tort of detinue comprises both the elements of wrongful detention <span class="font-italic">and</span> the refusal to redeliver, and as such a demand by the claimant (here, Novellers) for the return of the documentary records is an essential ingredient of the tort (Gary Chan Kok Yew and Lee Pey Woan, <span class="font-italic">The Law of Torts in Singapore</span> (Academy Publishing, 2nd Ed, 2016) at para 11.067). The Notice to Produce dated 15 May 2017 is not a demand for redelivery, but a notice to produce for the purposes of <span class="font-italic">inspection</span>. Novellers did not refer me to any evidence that a demand for redelivery was made in respect of the documentary records, and accordingly, that remedy was not available.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Equipment and tools</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">104 Novellers counterclaims for the conversion of various items of equipment and tools that were left at the Premises when the locks were changed by Btech.

Novellers explained that the correlation method (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, correlating invoiced purchases to transfers in its bank statements) could not be applied to every item because multiple purchase orders may have been compiled into a single invoice, and multiple invoices may have been paid using a single cheque or via a single transfer. For this reason, the supplier records (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, purchase requisition forms, purchase orders, delivery orders and records of cheque payments) were absolutely essential. Without these documents, it would not just be difficult but impossible for Novellers to make good its claim to ownership of the various items.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">112 I should add that Btech was itself unable to furnish any proof of payment for the disputed items. In my view, it is far too convenient for Btech simply to sit back and deny Novellers’ ownership of the items only on the basis of burden of proof, while at the same time suppressing the very documents Novellers would need to discharge that burden. In the circumstances, and for the same reasons discussed at [97]–[102] above, I think this an appropriate case to draw an adverse inference under s 116 of the Evidence Act (Cap 97, 1997 Rev Ed) against Btech by presuming that the documentary records – had they been preserved and disclosed – would have shown that Novellers did indeed purchase the items listed at [110] above (<span class="font-italic">Mitora</span> at [45(c)(v)]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">113 For these reasons, even if Btech’s defence to counterclaim still stood, I would nonetheless have found that the items listed at [106] above belonged to Novellers, and that by treating those items as its own, Btech had converted the said items and is liable to Novellers in damages.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Proprietary information</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">114 The third category of Novellers’ unlawful detention counterclaim concerns the proprietary information left at the Premises as at 25 August 2016.

The question of ownership over the proprietary information was put to Dr Huang, and his answers indicated that although he was the progenitor of the innovations and ideas, the process of developing those ideas into commercially viable processes – which is ultimately the information encapsulated in documents like the SOPs, technical drawings and material formulations – was a joint effort between Dr Huang and Novellers’ development team, and therefore belonged to Novellers:

However, those responses seem to contradict that very submission, as they suggest that the products which Btech was manufacturing at the Premises after Novellers’ eviction were similar to those which had been produced by Novellers.

After the re-examination of Dr Huang, Mr Sankar s/o Saminathan, counsel for Btech, requested leave for further cross-examination of Dr Huang. Mr Sankar informed me that he wished to put a further point (on which he had been instructed) to Dr Huang, the point being that Mr Ang had given Novellers’ SOPs to PPE:
