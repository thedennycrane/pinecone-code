</div>
</div> At the hearing of the setting aside application before the learned Assistant Registrar (“the AR”), Mr Chen relied on two grounds. First, more than six years had passed since the date of the foreign judgment. Second, insufficient notice was given to Mr Chen of the taxation proceedings. The learned AR rejected Mr Chen’s submissions on both grounds and dismissed the setting aside application on 13 December 2021.

One major change brought about by the 2020 Rev Ed is the removal of chapter numbers and the inclusion of the year of enactment in the short title of each Act. Another change involves the renumbering of sections and paragraphs, in particular where the section or paragraph numbering involved alphabetical suffixes. For example, of relevance to the present case is the renumbering of paragraphs (<span class="font-italic">aa</span>) and (<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of s 4(3) of the REFJA as paragraphs (<span class="font-italic">b</span>) and (<span class="font-italic">c</span>) respectively in the 2020 Rev Ed.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">15 As OS 618 was filed before 31 December 2021, all references to legislation in these grounds, including references to section and paragraph numbers, are references to the version in force prior to the coming into force of the 2020 Rev Ed (unless otherwise specified).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">16 The setting aside of the registration of a foreign judgment under the REFJA is governed by s 5(1) of the REFJA, which reads:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Cases in which registered judgments must or may be set aside</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">5.—(1)  On an application in that behalf duly made by any party against whom a registered judgment may be enforced, the registration of the judgment —</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) shall be set aside if the registering court is satisfied —</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-italic">(i) that the judgment is not a judgment to which this Part applies or was registered in contravention of sections 3 and 4;</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(ii) that the courts of the country of the original court had no jurisdiction in the circumstances of the case;</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(iii) that the judgment debtor, being a defendant in the proceedings in the original court, did not (notwithstanding that process may have been duly served on him in accordance with the law of the country of the original court) receive notice of those proceedings in sufficient time to enable him to defend the proceedings and did not appear;</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(iv) that the judgment was obtained by fraud;</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(v) that the enforcement of the judgment would be contrary to public policy in the country of the registering court; or</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(vi) that the rights under the judgment are not vested in the person by whom the application for registration was made;</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added in italics]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">17 As provided in s 5(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)(i), the registration of a judgment shall be set aside if:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) it is not a judgment to which Part I of the REFJA applies; or </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) it was registered in contravention of ss 3 and 4 of the REFJA. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">18 On whether Part I of the REFJA applies to a judgment, s 3(3) of the REFJA provides:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(3)  A judgment —</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) specified in an order under subsection (1) of a recognised court of a foreign country specified in the order; and</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) that is within subsection (2),</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">is a judgment to which this Part applies.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">19 In relation to s 3(3)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>), the Reciprocal Enforcement of Foreign Judgments (Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People’s Republic of China) Order (GN No S 93/1999) (“the Hong Kong Extension Order”) is an order made under s 3(1) of the REFJA. According to the Hong Kong Extension Order, </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Part I of the REFJA is extended to Hong Kong; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Hong Kong’s High Court (consisting of the Court of Appeal and the Court of First Instance) and Hong Kong’s Court of Final Appeal are deemed superior courts of Hong Kong for the purposes of Part I of the REFJA.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">20 It would not go unnoticed that there is a discrepancy between the text of the Hong Kong Extension Order, which refers to “superior courts”, and the text of s 3(3)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) as quoted at [18] above, which refers instead to a “recognised court”. This is due to amendments made to the REFJA by the Reciprocal Enforcement of Foreign Judgments (Amendment) Act 2019 (Act 25 of 2019) (the “2019 Amendment Act”), which replaced the term “superior courts” in s 3 with the term “recognised court” in order to allow for registration of lower court judgments. As the Hong Kong Extension Order predates the 2019 Amendment Act, it tracked the language of s 3 prior to the amendments made by the 2019 Amendment Act (the “2019 amendments”), which referred to “superior courts”. However, s 10 of the 2019 Amendment Act contains a transitional provision which reads:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">10.—(1)  Any order made before the date of commencement of this Act (called in this section the appointed date) under section 3 of the principal Act as in force immediately before that date, which —</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)  extends Part I of the principal Act to a foreign country;

Instead, those provisions determine which judgments Part I applies to. Therefore, the ground for setting aside referred to in s 5(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)(i) as “the judgment is not a judgment to which this Part applies” and the ground referred to as “registered in contravention of [section] 3” are, in reality, one and the same ground.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">An oddity in the paragraphing of s 4(1) of the REFJA</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 A matter touched upon during oral submissions concerned an oddity in the paragraphing of s 4(1) of the REFJA. Due to the manner in which s 4(1) had been divided into paragraphs (<span class="font-italic">a</span>) and (<span class="font-italic">b</span>), it appears from a literal reading of s 4(1) that the six-year time limit for registration applies only to first instance judgments and not to judgments rendered on appeal, with the consequence that an appellate judgment may be registered <span class="font-italic">at any time</span> after it is rendered. This seems to be an absurd result, as there appears to be no principled reason why the registration of appellate judgments would not be subject to any time limit while the registration of first instance judgments would. However, as the present case concerns a first instance judgment, the treatment of appellate judgments did not arise for determination.

As the 2020 Certificate was issued on 13 May 2020, OS 618 was brought within time and the registration did not contravene s 4(1) of the REFJA. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 Mdm Ha’s counsel further submitted at the hearing that pegging the commencement of the six-year period to the date on which the amount of costs was quantified would also be consistent with the position at common law for enforcement of a foreign judgment by way of an action on the amount due under it.

</div> Mr Chen’s response was that the position concerning enforcement at common law is based on the interpretation and application of the Limitation Act (Cap 163, 1996 Rev Ed) (the “Limitation Act”). The REFJA should be interpreted based on words found in the REFJA itself and not by reference to the provisions of the Limitation Act.

The 2013 Order therefore became registrable under the REFJA only upon issuance of the 2020 Certificate.

This in turn raises the question of what constitutes the relevant “judgment” for the purposes of applying the phrase “date of the judgment”. Mdm Ha’s position was that the “judgment” refers to a judgment for an ascertainable amount of costs, which necessarily requires that both the 2013 Order and the 2020 Certificate be taken into account and given effect.

A judgment of this nature was described in <span class="font-italic">Desert Palace </span>as a “foreign money judgment”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 <span class="font-italic">Desert Palace </span>also clarified that the applicable limitation period for an action to enforce a foreign judgment is six years, as provided in s 6(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the Limitation Act, and not twelve years as provided in s 6(3) of the Limitation Act for an action upon a judgment. This is because the action upon a judgment referred to in s 6(3) of the Limitation Act refers only to <span class="font-italic">domestic </span>judgments, whereas a common law action on a <span class="font-italic">foreign</span> judgment is an action on an implied debt. (at [49]–[53])</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 The six-year limitation period provided in s 6(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the Limitation Act commences from the “date on which the cause of action accrued”. A cause of action accrues when all the elements required to establish the cause of action are present. For an action to enforce a foreign judgment, these elements are: (a) a judgment <span class="font-italic">in personam</span> is made (b) by a foreign court of competent jurisdiction (c) for a definite sum of money (d) which is final and conclusive.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 For a typical foreign money judgment, all four elements would come into existence at the same time and there would be no difficulties determining when the cause of action for enforcing the foreign judgment accrues in such cases. In the case of an order for costs to be taxed, element (c) does not come into existence until the amount of costs is quantified. Therefore, the cause of action for enforcing such a costs order by way of action on a foreign judgment would accrue only when the amount of costs is quantified. This means that the six-year limitation period for enforcing such a costs order would not commence until the amount of costs is quantified.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 While I am not aware of any authorities which directly support the proposition made in the preceding paragraph, there are authorities to similar effect in the context of <span class="font-italic">domestic </span>costs orders. In <span class="font-italic">Chohan v Times Newspaper Ltd </span>[2001] 1 WLR 184 (“<span class="font-italic">Chohan</span>”), costs orders were made in 1993 with the amount of costs certified in November 1994 after taxation proceedings. The judgment creditor presented a bankruptcy petition against the judgment debtor in February 2000. This was more than six years after the initial costs orders were made but less than six years after the date of certification. Anthony Mann QC (sitting as a High Court judge) found that the costs orders only became enforceable after they were quantified and certified, with the six-year limitation period under s 24 of the Limitation Act 1980 (c 58) (UK) (“LA 1980”) starting to run only from this point. (Section 24 of the LA 1980 is <span class="font-italic">in pari materia</span> with s 6(3) of our Limitation Act, save that the limitation period provided under the LA 1980 is six years instead of twelve.)<span class="font-italic"> </span>The following passage from the Mann QC’s judgment is instructive (at pp 189E–190A):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… At the date of an order for taxation of costs there is an order for the payment of costs which, for some purposes, will take effect as at the date it is pronounced. For example, that date will be the starting date for the computation of time limits for the ensuing taxation (RSC Ord 62, r 29, in the case of the old rules). However, that does not mean that the judgment is enforceable as at that date of the purposes of section 24 of the 1980 Act. I think that the order becomes enforceable for those purposes only when the costs are quantified and certified by the process of taxation. The order is, in effect (and sometimes, in my experience, in its actual wording) an order for the payment of such costs as are found proper and due on taxation. <span class="font-italic">If there were a money judgment which provided for payment of £x in, say, 14 days’ time, I do not consider that an action on the judgment could be commenced before the expiry of that period of 14 days.</span> The normal costs order has a similar effect, albeit without an express reference to actual payment at a future date. … <span class="font-italic">While the costs order gives rise to rights, it does not give rise to an obligation to pay any sum until the costs are certified.</span> It is only at that point that the obligation becomes enforceable for the purposes of section 24 in any meaningful sense. <span class="font-italic">In the course of argument I asked Mr Lamacraft what the prayer in the particulars of claim would look like if an action were brought on a costs order before quantification. He said that it would contain a claim for the payment of costs to be quantified. I do not consider that any particulars like that would disclose a cause of action</span>. The beneficiary of a costs order has a right to have the costs taxed in the action in which the order is made; <span class="font-italic">there is no meaningful relief that could be granted in an action on the bare costs order, any more than there would be any meaningful claim that could be brought on a claim to pay a sum</span><span class="font-italic"> to be determined by valuation before that valuation was completed</span> (absent some claim for breach).</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added in italics]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 Even though <span class="font-italic">Chohan </span>is a judgment on s 24 of the LA 1980, which, like s 6(3) of our Limitation Act, employs the phrase “date on which the judgment became enforceable” instead of the phrase “date on which the cause of action accrued” employed in s 6(1), the reasoning in the passage quoted above applies with equal force to the enforcement of a foreign costs order in the nature of the 2013 Order. No meaningful relief could be granted on an action on such a bare costs order as it does not give rise to an obligation to pay any sum until costs are certified. In fact, Mann QC also considered that the same reasoning applies to a foreign costs order, when he commented in <span class="font-italic">Chohan</span>, at p 190, that:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">My reasoning is supported by what appears in <span class="font-italic">In re A Debtor (No 20 of 1953), Ex p The Debtor v Scott</span> [1954] WLR 1190.

At first instance Brandon J, at p 285, relied on the fact that <span class="font-italic">an action on a judgment </span><span class="font-italic">was based on implied debt, and was treated as an action in debt</span>. In the Court of Appeal Lyell J (who dissented in the result) acknowledged that an action on a foreign judgment was treated as an action arising on an implied contract to pay the amount of the foreign judgment. <span class="font-italic">That being the case it seems to </span><span class="font-italic">me that a foreign judgment relating to money cannot be enforceable in this jurisdiction until it is reduced to an actual money judgment, that is until the amount is finally quantified</span>. …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added in italics]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 Having established that, if a foreign judgment in the nature of the 2013 Order were to be enforced by action on the foreign judgment, the six-year limitation period for such an action would commence only when the amount of costs is quantified, I turn now to consider the legislative history and purpose of the REFJA.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Legislative history and purpose of the REFJA</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 In Singapore, there are two pieces of legislation providing for the enforcement of foreign judgments by way of registration – the Reciprocal Enforcement of Commonwealth Judgments Act (Cap 264, 1985 Rev Ed) (the “RECJA”) and the REFJA. The RECJA is modelled on the UK’s Administration of Justice Act 1920 (c 81) (the “AJA 1920”) while the REFJA is modelled on the UK’s Foreign Judgments (Reciprocal Enforcement) Act 1933 (c 13) (the “FJREA 1933”).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 The main differences between the AJA 1920 and the FJREA 1933 are:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Registration of a judgment under the FJREA 1933 is as of right if the criteria for registration are satisfied, while registration under the AJA 1920 is subject to the registering court finding it just and convenient to do so.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The period for making an application for registration under the FJREA 1933 is six years after the date of the judgment while the period for doing so under the AJA 1920 is one year, although this one-year period may be extended by the registering court.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) A foreign judgment which is registrable under the FJREA 1933 may not be enforced by a common law action on the foreign judgment, while the alternative of a common law action on the foreign judgment continues to be available for foreign judgments registrable under the AJA 1920.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 The rationale for the enactment of the FJREA 1933 as well as for the differences between the registration regimes under the AJA 1920 and the FJREA 1933 are explained in the report of the Foreign Judgments (Reciprocal Enforcement) Committee chaired by Lord Justice Greer (United Kingdom, <span class="font-italic">Report of the </span><span class="font-italic">Foreign Judgments (Reciprocal Enforcement) Committee</span> (Cmd 4213, 1932) (Chairman: Sir Arthur Greer) (“the Greer Report”), reprinted in <span class="font-italic">Butterworths Jurisdiction, Foreign Judgments and Awards Handbook</span> (Graham S McBain consultant ed) (Butterworths, 1994) (“<span class="font-italic">Butterworths Handbook</span>”) at pp 356–422).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 According to the Greer Report, when the UK government enacted the AJA 1920 to provide for reciprocal enforcement of judgments between different parts of the British Empire, a decision was made not to enact a similar statutory regime for enforcement of judgments of countries outside the British empire (at para 12). Several reasons were given for this decision including:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) the existing procedure for enforcing foreign judgments in England by action was found satisfactory and there was no evidence that foreign countries were dissatisfied with it; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) it was comparatively rarer for British merchants to be concerned about enforcing British judgments abroad because:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">England was mainly a creditor country, and the arbitrations of the trade organisations of powerful importing associations were alike obligatory and respected, and British merchants were able to require security for export transactions.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">However, after the enactment of the AJA 1920, the UK government received feedback concerning the unfairness arising from the fact that, while foreign judgments were easily enforceable in English courts by action, British merchants were facing difficulties enforcing English judgments in foreign countries (at para 14).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 Lord Hailsham, LC appointed a preliminary committee in 1929 (also chaired by Lord Justice Greer), which recommended that the remedy was to conclude international conventions for reciprocal enforcement of judgments. For this purpose, legislation would be required. The preliminary committee further recommended that such legislation “should not depart from the substantive principles of the common law applicable to foreign judgments in general.” (at para 16)</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 Thereafter, Lord Sankey, LC (who succeeded Lord Hailsham) appointed the Foreign Judgments (Reciprocal Enforcement) Committee in 1931 (“the Committee”) to follow up on the recommendations of the preliminary committee. The Committee chose to embody its recommendations in the Greer Report in the form of a draft Foreign Judgments (Reciprocal Enforcement) Bill (“the Draft Bill”), draft rules of court, draft orders in council and draft international conventions to be negotiated with various countries (at para 3).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 The Greer Report explained that one of the guiding principles followed by the Committee was that, in the proposed legislation, existing principles of the common law should generally be followed in matters of substance while the procedure in the AJA 1920 should generally be followed in matters of procedure (at para 18).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 Clause 2(1) of the Draft Bill is <span class="font-italic">in</span> <span class="font-italic">pari materia</span> with s 4(1) of the REFJA and similarly provides for an application for registration to be made “at any time within six years after the date of the judgment” (the Greer Report at p 23, <span class="font-italic">Butterworths Handbook </span>at p 374). The following explanation for the drafting of clause 2(1) was given at Annex V of the Greer Report (the Greer Report at pp 60–61, <span class="font-italic">Butterworths Handbook </span>at p 414):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… The period for registration is six years from the date of the foreign judgment (<span class="font-italic">i.e., the same period as that now allowed at Common Law for bringing an action on the judgment</span>). In the Administration of Justice Act, 1920, the period is “six months or such longer period as the Court may allow.” The Act of 1920, however, did not take away the right to bring an action on the judgment as an alternative to registration, and under that Act this method can be resorted to if the period for registration has run out. In this Bill (Clause 6) the alternative procedure of an action on the judgment is, for reasons explained below (paragraph 11), barred in the case of judgments which can be registered. <span class="font-italic">To allow a shorter period than six years for registration would involve a substantial diminution of the rights at Common Law of foreign judgment creditors</span>. It was found, moreover, desirable to specify in the conventions [referring to Draft Conventions with Belgium, Germany and France found in Annex IV of the Greer Report] the minimum period for applications to enforce judgments, and for this purpose the period of six months was clearly too short, and a purely discretionary power of extension of a short minimum period would not have been acceptable to the foreign experts nor satisfactory in operation in the case of the enforcement of English judgments abroad.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added in italics]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 Thus, the Greer Report’s rationale for the phrase “six years after the date of the judgment” was to provide the same period as was allowed at common law for bringing an action on a foreign judgment and to ensure that the statutory regime set out in the Draft Bill would not involve a substantial diminution of the rights at common law of foreign judgment creditors.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 Having considered the legislative history and purpose of the FJREA 1933 and, by extension, of the REFJA, including the rationale for the six-year limit for registration of a foreign judgment, I turn now to consider the structure of the enforcement regime under the REFJA.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Structure of enforcement regime under the REFJA</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 After the 2019 amendments, which came into force on 3 October 2019, the REFJA now provides for enforcement of both money judgments and non-money judgments. A money judgment is defined in s 2(1) of the REFJA simply as “a judgment under which a sum of money is payable …” while a non-money judgment is defined simply as “a judgment that is not a money judgment …”. Section 4(3A) of the REFJA provides that a non-money judgment may be registered only if the registering court “is satisfied that enforcement of the judgment would be just and convenient”. No such restriction applies to money judgments, which remain registrable as of right if the criteria for registration are satisfied.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 The REFJA as it stood prior to the 2019 amendments (the “pre-2019 REFJA”) only allowed for registration of money judgments. This arose from the fact that, back then, s 3(2) of the REFJA read:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(2)  Any judgment of a superior court of a foreign country to which this Part extends, other than a judgment of such a court given on appeal from a court which is not a superior court, shall be a judgment to which this Part applies, if —</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) it is final and conclusive as between the parties thereto;</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) <span class="font-italic">there is payable thereunder a sum of money</span>, not being a sum payable in respect of taxes or other charges of a like nature or in respect of a fine or other penalty; and</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) it is given after the coming into operation of the order directing that this Part shall extend to that foreign country.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added in italics]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">The effect of s 3(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) in the pre-2019 REFJA was that a judgment had to be one under which a sum of money was payable in order to be registrable. The 2019 amendments took this requirement out from s 3(2) and folded it into the newly created definition of “money judgment” referred to at [49] above.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 The 2019 amendments provided a <span class="font-italic">framework </span>for non-money judgments to be registered under the REFJA but did not have the effect of making non-money judgments of all descriptions immediately registrable. This is because, after the 2019 amendments, s 3(1) of the REFJA now provides:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">3.—(1)  If the Minister is satisfied that, in the event of the benefits conferred by this Part being extended to <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">a particular description of judgments</span><span class="font-weight-bold"> </span><span class="font-italic">given in a particular court or description of courts of a foreign country</span>, substantial reciprocity of treatment will be assured as respects the enforcement in that foreign country of <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">similar judgments</span><span class="font-italic"> given in a similar court or similar courts of Singapore</span>, the Minister may, by order in the <span class="font-italic">Gazette</span>, direct that —</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) this Part applies to that foreign country;</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) the court or courts of the foreign country specified in the order is a recognised court or are recognised courts of the foreign country for the purposes of this Part; and</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) <span class="font-italic">judgments specified in the order of any such recognised court or courts</span>, if within subsection (2), are judgments to which this Part applies.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added in italics and bold italics]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">Thus, it is envisaged that, under the 2019 amendments, a particular description of judgments will be registrable under the REFJA only if it is specified in an order made by the Minister under s 3(1) of the REFJA.

First, it is relevant for the purpose of Mdm Ha’s submission based on s 4(3)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the REFJA (at [29] above), as that submission turns, in part, on whether the 2013 Order could be “enforced by execution in the country of the original court”. Second, it is relevant for the purpose of determining whether and when a foreign judgment is final and conclusive under s 3(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>). This is because a foreign judgment will not be regarded as final and conclusive for the purpose of enforcement in this jurisdiction if it is not considered final and conclusive under the laws of the country in which the foreign judgment was given (see <span class="font-italic">Nouvion v Freeman</span> (1889) LR 15 AC 1 at 9, 13 and 18, <span class="font-italic">Carl Zeiss Stiftung v Rayner &amp; Keeler Ltd (No 2)</span> [1967] 1 AC 853 at 919 and <span class="font-italic">Berliner Industriebank Aktiengesellschaft v Jost</span> [1970] 3 WLR 743). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 Mr Chen did not file an expert’s opinion.

</div>
</div> If so, the “date of the judgment” for the purpose of calculating the six-year period allowed for registration would be the date on which the 2013 Order was issued. The reasoning of this submission takes the following route:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) For a judgment to come within s 4(1), it has to be “a judgment to which this Part applies” (meaning Part I of the REFJA). </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Section 3(3) defines “a judgment to which this Part applies”, and <span class="font-italic">one element</span> of that definition (as provided in s 3(3)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>)) is that it has to be a judgment within s 3(2) of the REFJA.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Section 3(2) provides that a judgment of a recognised court is within s 3(2) if it is final and conclusive as between the parties to it, unless it is an interlocutory judgment. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) Since Mr Chen’s liability to pay costs was finally determined by the 2013 Order, and the 2013 Order was not an interlocutory order, it was beyond question that the 2013 Order was “final and conclusive as between the parties to it”. The fact that the amount of costs has not been quantified does not prevent the 2013 Order from being final and conclusive.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) Since the 2013 Order was final and conclusive at the date of its issuance, it was a judgment within s 4(1) of the REFJA from the date it was issued. The “date of the judgment” for the purposes of s 4(1) would therefore be the date on which the 2013 Order was issued.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 There are at least two problems with this line of reasoning. First, in so far as Mr Chen’s reasoning is premised on whether the 2013 Order was a judgment within the meaning of s 4(1) of the REFJA <span class="font-italic">at the time of its issuance</span>, the analysis should be based on the text of the REFJA prevailing at the time the 2013 Order was issued, and not based on the text of the REFJA <span class="font-italic">after</span> the 2019 amendments (the “post-2019 REFJA”). Second, Mr Chen’s analysis using the text of the post-2019 REFJA is, in any event, flawed because it focused on only one criterion – whether the 2013 Order was final and conclusive – while ignoring other relevant statutory criteria that had to be fulfilled.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 In relation to the first problem identified in the preceding paragraph, as noted at [50] above, from its enactment in 1959 until the 2019 amendments, the REFJA provided only for the registration of money judgments. Prior to the 2019 amendments, the criteria to be met for a judgment to come within s 4(1) were set out in s 3(2) of the pre-2019 REFJA, which read:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(2)  Any judgment of a superior court of a foreign country to which this Part extends, other than a judgment of such a court given on appeal from a court which is not a superior court, shall be a judgment to which this Part applies, if —</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) it is final and conclusive as between the parties thereto;</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) <span class="font-italic">there is payable thereunder a sum of money</span>, not being a sum payable in respect of taxes or other charges of a like nature or in respect of a fine or other penalty; and</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) it is given after the coming into operation of the order directing that this Part shall extend to that foreign country.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added in italics]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">Thus, for a judgment to come within s 4(1) of the pre-2019 REFJA, the criteria to be met would be:</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(i) the judgment is of a superior court of Hong Kong (s 3(2) <span class="font-italic">chapeau</span>);</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(ii) it is final and conclusive as between the parties to it (s 3(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)); </div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(iii) there is payable thereunder a sum of money (s 3(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>)); and</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(iv) it is given after the coming into operation of the Hong Kong Extension Order (s 3(2)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>)).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 The 2013 Order did not meet criterion (iii) in the preceding paragraph <span class="font-italic">at the time of its issuance</span> as there was no “sum of money” payable thereunder until the amount of costs was quantified. At this point, it is useful to consider the explanation given in the Greer Report on clause 1 of the Draft Bill, which is <span class="font-italic">in pari materia </span>with s 3 of the pre-2019 REFJA. The relevant part of the explanation reads (the Greer Report at p 60, <span class="font-italic">Butterworths Handbook </span>at pp 413–414):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">1.   This Clause of the Bill provides for the extension, by Order in Council, of Part I of the Act (the arrangements for the enforcement in the United Kingdom) to the judgments of foreign countries, in cases where His Majesty is satisfied that reciprocal treatment is assured for judgments of the High Court in England, the Court of Session in Scotland and the High Court in Northern Ireland.

As noted at [32] above, such judgments must be judgments for definite sums of money. At the time of its issuance, the 2013 Order was not a judgment for a definite sum of money. Instead, to adopt the words of Mann QC in <span class="font-italic">Chohan</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>(see [37] above), the 2013 Order was, at the time of its issuance,<span class="font-italic"> </span>a foreign judgment relating to money which “cannot be enforceable in this jurisdiction until it is reduced to an actual money judgment, that is until the amount is finally quantified”. Therefore, the 2013 Order was not a judgment within the meaning of s 4(1) of the pre-2019 REFJA at the time of its issuance, and would not become a judgment within the meaning of s 4(1) until the amount of costs was quantified.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 Before dealing with the second problem identified at [59] above, it would be useful to clarify that, although questions concerning the status of the 2013 Order <span class="font-italic">at the time of its issuance </span>must be answered according to the law in force at the time the 2013 Order was issued, questions concerning the correctness of the Registration Order would have to be answered according to the law in force at the time OS 618 was filed. For this reason, it remains relevant and meaningful to consider the second problem with reference to the text of the post-2019 REFJA. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 Turning to the second problem, it may be recalled that the relevant provisions in the post-2019 REFJA which define the judgments that Part I applies to are ss 3(2) and 3(3), which read:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(2)  A judgment of a recognised court of a foreign country is within this subsection if —</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) it is given after the coming into operation of the order; and</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) it is final and conclusive as between the parties to it, unless it is an interlocutory judgment.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(3)  A judgment —</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) specified in an order under subsection (1) of a recognised court of a foreign country specified in the order; and</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) that is within subsection (2),</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">is a judgment to which this Part applies.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">These two subsections require the following four criteria to be met:</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(i) the judgment is of a recognised court of Hong Kong (s 3(2) <span class="font-italic">chapeau</span>);</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(ii) it is given after the coming into operation of the Hong Kong Extension Order (s 3(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>));</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(iii) it is final and conclusive as between the parties to it (s 3(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>)); and</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(iv) it is a judgment specified in the Hong Kong Extension Order (s 3(3)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 As noted at [59] above, Mr Chen’s reasoning overly focused on criterion (iii) in the preceding paragraph and erroneously ignored the existence of criterion (iv), which criterion is very much an essential element of the statutory framework for registration of foreign judgments under the REFJA. In relation to criterion (iv), s 3(3)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the REFJA refers to a judgment “specified in an order under subsection (1)”. However, the text of the Hong Kong Extension Order, as promulgated, did not actually specify any type of judgment. Nevertheless, when read with s 10(1)(<span class="font-italic">d</span>) of the 2019 Amendment Act (see [20] above), the Hong Kong Extension Order would, after the commencement of the 2019 Amendment Act, take effect as if final money judgments are judgments specified in the Hong Kong Extension Order. In other words, to fulfil criterion (iv) in the preceding paragraph, a foreign judgment has to be a money judgment. For the same reasons as those given at [61] above, the 2013 Order was not a money judgment until the amount of costs was quantified and therefore not a judgment within the meaning of s 4(1) of the REFJA until then. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 For the reasons given at [59]–[64] above, Mr Chen’s main submission, as summarised at [58] above, was misguided and could not be accepted by the court.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">My decision</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 Having explained the difficulties with Mr Chen’s main submission, I will now set out my decision.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 I agreed with Mr Chen’s submission that:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) the 2020 Certificate is not a judgment as it did not contain any direction or order for payment of costs, and merely quantified the amount of costs payable pursuant to the 2013 Order; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) it is therefore incapable of being registered independently of the 2013 Order.

</div> The dispute between parties was whether, pursuant to such merger, the date of this merged or collective judgment (the “Collective Judgment”) should, for the purposes of s 4(1) of the REFJA, be regarded as 30 April 2013 or 13 May 2020. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 According to s 5(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)(i) of the REFJA, the Registration Order shall be set aside if it was made in contravention of, <span class="font-italic">inter </span><span class="font-italic">alia</span>, s 4.

The Collective Judgment is a judgment to which Part I of the REFJA applies as it fulfils all four criteria referred to at [63] above. The Collective Judgment came into being as a judgment for an ascertainable amount of costs, and consequently as a final money judgment, when the 2020 Certificate was issued. The “date of the judgment” for the purposes of s 4(1) is therefore 13 May 2020, the date of the 2020 Certificate. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 To approach the analysis from a different angle, although the 2013 Order was a judgment providing for payment of money, it was not yet a money judgment, in the sense that it was not yet a judgment for a definite sum of money and no sum of money was yet payable under it. The 2013 Order was therefore not a judgment to which Part I of the REFJA applied until the amount of costs was quantified and certified with the issuance of the 2020 Certificate on 13 May 2020. It was only then that a sum of money was payable thereunder and it became a judgment for a definite sum of money. Consequently, it was only at that point that the 2013 Order became a judgment to which Part I of the REFJA applied. The “date of the judgment” for the purpose of computing the six-year period allowed in s 4(1) for registration is therefore 13 May 2020. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 Since OS 618 was filed on 21 June 2021, the application for registration was made within six years of the date of the judgment. The Registration Order was therefore not made in contravention of s 4 of the REFJA, and consequently not liable to be set aside.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">71 The foregoing conclusion, arrived at through textual analysis of the REFJA, is also borne out by a purposive interpretation of the REFJA. As provided in s 9A(1) of the Interpretation Act (Cap 1, 2002 Rev Ed), an interpretation that would promote the purpose or object underlying a written law is to be preferred to an interpretation that would not promote that purpose or object. As noted at [45] above, one key object or purpose of the provisions of the FJREA 1933 (and consequently of the REFJA) is that the existing principles of the common law on enforcement of foreign judgments should be followed in matters of substance. Further, as noted at [47] above, the object and purpose of the phrase “six years after the date of the judgment” was to provide the same period as was allowed at common law for bringing an action on a foreign judgment. It was also to ensure that the registration regime under the FJREA 1933 (and consequently of the REFJA) would not involve a substantial diminution of the rights at common law of foreign judgment creditors. This was because one effect of the FJREA 1933 (and the REFJA) was to remove the option of enforcement at common law for judgments to which the FJREA 1933 (or the REFJA, as the case may be) applies (see s 6 of the FJREA 1933 and s 7(1) of the REFJA). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">72 In the light of the foregoing, an interpretation which results in the six-year period in s 4(1) of the REFJA commencing at the same time as the six-year limitation period for a common law action to enforce a foreign money judgment is to be preferred to an interpretation that does not. As noted at [35]–[38] above, in the case of foreign judgments ordering costs to be taxed, the six-year limitation period for enforcing the judgment at common law by action begins to run only when the amount of costs is quantified. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">73 In coming to the foregoing decision, there was no need for me to rely on Mdm Ha’s submission based on s 4(3)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the REFJA (see [29] above). As such, I express no definite views on it.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">74 Returning to the issues posed at [30] above, the relevant “judgment” for the purposes of applying the phrase “date of the judgment” in s 4(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the REFJA is the judgment against Mr Chen for the quantified and certified amount of costs of HK$15,280,877.12. Consequently, the “date of the judgment” is 13 May 2020, the date on which the 2013 Order became a judgment for an ascertainable amount of costs as a result of the issuance of the 2020 Certificate. As OS 618 was brought less than six years from this date, the judgment was registered in compliance with s 4(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the REFJA and, thus, not liable to being set aside under s 5(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)(i) of the REFJA. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">75 I therefore dismissed Mr Chen’s appeal, and allowed the Registration Order to stand. After hearing parties’ costs submissions, I ordered Mr Chen to pay costs fixed at S$8,000 (inclusive of disbursements) to Mdm Ha.</div><table class="table table-sm table-borderless"><tbody><tr><td><div class="txt-body text-left">Pang Khang Chau J<br/>Judge of the High Court</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-left"></div></td></tr></tbody></table><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Tan Kai Liang, Mak Sushan Melissa and Lim Min Li Amanda (Allen &amp; Gledhill LLP) for the plaintiff;</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Soo Ziyang Daniel and Luis Inaki Duhart Gonzales (Selvam LLC) for the defendant.</div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div><div class="txt-body text-left"><div class="font-weight-bold"><br/><br/></div></div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Annex : The paragraphing of s 4(1) of the REFJA</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-List text-justify">A.1 Section 4(1) of the REFJA reads:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">4.—(1)  A person, being a judgment creditor under a judgment to which this Part applies, may apply to the General Division of the High Court at any time —</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) <span class="font-italic">within 6 years </span>after<span class="font-italic"> </span>the date of the judgment; or</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) where there have been proceedings by way of appeal against the judgment, after the date of the last judgment given in those proceedings,</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">to have the judgment registered in the General Division of the High Court.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added in italics]</div><div class="Judg-Quote-List text-justify">A.2 The structure of s 4(1) is such that s 4(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) applies to first instance judgments while s 4(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) applies to judgments rendered on appeal. The time limit of six years is mentioned only in s 4(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) but not s 4(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>). The opening words or <span class="font-italic">chapeau</span> of s 4(1) ends with the phrase “at any time”, before the paragraphs begin. In the light of the foregoing, if s 4(1) were to be read literally, the result would be that a first instance judgment must be registered within six years after the date of the judgment while an appellate judgment may be registered <span class="font-italic">at any time</span> after it is rendered (without any time limit). </div><div class="Judg-Quote-List text-justify">A.3 This seems to be an absurd result, as there appears to be no principled reason why the registration of an appellate judgment is not subject to any time limit while the registration of a first instance judgment is.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-List text-justify">A.4 As it turned out, the paragraphing of s 4(1) was introduced in the 2001 Rev Ed of the REFJA. Prior to the 2001 Rev Ed, s 4(1) read:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">4.—(1)  A person, being a judgment creditor under a judgment to which this Part applies, may apply to the High Court at any time <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">within 6 years</span><span class="font-italic"> after the date of the judgment</span>, or, where there have been proceedings by way of appeal against the judgment, <span class="font-italic">after the date of the last judgment given in those proceedings</span>, to have the judgment registered in the High Court …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added in italics and bold italics]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">Thus, as originally drafted, s 4(1) contained an ambiguity, in that the phrase “within 6 years” could be read either as applying to both the phrase “after the date of the judgment” and the phrase “after the date of the last judgment given in those proceedings”, or as applying only to the phrase “after the date of the judgment”. If the former reading is adopted, the six-year limit would apply to the registration of both first instance judgments and appellate judgments. If the latter reading is adopted, the six-year limit would apply only to the registration of first instance judgments, with the consequence that there would be no time limit for the registration of appellate judgments. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-List text-justify">A.5 Having regard to the context and purpose of s 4(1), it is clear that the former reading is correct. This is also how s 2(1) of the FJREA 1933, which is <span class="font-italic">in pari materia </span>with s 4(1) of the REFJA, has been interpreted: see K W Patchett, <span class="font-italic">Recognition of Commercial Judgments and Awards in the Commonwealth</span> (Butterworths, 1984) at para 3.26, and K R Handley, <span class="font-italic">Spencer Bower and Handley: Res Judicata</span> (LexisNexis, 5th Ed, 2019) at para 2.59. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-List text-justify">A.6 In other words, the paragraphing introduced by the 2001 Rev Ed is erroneous. The correct way to paragraph s 4(1) would have been to place the phrase “within 6 years” at the end of the <span class="font-italic">chapeau </span>instead of at the beginning of paragraph (<span class="font-italic">a</span>), so that the provision would read:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">4.—(1)  A person, being a judgment creditor under a judgment to which this Part applies, may apply to the General Division of the High Court at any time <span class="font-italic">within 6 years</span> —</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) after the date of the judgment; or</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) where there have been proceedings by way of appeal against the judgment, after the date of the last judgment given in those proceedings,</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">to have the judgment registered in the General Division of the High Court.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added in italics]</div><div class="Judg-Quote-List text-justify">A.7 The question which follows is whether, in the light of the changes made in the 2001 Rev Ed, s 4(1) of the REFJA should now be interpreted as imposing no time limit on the registration of appellate judgments. The limits of the Law Revision Commissioners’ powers were considered by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Yong Kheng Leong </span><span class="font-italic">and another v Panweld Trading Pte Ltd and another </span>[2013] 1 SLR 173, which held at [66] that “the Law Revision Commissioners did not have the power to effect any substantive change to this (or, for that matter, any other statute)”. Therefore, when a court interpreting a statutory provision is of the view that the adjustments made in a revised edition of the statutory provision may have inadvertently changed the meaning of the statutory provision, the court is entitled to look behind the text of that revised edition and, instead, interpret the provision on the basis of the text as it stood prior to the publication of that revised edition.</div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
