        Choo Han Teck J:</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       The appellant pleaded guilty to eight charges
                    for various offences. 18 other charges were taken into account for
                    sentencing. Three of the charges which are subject to this appeal are DAC No
                    31305 of 2012 under s 8(b)(ii) Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2008 Rev Ed),
                    for consumption of methamphetamine, DAC No 35669 of 2012 for trafficking of
                    methamphetamine under s 5(1)(a) and s 5(2) of the same, and DAC
                    No 44627 of 2012 for possession of offensive weapons under s 6(1) of
                    the Corrosive and Explosive Substances and Offensive Weapons Act (Cap 65, 1985
                    Rev Ed). He was sentenced to seven years’ imprisonment and six strokes of
                    the cane, six years’ imprisonment and six strokes of the cane, and nine
                    months’ imprisonment and six strokes of the cane for the said charges
                    respectively. The sentences were ordered to run consecutively, thus, the total
                    term of imprisonment ordered was 13 years and nine months with 18 strokes of the
                    cane.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The punishment prescribed by law in the above
                    charges are a minimum mandatory sentence of seven years imprisonment and six
                    strokes of the cane and up to 13 years imprisonment and 12 strokes of the cane
                    for s 8(b)(ii) of the Misuse of Drugs Act for DAC No 31305, a minimum
                    mandatory term of imprisonment of five years and five strokes for
                    s 5(1)/s 5(2) of the Misuse of Drugs Act and up to a maximum of 20
                    years imprisonment and 15 strokes of the cane in respect of DAC No 35669, and up
                    to three years imprisonment and six strokes of the cane in respect of DAC No
                    44627.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       The appellant’s counsel, Mr S K Kumar
                    submitted that the “one transaction” rule should apply in respect
                    of the two charges relating to methamphetamine because the methamphetamine under
                    trafficking charge under s 5(2) of the Misuse of Drugs Act and the
                    methamphetamine which he consumed were one and the same parcel. He argued that
                    the two charges should not be treated as separate offences. The appellant was
                    not charged with trafficking for the drug that he consumed. Consumption and
                    trafficking are distinct offences and thus an accused may be charged for
                    both.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       Counsel submitted that in Mohamad Iskandar bin
                    Basri v PP [2006] SGHC 158, the court had treated the offences of causing death
                    of one person and causing grievous hurt to two other victims arising from the
                    same motor vehicle accident caused by the negligence of the accused as offences
                    committed in one transaction. I think that where drug trafficking is concerned
                    an appropriate analogy would be one in which a trafficker sold drugs to two
                    different purchasers at the same time. It might also be analogous where an
                    offender was caught with drugs in his possession where part of the drugs was
                    kept in his home and part in his car. They are all in his possession at the one
                    and same time albeit stored in different places. Thus, if an offender had
                    consumed some of the drugs in his possession for which he was charged for
                    trafficking, the sentencing court can take this factor into account for the
                    purposes of sentencing, but not, strictly speaking, as part of the same
                    transaction rule, but as part of the individual circumstances of the case. In
                    that regard, the court may take into account that the consumption offence arose
                    from the offender’s addiction, and that the trafficking was carried out to
                    feed the offender’s own addiction. It is one of the factors that the court
                    may take into account, and give such weight (or none at all) to it as it thinks
                    fit.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       In the circumstances of this case, there was no
                    reason to interfere with the sentences passed by the court below. The appeal was
                    therefore dismissed.</p>
