Apoi had instructed Zaini to bring the drugs into Singapore, and was next to Zaini when he discussed the delivery with Mutaleb over the telephone. Telephone recordings and text messages also showed Mutaleb’s knowledge that Zaini would be meeting him to deliver 13 packets of drugs and that he was to pay $39,000 for the drugs.

Section 2 of the Interpretation Act (Cap 1, 2002 Rev Ed) provides that, unless expressly specified, the word “abet” has the same meaning as in the Penal Code: see also <span class="font-italic">Govindarajulu</span><span class="font-italic"> Murali and another v Public Prosecutor </span>[1994] 2 SLR(R) 398 at [43] and [44].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">19 Section 107 of the Penal Code defines abetment. The subsection invoked was that of abetment by conspiracy, as defined in s 107(<span class="font-italic">b</span>):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">A person abets the doing of a thing who … engages with one or more other person or persons in any conspiracy for the doing of that thing, if an act or illegal omission takes place in pursuance of that conspiracy, and in order to the doing of that thing; …</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">20 Making out abetment of conspiracy required the Prosecution to prove the following (<span class="font-italic">Chai Chien Wei Kelvin v Public Prosecutor </span>[1998] 3 SLR(R) 619 (“<span class="font-italic">Kelvin Chai</span>”) at [76]):</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) the person abetting must engage, with one or more other persons in a conspiracy; </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) the conspiracy must be for the doing of the thing abetted; and </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) an act or illegal omission must take place in pursuance of the conspiracy in order to the doing of that thing.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">Unlike criminal conspiracy, abetment by conspiracy requires some further act to be done pursuant to the conspiracy. There is, however, no need for the actual offence to be committed: <span class="font-italic">Chua Kian Kok v Public Prosecutor </span>[1999] 1 SLR(R) 826 (“<span class="font-italic">Chua Kian Kok</span>”) at [51].<span class="font-italic"> </span>I note that the definition of the elements set out in <span class="font-italic">Chua Kian Kok </span>at [48] differed slightly from that in <span class="font-italic">Kelvin Chai, </span>but I did not consider the differences material. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">21 As regards the element of conspiracy, what must be shown is agreement between the parties: <span class="font-italic">Chua Kian Kok </span>at [48], citing <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v Yeo Choon Poh </span>[1993] 3 SLR(R) 302 at [19]–[20]. As noted in various cases, direct evidence of the existence of a conspiracy will rarely be available. Usually, what evidence there is would be used to show that the words and actions of the parties indicate their concert in the pursuit of a common object or design, giving rise to the inference that their actions must have been co-ordinated by arrangement beforehand: see <span class="font-italic">Chua Kian Kok </span>at [48]; <span class="font-italic">Kelvin Chai </span>at [77], citing <span class="font-italic">Lai Kam Loy v Public Prosecutor </span>[1993] 3 SLR(R) 143 at [31].</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The issue to be determined</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">22 Here, the illegal act in question (see [20(c)] above) was that controlled drugs were imported as a result of the conspiracy. No issue was taken with the framing of this element by the accused persons: Mutaleb did not dispute that Zaini and Noor had indeed brought drugs into Singapore in contravention of s 7 of the MDA and were arrested for it. No significant issue also arose as to the common intention to commit importation as between Zaini and Noor.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">23 What was, however, in issue was whether Mutaleb had knowledge of and participated in a conspiracy with Zaini, Noor, Apoi and others to have the drugs imported into Singapore.

The Prosecution sought to make out a conspiracy based on Zaini’s evidence, the telephone records and text messages and other circumstantial evidence. For his part, Mutaleb denied that he was to receive the drugs in that particular transaction, but accepted at least in a statement recorded under s 22 of the CPC (marked “P207”) that he had previously dealt in drugs.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 No authority was cited for the Defence’s proposition that the charge as framed would lead to any embarrassment in Mutaleb’s defence. What was necessary was that the charge contain all the essential ingredients of the alleged offence so as to give the accused person notice and a chance to defend himself: <span class="font-italic">Li Weiming v Public Prosecutor and other matters </span>[2013] 2 SLR 1227 at [32], citing <span class="font-italic">Assathamby s/o Karupiah v Public Prosecutor</span> [1998] 1 SLR(R) 1030 at [9]. I found that the framed charge put Mutaleb on notice that the crime that the Prosecution alleged he committed involved Zaini, Noor, Apoi and others. Either Mutaleb was involved in a conspiracy or he was not, such conspiracy being concerned with the importation into Singapore of drugs by Zaini and Noor. Any defence which raised a reasonable doubt that there was any conspiracy with either of them or with Apoi would successfully defeat the charge, even if nothing was shown that Mutaleb did not conspire with anyone else. It was not his defence that there was any conspiracy with anyone else to do anything: his defence was a straight denial. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 As for the Defence’s argument that the Prosecution did not lead evidence about others involved the conspiracy, I considered that the allegation in the charge was only that the conspiracy involving Mutaleb may encompass persons other than those specifically named. I would not see it as more than a matter that leaves open the possibility of others being involved, but which causes Mutaleb no prejudice. As provided for in s 123(5) of the CPC, the fact that the charge is made is equivalent to a statement that the Prosecution’s case fulfils every legal condition required by law to constitute the offence charged; the contents of the charge do not go further than that. In any event, the Prosecution submitted orally that there was the possible involvement of another person, namely one “Erry” who was apparently involved in the packing of the drugs in Zaini’s car, according to a further statement recorded from Zaini.

</div> This was not at all fatal: the charge against each of them was for importation with common intention.

Again, no authority was cited for the proposition that this difference between the charges raised a viable objection.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 I am buttressed in my conclusions here by the approach taken in Singapore generally in relation to abetment; namely, that an accessory’s liability is not derivative upon the principal’s, as codified in the Penal Code: see Yong Pung How CJ’s discussion in <span class="font-italic">Chua Kian Kok</span> at [51]–[62]. To this end, an accessory may be liable even if the principal offence is not committed (at [58]) and may be convicted of an offence different from the offence for which the principal was convicted (at [62]). It was therefore not critical to the Prosecution’s case against Mutaleb that the charge preferred against him was different from the charges against Zaini and Noor.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Zaini’s evidence against Mutaleb</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 A significant part of the evidence against Mutaleb came from Zaini.

</div> While this was not wholly consistent with Zaini’s account in his statements that Apoi’s mobile phone had been used, I could not conclude that any reasonable doubt had been raised such as to undermine the Prosecution’s case against Mutaleb. Its case rested on the contents of the exchange as described in Zaini’s statements. Mutaleb’s defence that no telephone call had been made as described and that he did not know anyone named Apoi did not undermine the Prosecution’s case on this score. Mutaleb’s account of this telephone call was also unconvincing, as will be elaborated upon below at [65].</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The recorded telephone conversations</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 After Zaini was arrested on 11 September 2015, CNB officers monitored his mobile phone for incoming calls and recorded calls between Zaini and Apoi. It was submitted by the Defence that Zaini’s evidence at trial was that he asked Apoi to meet him in these calls, and that Apoi ultimately did not do so.

Although there was no specific mention of drugs and no explanation of what “thirteen” referred to, this figure matched the number of bundles of drugs initially found in Zaini’s car. Mutaleb also understood, unprompted, that he was to pay $39,000 for these items. These factors implicated Mutaleb and pointed towards his being privy to a prior agreement to receive the drugs that Zaini had brought into Singapore. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Zaini’s ss 22 and 23 CPC statements and their admissibility</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 Zaini claimed under cross-examination that various statements recorded from him under ss 22 and 23 of the CPC were recorded after a CNB officer promised him a certificate of substantive assistance under s 33B(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the MDA if he “cooperate[d]”.

</div> any reference that might have been made by the CNB officers to the alternative sentencing regime would not have rendered these statements inadmissible.

Zaini’s allegations that he had been asked to “cooperate” did not affect the voluntariness of his statements, but rather raised the possibility that he had been incentivised to give evidence that would implicate Mutaleb in order to obtain a certificate of substantive assistance. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 To this end, the Defence submitted that the CNB officers’ requests that Zaini “cooperate” with them to avoid the death penalty placed pressure on him to identify Mutaleb as the intended recipient of the drugs. At trial, Zaini resiled from the account in his statements and gave evidence that he did not know whom the ultimate recipient of the drugs was to be. He claimed that he was supposed to wait for further instructions from Apoi; however, when Apoi did not appear in Singapore, Zaini informed the CNB that “Abang” was supposed to receive the drugs, and later identified “Abang” as Mutaleb, even though he knew that Mutaleb was not supposed to receive the drugs.

Section 258(5) of the CPC, as applied in this case, provided as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">When more persons than one are being tried jointly for the same offence, and a confession made by one of such persons affecting himself and some other of such persons is proved, the court may take into consideration the confession as against the other person as well as against the person who makes the confession.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 In considering the confession by a co-accused person being tried jointly, the assessment of the weight to be given to the statements against another co-accused person will need to take into account the various circumstances of the recording of the statement and the charge. Of relevance would be the statement-maker’s state of mind and the incentive he might have in giving evidence against the other co-accused person. Where it is alleged that the statement-maker had a motive to frame the co-accused person, this must be proved as a fact: <span class="font-italic">Norasharee bin Gous v Public Prosecutor and another appeal and another matter</span> [2017] 1 SLR 820 (“<span class="font-italic">Norasharee</span>”) at [59]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 No submissions were addressed specifically on the application of s 258(5), but I was satisfied that Zaini’s 19 and 21 September statements, which described the manner he imported the drugs into Singapore, constituted confessions within the meaning of s 258(7) of the CPC. As Mutaleb was charged with abetting Zaini and Noor in their commission of the offences of importation for which they were charged, s 258(5) of the CPC applied to the use of Zaini’s statements against him: <span class="font-italic">Ramesh a/l Perumal </span>at [61]–[62], approving the High Court’s decision in <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v Ramesh a/l Perumal and another</span> [2017] SGHC 290 at [46]–[48].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 Even considering the allusion that Zaini’s implication of Mutaleb was motivated the former’s desire to obtain a certificate of substantive assistance under s 33B(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the MDA, I was, in the end, satisfied that Zaini’s statements could be considered as against Mutaleb and given full weight. As recognised in <span class="font-italic">Norasharee </span>at [59], a statement-maker may well be truthful despite having an incentive to lie. Even if Zaini had an incentive to cooperate with the CNB, there was nothing that raised any concerns as to the truthfulness of his statements. This was not a cutthroat zero-sum situation where Zaini’s innocence would depend on Mutaleb’s guilt, nor did it appear that Zaini’s statements were made to downplay his own culpability. Furthermore, as will be addressed next, the internal consistency of Zaini’s statements was not undermined by his inconsistent testimony, especially given that they were corroborated by the objective evidence against Mutaleb.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Zaini’s credibility as a witness</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 The Defence argued in relation to Zaini’s recorded statements that Zaini’s credibility was doubtful, given that his evidence was riddled with inconsistencies and discrepancies as to the conversation that he overheard, his instructions upon entering Singapore and how Mutaleb was identified.

</div> The Defence concluded that Mutaleb only came to hear of Apoi after his arrest, given that he did not have Apoi’s number saved on his mobile phone and there were no records of communications made between Apoi’s and Mutaleb’s mobile phones.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 It did appear that Zaini’s evidence was inconsistent across the trial, and no real explanation was proffered by him for his changes. As argued by the Prosecution, the inference to be drawn was that Zaini desired, for whatever reason, to downplay his prior incrimination of Mutaleb.
                   <sup><button class="btn btn-link superscript-btn" data-target="#fn-4269c70c-c96f-46c2-9190-de3f9feadcb1" data-toggle="modal" type="button">45</button></sup>

</div> But Zaini’s inconsistencies did not ultimately undermine the aspect of the Prosecution’s case that Mutaleb knew Apoi and that a telephone call took place between them on 10 September 2015. The inconsistencies as to which mobile phone Apoi used to call Mutaleb were not critical, given the objective evidence showing that a telephone call had been made at the relevant time (see above at [37]). Furthermore, the fact that SSSgt Ika accepted the possibility that Mutaleb did not know Apoi was neither here nor there: in my view, SSSgt Ika was just trying to be fair about the extent of the evidence that he was presented with and the possible inferences that could be drawn. While Mutaleb denied knowing Apoi, this denial had to be weighed against the contrary position taken by Zaini, whose evidence was detailed and unshaken that Apoi and Mutaleb knew each other.

There was no explanation from Zaini as to why he would change his evidence from what was in his statements, nor was there any allegation that these statements were fabricated in any way. As noted above at [49], what Zaini raised was that he had given the statements in the hope of obtaining a certificate of substantive assistance under s 33B(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the MDA. This did not render the statements inadmissible, and it did not appear that his otherwise-admissible statements were rendered unreliable simply because of what was allegedly promised. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 The Defence also argued that there was support for Zaini’s final version of events, namely, that Apoi had not told him to deliver to the drugs to Mutaleb, that Mutaleb was not the intended recipient of the drugs, and that Mutaleb was only named as the recipient because Zaini was under pressure by the CNB to cooperate, particularly after Apoi did not show up in Singapore as intended. Two arguments were made:

In the end, this inquiry into Zaini’s motives was speculative and did not go towards the truthfulness or accuracy of his statements. What was more relevant was that Zaini’s identification of Mutaleb was borne out by their subsequent conversation that confirmed that an arrangement for the delivery of drugs existed between them, and the other evidence against Mutaleb which I will now discuss.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Other evidence implicating Mutaleb</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 Aside from Zaini’s evidence, there was other evidence incriminating Mutaleb as being aware of the conspiracy to import the drugs into Singapore. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Phone records showing Mutaleb’s knowledge of Zaini’s entry into Singapore</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 The Prosecution submitted that it was incriminating that Mutaleb knew that Zaini was coming into Singapore on 11 September 2015.

Zaini also understood this to be Mutaleb’s intention, and in his 21 September statement (excerpted above at [35]), he further recounted that Mutaleb had told Apoi over the telephone that he had earlier sent a message to Zaini to ask him not to come to Singapore. Apoi had responded to say that the delivery had to proceed as the drugs could not be returned.

It was unlikely that Mutaleb had decided, apropos of nothing, to warn Zaini not to enter Singapore, and later to have asked him to call just to highlight that security would be tight when he entered Singapore due to ongoing elections. Mutaleb was unable to specify or elaborate on how the elections would affect Zaini’s entry into Singapore. The most that could have been argued for was that Mutaleb had been concerned with the heightened security on that day, but such concerns would only have arisen if Zaini had something to hide from law enforcement. Indeed, the natural inference would have been that Zaini was intending to enter Singapore for an illegal purpose.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 Furthermore, the messages exchanged between Mutaleb and Zaini on the morning of 11 September 2015 were in themselves incriminating, as they corroborated (a) Zaini’s account that Apoi and Mutaleb had discussed the plan to deliver drugs the previous night and (b) Zaini’s understanding in his 19 and 21 September statements (see above at [34] and [35]) that the delivery was to take place at 7am or 8am, which would have required him to set out from Johor at around 4am or 5am:

Coincidences do happen, but the likelihood of a sum of close to $39,000 being in his possession for some reason other than payment for the drugs brought in by Zaini was low. Mutaleb was unable to proffer any real explanation for this correspondence, apart from emphasising that even though he had told Zaini that he was going to meet him and would be bringing $39,000 with him, he did not “really” have the $39,000 with him.

Mutaleb assumed that this was the $35,000 “for payment for the cosignment [<span class="font-italic">sic</span>]”. Mutaleb then proceeded to wait “a very long time” for Zaini’s call and became concerned as Zaini had “taken too long” to call. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Zaini eventually called Mutaleb to inform him that he was at “the casino at Marina Bay”. Mutaleb’s explanation of this call was consistent with the transcript excerpted above at [38] and Zaini’s account that the initial arrangement was to deliver fewer than 13 units of drugs:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… I asked him how many he had, and he replied 13. When I asked how many he had, I was referring to how many balls of heroin he had. When he said 13, I was shocked. I did not expect to receive so many balls.

The Defence submitted that this noncompliance with s 22(3)(<span class="font-italic">d</span>) of the CPC rendered P207 inadmissible. I did not find that Mutaleb’s failure to append a signature to P207 affected its admissibility. Section 22 of the CPC must be read subject to s 258, and the clear wording of s 258(1) of the CPC and Explanation 1 to s 258 indicates that questions of admissibility arise only where the voluntariness of the statement is affected, <span class="font-italic">eg</span>, where the making of a statement was obtained by way of a threat, inducement or promise. In this case, the omission of Mutaleb’s signature did not affect P207’s admissibility, and no ancillary hearing<span class="font-italic"> </span>was required.

Mutaleb’s knowledge that Zaini was involved in drug activities was also incriminating; while it would not be sufficient on its own to incriminate Mutaleb of the charge, it could be so incriminating when considered alongside other evidence.

First, the Defence’s position was based on Zaini’s change in evidence, which I did not accept as being true. There was thus no abandonment of the original purpose on the facts. But even if there was in actual fact such a change in plans, the conspiracy would have been revived when the delivery was made to Mutaleb. The Defence did contend that the drugs were delivered to Mutaleb only as a result of pressure or encouragement from the CNB, but that has been dealt with above and, in any event, raised a different issue from the abandonment of the conspiracy. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The irrelevance of Mutaleb’s reactions at the time of arrest</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">84 When Mutaleb saw CNB officers moving in on him, he dropped the bag containing the mock drugs.

In all, 14 bundles of drugs were found in Zaini’s car. But as noted from Zaini’s 21 September statement, Apoi had initially told Mutaleb that about 12 bundles of drugs would be delivered. As it was, the eventual arrangement was for Zaini to deliver 13 bundles to Mutaleb, and the CNB officers executing the mock delivery of the drugs handed over 11 bundles to Mutaleb, intending to hold back two bundles to delay the transaction and to facilitate Mutaleb’s arrest.

</div>
</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">86 In my view, these discrepancies were not ultimately material. This was not a situation in which Mutaleb rejected the delivery on the basis of the number of bundles he was to or did actually receive, nor would an additional bundle have made a difference as to whether the delivered drugs crossed the threshold for capital punishment. The vagueness on Apoi and Zaini’s part about the number of bundles of drugs to be delivered (14, as compared to 12) was perhaps surprising, as was Apoi’s apparent willingness to allow for payment for the drugs on an instalment basis, as implied by the recorded telephone calls between Zaini and Mutaleb (see above at [38] and [40]). But on the whole, I was convinced that the charge against Mutaleb, which related to a conspiracy to import 12 bundles of drugs, was made out. This figure matched the quantity that Apoi initially wanted Zaini to deliver to Mutaleb and also gave Mutaleb the benefit of the doubt by excluding the weight of the drugs in the two heaviest bundles.

</div> In the event, I did not allow the discharge as I understood that the difficulties they faced were not in relation to Zaini’s own defence, but in relation to Zaini’s evidence as to Mutaleb’s involvement in the alleged conspiracy. That did not to my mind go towards the question of the appropriateness of Zaini’s counsel continuing to act for him. I did stipulate that I would bear in mind the difficulties counsel faced and would consider this matter in the round. I also asked that counsel check in on Zaini’s instructions from time to time and emphasised that there would not be any finding that counsel for Zaini misled the court because of any such changes in his evidence.

</div>
</div> I found that the application by Zaini’s counsel to discharge themselves did not discredit Zaini’s evidence, especially as the actual reasons for their concerns could not be aired to me during the trial. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Evidence as to Mutaleb’s psychiatric condition </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">88 Counsel for Mutaleb considered adducing psychiatric evidence to show that Mutaleb was affected by withdrawal symptoms at the time of his arrest. In the event, that evidence was not put forward, although opportunities were given for this to be done. I could not in the absence of such evidence make any finding favourable to Mutaleb in this regard.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Conclusion on conviction</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">89 The inferences that I drew from the evidence were:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Mutaleb and Zaini were known to each other, both having stated in their statements that Zaini had previously delivered drugs to Mutaleb. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Zaini and Noor entered Singapore on 11 September 2015 with the intention of delivering at least 12 packets of drugs.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Mutaleb knew that Zaini was coming into Singapore for illegal purposes, as borne out by their text messages.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) When Zaini called Mutaleb on 11 September, Mutaleb broached the issue of the delivery, asking Zaini, unprompted, about how many bundles were to be delivered; Zaini replied “thirteen”, and Mutaleb confirmed that he would pay $39,000 in exchange. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) Mutaleb intended to meet Zaini at the Chai Chee car park even though neither party specified in their telephone call where their exact meeting location was to be. Mutaleb had $1,600 on his person when he arrived at the car park, and had $37,000 stored in bundles in a haversack and a pair of pants in his flat.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(f) The drug in question was diamorphine.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">From the above, the conclusion that followed was that Mutaleb was party to an agreement or arrangement for at least 12 bundles of drugs to be brought into Singapore to be transferred to him, in return for payment. The drugs were imported into Singapore pursuant to the conspiracy. The elements of the charge against him were thus fulfilled.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">90 The case against Mutaleb was certainly not without difficulties and shortcomings. There were aspects of the Prosecution’s case that were wanting: for instance, Zaini’s evidence against Mutaleb vacillated at trial, Mutaleb did not have in hand the agreed payment sum of $39,000 when he arrived at the car park, and there was some discrepancy as to the number of bundles to be delivered. There was also no direct evidence that a conspiracy to import drugs existed. In court, Zaini exonerated Mutaleb and retracted the parts in his statements that implicated Mutaleb. But on an overall assessment, none of these points were sufficient to raise any reasonable doubt, given the weight of the other evidence incriminating Mutaleb. The strength of the statements from Zaini, the telephone records and text messages, and Mutaleb’s own conduct were of much greater significance than the discrepancy about the number of bundles to be delivered and the looseness of the payment arrangements, which could perhaps be explained by other reasons, including the close relationships between those involved. Whatever these other reasons may be, they did not put in doubt what was incriminatory. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">91 For the reasons above, I was of the view that there was sufficient evidence to establish the Prosecution’s case beyond a reasonable doubt. The Prosecution had proven that Mutaleb had engaged in a conspiracy for Zaini and Noor to import drugs into Singapore and that Zaini and Noor brought at least 12 bundles of drugs into Singapore pursuant to the conspiracy. Accordingly, I convicted him of the charge under s 7 read with s 12 of the MDA.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Decision on sentence</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">92 The prescribed punishment under s 33(1) read with the Second Schedule of the MDA is death. The alternative sentencing regime in s 33B of the MDA did not apply: being a purchaser, Mutaleb was not merely concerned with the transportation of the drugs, and the Defence did not argue that he was a courier. In any event, no certificate of substantive assistance under s 33B(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) was granted, nor did any question that he was of unsound mind arise. I therefore imposed the mandatory sentence of death on him.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">93 For the foregoing reasons, the accused persons were convicted of the respective charges against them. A certificate of substantive assistance was granted to Zaini, who was sentenced to life imprisonment and 15 strokes of the cane. Noor’s sentencing has been adjourned, pending other matters. The mandatory sentence of death was passed in respect of Mutaleb, who has appealed against my decision.</div><div class="Judg-Sign text-left">Aedit Abdullah  <br/>Judge</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Lau Wing Yam, Kenny Yang and Soh Weiqi (Attorney-General’s Chambers) for the Prosecution;<br/>Lee Yoon Tet Luke (Luke Lee &amp; Co) and Sukdave Singh S/O Banta Singh (Winchester Law LLC) for first accused;<br/>Aw Wee Chong Nicholas (Clifford Law LLP) and Mahadevan Lukshumayeh (Lukshumayeh Law Corporation) for the second accused;<br/>Hassan Esa Almenoar (R Ramason &amp; Almenoar), Diana Foo (Tan Swee Swan &amp; Co) and Sheik Umar bin Mohamad Bagushair (Wong &amp; Leow LLC) for the third accused.</div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div><div class="Judg-Quote-List text-justify"> </div><div class="txt-body text-left"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
