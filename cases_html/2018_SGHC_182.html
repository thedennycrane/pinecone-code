font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Introduction</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">1 When a conservation building in a historic district in Singapore is renovated, all those involved in the renovation must comply with Conservation Guidelines issued by the Urban Redevelopment Authority (“URA”). The case before me arises from the renovation of a conserved shophouse in Chinatown which deviated substantially from these guidelines. Parts of the shophouse which were to be retained were demolished and rebuilt in a non-compliant way. Parts of the shophouse which were to be constructed in a certain way were constructed in a non-compliant way. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 The URA refused to waive these deviations. The owner of the shophouse was obliged to rectify the deviations. As a result, it incurred substantial costs and suffered a delay of more than three years in securing the Temporary Occupation Permit (“TOP”) for the shophouse. The owner now seeks compensation from the three parties involved in the renovation: the contractor, the architect, and the engineer. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">3 The owner’s case is that: (a) the architect failed to ensure that the drawings used for the renovation were consistent with each other; (b) the engineer failed to ensure that his structural drawings were consistent with the other drawings; and (c) the contractor failed to clarify with the architect the obvious inconsistencies between the drawings presented to it and instead proceeded to demolish architectural features and to rebuild them, doing both in a manner inconsistent with the drawings. The plaintiff also alleges that the architect and the engineer failed to detect the contractor’s deviations and failed to insist that the contractor rectify them in a timely manner.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">4 The main question before me is which one or more of these three parties, if any, is liable for the owner’s loss. A subsidiary question before me is whether the owner owes the contractor certain sums for work done. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">5 Having heard and considered the parties’ submissions, I now set out my decision. On the owner’s claim, I hold that: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The contractor, the architect, and the engineer are all liable to the owner in respect of the deviations to: (i) the second and third storey rear slabs; (ii) the rear roof slab; and (iii) the rear external staircase; </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The contractor and the architect, but not the engineer, are liable to the owner for the deviation at the rear boundary wall. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">The quantum of damages payable to the owner by these three parties will be assessed separately. That assessment will also deal with the apportionment of liability as between each of these three parties. As against the owner, however, the three parties are jointly and severally liable for the whole of the owner’s loss. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">6 On the contractor’s claim against the owner, I allow the claim in respect of variation works done to install an additional rainwater drop pipe. All of the contractor’s remaining claims against the owner are dismissed.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The factual background</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The shophouse </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">7 The conservation shophouse at the centre of this dispute is at 25 Boon Tat Street, Singapore 069622. It is located within the Historic District of Chinatown. The URA considers that district to be one in which the “strictest form of conservation is practised”.

</div> The colour-coding indicates whether a particular feature is: (a) an element of the existing structure to be retained, indicated in blue or cyan; (b) a proposed new element to be constructed, indicated in magenta or purple; or (c) an existing element to be demolished, indicated in yellow.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The deviations </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">20 The project breached the URA’s Conservation Guidelines in the manner in which four features of the shophouse were treated. These breaches also led to the URA refusing to give its approval to BCA issuing a TOP for the shophouse. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">21 The first of the four features is the rear slab on the roof of the shophouse. The rear roof slab was to be demolished and reconstructed. The original rear slab accommodated a drop in elevation from the front slab. As required by the conservation guidelines, the reconstructed rear roof slab was to retain this drop in elevation. Instead, the contractor reconstructed the rear roof slab flush with the front roof slab, <span class="font-italic">ie</span> without any drop in elevation. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">22 The second feature is the rear floor slabs on the second and third storey. The original rear floor slabs on the second and third storeys had a drop in elevation from the original front floor slab on the same storey. This drop in elevation was again to be retained. The contractor demolished these rear floor slabs and reconstructed them flush with the front floor slabs on each storey, <span class="font-italic">ie </span>without the drop in elevation. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">23 The third feature is the rear external staircase. The contractor built this staircase using a structure comprising thick columns and beams. The parties refer to this as the “‘H’ structure”. The “H” structure appeared in neither the written permission drawings nor the construction drawings. The URA rejected the “H” structure as being in breach of the Conservation Guidelines because it was “too heavy looking and [changed] the architectural character of the rear service block”.

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> As far as the claim is concerned, therefore, this judgment deals with both liability and quantum. As far as the counterclaim is concerned, this judgment deals only with liability.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 By a series of agreements, the contractor’s claim against the owner has been considerably narrowed. As a result, the substance of this action is now really about the counterclaim rather than the claim. I therefore begin with the counterclaim before turning to the claim. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The parties’ cases on the counterclaim</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 I shall set out in detail each party’s case on each deviation when I analyse that deviation. At this juncture I set out only the general thrust of each party’s case in order to crystallise the issues to be addressed. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 The owner’s case is that all three defendants to its counterclaim are – to varying extents – responsible for its loss. The contractor is liable because it failed to clarify inconsistencies in the drawings with the architect. Instead, the contractor blindly demolished what was not meant to be demolished; and, in rebuilding the features, it failed to rebuild them according to the drawings. The architect is liable because he was the professional overseeing the project but failed to ensure that his drawings and the engineer’s drawings were consistent with the drawings approved by the URA. Finally, the engineer is also liable because he failed to ensure that his structural drawings were consistent with the drawings approved by the URA. Moreover, both the architect and the engineer failed to detect the contractor’s deviations during their respective site inspections and failed to have the deviations rectified in a timely manner. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 The contractor, the architect and the engineer respond with mutual finger pointing. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 The contractor’s response is that it has no obligation to clarify divergences between the drawings, and that as long as it follows one of the various sets of drawings, it is not in breach of contract. In any event, the architect approved the demolition and rebuilding of the various features.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 The architect’s response is that he owed no duties to the owner because he is not in a contractual relationship with the owner. But even if he did owe a duty of care in tort to the owner, he says that he discharged that duty because detecting deviations such as those which occurred here is not within the scope of that duty. The cause of the owner’s loss and damage is the contractor’s failure to follow the approved drawings. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 The engineer’s response is that he owed no duty to the owner to ensure consistency between drawings or to detect deviations from the drawings such as those which occurred. Instead, it is the architect’s duty to ensure that the various sets of drawings are consistent with each other and that no deviations occur when the contractor carries out the works. That is because the architect is required by statute to be the professional overseeing a project such as this. Alternatively, the contractor should be held liable because he failed to comply with the drawings. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Issues to be determined on the counterclaim</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 The most significant legal feature of this case is that the owner has no contract with either the architect or with the engineer. The fundamental issue which is in controversy, therefore, is whether either the architect or the engineer owed a duty of care to the owner. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 I therefore summarise the issues which I have to decide on the counterclaim as follows: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Did the architect owe a duty of care to the owner?</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Did the engineer owe a duty of care to the owner?</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Were any of the four deviations identified above at [21]–[24] above caused by one or more of the following:</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(i) a breach of contract by the contractor; </div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(ii) a breach of any duty of care which the architect owed the owner; or</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(iii)  a breach of any duty of care which the engineer owed the owner?</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Preliminary issue: what were the exact duties owed?</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 Before I turn to analyse these issues, it is necessary to set out clearly the specific duties which the owner claims the architect and the engineer owed it.

Proximity may be established using various indicia, as identified by the High Court of Australia in <span class="font-italic">Sutherland Shire Council v Heyman</span> (1985) 60 ALR 1 (“<span class="font-italic">Sutherland Shire</span>”) at 55-56, and adopted in <span class="font-italic">Spandeck</span> at [78]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The requirement of proximity is directed to the relationship between the parties in so far as it is relevant to the allegedly negligent act or omission of the defendant and the loss or injury sustained by the plaintiff. It involves the notion of nearness or closeness and embraces physical proximity (in the sense of space and time) between the person or property of the plaintiff and the person or property of the defendant, circumstantial proximity such as an overriding relationship of employer and employee or of a professional man and his client and what may (perhaps loosely) be referred to as causal proximity in the sense of the closeness or directness of the causal connection or relationship between the particular act or course of conduct and the loss or injury sustained. It may reflect an assumption by one party of a responsibility to take care to avoid or prevent injury, loss or damage to the person or property of another or reliance by one party upon such care being taken by the other in circumstances where the other party knew or ought to have known of that reliance. Both the identity and the relative importance of the factors which are determinative of an issue of proximity are likely to vary in different categories of case… [emphases omitted]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 Although the test for a duty of care in <span class="font-italic">Spandeck</span> is universal, the indicia of proximity to be considered in the first stage are not universal. As the passage from <span class="font-italic">Sutherland Shire</span> quoted in <span class="font-italic">Spandeck</span> recognises, the indicia of proximity will vary, depending on the alleged tortfeasor’s negligent act or omission and depending on the type of loss or injury sustained by the plaintiff. The owner’s claim against the architect in this action involves an allegation of professional negligence causing pure economic loss. The key indicia for that class of case or that type of loss are the twin elements of an assumption of responsibility by the tortfeasor and reliance by the plaintiff of which the tortfeasor knew or ought to have known. Indeed, all of the parties have been content to argue proximity based on precisely these twin elements. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The owner’s arguments</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 The owner argues that the architect owes it a duty of care because there was both an assumption of responsibility and reliance.

I agree with the owner that the architect assumed responsibility to the owner for design failure and supervision failure, notwithstanding the overarching contractual framework for the project. I also find that it was reasonable for the owner to rely on the architect, and that the owner did so rely.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(1) The law</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">75 There are a number of authorities which have considered the issue of an architect’s duty of care and which are binding on me. In <span class="font-italic">RSP Architects Planners &amp; Engineers (formerly known as Raglan Squire &amp; Partners FE) v Management Corporation Strata Title Plan No 1075 and another</span> [1999] 2 SLR(R) 134 (“<span class="font-italic">RSP Architects</span>”), the question before the Court of Appeal was whether an architect who designed a condominium was liable in the tort of negligence to the condominium’s management corporation for the cost of rectifying the consequences of the architect’s design failure. As is typical in these cases, the architect had a contract only with the developer of the condominium but not with its management corporation.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">76 The Court of Appeal held (at [38]) that there was sufficient proximity between the architects and the management corporation for a duty of care to arise. The architects were aware that, in the normal course of events, the developers would apply to register a strata title plan for the condominium and that a management corporation would then come into existence. The architect assumed responsibility to the developer to be professionally competent, and the architect knew that the developer relied on the architect exercising reasonable care and skill. The management corporation was merely the successor in title of the developer with respect to the common property. The architect knew that the management corporation would depend on the architect’s care and skill in designing and supervising the construction of the common property. Further, the management corporation relied on the architect to get the design of the building right. There was therefore a sufficient degree of proximity in the relationship between the management corporation and the architect for the architect to owe a duty of care to the management corporation to avoid causing the loss sustained by the management corporation.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">77 I acknowledge that <span class="font-italic">RSP Architects</span> was decided well before <span class="font-italic">Spandeck</span>. But the adoption of the universal test in <span class="font-italic">Spandeck</span> does not mean the rejection of all case law before <span class="font-italic">Spandeck</span>, particularly case law which deals with the concept of proximity in the tort of negligence. Further, the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Spandeck</span> held that the universal test is to be applied incrementally: at [73]. This means that it is desirable at each stage of the test to refer to decided cases in analogous situations to see how the courts have reached their conclusions in terms of proximity or policy: at [73]. I am therefore entitled and indeed obliged to have regard to the decision of <span class="font-italic">RSP Architects</span> at the proximity stage of the <span class="font-italic">Spandeck</span> test. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">78 The case of <span class="font-italic">RSP Architects</span> is instructive for several reasons. First, <span class="font-italic">RSP Architects</span> shows that the focus of the court is not on the degrees of separation between architect and owner, but on the fact that the owner is known by the architect to be the entity who is ultimately to benefit from the architect’s professional skill. Thus, the fact that there are several degrees of separation between the architect and the owner in the present case is of no great consequence to the duty of care analysis because the architect here – like the architect in <span class="font-italic">RSP Architects</span> – must have known that his skills were being exercised for the ultimate benefit of the specific entity who is now suing him. Indeed, the relationship between the architect and the management corporation in <span class="font-italic">RSP Architects</span> can be said to be even more remote than the relationship between the architect and the owner in the present case. The owner in the present case existed from the outset. The management corporation in <span class="font-italic">RSP Architects</span> did not even exist as a legal person at the time the architects carried out the acts or omissions said to be negligent.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">79 The second reason <span class="font-italic">RSP Architects</span> is instructive is because it shows that the presence of a contract between the architect and one entity – in that case the developer and in the present case with NDAE – does not in itself prevent a duty of care from arising or otherwise exhaust the scope of the architect’s potential liability. This observation has been echoed in more recent case law. In <span class="font-italic">ACRES</span>, the Court of Appeal observed at [66] that the contractual arrangements of the parties, although an important consideration to be taken into account when deciding whether there is proximity, does not automatically exclude a duty of care. Instead, the true principle is “whether or not the parties structured their contracts intending thereby to exclude the imposition of a tortious duty of care”: <span class="font-italic">ACRES</span> at [71]. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(2) Assumption of responsibility </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">80 In this case, there is nothing in the contract between the owner and NGPL to suggest that those two parties intended, by entering into that contract, to exclude the architect’s potential personal liability to the owner in tort.

</div>
</div>
</div> Nor has the architect pointed to any evidence which suggests that, as between the architect and the owner, it contracted in that way so as to exclude the architect’s liability in tort. As for the contract between NGPL and NDAE, that was not even an express contract. There is virtually no scope for extending its legal consequences beyond those two parties. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">81 Conversely, the evidence that is before me does suggest that the architect stands in a sufficiently proximate relationship to the owner to give rise to a duty of care. As the owner points out, the architect is the only registered architect in the Nota group. Thus, whether one speaks of NGPL or NDAE as the entity which bore the immediate obligation to provide architectural services to the owner, the ultimate obligation fell upon the architect. He was the only person in either entity with the qualifications and skills necessary to supply the required architectural services.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">82 Similarly, the behaviour of the architect suggests that he assumed the responsibility of providing the architectural services. In the first place, the architect assumed the role of QP (Architectural) for the project. Although it is true that the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">ACRES</span> recognised (at [21]–[23]) that the presence of a statutory duty does not automatically give rise to a common law duty of care, it acknowledged that the former can “form the backdrop to and inform the existence” of the latter. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">83 In the present case, the statutory duty does inform the existence of a common law duty of care. By taking on the role of QP (Architectural), the architect became the person with the primary responsibility for ensuring that the project complied with the Conservation Guidelines. He became the individual whom the URA would hold responsible for any deviations. And, because successful completion of the project depended on obtaining the URA’s approval for TOP, he became the person to whom the owner was looking to secure that successful completion. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">84 It is true that there are several degrees of separation between the owner and the architect. NGPL served as a contractual intermediary between the owner and NDAE. NDAE in turn served as an intermediary between NGPL and the architect. But I do not make too much of this. The architect in his evidence acknowledged that whenever NGPL takes on a project that requires architectural services, it is NDAE who would provide those services.

</div> Indeed, there is also evidence that the staff of NGPL with an architectural background – but who were not themselves at that time registered architects – were accustomed to act under the direction of the architect. This occurred so much so that the URA believed that the staff of NGPL acted for the architect.

In both of those cases, a plaintiff who stood in a direct contractual relationship with an owner was arguing that other parties who were also in a contractual relationship with the owner owed – in addition to their contractual duties to the owner – a parallel duty of care to the plaintiff. The present case is different. Here, it is the owner who is arguing that a professional providing services to the owner’s project manager owes a duty of care to the owner personally. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">87 This is a material distinction. The person for whose benefit the services are provided, and to whom a duty of care might be said to arise, differs dramatically between these two categories of cases. In the first category, the third parties perform their services for the benefit of the owner, not for the benefit of the plaintiff asserting the duty of care. In the second category – which includes the present case and <span class="font-italic">RSP Architects</span> – the third party performs his services for the ultimate benefit of the owner. The duty of care in the present category of case follows the grain of the parties’ arrangements rather than going against it. Thus proximity is more easily found. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">88 I would also add that Lee Boon Pin and Declan Reilly of NGPL were only trainee architects, and thus could not be in a position to have provided the architectural services which the owner contracted with NGPL for in this case. Moreover, the evidence is that the architect had professional responsibility for supervising the work of Lee Boon Pin, who was then a trainee architect.

</div> however, is that this is the norm and the expectation in the construction industry. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">92 Although industry norms or expectations in themselves do not make law, I find that the drawings duty was within the scope of the architectural services which the architect assumed the responsibility of providing to the owner. This industry norm has arisen for a good reason. The architect is the QP overseeing the entire project. In a project involving a conservation building, he reports to both the key authorities: the URA and the BCA. He is best placed in terms of the skill and expertise of his profession to prepare, receive, and assess the various drawings, and ultimately to ensure that they are consistent with each other. Further, in a project involving Category 1 Works to a conservation building, a registered architect is the <span class="font-italic">only</span> person permitted to apply to the URA for written permission under the Planning Act.

</div> That is understandable as a registered architect is clearly better placed compared to an engineer to fulfil the objectives of the Conservation Guidelines by ensuring that the aesthetic features crucial for a conservation property are preserved. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(4) The supervision duty</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">93 As for the supervision duty, both the owner and the architect have heavily contested whether the duty is one of supervision, or of inspection; and further, if it is the former, whether it is a duty of continuous supervision, or of standing supervision. In my view, the architect does owe the supervision duty claimed by the owner. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">94 The architect relies on extracts from a leading textbook, John Powell <span class="font-italic">et al</span>, <span class="font-italic">Jackson &amp; Powell on Professional </span><span class="font-italic"> Liability </span>(Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 8th ed, 2017)<span class="font-italic"> </span>(“<span class="font-italic">Jackson &amp; Powell</span>”) and the Singapore Institute of Architect’s Conditions of Appointment and Mode of Payment (2002 Edition) (“SIA Conditions of Appointment”). Both these extracts are cited for the proposition that the architect typically bears only a duty of inspection, and not a duty of supervision.

</div>
</div> Further, <span class="font-italic">Jackson &amp; Powell </span>expresses the view that the distinction between “supervision” and “inspection” is an important one: supervision entails detailed and continuous direction, whereas inspections are expected to be limited in number, duration and frequency. Similarly, the SIA Conditions of Appointment indicate that constant or daily inspection is not part of the architect’s basic services, and the architect is required to inspect the works only at periodic intervals as the architect deems necessary. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">95 I do not accept that the architect owed only a duty of inspection. The architect’s reliance on <span class="font-italic">Jackson &amp; Powell</span> is misplaced. That extract addresses changes made to the architect’s contractual duties across various editions of Royal Institute of British Architects’ Conditions of Engagement for the Appointment of an Architect. That standard form has no application here. Similarly, as the owner has rightly pointed out, the architect was not appointed under the SIA Conditions of Appointment in the present case. Reliance on the contractual duties set out in that standard form contract too is misplaced.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">96 I instead accept the owner’s argument that the architect’s duty of care encompassed a duty of supervision. The owner has drawn my attention to the Court of Appeal’s decision in <span class="font-italic">Sim &amp; Associates v Tan Alfred</span> [1994] 1 SLR(R) 146 (“<span class="font-italic">Sim &amp; Associates</span>”). In that decision, the Court of Appeal considered it to be settled law that an architect in a building contract has a duty to supervise the building works to ensure that they are being carried out in conformity with the contractual specifications; and that in the absence of specific provision in the contract, such a duty will be implied in law: at [39]. Further, that case was also a case where the owner did not have a contract with the architect – the building contract the Court of Appeal referred to was the building contract between the owner and the contractor. The Court of Appeal’s decision therefore applies equally here.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">97 I do add, however, that in my view the supervision duty does not go so far as to oblige an architect to prevent all deviations before they occur. This is because I accept that the architect, in carrying out the supervision duty, does not have to be continuously present on site. An architect who complies with the supervision duty may nevertheless fail to prevent a deviation that occurs between the visits made to discharge the duty. That said, the supervision duty does entail in practical terms a duty to detect a gross deviation – in this case, either a fresh construction of a deviating new feature or a deviating reconstruction of a demolished feature – and to act promptly to get the deviation rectified in a timely manner so as not to jeopardise the completion date of the project. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(5) Reliance</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">98 Turning now to the issue of reliance, I also find that the owner did rely on the architect and did so reasonably. The owner had no expertise in dealing with construction projects, and in particular, construction projects involving conservation buildings such as the shophouse here. It was entirely reasonable for it to rely on the expertise that the architect had, and held himself out as having. Indeed, the architect himself recognises as much:

While it is true that contractual arrangements can serve as a policy consideration at the policy stage of the <span class="font-italic">S</span><span class="font-italic">pandeck</span> test, these arrangements can also be considered as an indicium at the proximity stage: <span class="font-italic">ACRES</span> at [66]. The Court of Appeal recognised that contractual arrangements could be relevant to both stages, and that it may in certain cases be appropriate to analyse the effect of these arrangements at the proximity stage: <span class="font-italic">ACRES</span> at [66]. This is such a case. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">104 The architect’s argument is essentially that the owner’s contractual arrangements set out a complete framework for liability of all of the professionals involved in the owner’s project, and thus there is no scope for the architect to be found to have assumed responsibility to the owner, nor for the owner reasonably to have relied on the architect. This is an argument that is best dealt with at the proximity stage. I have already done so above and concluded that there was nevertheless sufficient proximity between the architect and the owner for there to arise a duty of care owed by the former to the latter.

The engineer knew that his professional skill and expertise was being applied for the ultimate benefit of the owner even though his contract was with NDAE. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">114 The parties have, however, devoted lengthy submissions addressing me on proximity. I now go through them in detail to show how they do not disturb the applicability of the general principle I have just identified.

</div> He points to the fact that the architect was the QP for the URA and that the architect was also the QP for the BCA so far as the building plans were concerned. The engineer’s own role was only as QP for the <span class="font-italic">structural</span> plans submitted to the BCA. The engineer does not submit specifically that this argument is directed towards contesting assumption of responsibility as an indicia of proximity. But I infer from his lengthy submission that it is his case either that: (a) that he owes statutory duties alone, and therefore cannot owe a duty of care at common law; or (b) that the operation of the statutory framework excludes the possibility of a duty of care arising in tort. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">118 I agree with the owner that the engineer assumed responsibility to the owner for design and supervision. It bears repeating that a duty of care in tort at common law does not arise automatically out of a statutory duty on the engineer under either Act: <span class="font-italic">ACRES </span>at [22]. The statutory duty may, however, form part of the contextual backdrop or be a relevant factor pointing for or against a duty of care: <span class="font-italic">ACRES </span>at [22]. Here, I find that it is a factor pointing for a duty of care. I agree that the foremost purpose of the statutory duty of a QP (Structural) is to ensure the structural safety and integrity of the building works. But to achieve this purpose, the engineer needs to ensure that his drawings are consistent with those of the other professionals involved in the project – in this case, the architect – and also to ensure that any deviations from the drawings are identified and rectified in a timely manner. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">119 With regard to the drawings, the engineer himself acknowledges in his closing submissions that he owed a duty to incorporate the design intent of the architect in his structural drawings. Indeed, he recognises that the design in the written permission drawings – which are drawn up by the architect – is the dominant design, and that he should generally adopt the architect’s design in the written permission drawings.

</div> confirmed that this is industry practice. I reiterate that industry practice or norms are not by themselves determinative of an assumption of responsibility or a duty of care. But I do consider that this industry practice is a powerful factor in favour of a finding that the engineer owes a common law duty to ensure consistency between his drawings and the architect’s drawings. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">121 To my mind, this is a practice that supports and reinforces, and does not detract from, the purpose of the statutory duty of ensuring structural safety and integrity. It is conducive towards the structural safety and integrity of construction projects that the building professionals working on them coordinate their drawings to ensure that the contractors and builders who ultimately have to construct the building are not misled or confused by inconsistent plans and drawings. The engineer, as one of the professionals responsible for preparing one of these plans, has a key role to play in this endeavour. While it might be said that the engineer should not be liable for failing to ensure that his plans are consistent with the written permission drawings so long as no structural safety concerns are raised, I do not think that the engineer’s duty should be made dependent on something so fortuitous or arbitrary. No structural safety concerns may arise simply because the contractor, faced with inconsistent architectural drawings and structural drawings, opts for the latter. But he could well have chosen the former. The point is that the engineer has introduced a risk of there being a structural safety issue, and it cannot be that it is simply left to the contractor, whether consciously or fortuitously, to mitigate this risk. Nor can it be that the engineer should simply depend on the architect to check and discover the error, although the architect is also subject to this duty. I therefore find that the engineer did assume the drawings duty. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">122 Similarly, in respect of the supervision duty, the engineer declared to the BCA that he was the appointed site supervisor under s 10 of the Building Control Act and that he would be supervising the structural works.

</div> In that reading, the former Minister for National Development Mr S Dhanabalan said that “for minor building works it is not necessary to have a full-time supervisor for all the works”. The engineer submits that the value of the works in this case categorises them as minor building works. He also notes that in the declaration, he undertook to exercise only “immediate supervision of critical structural works as required in Section 7(1)(c) of the Building Control Act” and not the alternative of exercising “[f]ull-time supervision of structural works as required in Section 7(1)(b) of the Building Control Act”.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">123 I do not think these arguments are of much assistance to the engineer. The crux of the owner’s complaint on the supervision duty is not to do with a failure to supervise the demolition process or the reconstruction process, <span class="font-italic">ie</span> as a failure to prevent the deviations from being carried out. The crux of the complaint is that the engineer had a duty in carrying out his site inspections to detect deviations of the magnitude which occurred here. However one characterises the duty of the engineer – whether as a duty to supervise or to inspect – I am of the view that the engineer did indeed have a duty to detect gross deviations such as those which occurred here. This duty would be meaningless if gross deviations as the non-compliant demolition or reconstruction of an entire slab fell outside its scope. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">124 To round things off, I would also add that the owner is clearly within the class of individuals which the statutory duty was designed to protect. The engineer is engaged to provide his professional services for the project because the owner, not being a construction professional, and in particular, not being a structural engineer, requires professional assistance. The engineer takes it upon himself to provide that assistance by assuming the statutory duties of QP (Structural). That to my mind is another factor pointing towards the engineer bearing a duty of care in tort to the owner, unless there are countervailing factors that militate against this.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">125 I would also add, for the sake of completeness, that my view that the engineer has assumed the drawings duty and supervision duty is fortified by the fact that the engineer is not correct in saying that his statutory duties encompass <span class="font-italic">only</span> ensuring the structural safety and integrity of the project. The URA representative, Lee Yan Chang, testified in cross-examination that the reasons the URA rejected the deviations in this project were not “related to aesthetic nor structural integrity” but were instead “related to the conservation principle of maximum retention”.

</div> [emphasis added]. The engineer himself recognised this, as evidenced by his endorsement on the architectural drawings: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">As a qualified person, I agree with and endorse the alterations to the structure as shown on this plan and that they are generally in accordance with conservation principles and good engineering practice. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">127 The upshot of this is that the engineer’s duties, even as a structural engineer, were not confined to ensuring structural safety and integrity in the project. He also undertook that the structural alterations complied with the URA’s conservation principles. In my view, discharging these duties required ensuring that his drawings were consistent with the written permission drawings. It is the written permission drawings which were approved by the URA, the competent authority under the Planning Act, and the issuer of the Conservation Guidelines. Moreover, an engineer should detect deviations which have taken place so that they can be rectified in a timely fashion. This therefore reinforces my views set out above that the engineer did assume responsibility in respect of the drawings duty and the supervision duty to the owner.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">128 I now turn to address the engineer’s specific submissions to show why each is not a bar to his having assumed responsibility to the owner. It is first necessary to distinguish between the material which the engineer cites, which in essence is nothing more than mere statements of fact, and those on which he hints at a legal argument. The engineer makes several statements of fact. The engineer points out that it was the architect, and not the engineer, who was the QP for the written permission drawings submitted to the URA, and also the QP for the building plans submitted to BCA.

</div>
</div> His submission is that he therefore cannot be the QP for those drawings. There is nothing wrong with making mere statements of fact, but if the engineer means by this that he cannot have assumed responsibility for his own drawings, then that is a <span class="font-italic">non sequitur</span>. Another point which the engineer raises is that he cannot owe any duties of compliance with the URA’s Conservation Guidelines because he is not the QP making submissions to the URA.

</div> But the owner is not pursuing this point against the engineer, so it is not necessary to consider this argument any further. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">129 Turning now to material on which the engineer appears to make a legal argument, the engineer points to the architect’s declarations to the URA and the BCA. He says that the upshot of these declarations is that it is the architect who assumed responsibility for reviewing the design in the structural drawings to ensure consistency with the written permission drawings.

</div>
</div> But even if the engineer is right on this, that does not automatically exclude a separate and parallel assumption of responsibility by the engineer to ensure that his own drawings – for which he undoubtedly assumed responsibility – are consistent with the architect’s written permission drawings. This argument simply means that the architect has his own duty to review drawings. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">130 The engineer next turns to his own duties. He acknowledges that he is the QP responsible for submitting structural drawings to the BCA and points out that the BCA approved these drawings. He says that the only conditions which the BCA imposed on the approval granted had to do with the safety and structural integrity of the building.

</div> Thus, he says, his duties are confined to ensuring that the works are structurally safe. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">131 This must be correct so far as his statutory duties are concerned. But, as I have already observed above, the engineer also concedes that he has a duty to incorporate the architect’s design intent into his structural drawings. I have found above that this duty, as supported by the industry practice, does include the drawings duty. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">132 The engineer makes a further point on this. He argues that the duty to incorporate the architect’s design intent is not immutable and rigid, because it is possible to apply to the URA for approval of an amended design or waiver of deviation from the approved design.

The fact that the structural drawings are inconsistent with the written permission drawings is a<span class="font-italic"> prima facie</span> breach which is capable of then being cured by the approval of amended structural drawings which are consistent with the written permission drawings, just as a deviation from the approved design may be a<span class="font-italic"> prima facie</span> breach that is treated as cured if waived by the URA.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">139 It is apparent to me that the engineer gave thought to the structural drawings and assumed responsibility for them in the form in which they were submitted. It is of no assistance to him that he thought his drawings were only a preliminary drawing or a “draft” and that he could revisit or revise his drawings later. By encrypting his drawings and submitting them, he assumed professional responsibility for those drawings. His assumption of responsibility was tied to those <span class="font-italic">drawings</span>, not simply to that specific <span class="font-italic">submission</span> of those drawings. Nothing material in his drawings changed from the first submission which the engineer personally encrypted and the subsequent submissions which he did not. The engineer also knew full well that his drawings were being reused in subsequent submissions even if he did not personally encrypt them for each of those subsequent submissions. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">140 In these circumstances, I find that the lack of personal encryption by the engineer does not allow him to disclaim any assumption of responsibility for his drawings whatsoever. It may be that the engineer cannot be held responsible under the relevant statute for the contents of the later structural drawings on the basis that he did not add his personal encryption to them before submission. But that is not the question before me. Insofar as the tort of negligence is concerned, and on the facts before me, the lack of encryption does not negate the assumption of responsibility. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">141 Under the third broad area of contention, the engineer argues that the owner’s conscious and deliberate allocation of risk within the contractual framework between the parties militates against the engineer owing a duty of care to the owner. He also submits that this is a consideration to be accounted for at the policy stage of the <span class="font-italic">Spandeck</span> test. For the same reasons I have given in my analysis of proximity in relation to the architect, I consider this to be an argument which goes largely towards proximity and not policy. I therefore consider this argument now, at the proximity stage. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">142 The engineer makes three points. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">143 First, he submits that the owner contracted with the contractor on the Singapore Institute of Architects Articles and Conditions of Building Contract – Lump Sum Contract 9th Edition (“SIA Building Contract”). It is part of the structure of that contract that the contractor takes instructions from the architect rather than from the engineer. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">144 Second, the engineer relies on the fact that the owner did not enter into a contractual relationship with him. Instead, the owner entered into contracts only with the contractor and with NGPL. Further, it was NGPL who in turn engaged NDAE and NDAE who then engaged the engineer’s services. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">145 Finally, the engineer submits that the need for distributive justice militates against the engineer owing a duty of care to the owner. To support this submission, the engineer cites the Court of Appeal’s decision in <span class="font-italic">Tan Juay Pah v Kimly Construction Pte Ltd </span><span class="font-italic">and others </span>[2012] 2 SLR 549. The engineer submits that participants in the construction industry are in the business of managing commercial risk through contracts and the imposition of a duty of care in tort risks undermining the private, consensual and bargained-for allocation of risk, and therefore the framework of distributive justice. The engineer points to his small fee of $5,000 or 1% of the contract sum,

</div>
</div> The owner points to the fact that its relationship with the engineer was under a single and linear chain of three contracts and that the engineer knew that his services were engaged for the owner’s ultimate benefit. On this point, the owner also notes that is not unusual in the construction industry for the owner to hire a project consultant who in turn hires the professionals. The owner’s second point is that the policy considerations pointing towards a duty of care resting on a QP (Structural) outweigh the engineer’s policy argument on distributive justice. Even accepting that the engineer’s fee under the contract was small and his scope of work limited, the engineer was aware that the owner relied on him to exercise reasonable care in rendering his professional advice and services. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">147 To my mind, the owner’s contractual arrangements do not militate against a duty of care. The engineer’s point that the contractual arrangement between the owner and the contractor did not permit the engineer to direct the contractor does not really assist engineer. The owner’s complaints centre on the lack of consistency between the engineer’s and the architect’s drawings and on the professionals’ failure to supervise. The owner’s complaint does not centre on whether the contractor demolished or rebuilt the features under the architect’s or the engineer’s direction. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">148 Further, the engineer is right in saying that there were several degrees of separation between him and the owner: there is one degree of separation between the owner and NGPL, another degree of separation between NGPL and NDAE, and a final degree of separation between NDAE and the engineer. But the fact of these degrees of separation is not itself enough to exclude a duty of care in tort from arising because the evidence does not suggest that these arrangements were deliberately made to exclude such a duty.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">149 As regards the degree of separation between NGPL and NDAE, the engineer’s argument is that he did not know of this relationship when he agreed to take on this engagement.

</div>
</div>
</div> So for the purposes of this case, that degree of separation cannot be considered to be a deliberate structuring of the contractual relationships to exclude a duty of care in tort arising. In fact, the engineer would have thought that there was only one intermediary between himself and the owner, <span class="font-italic">ie </span>NDAE. Moreover, the engineer would have seen NDAE as being owner’s project consultants. The hurdle that NDAE presents as an intermediary between the owner and the engineer can then be overcome by the engineer’s own admission that it is not unusual in the construction industry for an owner to hire a project consultant, who then hires the professionals.

</div>
</div>
</div> The project consultant can then be thought of as the owner’s representative, and a duty owed to the project consultant can thus be thought of as being owed to the owner, as the engineer must have known that his services are performed for the owner’s ultimate benefit, regardless of whether it is the owner who contracts directly with the engineer or whether it is the owner’s representative, the project consultant, who contracts with the engineer. This therefore narrows that degree of separation between the owner and NDAE. Thus, the contractual arrangements, viewed holistically, and bearing in mind that the engineer must have known that his services were being performed for the ultimate benefit of the owner, do not suggest that they were structured to exclude a duty of care. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">150 As for the point on distributive justice, I am not persuaded that it is an accurate depiction of the allocation of risk and liability between the parties to say that the engineer bears responsibility for his work only insofar as it affects safety and structural integrity. As indicated above, the engineer by taking on the duties of QP (Structural) took on more than simply that narrow duty. More specifically, the engineer did assume responsibility to comply with the conservation principles. So it does not appear to me that the scope of the engineer’s responsibility is as narrowly confined as the engineer makes it out to be. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">151 I make a final point on the supervision duty. The supervision duty does not require the engineer to be on site at all times. The duty cannot therefore require the engineer to take pre-emptive action to prevent deviations from the written permission drawings before the deviations take place. What the supervision duty requires of the engineer in practical terms instead is to carry out inspections with reasonable frequency and with reasonable care. If such an inspection would have revealed the existence of deviations from the written permission drawings, he would be expected to draw the architect’s attention to the deviation and the need for rectification. A deviation in this sense includes a feature which should not have been demolished, a feature which has been constructed but which should not be there at all and a feature which has not been reinstated correctly. The supervision duty thus framed takes account of the contractual power granted to the architect under cl 1.(1) of the SIA Building Contract to order the contractor to rectify works, a power which the engineer does not have. The engineer’s supervision duty is therefore slightly narrowed in this regard.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Stage 2: Policy considerations</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">152 The engineer submits that the statutory regime militates against the engineer owing a duty of care to the owner. This is because the engineer’s status was only the QP (Structural), with responsibility for making submissions only to the BCA under the Building Control Act and not to the URA. The focus of the BCA and the Building Control Act is only structural safety. Conversely, the URA’s role arises under the Planning Act and is focused on aesthetics. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">153 The owner’s response is that the engineer’s duties are not so narrowly confined. The engineer also owed a duty to comply with the Conservation Guidelines. Further, the owner submits that even if the engineer’s duty is only to ensure structural safety and integrity, that duty nevertheless required the engineer to ensure that the structural aspects of the works complied with the authorities’ requirements. That included ensuring that the engineer’s structural drawings were consistent with the written permission drawings.

An instruction is given orally if it is given by means of speech rather than in writing. A written instruction is not an oral instruction but is a verbal instruction if it is given in words.

</div> that the owner’s approach in its submissions does not assert any liability on the part of the architect for this deviation. The architect relies on this as the owner conceding that the contractor alone is responsible for this deviation and as absolving the architect of liability for it.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">186 I hold that the architect is liable for breaching both his drawings duty and his supervision duty in relation to the demolition of the rear roof slab. I do not perceive the owner’s failure to pursue arguments against the architect in his written submissions as an abandonment of the owner’s pleaded case that the architect is liable for this breach. Indeed, I take the view that the analysis of the deviation in respect of the rear roof slab is virtually identical to the analysis of the deviations in respect of the second and third storey rear slabs, which I consider below. If the architect is liable for one, he must also liable for the other. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">187 So far as the drawings duty is concerned, the evidence before me is that there is a divergence between the structural drawings on the one hand, and the written permission drawings and the construction drawings on the other. The drawings duty requires the architect to ensure consistency between the drawings. This he has failed to do. He has therefore breached his drawings duty. I do not consider this, however, to be a significant breach in that the inconsistencies he failed to identify did not indicate that the slab was to be demolished. And, in any event, all three drawings show that the drop in elevation between the front and the rear slab was to be retained. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">188 Similarly, as far as the supervision duty is concerned, there has been a failure to identify the deviations and have them rectified in a timely manner. I accept that the 13 July 2011 Minutes do not record the architect as being present at that meeting. I therefore accept that he did not learn of the demolition at the same time as the engineer or the owner. But I nevertheless repeat my observations earlier that although it was not incumbent on the architect to prevent the deviations from occurring – as it was not his duty to visit the site frequently enough to do so – for this case at least, he should have noticed that the rear roof slab had been reconstructed in a way that deviated from the written permission drawings, and have the deviation either rectified or waived prior to the project completion date.   </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The engineer</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">189 I now come to consider the engineer’s liability.

The owner did, however, cite breaches of the supervision duty because of the failure to detect the deviations in a timely manner.

I appreciate that the engineer does not have the power under the SIA Building Contract to order the contractor to rectify the deviation. But he could and reasonably should have detected this deviation and drawn the architect’s attention to it and the need for it to be rectified.

In addition, I find that there is nothing in the written permission drawings to indicate in any way that the existing drop in elevation is to be eliminated structurally. Although there are magenta or purple lines in the written permission drawing to indicate that the height of the rear section of the second and third storeys should be raised to the same level as the rest of those storeys, this is to do with the level of the floor to be laid over these rear slabs and not with any change in the slabs themselves as structural elements.

The contractor had no contractual power to decide unilaterally to follow one set of drawings and ignore the other. Indeed, Article 7 of the SIA Building Contract expressly provides that the “Contract Documents shall be read and construed as a whole, and no special priority other than that accorded by law shall apply to any one document or group of documents”.

I will, however, set out my observations on other arguments as parties devoted lengthy submissions to them. I first deal with the contractor’s contention that it had only the tender drawings and never received the written permission drawings. Even if this were true, the contractor’s own list of tender drawings includes architectural drawings “80085_A_100_FP01” and “80085_A_100_FP02”.

</div> So the contractor would have been contractually obliged to comply with the <span class="font-italic">content</span> of the written permission drawings in any event, which content indicates that there should not be demolition of the slabs. Indeed, it bears noting that the contractor has also relied on the finished floor levels indicated in these architectural drawings as justification for the deviations.

</div> This argument therefore does not assist the contractor. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">210 I turn now to the contractor’s arguments concerning the demolition of the steps and the finished floor levels. In my view, neither of these arguments assist the contractor. The fact that the finished floor level at the rear portion of the building is flush with the front portion does not mean that the rear <span class="font-italic">slabs</span> must be demolished and reconstructed flush. Instead, it is consistent with a new deck being placed on top of the rear slab, with the finished floor level at the front and rear rendered flush by the construction of the deck rather than by the demolition and reconstruction of a structural element. Indeed, this much was conceded by Lau Teck Hwa in cross-examination.

</div>
</div> This in turn explains why the indications that the steps were to be removed do not necessarily require the demolition of the rear slab. The steps that led down from the front slab to the rear slab would not be necessary once a deck made the finished floor level of the rear flush with the front. The removal of the steps does not mean that the rear slab must be demolished and reconstructed flush.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">211 In any event, I also agree with the owner’s arguments that the contractor has taken a selective view of the drawings and ignored clear indications that the slabs were not to be demolished and reconstructed. Even if it were true that the contractor did not have the written permission drawings in colour at the time it demolished the slabs, it did have black and white construction drawings at that time.

But in my view the supervision duty does require him to have detected the demolition once it occurred, and to raise it with the contractor and require rectification, or to obtain a waiver of the deviations from the URA before the project completion date. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">219 Further I do not think the argument as to the contractor’s method of working assists the architect in any way. I do not consider demolition of entire parts of the building to be merely a “method of working”. A method of working, as the name suggests, is the process by which the contractor achieves the intended outcome of a construction project. At any rate, it must refer to a process that does not contravene the project intent. So any act which breaches that intent, as shown in the project documents, cannot be characterised as merely a “method of working”. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The engineer</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">220 I now consider the engineer’s liability. The owner argues that the engineer breached both the drawings duty and the supervision duty. The drawings duty was breached when the structural drawings did not conform to the written permission drawings, as the former indicated that new concrete slabs would be added on top of the existing rear slabs, instead of a lightweight material as indicated in the latter. The supervision duty was breached when the engineer failed to prevent the demolition of the slabs and when he failed to ensure that the original drops in elevation were retained when the slabs were reconstructed. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">221 The engineer argues that his drawings duty was discharged once he had submitted the structural drawings to the architect and received no instructions from the architect to change the design.

</div> Demolition works are not critical structural works. There was thus no breach of the supervision duty.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">223 I hold that the engineer is liable for breaches of both the drawings duty and the supervision duty. The drawings duty requires the engineer’s structural drawings to conform to the written permission drawings, so far as structural defects and irregularities are not contemplated within the latter. In that event, the engineer’s duty is to draw the architect’s attention to them. There is no allegation here that the written permission drawings contained any structural defect or irregularity which required the structural drawings to depart from the written permission drawings in respect of these particular features. This being the case, the engineer is liable is liable for breaching his drawings duty. I add also that this must be the right result, because accepting the engineer’s argument effectively makes the architect the insurer of the engineer’s design obligations, which cannot be right. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">224 As for the supervision duty, I take the view that this duty was also breached. I do not think that the supervision duty is as narrow in scope as the engineer submits. A duty of care in tort does not necessarily mirror the statutory duties to which the engineer is subject. As I observed above, the duty of care that the engineer owes in this case is wider than the scope of his statutory duties. I take the view that the supervision duty in this case also extends to the detection of deviations from the written permission drawings as occurred here. The engineer’s failure to detect the deviations is therefore a breach of the supervision duty. The engineer, just like the architect, was not required to be on site at all times and owed no duty to prevent the demolition works from being carried out. But he should have noticed that these features had been demolished and should have drawn the architect’s attention to them. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">225 But should I be wrong on this, I would also add that there has been a breach of the supervision duty even on the engineer’s preferred interpretation. The engineer has cited s 7(1)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the Building Control Act as authority for what is comprised in critical structural works. That provision indicates that “concreting” <span class="font-italic">is</span> critical structural work. The reconstruction of the demolished slabs would have involved concreting. The failure of supervision lies in the failure to ensure that the slabs, upon reconstruction, would be at the height specified in the written permission drawings, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, with a drop in elevation. This would hence be a breach of the supervision duty in any event. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">226 In summary, in relation to this deviation, I hold that the contractor is in breach of contract and that the architect and the engineer both breached their duties of care in tort.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Feature 3: the rear external staircase</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">227 I come now to the third feature in respect of which a deviation from the approved plans – the written permission drawings – occurred. This involves the construction of a rear external staircase towards the back of the building using an “H” structure comprising thick columns and beams. The URA indicated that this structure was non-compliant because it (a) did not end at the original roof level of the rear service block; and (b) the beams and columns “[were] too heavy looking and change[d] the architectural character of the rear service block”.

The owner has submitted that the true issue concerning the rear external staircase is the use of the “H” structure, as the deviation in respect of the staircase failing to meet the original roof level of the rear service block is merely a consequence that flows from the deviations in respect of the demolition and reconstruction of the rear roof slab at a new, raised height.

</div>
</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">240 I first deal with a preliminary point raised by the engineer: that he owed no duty to ensure that his design was compliant with the Conservation Guidelines, but only a statutory duty to ensure structural safety and integrity of the project. This, strictly speaking, belongs under the duty of care analysis, and I have already found that the engineer’s duty was not confined to the statutory duty. It goes beyond that to include, in this case, the drawings duty and the supervision duty. The engineer’s argument that the “H” structure is a mere aesthetic feature therefore is neither here nor there. Indeed, I am not sure how this submission that it is a mere aesthetic feature can even be correct when this feature appeared only in the structural drawings prepared by the engineer. One would expect the engineer to introduce structural features and the architect to introduce aesthetic features.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">241 I turn now to the substantive arguments on the “H” structure. The engineer is correct that the architect has a duty to review drawings sent to him. But he is wrong that this duty means that the engineer is given a free hand to ignore the written permission drawings and design whatever he wishes, safe in the knowledge that the architect will catch his errors. The architect is not the insurer of the engineer’s mistakes. Nor is the engineer absolved of a breach simply because he sends his structural drawings to the architect and the architect fails to notice the breach. In that scenario, as here, both parties are liable. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">242 The simple fact of the matter is that the engineer’s drawings duty included ensuring that his structural drawings conformed to the written permission drawings save as required by his own discipline. He has breached that duty here. I therefore find that he has breached his drawings duty. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">243 I also hold that the engineer breached his supervision duty. The engineer owes this duty not only in respect of detecting deviations that might affect the building’s structural integrity and safety. The engineer’s duty of care is not confined only to the strict confines of his statutory duty. What this means is that the engineer should have detected deviations from the approved plans, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the written permission drawings, and brought them to the attention of the architect to ask that they be rectified in a timely fashion. This duty is not discharged by merely sending structural drawings to the architect, contrary to the engineer’s submissions.

</div> Even if that can be said to be notification, it addresses only deviation in <span class="font-italic">design</span>.

It appears to me wrong in principle to decide that issue without hearing specific submissions made by each defendant to the counterclaim in the light of my findings in this judgment, in light of the specific heads of loss claimed against that party. All of that can be done in the quantum phase of this action. I therefore deal now only with causation. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">258 I begin by considering the respective liabilities of the parties with respect to each individual feature, before setting out my views on the liabilities of the defendants collectively as against the owner.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Feature 1: rear roof slab</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">259 It is necessary to be clear about the loss to the owner by reason of this deviation. The immediate loss to the owner is the cost of rectification. Rectification involves reinstating the drop in elevation between the front roof slab and the rear roof slab by demolishing the wrongly constructed rear roof slab and constructing a new rear roof slab reinstating the drop in elevation indicated in the written permission drawings. The loss to the owner also includes the delay in obtaining TOP. It does not, however, include the demolition of the original slab as that did not have to be rectified. What had to be rectified was the reconstructed rear roof slab that was built flush. Indeed, it appears that the elimination of the drop in elevation between the front roof slab and the rear roof slab was the key cause for the URA refusing to approve the TOP. The evidence before me suggests that the URA was prepared to accept reconstruction of the  rear roof slab if it had been necessary for safety, <span class="font-italic">ie</span> to accommodate additional loading.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">260 Having defined the scope of the owner’s loss on this aspect of its case, I now consider each party’s liability. I consider that the contractor caused this loss. It constructed the slab flush despite the written permission drawings and the construction drawings indicating a drop in elevation. The contractor should have given notice to the architect of the divergence between the structural drawings and the written permission drawings. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">261 I consider that the architect and the engineer also caused this loss. The architect and engineer breached their respective drawings duties in failing to ensure consistency between the drawings. That said, this was not as potent a cause given that the divergence was not large. The finished floor levels indicated in the structural drawings do indicate a drop in elevation, consistent with the written permission drawings and the construction drawings, even if other parts of the structural drawings suggest otherwise. This being the case, the structural drawings are inconsistent on its face and should have invited greater scrutiny from the contractor. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">262 The architect’s and engineer’s breaches of their supervision duties also resulted in the loss occasioned by the delay in obtaining TOP. Upon identifying that the slab had been wrongly reconstructed flush they did not instruct rectification of the deviation by having the slab removed and drop in elevation reinstated. Instead, they chose to seek a waiver of this deviation from the URA. They failed to obtain that waiver. I consider that this too is a cause of the owner’s loss. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">263 In summary, I find that the contract, the architect and the engineer have all contributed to the owner’s loss suffered in respect of the rear roof slab deviations.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Feature 2: the second and third storey rear slabs</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">264 In my judgment, the relevant loss arising from the deviations to this feature as are follows. First, there is the loss and damage involved in rectifying the deviation. This is the cost of demolishing the reconstructed slabs and reinstating the drop in elevation, as indicated in the written permission drawings. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">265 Second, so far as delay in obtaining TOP is concerned, the loss caused is the delay in carrying out the rectification works I have just described. This much is clear from the URA’s Direction of 12 December 2012, refusing permission for the deviation as the wrong material was used (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the reconstruction of the slabs using cement instead of a lightweight material as indicated in the written permission drawings).

So the owner’s only loss on this feature is the cost of rectification.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">276 I consider that the contractor and the architect have both caused this loss. The contractor is primarily responsible for the loss because nothing in the drawings indicated that the rear boundary wall should be constructed above one metre.

The Architect shall also have power at any time subsequently to sanction by way of direction a variation previously carried out by the Contractor without any authority, direction or instruction from the Architect. Such subsequent sanction shall not entitle the Contractor to additional payment or compensation or an extension of time, unless such variation was due to the negligence or omission or default on the part of the Architect or the Employer or was reasonably carried out in an emergency when it was not practicable to obtain the prior instructions of the Architect, but shall relieve the Contractor from liability to the Employer for departing from the contract requirements without authority, and may involve a reduction in the Contract Sum if any reduced value to the Employer or reduced cost to the Contractor, whichever is greater, is involved in the sanctioned variation.” </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">289 Clause 12.(1) does not, however, deal directly with the contractor’s right to be paid for variation work.

The critical distinction is between an architect’s direction and an architect’s instruction. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">290 Clause 1.(2) explains that a “direction” is an order of the architect, “compliance with which will not under the terms of the Contract entitle the Contractor to additional payment or compensation or to an increase in the Contract Sum, but which may in some cases result under the terms of the Contract in a reduction of the Contract Sum”. Conversely, an “instruction” means an order of the architect “compliance with which, while it may in some cases involve a reduction of the Contract Sum, will in principle entitle the Contractor in an appropriate case under the terms of the Contract to additional payment or compensation or to an increase in the Contract Sum”. The Contract Sum in this case is an amount of $1,129,700 (excluding GST).

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">291 Clause 1.(1) explains how directions and instructions are to be given: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">All orders of the Architect shall be expressed to be either directions or instructions, and shall be given in writing if requested by the Contractor. Any direction or instruction given verbally shall be deemed to have been given in writing, and have retrospective effect from the date of the verbal direction or instruction, provided that the Contractor confirms the direction or instruction in writing within 14 days of its being given, and the Architect does not within 14 days of receipt of the written confirmation dissent from or withdraw the direction or instruction... In addition the Architect may (but shall not be obliged to) at any time subsequently confirm in writing any direction or instruction previously given verbally by him, in which event the confirmation shall have retrospective effect as a written direction or instruction given at the time of the verbal direction or instruction. Verbal directions or instructions of the Architect Clerk-of-Works [sic], or written or other orders or requests not expressed to be directions or instructions, need not be complied with by the Contractor if the Architect fails or refuses to confirm the same in writing in properly expressed terms with the minimum of delay when requested to do so, and no claim will be permitted under this contract based on an order or request of the Architect unless expressed as a written direction or instruction of confirmed in writing to or by the Architect under the terms of this Sub-Clause of the Conditions.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">292 The following can be discerned from cl 12.(1) of the contract:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The architect is empowered to give a direction or an instruction for a variation to the contract, in advance of work being done; </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) If the contractor proceeds to carry out a variation without a direction or instruction, he will have done so “without any authority, direction or instruction” from the architect. The contractor is then liable to the owner “for departing from the contract requirements without authority” unless the variation was necessitated by the negligence or default of the architect or the owner or was done in an emergency; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) A variation carried out by the contractor in situation (b) above may be subsequently sanctioned by an architect’s direction. This direction will not entitle the contractor to additional payment or compensation or an extension of time, but it will relieve him from the liability to the owner described in (b) above.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">293 It might then be said that there is no architect’s instruction or direction in writing, but that it was orally given. Clause 1.(1) then enters the picture. Clause 1.(1) certainly contemplates that oral directions may be given, but it also pertinently provides that “no claim will be permitted under this Contract based on an order or request of the Architect unless expressed as a written direction or instruction or confirmed in writing under the terms of this Sub-Clause of the Conditions.”</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">294 I now apply the above clauses to the facts of this case. The very fact that the Variation Orders are described as such is a clear indication that they are variations from the original contract. That being the case, the question is whether they were approved by the architect before they were carried out, or were subsequently sanctioned by the architect. It appears to me that these variations were carried out entirely without the architect’s approval. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">295 The summary of variation works is set out in a document prepared by the quantity surveyor (“QS”) for the project.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">296 The fact that the QS could find no architect’s instruction for these four items is not necessarily fatal to the contractor’s case. Clause 12.(1) of the contract provides that the architect is also empowered to sanction after the fact any variations carried out without authority. That said, there is no evidence before me that the architect gave any sanction for these variations after the fact. I further note that contractor in its reply submissions does not deny that the architect gave no instructions so far as Variation Orders No 8 and 9 are concerned, even after the owner raised this specific issue in its closing submissions. Further, insofar as the contractor might argue that there was in fact an oral direction or instruction given, cl 1.(1) is clear that a direction or instruction must be given in writing if the contractor wishes to pursue a claim on it. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">297 In light of the above, I am satisfied that the architect did not instruct these variations or approve them retrospectively. The scenario I described above at [292(b)] therefore applies. The contractor – far from being contractually entitled to compensation – is in fact in breach of contract by having carried out these variations. It is therefore unnecessary for me to go further to consider the arguments mounted by each party on the individual items concerned.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Item 7: Teflon membrane</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">298 A substantial item in dispute is the omission of a Teflon membrane.

Clause 12.(4) provides that “[variations] shall be valued as closely as possible on the basis of the Contractor’s prices without regard to any alleged element of high or low profitability in those prices”. The clause then sets out certain rules for valuing variations. The applicable rule is found at clause 12.(4)(f). That rule provides that in the case of omitted work, “an allowance for the increased cost or reduced profitability (if any) of the remaining work may … be made … against the prices for the remaining work, but not for loss of profit on the omitted work itself.” </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">300 I accept the owner’s submission that the amount specified in the BQ is the correct value to use here.

</div> That rule provides that “[work] ordered … shall be valued at the same prices as those in the Schedule of Rates”. To my mind, that provision applies when <span class="font-italic">additional</span> works are ordered. This means that the general rule – that variations are to be valued as closely as possible on the basis of the contractor’s prices – points to values actually specified in the BQ. That is, after all, the part of the contract in which the contractor indicates the value it ascribes to those works. The specific rule dealing with omissions found in cl 12.(4)(f) does not disturb this conclusion. That rule merely entitles the contractor to claim an allowance on the remaining works where a part of it is omitted, thereby affecting any applicable economies of scale. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">301 I am conscious that the evidence of the QS was that he would use the SOR rates even to value an omission.

</div> But he qualified that evidence by indicating that where there was a <span class="font-italic">wholesale</span> omission, then the BQ rates would be most accurate, because the BQ rates indicate the contractor’s pricing for that entire item.

</div> So this evidence does not assist the contractor. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">302 The contractor accused the QS of cherry-picking between the SOR and the BQ to favour the owner.  In respect of another omitted item, the QS valued the omission by using the rates in the SOR.

</div>
</div> In the case of that item, the value arrived at by referring to the SOR was higher than the value stated in the BQ. The QS’s approach valued the omission at a higher sum and was therefore to the owner’s benefit. I do not accept that the QS was cherry-picking his data. His evidence is that he adopted a different approach for this different item because the contractor offered to use the higher figure, as the difference between the two approaches was not large.

</div> It claims a sum of $1,383.18. The owner’s key contention is that the contractor is unable to substantiate that the work was indeed carried out. A sales order is not the same as receipt or an acknowledgement of payment by the supplier of the light fittings.
