<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       The Defendant, Cheong Ming Kiat (Zhang Minjie)
                    t/a Autohomme Automobiles, applied by way of Summons 21202/2009 (“the
                    Summons”) to set aside a judgment entered against him by the Plaintiff,
                    Tony Lee Ngiap Pheng, after a hearing some seven years ago on 30 January
                    2003. The Defendant also sought to have the action restored for trial. District
                    Judge Leslie Chew (the “DJ”) dismissed the Defendant’s
                    application and awarded the Plaintiff costs of $2,000 (inclusive of
                    disbursements). The Defendant appealed to the High Court against the DJ’s
                    decision. I dismissed the appeal with costs.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Background</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       In February 2001, the Defendant set up a
                    sole-proprietorship which dealt with the purchase and sale of second hand cars
                    (“the business”). The Plaintiff approached the Defendant and
                    suggested that they enter into a partnership. The Defendant agreed and the
                    Plaintiff was made an equal partner in April 2001.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       In the middle of 2001, the Plaintiff was
                    arrested on a drug related charge. As a result, his name had to be removed from
                    the partnership to prevent the licence granted to the business from being
                    revoked.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       According to the Defendant, the attack on the
                    World Trade Centre in New York in September 2001 affected the business
                    adversely. Matters were compounded when the Plaintiff had to serve time in
                    prison. It was therefore agreed that the Plaintiff would cease to be a partner
                    of the business as from 1 November 2001. However, the terms for the parting of
                    ways were disputed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       The Plaintiff contended that despite the
                    depressed market condition, the Defendant agreed to repay him the amount that he
                    had put into the business with interest at 6.5% per annum. Thus, he asserted
                    that he was entitled to a total of $133,482.02. In addition, the Plaintiff
                    claimed that the Defendant had made unauthorized withdrawals from the
                    partnership assets amounting to $215,170.53 over a period of seven months from
                    1 April 2001 to 30 October 2001. Accordingly, the Plaintiff argued
                    that he was entitled to half this amount which is $107,585.26. The Plaintiff
                    therefore claimed the sum of $241,067.28 (comprising $133,482.02 and
                    $107,585.26) (“the sum”) from the Defendant. As the Defendant
                    refused to pay the sum to the Plaintiff, the Plaintiff commenced this action on
                    2 February 2002.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       The Defendant’s version of events was
                    totally different. According to him, due to bad market conditions, the Plaintiff
                    and he agreed to end the partnership on the basis that the Plaintiff would forgo
                    his capital investment of slightly over $100,000.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       At the commencement of the trial on
                    30 January 2003 in a district court, the Defendant did not turn up but his
                    counsel (not the present solicitors) was present. His counsel informed the court
                    that he had no instructions to defend the case but was still on record as
                    counsel for the Defendant. He did not ask the Plaintiff and his three witnesses
                    any questions during cross-examination. The Defendant’s counsel also
                    offered no witness and no submissions at the conclusion of the Plaintiff’s
                    case. On the same day, the Plaintiff obtained judgment against the Defendant for
                    the sum with interest at 6% per annum from 5 February 2000 to the date of
                    judgment. The court also awarded costs of $13,000 plus reasonable disbursements
                    to the Plaintiff (“the 2003 judgment”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       The Plaintiff did not attempt to enforce the
                    2003 judgment. This was apparently because the Defendant was then in a poor
                    financial state. When the Defendant’s financial situation improved
                    markedly over the years, the Plaintiff took action in 2009 to execute the 2003
                    judgment. In response, the Defendant filed the Summons to set aside the 2003
                    judgment.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       On 25 March 2010, the Summons was heard. As
                    mentioned above, the DJ dismissed the Defendant’s
                application.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     On 1 April 2010, the Defendant filed
                    notice of appeal against the DJ’s decision and the appeal came up before
                    me for hearing.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The DJ’s decision</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     The DJ held that the action had not been
                    decided on its merits. He took the view that the 2003 judgment was given
                    pursuant to O 35 of the Rules of Court (Cap 322,
                    R 5, 2006 Rev Ed)(“the Rules”). However, he
                    noted that by virtue of O 35 r 2(2) of the Rules, an application
                    to set aside the judgment must be made within 14 days. In this case, the
                    application to set aside the 2003 judgment was made on 17 December 2009, almost
                    seven years after the 2003 judgment.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     The DJ stressed that the court’s
                    predominant concerns in setting aside a judgment entered in default under
                    O 35 of the Rules were the reasons for the defendant’s absence from
                    the trial and his delay in applying to set the judgment aside rather than the
                    merits of the case. The factors that he took into account included the issue of
                    prejudice to the other party and the prospects of success on the part of the
                    Defendant if a retrial was ordered. The DJ found that the Defendant had no good
                    and valid reasons to explain his absence from the trial in 2003 and his long
                    inaction in not applying to set aside the 2003 judgment. He therefore dismissed
                    the Defendant’s application to set aside the 2003 judgment.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The appeal</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     Order 35 r 1(2) of the Rules
                    provides:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_13-p2_2"></a>(2)     If, when the trial of an action is
                        called on, one party does not appear, the Judge may proceed with the trial
                        of the action or any counterclaim in the absence of that party, or may
                        without trial give judgment or dismiss the action, or make any other order
                        as he thinks fit.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">O 35 r 2 goes on to
                    state that:</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(1)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">Any judgment or order made under Rule 1 may be
                            set aside by the Court on the application of any party on such terms as
                            the Court thinks just.</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(2)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">Unless the Court otherwise orders, an application
                            under this Rule must be made within 14 days after the date of the
                            judgment or order.</div>
<p class="Judg-1">The words “Unless the Court otherwise orders” in O 35 r
                    2(2) were inserted on 1 January 2010. The Summons here was taken out in December
                    2009 but nothing turns on this as the said words were inserted for clarification
                    rather than to change the procedure under this rule.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     The Defendant contended that the 2003 judgment
                    had not been obtained on the merits of the case as he was not present at the
                    trial and his counsel did not take part in the proceedings. He asserted that
                    this was clear from the Notes of Evidence (“NE”) of the hearing
                    which indicated that his counsel did not cross-examine the Plaintiff and his
                    witnesses, who merely appeared in the witness box to confirm the truth of the
                    contents of their affidavits of evidence in chief
                (“AEIC”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     In contrast, the Plaintiff, who pointed out
                    that the Defendant’s counsel had made no attempt to explain to the court
                    why his client had absented himself from the trial, asserted that the NE clearly
                    showed that the trial judge did proceed with the trial and that the merits of
                    the case were considered. He pointed out that:</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(a)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">The Defendant’s counsel (not his present
                            solicitors) was present at trial;</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(b)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">The Defendant’s counsel informed the trial
                            judge that he had no instructions to defend the case;</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(c)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">The Defendant’s counsel informed the trial
                            judge that he wanted to cross-examine the Plaintiff’s witnesses as
                            he had not been discharged as Defence counsel;</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(d)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">The Plaintiff and his witnesses were called to
                            the witness stand and offered for cross-examination but no questions
                            were asked by the Defendant’s counsel.</div>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     In my view, the Plaintiff’s position is
                    the correct one. The trial judge did proceed with the trial in accordance with
                    O 35 r 1(2) of the Rules. After all, the truth of the contents of the AEICs
                    of the Plaintiff and his three witnesses was confirmed and the said AEICs were
                    admitted. The Defence counsel was also present and had the opportunity to
                    cross-examine the Plaintiff and his witnesses but chose not to do so despite his
                    earlier indications to the trial judge. In any event, whether or not the trial
                    proceeded makes no material difference to the outcome as any application to set
                    aside the judgment must still be made within 14 days after the date of the
                    judgment.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     In determining whether a judgment under
                    O 35 of the Rules should be set aside, the decision of the Court of Appeal
                    in <em>Su Sh-Hsyu v Wee Yue Che</em>
                    [2007] 3 SLR(R) 673 (“<em>Su
                        Sh-Hsyu</em>”) is instructive. In that case, the Court of
                    Appeal stressed at [41] that two broadly different categories of applications
                    involving the setting aside of judgments must be recognised. The first concerns
                    judgment given in default of appearance or pleadings or discovery and the second
                    concerns judgment given after a trial, albeit in the absence of the party who
                    later applies to set it aside. With regard to the second category, which is
                    applicable in the present case, the Court of Appeal explained at [44]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In contrast, where judgment has been entered after a trial in the
                        defendant’s absence, the predominant consideration in deciding whether
                        to set aside the judgment is the reason for the defendant’s absence.
                        In [<em>Shocked v Goldschmidt</em> [1998] 1 All ER 372], Legatt
                        LJ itemised (at 381) the other relevant factors that the court should take
                        into consideration:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(a)    prejudice - whether the successful party would
                        be prejudiced by the judgment being set aside, especially if the prejudice
                        was irremediable by an order of costs;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(b)    applicant's delay - whether there was any undue
                        delay by the absent party in applying to set aside the judgment, especially
                        if during the period of delay the successful party acted on the judgment, or
                        third parties acquired rights by reference to it;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(c)    whether complete retrial required - whether the
                        setting aside of a judgment would entail a complete retrial on matters of
                        fact which have already been investigated by the court;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(d)    prospects of success - whether the applicant
                        enjoyed a real prospect of success; and</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(e)    public interest - whether the public interest
                        in finality in litigation would be compromised.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">To these broad-ranging factors we would also add the overriding
                        consideration of whether there is a likelihood that a real miscarriage of
                        justice has occurred.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis in original]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">As for the predominant consideration, namely the reason for the
                    Defendant’s absence, in <em>Su Sh-Hsyu</em>, the
                    Court of Appeal stated at [48] that there could be wholly innocent defendants,
                    such as those who had been genuinely misled by a court official into thinking
                    that their attendance was unnecessary: see <em>Grimshaw v
                        Dunbar</em> [1953] 1 QB 408. However, in the case of
                    persons, such as the Defendant in this case, who deliberately decided not to
                    attend the trial, the Court of Appeal noted at [49] that the courts have
                    generally been unforgiving.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     In the present case, the Defendant said that
                    he was absent from the trial in 2003 because he was being “hounded by
                    creditors”, he “did not think that the trial would be
                    fruitful” without auditing the accounts and he “did not fully
                    appreciate the necessity for the trial attendance”. The Defendant claimed
                    that on hindsight, he realised that it was his mistake to absent himself from
                    the trial. Undoubtedly, these reasons were not valid to explain his deliberate
                    absence from the trial. A party cannot be allowed to absent himself from trial
                    simply because he is facing financial pressure or assumes that the trial would
                    not be fruitful. Moreover, being represented by a solicitor at the material
                    time, it was highly unlikely that the Defendant was unaware of the consequences
                    of his non-appearance at the trial.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     The Plaintiff pointed out that there would be
                    great prejudice to him if a re-trial is ordered and that such prejudice cannot
                    be compensated by costs. He said that it would be difficult to locate his
                    witnesses for a fresh trial after all these years and that his then wife, who
                    was a key witness at the trial, would not be willing to testify on his behalf
                    anymore as they have divorced. The Plaintiff also rightly argued that the
                    documentary evidence relevant to the trial would have probably been destroyed
                    given that the matter concluded some seven years ago.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     There can be no argument that the
                    Defendant’s delay of seven years is a long delay by any standards. In his
                    affidavit dated 12 January 2010, the Defendant stated that the reason for
                    his delayed application was as follows (at paragraph 60):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">After the judgement, I did not do anything as the Plaintiff did not take
                        any steps against me either. I was led to believe that he himself knew that
                        the claim was false, otherwise he would have pursued it earlier with much
                        vigour.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     The Defendant’s excuse is unacceptable.
                    Even if the Plaintiff has delayed enforcing the 2003 judgment, the fact remains
                    that by virtue of O 35 r 2(2) of the Rules, the Defendant’s
                    application to set the judgment aside must be made within 14 days. Of course, in
                    the case of a judgment where six years or more have elapsed since the date of
                    the judgment, the party enforcing it is required by
                    O 46 r 2(1)(a) of the Rules to obtain the leave of the Court to
                    issue a writ of execution to enforce the judgment. The Defendant made no
                    submissions about this and I therefore assumed there is no issue about this
                    here. The Plaintiff had good reasons to bide his time – the Defendant was
                    in no position to pay up on the 2003 judgment until recently and it would
                    therefore have been foolish of the Plaintiff to incur more costs in fruitless
                    execution.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     The Defendant relied on <em>Su
                        Sh-Hsyu</em> to support his contention that the 2003 judgment should
                    be set aside but that case did not help him at all. In that case, the respondent
                    claimed that the appellant had not paid for shares sold by him to her in
                    Shanghai. The appellant’s case was that the respondent had requested
                    payment be made to a specified account of another person with the Standard
                    Chartered Bank (“SCB”) in Singapore and had signed on the SCB slip
                    to confirm his instructions. However, the respondent denied having signed the
                    SCB slip and claimed that he did not know that other person to whose SCB account
                    the appellant had transferred the money for the shares. On the morning of the
                    trial, the appellant’s counsel applied for an adjournment on the ground
                    that the appellant and two of her witnesses had to attend last-minute meetings
                    in Shanghai regarding a university with which they were involved. The trial
                    judge proceeded with the trial in the appellant’s absence and entered
                    judgment against her for $414,200 on 6 July 2006. On 20 July 2006, the
                    appellant applied to set aside the judgment. Apart from the fact that the
                    appellant had applied to set aside the judgment within the 14 days’
                    deadline in O 35 r 2(2) of the Rules, what swung the balance in
                    the appellant’s favour was that she had obtained a report from the Health
                    Sciences Authority (“HSA”), which concluded that the
                    respondent’s signature on the SCB slip was genuine. The Court of Appeal
                    accepted at [63] that the appellant’s decision not to attend trial was
                    wholly deliberate in nature and could not be countenanced. However, the Court
                    pointed out at [64] that an “exceptional feature” in this case was
                    the real possibility that Respondent had attained a judgment through fraud in
                    light of the HSA report. In those circumstances, the Court of Appeal allowed the
                    appellant’s application to adduce the fresh evidence from the HSA, set
                    aside the judgment and ordered a fresh trial.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     The present case is wholly distinguishable
                    from <em>Su Sh-Hsyu</em>. No allegation of fraud has been
                    raised so as to constitute an exceptional circumstance that may be taken into
                    account in determining whether the 2003 judgment should be set aside.
                    Furthermore, unlike the appellant in <em>Su Sh-Hsyu</em>,
                    who applied to set the judgment within 14 days, the Defendant in the present
                    case took almost seven years to do so. It is noteworthy that despite the
                    possibility of fraud and the fact that the application to set aside the judgment
                    had been made on time, the Court of Appeal said at [78] that the exceptional
                    circumstances only “marginally” tilted the balance in favour of
                    setting aside the judgment. In the present case, with a delay of almost seven
                    years and no allegation of fraud, there is no reason why the 2003 judgment
                    should be set aside. The Defendant is merely seeking to do in 2010 what he
                    should have done in 2003, that is, turn up and defend the case brought against
                    him. He has compounded his difficulties by letting the 2003 judgment against him
                    stand on record all these years. In my view, there would be no miscarriage of
                    justice if the Defendant’s application to set aside the 2003 judgment is
                    not allowed. Instead, there would be serious prejudice to the Plaintiff as he is
                    now unlikely to be able to muster the evidence for his claim.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     I therefore dismissed the Defendant’s
                    appeal and awarded the Plaintiff costs of $2,000 and reasonable
                    disbursements.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Appeal to the Court of Appeal </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     The Defendant has appealed to the Court of
                    Appeal against my decision. The 2003 judgment was for $241,067.28 which is below
                    the threshold of $250,000 for an appeal provided in s 34(2)(a) of the Supreme
                    Court of Judicature Act. When I was notified of the notice of appeal, I informed
                    the registry to ask the Defendant’s solicitors whether leave to appeal is
                    necessary here and, if so, whether such leave has been obtained. They replied
                    that they were of the view that leave is not required.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     In response to the Defendant’s
                    solicitors’ letter, the Plaintiff’s solicitors by their letter of 8
                    July 2010 pointed out that the Court of Appeal held in <em>Virtual Map (Singapore) Pte Ltd v Singapore Land Authority and another
                        application</em> [2009] 2 SLR(R) 558 that
                    non-contractual interest and costs are not to be taken into account for the
                    purpose of determining whether the threshold of $250,000 for an appeal to the
                    Court of Appeal has been met as these were merely consequential
                matters.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     In their further letter of 12 July 2010,
                    the Defendant’s solicitors stated:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">We wish to highlight that our present appeal to the Court of Appeal does
                        not arise from an appeal against the judgment of [the trial judge] made on
                        30 January 2003.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Our present application stems from the decision of [the DJ] made on 25
                        March 2010 in refusing to set aside the default Judgment of [the trial
                        judge] and ordering a retrial of the matter. The value of the Judgment that
                        [the DJ] was asked to set aside exceeded the sum of $250,000.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In the premises, we are of the respectful view that no leave pursuant to
                        section 34(2)(a) is required.</p>
