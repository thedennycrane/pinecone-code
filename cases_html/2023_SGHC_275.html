The Arbitrator also found it important to bear in mind that the conspiracy as pleaded by the claimant was alleged to have occurred at a time before the Storage Agreement had been entered into. Matters relied on by the claimant in terms of X’s and Y’s roles subsequent to the entering into of the Storage Agreement could not form the basis on which to infer the alleged combination at a much earlier point in time.

</div>
</div> Ostensibly, the claimant’s arguments on the Implied Term were grounded on a <span class="font-italic">similar</span> complaint and concern, namely the claimant’s ownership of the Product in the tanks, and in what quantities. The contended term to be implied into the Storage Agreement was, after all, that the defendant would inform the claimant if the Storage Tanks contained product either belonging to other customers, or where the defendant did not know to whom the product belonged, or where the defendant had not been informed that the product belonged to the claimant (see [59] above).

This would explain the structure of SOC A1 in which para 11A (where the Implied Term Contention was pleaded) was referred to at paras 82A and 82B as part of the pleading relating to the Failure to Allocate Allegation.

The alleged breach of the Implied Term was pleaded as one of the unlawful acts committed by the defendant and Co A with the intention of injuring the claimant – “[a]s of [D0], the tanks allocated to the [c]laimant were filled with gasoil belonging to [Co A], but in breach of the Implied Term, the [defendant] did not inform the [c]laimant of this fact” (see [62(c)] above).

The inclusion of the alleged breach of the Implied Term as an issue to be decided is entirely unsurprising, considering that this was contested by both parties and thus was indeed in issue in the Arbitration. In my view, the mere inclusion of a sub-issue in the parties’ respective List of Issues is not inconsistent with my finding that the alleged breach of the Implied Term was not pleaded (and more importantly, not ultimately argued) as a <span class="font-italic">standalone</span> breach of contract.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">76 Second, I note that arguments on the Implied Term were raised in the parties’ oral opening submissions (see [62(h)] and [62(i)] above). However, an appreciation of the <span class="font-italic">context </span>in which these arguments were made is critical. A closer analysis of the oral opening submissions advanced by Mr Lok in the Arbitration shows that arguments for the implication of the term were made in response to the Arbitrator’s question as to why there could not, in theory, be commingling of the Product under the terms of the Storage Agreement. In fact, the Arbitrator’s questions arose directly out of the claimant’s submissions on the defendant’s obligation <span class="font-italic">to allocate tanks for the claimant’s exclusive use</span>. This is consistent with the defendant’s case, and my own view, that the alleged breach of the Implied Term was not pleaded (and was certainly not being argued) by the claimant as a standalone breach of contract but as a “<span class="font-italic">subset </span>of the Failure to Allocate Allegation” (see [64] above).

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> There was no separate section in the claimant’s closing submissions on its contractual cause of action or on the Implied Term. Whatever allegations of breach of contract that were levelled at the defendant were only raised in the closing submissions as acts in furtherance of the unlawful means conspiracy. In my judgment, this only serves to confirm that the alleged breach of the Implied Term was never raised by the claimant as a <span class="font-italic">standalone </span>argument; that was certainly not the case by the time the claimant was pulling all the threads together and presenting its closing arguments to the Arbitrator. As I mentioned above, in the claimant’s closing submissions, the Implied Term was presented to the Arbitrator as one of the unlawful acts pleaded in support of the claimant’s conspiracy claim. I would go so far as to say that the decision to argue it in this manner must have been a deliberate or strategic choice on the part of the claimant. At the hearing before me, I asked Mr Lok if he could point me to any part of the claimant’s closing submissions in the Arbitration where breach of contract by the defendant had been argued and submitted on as a standalone cause of action, distinct from the conspiracy claim. Mr Lok candidly replied that he could not.

</div> While Mr Lok’s response to the court was that there was no separate section in the claimant’s closing submissions dealing with breach of the <span class="font-italic">express</span><span class="font-italic"> terms</span> of the contract, that response must apply equally to the Implied Term, as would be plainly apparent from the closing submissions themselves.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">78 A cursory reading of the claimant’s prayers for relief in para 470(a) of its closing submissions might, however, suggest otherwise. The claimant sought “<span class="font-italic">alternatively</span>, for [the claimant’s] claim for breach of Implied Term, damages for loss of chance in the sum of [US$X] or such sum the Arbitrator deems fit” [emphasis added] (see [62(k)] above). Mr Lok argues that this shows that the claim for breach of the Implied Term was distinct from the conspiracy claim, as damages for loss of chance are not available for a conspiracy claim.

</div>
</div> However, it is important not to lose sight of the fact that the primary purpose of para 470 of the claimant’s closing submissions was to set out the <span class="font-italic">remedies</span> sought by the claimant, and not to detail the claimant’s causes of action. Further, the prayers for relief were structured in a manner where the breach of the Implied Term under sub-section (iii) fell under the claimant’s allegations of “<span class="font-italic">conspiracy</span>, fraudulent or negligent misrepresentation, <span class="font-italic">breach of contract</span> and negligence” [emphasis added] under section (a). In my view, reading para 470 in accordance with its internal structure <span class="font-italic">and</span> the broader context of the pleadings and submissions made by the parties, para 470 is best understood to mean: <span class="font-italic">if</span> the Arbitrator were to find that the claimant’s breach of contract and/or conspiracy claims succeeded, <span class="font-italic">and</span> that there was a breach of the Implied Term as analysed under those two claims, there would be available to the claimant an alternative head of damages for loss of chance in the same sum (<span class="font-italic">ie</span><span class="font-italic">,</span> US$X).  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">79 From the discussion above, one could surmise (and perhaps be forgiven for doing so) that the claimant’s case and arguments on the Implied Term before the Arbitrator were not particularly easy to understand but, more importantly, evolved as the case progressed from pleadings to closing arguments. There are several possible ways of interpreting the claimant’s arguments – the alleged breach of the Implied Term could have been (a) a subset of one of the pleaded heads of breaches of the Storage Agreement, namely that the defendant had failed to allocate tanks for the claimant’s exclusive use; and/or (b) an unlawful act under the conspiracy claim; and/or (c) a combination of both (a) and (b), where the breach of the Implied Term as a breach of contract (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, (a)) was an unlawful act under the conspiracy claim (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, (b)). It appears to me that the answer lies somewhere closer to (c). Regardless, <span class="font-italic">any</span> of these permutations leads me to the same conclusion – that the breach of the Implied Term was <span class="font-italic">not</span> a standalone argument and was not pitched or argued as such. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">80 Therefore, and material to the claimant’s objection that there was a breach of natural justice in the Arbitrator’s alleged failure to consider or apply his mind to the Implied Term Contention, if the Arbitrator had resolved and found against the claimant on the <span class="font-italic">larger questions</span> under which the Implied Term was raised, the Arbitrator would have <span class="font-italic">in effect</span> also determined the arguments raised by the parties concerning the Implied Term, <span class="font-italic">even if</span> the Arbitrator did not deal with the Implied Term in the Award expressly, specifically or in great detail. With these observations setting the stage, I turn now to consider the Award in some detail. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">81 The Arbitrator started off this section of the Award “VII. The Claim for Breach of the Agreement” (at para 164) by identifying the question as being whether the defendant had breached the Storage Agreement in any of the three overarching respects pleaded by the claimant (see [30(a)] above). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">82 In paras 165–171 of the Award, the Arbitrator then proceeded to address and <span class="font-italic">dismiss</span> the claimant’s argument that the defendant had breached the Storage Agreement in failing to allocate tanks for the claimant’s exclusive use, finding that there was <span class="font-italic">no</span> such obligation under the terms of the Storage Agreement in the first place (see [35] above).

</div>
</div></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">222. It is important at the outset to focus on what precisely is the combination alleged by the [c]laimant, which it is essential for the [c]laimant to establish in order to found its conspiracy claim; and, in particular, on the time when the alleged combination came into existence. The [c]laimant’s pleaded case is that the alleged combination came into existence in or about [M0-1]: it is alleged that the [defendant] and [Co A] “<span class="font-italic">conceived a plan</span>” on or about [D0-5] to sell non-existent Product to the [c]laimant; and that, on or before [D0], X and Y, together with certain employees of the [defendant] and [Co A], “<span class="font-italic">hatched a plan</span>” to sell non-existent Product to the [c]laimant: paragraphs 114D(a) and (b) of the Amended Statement of Claim. The alleged combination, therefore, must have preceded the 1st and 2nd Sale Contracts and the [Co A] Sale Contract, to none of which was the [defendant] a party. The [defendant’s] case is that there is also no evidence that it was aware of those contracts at the material time. Given the timing of the alleged combination, it is difficult to see how, as the [c]laimant alleges, the [defendant] was operating in “<span class="font-italic">clear tandem </span><span class="font-italic font-underline">against the background of</span><span class="font-italic"> the Agreement</span><span class="font-italic">, the 1st and 2nd Sale Contracts and the [Co A] Sale Contract” … </span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis in original] </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">85 Therefore, in my judgment, the Arbitrator had addressed and determined the two larger questions under which arguments on the Implied Term were raised, namely whether the defendant had breached the Storage Agreement in failing to allocate tanks for the claimant’s exclusive use and whether the defendant had committed the tort of unlawful means conspiracy. In doing so, the Arbitrator had, at the very least, implicitly also addressed what needed to be addressed in relation to the parties’ arguments on the Implied Term. Alternatively, having found against the claimant on the two larger questions, it could equally be the case that the Arbitrator found it unnecessary to deal with the Implied Term Contention. Accordingly, I disagree with the claimant that one is compelled to draw the inference or reach the conclusion that the Arbitrator failed completely to apply his mind to the Implied Term Contention and thereby breached the rules of natural justice. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">86 The conclusion I have reached above is sufficient to dismiss the claimant’s case on the Implied Term Contention. However, I venture further to add that the Arbitrator, having found that there was <span class="font-italic">no </span>obligation on the defendant’s part under the Storage Agreement to allocate tanks for the claimant’s exclusive use (see [35] above), could be taken to have impliedly rejected the Implied Term Contention as well. In this regard, I agree with Mr Nandakumar’s submission that the Implied Term Contention “would fall away” if the Arbitrator found that there was no requirement to allocate tanks for the claimant’s exclusive use in the first place

</div>
</div> – after all, as a matter of commercial sense, it would not be logical for the defendant to be contractually obliged to inform the claimant if any of the Allocated Tanks contained product belonging to other customers (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the Implied Term), if there was no obligation to allocate tanks for the claimant’s exclusive use to begin with. This also explains the structure of SOC A1, as canvassed in [69] above. As such, I do not accept that simply failing to expressly refer to or decide the Implied Term Contention, <span class="font-italic">after </span>having already found that there was no obligation to allocate tanks for the claimant’s exclusive use, leads to the inescapable inference that the Arbitrator was guilty of failing to apply his mind to the Implied Term Contention at all. It could equally be a case of the Arbitrator’s implicit rejection of the Implied Term Contention – the law is unequivocal in this regard that “an issue need not be addressed expressly in an award but may be <span class="font-italic">implicitly </span>resolved”: <span class="font-italic">BLB and another v BLC and others </span>[2013] 4 SLR 1169 (“<span class="font-italic">BLB</span>”) at [75].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">87 In my view, this also means that even if, <span class="font-italic">arguendo</span>, there was a breach of natural justice, no prejudice could be said to have been occasioned to the claimant. To succeed in setting aside an award on the basis that there was a breach of the rules of natural justice, the applicant must also show that there has been some actual or real prejudice caused by the alleged breach: <span class="font-italic">Soh Beng Tee </span>at [91]. The requirement to demonstrate that the rights of a party have thereby been prejudiced is expressly set out in s 48(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)(vii) of the AA. The test is whether as a result of the breach, the tribunal was denied the benefit of arguments or evidence that had a real as opposed to a fanciful chance of making a difference to its deliberations: <span class="font-italic">L W Infrastructure Pte Ltd v Lim Chin San Contractors Pte Ltd and another appeal </span>[2013] 1 SLR 125 at [54]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">88 The Arbitrator’s finding that there was no obligation to allocate tanks for the claimant’s exclusive use was a finding of fact, based on the evidence before the Arbitrator and the Arbitrator’s interpretation of the terms of the Storage Agreement – this was a finding on the merits that cannot be appealed or otherwise challenged before the court. Having found no such obligation to allocate exclusive use and therefore no breach by the defendant in that regard, it would, in my judgment, be <span class="font-italic">fanciful </span>to suggest that had the Arbitrator expressly addressed the Implied Term Contention, he could have come to the conclusion that the Implied Term existed and that it was breached by the defendant. As mentioned in [86] above, it would not make commercial sense for the defendant to be required to inform the claimant if any of the Allocated Tanks contained product belonging to other customers (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the Implied Term), if there was (as the Arbitrator found) no obligation to allocate tanks for the claimant’s exclusive use to begin with. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">89 Finally, even if the alleged breach of the Implied Term had in actual fact been raised as a standalone argument, the inference that the Arbitrator failed to consider this independent breach should still not be drawn. In this regard, I refer to the oft-quoted passage from the Court of Appeal’s decision in <span class="font-italic">AKN </span>at [46]: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… It will usually be a matter of inference rather than of explicit indication that the arbitrator wholly missed one or more important pleaded issues. However, the inference – that the arbitrator indeed failed to consider an important pleaded issue – if it is to be drawn at all, must be shown to be <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">clear and virtually inescapable</span>. If the facts are also consistent with <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">the arbitrator simply having misunderstood the aggrieved party’s case</span>, or having been mistaken as to the law, or <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">having chosen not to deal with a point pleaded by the aggrieved party because he thought it unnecessary (notwithstanding that this view may have been formed based on a misunderstanding of the aggrieved party’s case)</span>, then the inference that the arbitrator did not apply his mind at all to the dispute before him (or to an important aspect of that dispute) and so acted in breach of natural justice should <span class="font-italic">not </span>be drawn. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis in original in italics; emphasis added in bold italics]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">90 In my judgment, a “clear and virtually inescapable” inference that the Arbitrator failed to consider the independent breach of the Implied Term simply cannot be drawn. As my analysis above demonstrates, the claimant’s pleadings and submissions on the alleged breach of the Implied Term lacked the clarity required for such an inference to be drawn. Even if the breach of the Implied Term had in actual fact been raised as a standalone argument, this was not articulated to the Arbitrator with sufficient clarity in the claimant’s pleadings and submissions. One would be hard-pressed to find a single instance, in the entire arbitral record that was put into evidence by the parties in this application, where the claimant intimated to the Arbitrator that the Implied Term Contention was being advanced by the claimant as a standalone claim or argument which had to be decided by the Arbitrator independently of the claim(s) for (a) breach of contract in failing to allocate tanks for the claimant’s exclusive use; and/or (b) conspiracy. Viewed in this light, the Arbitrator’s decision not to address the breach of the Implied Term as an independent allegation would, at best (if at all), simply be a case of the Arbitrator “having misunderstood the aggrieved party’s case” (<span class="font-italic">AKN </span>at [46]). To be clear, I am not in any way suggesting that this is indeed what happened in this case, but simply pointing out the formidable hurdles that stand in the claimant’s way.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">91 Further, the Arbitrator expressly indicated in para 265 of the Award (see [84] above) that he chose not to deal with the issue of the unlawfulness of the acts relied on by the claimant as regards the conspiracy claim <span class="font-italic">because</span> the other elements of the alleged conspiracy had not been made out. Thus, the Arbitrator could not have been clearer in expressing his thought process that he “[chose] not to deal with a point pleaded by the aggrieved party because he thought it unnecessary” (<span class="font-italic">AKN</span> at [46]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">92 For the foregoing reasons, the claimant’s case that the Arbitrator failed to apply its mind to the Implied Term Contention cannot succeed. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">93 I make a final observation: in the claimant’s written submissions for this application, the claimant submits that the Arbitrator “came up with [his] own argument that there was no obligation of exclusivity notwithstanding that [the defendant] had not even made this contention” and the claimant “had no opportunity to address this reasoning”.

</div>
</div> These submissions were made, not when dealing with the substantive arguments on the Implied Term Contention, but in a section dealing with remission of the Award. There are two inherent problems with these arguments. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">94 First, the claimant appears to be <span class="font-italic">hinting</span> that the Arbitrator had exceeded his jurisdiction and/or breached natural justice in utilising a chain of reasoning that was not foreseeable or coming up with an idea of his own without giving the parties an opportunity to address him on it. Yet, no arguments were advanced in the claimant’s written submissions or at the oral hearing before me on this issue when the claimant submitted on the Implied Term Contention. As I indicated at [93] above, these submissions were contained under a section dealing with <span class="font-italic">remission</span>, and not when dealing with the <span class="font-italic">grounds for setting aside the Award</span>. The claimant’s sole objection in relation to the Implied Term is that the Arbitrator had, in breach of natural justice, failed to apply his mind to the Implied Term. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">95 Second, and more fundamentally, the claimant’s complaint that the Arbitrator came up with his own argument that there had been no obligation of exclusivity is, with respect, puzzling. One of the claimant’s arguments before the Arbitrator was <span class="font-italic">precisely</span> that the defendant breached the Storage Agreement by failing to allocate tanks for the claimant’s <span class="font-italic">exclusive</span> use (see [30(a)(i)] above). That necessarily required a determination as to whether such an obligation of exclusivity even existed, in circumstances where the burden of proof lay on the claimant alleging the breach since the existence of the obligation was never conceded or admitted by the defendant.

</div> In this application, the claimant takes issue with the characterisation of the duty as relating to the non-existence of the Product instead of title and/or ownership over the Product. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">107 In my view, the claimant is splitting hairs and, in essence, nitpicking at the Award again. Reading section (IX)(1) of the Award in context and as a whole, it appears that the Arbitrator considered the two framings of the duty to be interchangeable – after all, the Arbitrator’s determination on the agency doctrine in para 243 (see [106] above) followed shortly after his summary of the parties’ cases on the agency doctrine in paras 227–228 (see [105] above).  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">108 In any case, the respective enquiries as to the existence or non-existence of the Product and the claimant’s title to the Product are, in my view, intertwined; they are not clear and discrete lines of questioning separated by a bright line. The non-existence of the Product (sold and allegedly allocated to the claimant) was the direct result of there being competing claims of title over the Product; fundamentally, and as a matter of logic and common sense, existence of the property is a necessary precursor to ownership and title. The rhetorical question thus follows: if there was no duty to enquire into <span class="font-italic">existence</span>, how could there be a duty to enquire into <span class="font-italic">ownership</span>? Viewed in this light, the Arbitrator’s negative conclusion on the former would summarily determine the latter in the negative as well. But more to the point – the claimant has again failed to demonstrate that the inescapable inference to be drawn here is that the Arbitrator completely failed to decide the Combination Contention. On the contrary, the available evidence within the Award itself, when read in its proper context, is that the Arbitrator <span class="font-italic">did</span> determine the issue, just not in the way the claimant had hoped.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">109 Finally, one must bear in mind that the claimant’s overarching case on conspiracy was that the defendant and Co A conspired to “sell non or partially existent oil to [the claimant]”.

In doing so, the claimant runs the risk of being seen as attempting a backdoor appeal on the merits in the guise of a purported process breach – our courts have repeatedly deprecated attempts by unsuccessful arbitrants to do so and I would repeat that deprecation in this case.

</div> Critically, this is a finding by the Arbitrator that is unappealable. The struggle that the Arbitrator faced, at a more fundamental level, was in ascertaining the contents and extent of X’s and Y’s knowledge to determine whether they had carried out or coordinated the alleged unlawful acts – in this regard, the Arbitrator observed that “the [c]laimant adduced no evidence from [X] or [Y] or from any other [Co A] employee with which it dealt directly”.

The claimant’s <span class="font-italic">positive</span> case before the Arbitrator was that the defendant was liable for the issuance of the Certificates, which constituted the fraudulent and/or negligent misrepresentation. Therefore, on first principles, the <span class="font-italic">claimant</span> bore the burden of proving the authenticity of the Certificates, especially considering that the defendant denied issuing any of them thereby placing their authenticity directly into issue. Proof of authenticity by the claimant would have entailed making good its case that the company stamps on the Certificates were in wet ink. Thus, the mere fact that the defendant had not made extensive arguments on this specific issue does not mean that the claimant had thereby discharged its burden of proof. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">128  Further, the defendant always maintained its challenge to the authenticity of the Certificates – from the outset, the defendant’s pleaded position was that it did not issue any of the Certificates, did not authorise their issuance, and was not aware of the Certificates having been issued prior to the commencement of the Arbitration.

</div> In my view, <span class="font-italic">CAJ</span> is easily distinguished on its facts and affords no support to the claimant. As the claimant itself acknowledges, <span class="font-italic">CAJ </span>dealt with a situation where the defendant raised an extension of time defence for the <span class="font-italic">first time</span> in their written closing submissions seeking to reduce the amount of liquidated damages that was payable. The Court of Appeal agreed with the Judge below that “[a] chance to respond to the counterparty’s <span class="font-italic">legal submissions </span>on a newly raised defence cannot constitute a reasonable opportunity to present one’s case” [emphasis in original] (<span class="font-italic">CAJ</span> at [58]). Here, the defendant’s assertion that there was “no forensic evidence that the ink on [the Certificates] is a wet stamp ink” was not a <span class="font-italic">newly </span>raised defence; rather, and as I have indicated above, it was a component of an existing and hotly contested issue between the parties on the authenticity of the Certificates. The burden of proof lay squarely on the claimant’s shoulders to make good its case. Having failed in that endeavour, it cannot now come before the court and cry foul.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">130 In my judgment, the claimant had not only reasonable but every opportunity to present its case on the authenticity of the Certificates. Whether the claimant took it for granted that the authenticity of the Certificates would not be challenged on the basis of whether the company stamps were in wet ink is not for me to speculate. However, the fact that the claimant made the call not to run certain arguments or adduce forensic evidence on this point, in circumstances when the issue was squarely in the arena, cannot mean that the claimant was denied a reasonable opportunity to present its case. Accordingly, I also reject this ground of the application.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Apparent Authority Allegation </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">131 The claimant contends that the Arbitrator’s finding that X and Y had “no apparent authority” was tainted by the Arbitrator’s failure to apply his mind and consequentially to decide the real issues at play.

The Tribunal also does not accept that, as directors (and, in [Y’s] case as CEO), [X] and [Y] were vested with apparent authority by the [defendant] to issue such [redacted] Certificates. The issue of fraudulent [redacted] Certificates does not fall within the usual scope of the office of the CEO.

However, I do not accept that the Arbitrator determined the (wrong) question of whether X and Y had apparent authority to issue <span class="font-italic">fraudulent </span>Certificates. I cannot imagine that this would have even been an issue raised or worth exploring – it is inconceivable for any director of a company to be clothed with apparent authority to engage in fraud. It is also unbelievable for any company’s memorandum and articles of association to confer <span class="font-italic">actual </span>authority on its directors to make fraudulent misrepresentations. Reading the Award closely and in context, it is sufficiently clear, in my view, that the Arbitrator was in fact deciding on the question posed to him by the claimant – <span class="font-italic">viz</span>, whether X and Y had apparent authority to issue the Certificates on the defendant’s behalf. As such, the claimant was heard and did in fact present its case, only that the Arbitrator disagreed with the claimant and found that the indoor management rule was not engaged.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">134 In any event, even if I accept the claimant’s argument that the Arbitrator decided a different unargued point, I am of the view that no prejudice would have been occasioned to the claimant.

The Arbitrator also noted that the circumstances in which the Certificates had come to be issued “remain[ed] opaque” and that the claimant had adduced no evidence of “the roles played by [X] and [Y]” or any other person sufficient to fix the defendant with liability.

I also bear in mind that the Whatsapp Message was disclosed by the defendant in another suit pending before the court; this does not appear to be conduct consistent with a party intent on deliberately concealing or suppressing evidence.

First, the substance of the information in the Whatsapp Message was already made known in the Arbitration by way of the disclosure of the Employee’s email to the Entity dated [D0+20], wherein the Employee informed the Entity that she was “awaiting instructions from [Co A] on the [undertaking]”.

</div> The other messages exhibited pertained to the then-prevailing COVID-19 restrictions and the defendant’s intended legal representation. Further, for the reasons canvassed above at [143], the Whatsapp Message was not of relevance to the Arbitration. I also disagree with the argument made by Mr Lok that the messages exchanged between Y and the Employee on the defendant’s intended legal representation demonstrated the senior position and influence that Y had in the defendant, and therefore this evidence would (if not suppressed) have had a material impact on the issues of attribution of knowledge of Y to the defendant and the identification doctrine, in the context of the claims advanced by the claimant in the Arbitration for unlawful means conspiracy. Those arguments make a leap too far and are somewhat speculative. In my judgment, the claimant has not demonstrated that there could have been any meaningful difference to the outcome of the Arbitration, bearing in mind again the Arbitrator’s fundamental difficulty with the lack of evidence adduced by the claimant on the alleged combination involving the defendant, X and/or Y (see [84] above). </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Other allegedly suppressed documents </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">148 The claimant contends that there are likely to be further WhatsApp exchanges or correspondence between the Employee and Y on matters that fall within the ordered disclosures, but which were not disclosed.

Suppression of the relevant documents was thus viewed from the perspective of the tribunal during the arbitration proceedings. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">150 In my judgment, when a setting aside application on the ground of fraud by way of concealment of evidence is placed before the seat court, there must be <span class="font-italic">actual </span>evidence of the existence of those documents that the party allegedly concealed in the arbitration proceedings before the court can even conclude that the making of the award was indeed induced or affected by fraud, bearing in mind the high standard of proof required for an allegation of fraudulent conduct (<span class="font-italic">Dongwoo</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [147]; <span class="font-italic">CLX</span> at [57]–[58])).

</div> at the time the tribunal had been constituted and not only after the Award was released. Given the amounts at stake, it would be surprising if the claimant or its representatives had not undertaken any checks at all on the Arbitrator when the parties had been notified of his appointment by the SIAC and only purported to do so after the Award was published. The claimant’s decision to raise questions relating to the Arbitrator’s CV after the release of the Award could therefore be construed as more than just mere coincidence but rather, an attempt by the claimant to self-induce an impression that the Arbitrator would “hold it against” the claimant because the claimant had raised doubts over the Arbitrator’s impartiality and professionalism, and that therefore, it would be inappropriate to remit the matter to the Arbitrator. According to the claimant, from the Arbitrator’s “terse response” to the claimant’s solicitors’ questions, the Arbitrator “displayed obvious displeasure” in having to respond to the questions raised, and thus the claimant was concerned that objectively there was a risk that the Arbitrator may be “sub-consciously tempted to achieve the same result as before” (<span class="font-italic">BZW</span> at [67(a)]).

</div> This then raises questions as to the <span class="font-italic">bona fides </span>and real motive of the claimant in seeking the Arbitrator’s clarification, post-Award, on whether the Arbitrator was in a position of conflict of interest. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">162 As a matter of principle, I should say that the court would not look fondly on applicants who attempt, post-award, to create evidence or circumstances to portray an arbitral tribunal as being incapable of viewing the matter objectively should the dispute be remitted to it by the court. If parties can prevent remission simply by being antagonistic towards a tribunal after it is <span class="font-italic">functus</span><span class="font-italic"> officio</span> and questioning (by innuendo) the tribunal’s impartiality without any real bite to any implied suggestion of bias, such conduct would, in my view, make a mockery of the process of arbitration <span class="font-italic">and</span> the process of seeking recourse from the court against an arbitral award.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">163 There were, regrettably, traces of such conduct by the claimant in this case.
