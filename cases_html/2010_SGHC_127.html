<p class="Judg-Heading-1">I.   INTRODUCTION</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       This action concerned the defendants’
                    refusal to issue certain corporate notes to the plaintiffs. The plaintiffs in
                    this action were Rockline Limited (“Rockline”) and Superon
                    International Limited (“Superon”), both of which were owned by
                    Schroder Asian Properties Fund (“SAP”). The defendants were
                    Silverlink Holdings Limited (“Silverlink”) and Argent Holdings
                    Limited (“Argent”). The 1st third party, Schroder Ventures
                    Managers Inc (“SVMI”), was an entity vested with the exclusive
                    right, power and discretion to manage Schroder Ventures Asia Pacific Fund
                    (“SVAPF”). The 2nd third party Anchor Victory Ltd
                    (“AVL”) was a special purpose company wholly-owned by
                    SVAPF.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The plaintiffs’ claim was for breach of
                    contract. They alleged that the defendants failed to issue certain Secured
                    Convertible Redeemable Notes (“SCRNs”) to them (or their nominee)
                    pursuant to the Rockline Repurchase Agreement (“RRA”) and as
                    consideration for the agreed complete repurchase of Superon’s indirect
                    interest in Silverlink (“the Superon Repurchase”). The defendants,
                    on the other hand, contended that except for economic benefits, the SAP Notes
                    (defined at <a href="#p1_4">[4]</a> below) were subject to the
                    control of the holder of the SVAPF Note (“SVAPF Control”), and
                    that before the SAP Notes may be issued, this control provision must be
                    documented and executed. They contended that their failure to issue the SAP
                    Notes was not in breach of any agreement because SVAPF Control had not been
                    documented and executed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       SVAPF comprised of, <em>inter
                        alia</em>, two limited partnerships, Schroder Ventures Asia Pacific
                    Fund LP1 and Schroder Ventures Asia Pacific Fund LP2. At the material time, SVMI
                    was the General Partner of the two limited partnerships. SVMI was also vested
                    with full management and control over SVAPF. Pursuant to a Fund Management
                    Agreement with Schroder Venture Managers Limited (“SVML”) dated
                    1 July 1999, SVMI appointed SVML as fund manager of SVAPF. According to
                    SVMI, the functions of SVMI were, in effect, delegated to SVML. Pursuant to a
                    Fund Advisory Agreement and Investment Advisory Agreement executed that same
                    day, Schroder Ventures (Asia) Limited (“SVAL”) was appointed the
                    Fund Advisor to SVML while Schroder Capital Partners Limited
                    (“SCPL”) was appointed the Investment Advisor to advise and guide
                    SVAL. The recommendations of the Investment Advisor were to be reviewed by an
                    investment committee (“the SVAPF IC”) which would in turn make its
                    recommendation formally to SVMI/SVML. As at November 2002, the SVAPF IC
                    comprised of Nicholas Ferguson (“NF”), Anil Thadani
                    (“AT”) and Andrew Williams. At the material time, AT was also a
                    director of Silverlink and Argent. Argent was then the majority shareholder of
                    Silverlink.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       In November 2002, SVAPF gave a loan of US$79.5m
                    to Silverlink through AVL. In return, a SCRN (the “SVAPF Note”)
                    was issued to SVAPF. Silverlink needed the money to acquire a piece of land in
                    Lodhi Road, New Delhi, India. The important questions in the present dispute
                    were whether the SVAPF Note was able to control the rights under two other SRCNs
                    that were to be issued by Silverlink to the plaintiffs, Rockline and Superon
                    (respectively the “Rockline Note” and “Superon Note”
                    and collectively the “SAP Notes”), and whether the documentation
                    and execution of such control was a condition precedent to the issuance of the
                    SAP Notes. Since SAP was the ultimate shareholder of both Rockline and Superon,
                    this meant that both SVAPF and SAP were linked to Schroders plc (the parent
                    company of SVMI and SAPML) and shared common directors.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       The SAP Notes were meant to be consideration in
                    respect for the partial repurchase of Rockline’s shareholding in
                    Silverlink and the Superon Repurchase. The issuance of the SAP Notes therefore
                    did not require any fresh funds to be injected into Silverlink (unlike the SVAPF
                    Note). The Rockline repurchase was duly completed, although the Rockline Note
                    was not issued. According to the plaintiffs, Superon tendered its shares in
                    Silverlink for repurchase, but in breach of its obligations, the defendants did
                    not complete the Superon Repurchase. The relevant agreed term pertaining to the
                    Rockline Note was as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">a secured convertible note to be issued by the Purchaser in substantially
                        the form and substance of the US$79.5M Note [SVAPF Note] with necessary
                        amendments but otherwise ranking pari passu with the US$79.5M Note.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       The plaintiffs contended that the SAP Notes
                    ranked <em>pari passu</em> with the SVAPF Note and the
                    former were not intended to be issued subject to SVAPF Control. The plaintiffs
                    further asserted that the defendants were in breach of contract for not issuing
                    the SAP Notes. As mentioned above at <a href="#p1_2">[2]</a>, the
                    defendants disputed the plaintiffs’ claim and argued that save for
                    economic benefits, the SAP Notes are subject to the control of the holder of the
                    SVAPF Note and that before the SAP Notes may be issued, the control given by SAP
                    to SVAPF had to be documented and executed. According to the defendants, SVAPF
                    Control arose out of:</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(1)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">an express or implied term;</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(2)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">a collateral contract;</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(3)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">the mutual common assumption of the parties;
                            or</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(4)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">estoppel.</div>
<p class="Judg-1">The purpose of the purported agreement was to give SVAPF overall
                    control of Silverlink. The defendants’ defence was that they were not
                    obliged to issue the SAP Notes because the SVAPF Control had not been documented
                    or executed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       The third parties agreed with the plaintiffs
                    that no agreement on SVAPF Control had been reached. However, they denied that
                    they were parties to any agreement or sub-agreements therein (characterised as
                    the capital raising agreement (“CRA”) by the plaintiffs and
                    defendants). The third parties, however, disagreed with the plaintiffs that the
                    preliminary document known as the Outline of the Principal Terms of Agreement
                    (“Outline”) was binding on them.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">II.   SVAPF CONTROL</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">a.   The definition of SVAPF Control</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       What SVAPF Control meant was an important issue
                    in the trial. In this regard, according to the plaintiffs:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[T]he [d]efendants definition and use of the phrase “SVAPF
                        Control” keeps changing and it is different at different times. The
                        [d]efendants have at trial deviated from their pleaded case, and there are
                        three different versions of what the [d]efendants say is “SVAPF
                        Control”</p>
<p class="Judg-1">These three versions related to: (a) the defendants’ pleaded
                    case; (b) the deleted clause in the 27 November 2002 draft of the Outline;
                    and (c) cl 6 of the 4 November 2003 version of the unsigned Downside
                    Protection Agreement (“DPA”). The defendants did not dispute the
                    above assertion. In fact, in their reply submission, they stated that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… the [p]laintiffs submit that the [d]efendants do not have a clear
                        idea of what SVAPF Control means and that there is an “ever changing
                        definition” of SVAPF Control even within the many DPA drafts. They
                        claim that as a result, SVAPF Control cannot be implied. However, this is a
                        misreading of the requirement that an implied term must be capable of clear
                        expression. The only question which the Honourable Court needs to ask itself
                        is whether there was any lack of clarity in Clause 6, which is the
                        elaborated form of SVAPF Control. The answer must be no. Notably neither the
                        [p]laintiffs nor the [t]hird [p]arties have ever raised any ambiguity as to
                        how Clause 6 might apply. Clause 6 is clear and that in turn means that
                        SVAPF Control was capable of clear expression in the form of Clause
                        6.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">In response, the plaintiffs reiterated that “the [d]efendants
                    cannot even articulate with precision exactly what the terms of SVAPF Control
                    are. The court cannot imply terms which are vague or
                uncertain.”</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       The salient terms of cl 6 of the unsigned draft
                    DPA provided that before AVL, as nominee, exercised the “<em>conversion rights</em>” or “<em>any other rights arising solely on the occurrence of an event of
                        default</em>”, AVL was to seek instructions from both SAP and
                    SVAPF. If the instructions were in conflict, AVL had to take instructions from
                    whoever had the greater residual cost then outstanding. Further, before AVL
                    exercised “rights” under the respective notes, it need only take
                    instructions from or give notice to the party with the greater residual cost
                    then outstanding (<em>viz</em> cl 6.2). Given that
                    cl 6.1 provided for pro rata conversion of the SAP Notes and SVAPF Note,
                    control over the rights provided in cl 6 under the SAP Notes would
                    effectively lie with SVAPF as the latter would have a greater residual cost
                    outstanding at all times.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     In stark contrast, the relevant part of the
                    Outline (with the deleted portion) simply provided as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The security for the Loan amount held by SAP will be a further Note, the
                        Debenture and the Pledge Agreement. The Note will be held by SVAPF as
                        Nominee of SAP. <del>SVAPF will have the right to
                            exercise all the rights and provisions under the Note, the Debenture and
                            the Pledge Agreement as it in good faith after consultation with SAP
                            decides and cannot be replaced</del>.”</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The deleted sentence in the Outline was plainly different from the
                    provisions set out under cl 6 of the draft DPA. This was pointed out by
                    Ms Indranee Rajah, counsel for the plaintiffs. The defendants’
                    response to this was that cl 6 “<em>is the elaborated
                        form of SVAPF Control</em>”. This cover of
                    “elaboration” did not, however, explain the irreconcilable
                    differences between the Outline and the draft DPA. Adding to the differences,
                    the defendants’ pleaded case articulated yet another version of SVAPF
                    Control, wherein it averred that SVAPF Control related to conversion rights and
                    other rights pertaining to events of default or acceleration of payment
                        (<em>i.e</em>. corresponding roughly to the first part
                    of cl 6.2 of the DPA), without any suggestion to SVAPF Control being
                    extended to “other rights” (<em>i.e</em>. the
                    second part of cl 6.2 of the DPA). The failure to identify the terms and
                    scope of SVAPF Control consistently indicated strongly against the defence that
                    an agreement (or common assumption) on SVAPF Control existed.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">b.   Whether there was an express agreement as to SVAPF
                Control</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     The defendants’ main contention was that
                    there was an agreement between SVAPF and SAP for SVAPF Control, and that they
                    were therefore not obliged to issue the SAP Notes until the said control had
                    been documented and executed. This claim was made notwithstanding SVAPF’s
                    and SAP’s assertions that SVAPF Control was not agreed upon and did not
                    exist. In this regard, counsel relied on <em>Zurich Insurance
                        (Singapore) Pte Ltd v B-Gold Interior Design &amp; Construction Pte
                        Ltd</em> [2008] 3 SLR(R) 1029, to persuade this court to
                    adopt a contextual approach to contractual interpretation.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">i.   SVAPF’s and SAP’s positions</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     Significantly, SVMI, which had full control
                    over the affairs of SVAPF, took the position that SVAPF Control did not
                    exist:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Both SVAPF and SAP have denied any such binding agreement between them.
                        The parties asserting SVAPF Control are Silverlink and Argent –
                        parties who have no role in respect of SVAPF Control.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">SAP was also unequivocal in stating that SVAPF Control would have been
                    unacceptable to them and they would not have agreed to it. Given that <em>both</em> the purported parties to SVAPF Control (which does
                    not involve the defendants) had denied its existence, it was obvious that a
                    non-party had no basis to assert that there had been an agreement on SVAPF
                    Control.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">ii.   SVAPF IC / SCPL – Authority</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     Citing the testimony of several SVAPF IC
                    members, the defendants argued, <em>inter alia</em>, that
                    SCPL would not have compromised on SVAPF Control. In particular, NF said, in
                    cross examination:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">Q:</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">Can I just ask, then, a very simple question. Would
                            you accept that SVAPF would also want to control an exercise of right by
                            SAP under clause 6(B) of the note?</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">A:</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">Let me be very clear. At the investment committee,
                            the understanding was and the desire was that SVAPF controlled the
                            notes. It obviously wouldn’t control it if somebody else
                            controlled it. So it was very clear, as far as I was concerned, that
                            SVAPF would control the notes and would appoint the majority of the
                            board.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1">The defendants then pointed out that both Peter Everson
                    (“PE”) and Gary Carr agreed that if NF had agreed to SVAPF
                    Control, it was unlikely that SVMI as General Partner would have disagreed with
                    NF. Several points should be noted from the above. First, NF’s response to
                    the question posed to him was in the context of what SVAPF IC had wanted and not
                    what had been agreed upon between SAP and SVAPF. Secondly, taking the
                    defendants’ submissions at its highest, it was still possible for SVMI to
                    disagree with NF and/or the SVAPF IC (although in their view it would be
                    unlikely). At the same time, it should also be pointed out that SCPL, as
                    Investment Advisor, had no power to enter into any transactions or to make
                    investment decisions on behalf of SVAPF. The same applied to SVAPF IC whose
                    function was to consider and provide an objective review of the recommendations
                    of SCPL to SVMI/SVML. Nonetheless, the defendants continued to assert that SCPL
                    had been clothed with the necessary authority to secure an agreement on SVAPF
                    Control. A post-conflict letter dated 14 September 2006 by Lester Gray of
                    Schroders plc to investors of SVAPF stating that “<em>Schroders has deferred to Anil Thadani, as advisor to SVAPF and a director
                        of Silverlink, to represent the interests of SVAPF</em>”, was
                    cited in support. However, the third parties pointed to the fact that AT and
                    Sunil Chandiramani (“SC”) (both officers of SCPL) admitted that
                    SCPL had no authority to enter into agreements on behalf of SVAPF, and their
                    counsel Mr S Suressh thus submitted that the defendants had failed to
                    demonstrate that SCPL had any such authority.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     It was evident from the record that no express
                    actual authority existed. If there were any authority, it would have to be
                    either implied actual authority or ostensible authority: see <em>Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken v Asia Pacific Breweries (Singapore) Pte
                        Ltd</em> [2009] SLR(R) 788. Reverting to the facts, I am of
                    the view that SCPL could not have possessed any implied actual authority because
                    the evidence showed that as advisor, it had no authority to bind the fund. Entry
                    into binding agreements without prior approval would not be reasonably
                    necessary, and would also not fall within the usual scope of an advisor. In this
                    regard, SC’s own evidence contradicted the defendants’ case. While
                    he may be correct to say that it was not unusual for advisers to handle the
                    negotiations and documentations, he also conceded that “the ultimate
                    signing [was] done by the GP”. Quite evidently, this suggested that fund
                    advisors typically do not possess the authority to sign off on transactions or
                    enter into binding agreements. If the defendants meant to suggest that SCPL was
                    ostensibly authorised to bind SVAPF, that argument could not succeed since they
                    could not show any representation by SVAPF to SAP that SCPL (or its officers)
                    had the requisite authority to bind SVAPF on the issue of SVAPF Control. In the
                    circumstances, I had little hesitation in finding that SCPL and AT had no
                    authority (whether actual, implied or ostensible) to agree to SVAPF
                    Control.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">iii.   Leverage</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     The evidence showed that SAP had substantial
                    leverage during the material period. Under the Silverlink Shareholders
                    Agreement, the SVAPF Investment would have to garner approval from holders of
                    75% of Silverlink’s shares. It was not seriously disputed that the SVAPF
                    Note might potentially have resulted in a significant dilution of the existing
                    shares. What was disputed, however, was whether the 75% votes had been locked
                    in. The defendants contended that Asia Pacific Trust (“APT”) and
                    Byam Limited would vote in favour of the investment alongside Argent thereby
                    crossing the 75% threshold. The plaintiffs, on the other hand, maintained that
                    they could have blocked SVAPF’s entry and consequently, the Lodhi deal.
                    For the following reasons, I was inclined to the plaintiffs’ version of
                    events on this issue. First, the threat of substantial dilution meant that APT
                    would be unlikely to vote in favour of SVAPF’s entry (by way of the SVAPF
                    Note) if its exit was not assured. Second, a speedy exit on APT’s part was
                    required because it was perceived (by, amongst others, AT), at the material
                    time, that the Lodhi deal would fail if the SVAPF Investment was not swiftly
                    concluded. Contrary to AT’s testimony, this urgency was clearly documented
                    in numerous contemporaneous documents. It was the more probable
                version.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     Next, APT’s exit was in itself not
                    ensured unless Silverlink shareholders waived their rights to pre-emption. This
                    was because both Golden Land’s (the original purchaser) and later George
                    Robinson &amp; Liakat Dhanji’s (the replaced purchaser) offers were
                    conditional upon the waiver of pre-emption rights by the shareholders of
                    Silverlink. While the defendants submitted that APT’s exit was ensured as
                    either Golden Land or Rockline would acquire the APT shares, it was a weak
                    argument because Golden Land (or George Robinson &amp; Liakat Dhanji) could have
                    declined to proceed with the offers had the waiver not been put in place (at the
                    point the Transfer Notice was served). This would effectively put an end to the
                    Lodhi deal since Rockline was not bound to acquire the APT shares at the end of
                    the 45-day period. In the circumstances, Rockline, being a shareholder of
                    Silverlink, would therefore be in a position to jeopardise the Lodhi deal
                    because it could have refused to waive its pre-emption right, and thus imperil
                    both APT’s exit and the urgently required infusion of funds by SVAPF. That
                    in turn meant that SAP possessed substantial leverage in November 2002. It was
                    thus less likely to have agreed to the onerous terms imposed by way of SVAPF
                    Control.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">iv.   SAP’s commercial considerations</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     Any agreement on SVAPF Control would have
                    impinged upon SAP’s ability to exercise its rights independently under the
                    SAP Notes, and especially the right to exit the investment. As pointed out by
                    Ms Indranee Rajah, SVAPF Control would adversely affect the
                    plaintiffs’ ability to sell the SAP Notes to a third party. Further, given
                    the remaining 5 year shelf life of the fund, it would not have been commercially
                    sensible for SAP to agree SVAPF Control since that would conflict directly with
                    SAP’s limited fund life. That was then a live issue which appeared in
                    several correspondences during a relevant period (see below at <a href="#p1_19">[19]</a> where the text of NR’s e-mail is
                    reproduced). Some of the other provisions in SVAPF Control were also in
                    counsel’s words, “draconian and wholly inequitable” and
                    there was no reason why Macquarie (advisor to SAP) or SAP would have accepted
                    them. This “inequity” formed the basis for SAP’s assertion
                    that SVAPF Control would have been unacceptable to them and they would not have
                    agreed to it.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">v.   Whether SVAPF Control was agreed by way of the Outline and
                the 29 November e-mail</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     The defendants submitted that the negotiations
                    and correspondence leading up to and post-conclusion of the 3-page Outline were
                    evidence that an agreement for SVAPF Control had been concluded. Reference was
                    made to a conversation between AT and David Schaefer (“DS”) (as
                    evidenced in an e-mail dated 30 October 2002 from DS to Nick Ridgewell
                    (“NR”) and Craig Wallace), an executive summary sent on
                    7 November 2002 by AT to DS, as well as the evidence of SC. Reference was
                    also made to the Outline wherein DS deleted a sentence pertaining to control on
                    the basis that “that is part of documentation”. Both AT and DS
                    signed the Outline on 27 November 2002, wherein AT in his covering letter
                    also sought confirmation on the nominee issue. This was followed shortly by an
                    e-mail from SC to PE on 29 November 2002. The defendants contended that an
                    express agreement on SVAPF Agreement was reached as a result of the latter two
                    correspondences. The relevant portion of AT’s cover letter to DS on
                    27 November 2002 when he returned the signed copy of the Outline reads as
                    follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I am returning your version of the terms signed by me on the condition
                        that the final documentation will reflect our agreement that SVAPF will, at
                        all times, act as Nominee for SAP and cannot be replaced as Nominee.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">SC’s e-mail to PE on 29 November 2002 reads as
                    follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… you mention that Anchor [Victory] would act as Nominee for SAP
                        for the Superon related Note. Actually, AV would act as Nominee for all
                        Convertible Notes issued to SAP (e.g. they could get more Notes if Golden
                        Land does not come in later on). Also, as you may have noted from
                        Anil’s cover note SAP cannot replace AV as Nominee. The reason for
                        this arrangement is that we have build in a lot of protections into the Note
                        which effectively give us control of the Company. Given that we are
                        injecting $79.5mm [sic] this makes sense. However, all these rights do not
                        make sense for a smaller Noteholder. Therefore by AV acting as Nominee SAP
                        [e]ffectively shares in those rights pari-passu though it cannot
                        independently exercise any of them.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">In construing SC’s e-mail, it was important to emphasise again
                    that reference to any form of SVAPF Control had been removed from the Outline by
                    DS. Further, SC’s e-mail referred to “control of the
                    Company”, and any references to “rights” that follow would,
                    presumably have related to rights regarding “control of the
                    Company” (<em>i.e</em>. control of the Board).
                    Contrary to the defendants’ attempt to conflate control over Silverlink
                    with control over the SAP Notes, and AT’s testimony that to his
                    “frame of mind” control over Silverlink “automatically
                    translated to control of the notes”, the two were legally and factually
                    distinct. This distinction was consistent with DS’s evidence where he
                    stated that to his mind, control of the company meant majority board
                    representation. Further, DS had agreed with the obvious point that control of
                    Silverlink was different from control over the SAP Notes. In other words, in
                    DS’s frame of mind, control over Silverlink was limited only to the issue
                    of board representation. As for the “nominee” point raised by the
                    defendants, it was difficult to see how DS would have agreed to any form of
                    SVAPF Control, especially when he deleted the subsequent sentence in the
                    Outline. It seemed to indicate that “nominee” in the Outline
                    referred only to a nominee simpliciter. It should also be noted that SVAPF, the
                    only beneficiary of SVAPF Control, had taken the position that it did not
                    possess SVAPF Control. In the premises, I find that the Outline as well as the
                    27 November 2002 and 29 November 2002 correspondences did not support
                    the argument for SVAPF Control.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">vi.   Subsequent conduct</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     The defendants also relied on the
                    parties’ subsequent conduct. While it was common ground that
                    post-contractual conduct was irrelevant when construing a written contract, the
                    defendants argued that they could help determine whether the parties had agreed
                    to a “relevant term under an incompletely expressed contract”. The
                    defendants referred first to DS’s e-mail dated 17 December 2002. The
                    relevant words there were “<em>… the Notes which
                        are generally under the control of SVAPF</em>”. The
                    defendants’ counsel submitted that this was consistent with DS having
                    agreed to SVAPF Control on 27 November 2002. While I do not disagree with
                    the authorities cited by the defendants, the point remained that any purported
                    understanding on SVAPF Control between AT/SCPL and DS did not bind the principal
                    parties, namely SVAPF and SAP. AT and DS were just the fund advisors and any
                    understanding between them are non-binding until approved by SVMI/SVML and
                    SAPML. Perhaps both fund advisors thought that it might be appropriate to have
                    some form of SVAPF Control (which remained to be finalised), but such thoughts
                    did not, in themselves, create a binding agreement or prove the probability of
                    such an agreement. It should be noted that DS had caused the deletion of all
                    references of SVAPF Control from the Outline, and he also took a consistent
                    position that he had never agreed on behalf of SAP to SVAPF Control. The
                    defendants also relied on correspondence emanating from NR. An e-mail sent by NR
                    to PE in December 2002 was significant:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I noticed that the revised terms for <em>what is being put
                            forward</em> on the Notes mean that these may be outstanding for
                        up to 7 years before being redeemed or converted to equity, which I thought
                        was beyond the life of the Fund. I also understood that control of the
                        Fund’s notes would not be in the hands of the Fund or its advisers, so
                        that the Fund would not be able to engineer an exit itself. [emphasis
                        added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The defendants claimed that the above e-mail was “again
                    consistent with an agreement having been reached on SVAPF Control on
                    27 November 2002 between SC and DS”. A plain reading of the above
                    e-mail however showed otherwise. First, the words “what is being put
                    forward on the Notes” made it clear that an agreement had not yet been
                    reached given that a particular position had only been “put
                    forward”. Secondly, it was also apparent that NR was of the view that
                    SVAPF Control made little commercial sense to SAP as redemption or conversion of
                    the SAP Notes might stretch beyond the life of the fund, and control over the
                    SAP Notes would have slipped out of SAP or from its advisors. NR was clearly not
                    in favour of the position put forward. In my view, the said e-mail further
                    supported the plaintiffs’ and third parties’ contention that no
                    binding agreement on SVAPF Control had been reached, and that SVAPF would only
                    be acting as nominee simpliciter for SAP. Here, I should also add that the
                    instances cited by the defendants in support of the proposition that SVMI/SVML
                    had approved of SVAPF Control did not directly address the issue.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">vii.   The draft DPA</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     The defendants also took issue with the
                    parties’ conduct <em>vis-à-vis</em> the draft DPA. In
                    particular, they pointed out that NR had not objected to cl 6 of the DPA when
                    earlier drafts were exchanged. As for PE’s explanation that cl 6 was one
                    of the reasons why the DPA was not signed, the defendants claimed that this was
                    inconsistent with PE’s response when he received SC’s e-mail on
                    29 November 2002 (in relation to the Outline), and for this reason (and
                    others), PE’s use of cl 6 as a justification for the non-conclusion
                    of the DPA was an afterthought. A closer examination of SC’s
                    29 November 2002 e-mail and AT’s 27 November 2002 cover letter
                    however showed that they did not specifically refer to any agreement to give
                    control of any rights under the SAP Notes to SVAPF. Consistent with the Outline
                    (which deleted references to any form of SVAPF Control), the cover letter
                    referred only to SVAPF acting as nominee for SAP, and SVAPF having control of
                    Silverlink (which is different from control over the SAP Notes). PE could not
                    therefore have agreed to SVAPF Control (which entailed restrictions on
                    conversion and redemption) given that there were no references to the same in
                    the two cited correspondences. Finally, I also accept PE’s explanation
                    that the DPA was not signed partly because of cl 6. In the premises, I am
                    of the view that the draft DPA did not assist the defendants’
                case.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">c.   Conclusion on express/collateral agreement for SVAPF
                Control</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     For the above reasons (as well as my finding
                    below that the Outline was not a binding contract), I find that there was no
                    express or collateral agreement between any of the parties for SVAPF Control. I
                    should also state that at this point, I do not propose to venture into the
                    cross-allegations of conflict as I am of the view that they are irrelevant for
                    the purposes of determining whether there was an agreement on SVAPF
                    Control.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">III.   IMPLIED SVAPF CONTROL</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">a.   Whether SVAPF Control within parties’
                contemplation</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     The law on implied terms was discussed in the
                    Court of Appeal judgment in <em>Ng Giap Hon v Westcomb Securities
                        Pte Ltd</em> [2009] 3 SLR(R) 518 (“<em>Westcomb</em>”), at [34]–[40]. The question before this
                    court was whether SVAPF Control should be a “term implied in
                    fact”, as opposed to a “term implied in law”. See <em>Westcomb</em> at [31]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">First, an implied term, by its <em>very nature</em>
                        (as an <em>implied</em> term), would <em>not</em>, <em>ex hypothesi</em>, have been
                        in the contemplation of the contracting parties to begin with when they
                        entered into the contract. Secondly, if a term were implied on, so to speak,
                        a “broader” basis “in law” (as opposed to on a
                        “narrower” basis “in fact”), it would follow,
                            <em>a fortiori</em>, that such a term would not
                        have been in the contemplation of the parties for, as we shall see below (at
                        [38]), a term which is implied “in law” (<em>unlike</em> a term which is implied “in fact”) is
                            <em>not</em> premised on the presumed intention of
                        the contracting parties as such. Thirdly, it is clearly established law that
                        a term <em>cannot</em> be implied if it is <em>inconsistent with</em> an <em>express</em> term of the contract concerned. [emphasis in
                        original]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The defendant’s alternative case was that if SVAPF Control had
                    not been agreed between by SVAPF and SAP, “<em>there was
                        every likelihood that a chaotic state of affairs for Silverlink would
                        result</em>”, and Silverlink could receive conflicting
                    instructions from the three different noteholders. Those noteholders could veto
                    decisions made by Silverlink’s board, thereby compromising SVAPF’s
                    control over Silverlink. This, of course, begged the question why did
                    Silverlink, as note issuer, give away co-extensive rights to three different
                    parties in the first place? The references to the earlier form of SVAPF Control
                    in the Outline were inserted by AT but were deleted by SAP’s advisor, DS.
                    That being the case, SVAPF Control must have been within the parties’
                    contemplation (although no express agreement had been reached). Following
                        <em>Westcomb</em>, a term should therefore not be
                    implied given that “an implied term, by its <em>very
                        nature</em> (as an <em>implied</em> term), would
                        <em>not</em>, <em>ex
                        hypothesi</em>, have been in the contemplation of the contracting
                    parties to begin with when they entered into the contract” (see <em>Westcomb</em> at [31]). Further, at least one party, SAP,
                    made a deliberate decision not to agree to SVAPF Control. Any reference to SVAPF
                    Control had been deleted from the Outline, which was concluded on
                    27 November 2002 well before the execution of the RRA on 17 February
                    2003, which I note also contained an entire agreement clause (<em>viz</em> cl 7). Significantly, both parties to the alleged SVAPF
                    Control had since taken the stand that there was no express agreement on SVAPF
                    Control, and confirmed that it should not be implied. In the circumstances, it
                    was evident that SVAPF Control could not be implied as the issue was obviously
                    within the parties’ contemplation on or around the time the RRA was
                    concluded.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">b.   Officious bystander and/or business efficacy tests</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     The fact that the term sought to be implied is
                    within the parties’ contemplation would in itself be sufficient to dispose
                    of the point. However, even if the officious bystander test or business efficacy
                    test were to be applied and taking the defendants’ case at its highest, I
                    am of the opinion that SVAPF Control could not be implied because of the
                    expansive articulation of SVAPF Control. The portion of the Outline that was
                    struck out, SVAPF Control included “<em>all the rights and
                        provisions under the Note</em>”, while cl 6 of the
                    unsigned DPA depicted SVAPF Control as “<em>conversion
                        rights</em>” or “<em>any other rights
                        arising solely on the occurrence of an event of default”</em>
                    and “<em>other rights</em>”. If the concern
                    was truly over control of SVAPF, why would it be necessary for SVAPF Control to
                    include, <em>inter alia</em>, conversion rights, rights
                    upon default and other rights held by the SAP Notes? I shall deal with these
                    rights in turn.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">i.   Redemption</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     In respect of the 30-day redemption point
                    under cl 6(B) of the SVAPF Note, the fact that funds injected by SVAPF
                    could be used to repay SAP was irrelevant since SVAPF had maintained that there
                    was no SVAPF Control. If SAP desired to redeem, the onus would be on Silverlink
                    to raise sufficient funds to meet the redemption. As for the event of default
                    point, it would be commercially unacceptable to imply a term into an agreement
                    to prevent a noteholder from exercising an independent right to repayment in
                    order to allow the issuer to avoid repayment or default (the direct beneficiary
                    of which is again Silverlink).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">ii.   Conversion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     In respect of devolving SAP’s right of
                    conversion to SVAPF, AT’s evidence was that SAP could take
                    “control” of Silverlink with an investment of $17 million by
                    converting its SCRNs. This was to mistake ownership for control. If an agreement
                    on board representation had been placed, SAP would still not be able to control
                    Silverlink because shareholders of a company generally cannot interfere with the
                    management of a company as the power to manage the company was usually vested
                    with the board. In respect of the dilution point, the defendants contended, by
                    way of several illustrations, that “this could result in a situation
                    where an earlier conversion by one of the Noteholders will be diluted by a
                    subsequent conversion by another Noteholder”, which would be highly
                    inequitable, especially to SVAPF. It also emphasised that a “Mexican
                    stand-off” would ensue if SAP and SVAPF could not reach an agreement on
                    conversion. The defendants submitted that this would be avoided if SVAPF Control
                    was implied into the agreement. However, that a dilution could take place
                    unimpeded by a later issuance of shares at a lower notional price, as suggested
                    by counsel, was not consistent with the fact that SVAPF did manage to obtain
                    protections from future dilution by way of lower-priced shares: see
                    cl 9(B)(iii) of the Conditions, which provided:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Continuing undertakings:-</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The Company undertakes with the Noteholder that:-</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">(a)</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">it shall not issue any Shares within one (1) year
                            of any conversion of principal outstanding under the Note into Shares at
                            a price per Share lower than the price per Share at which such
                            conversion notionally took place; and</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">(b)</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">in the event that, Condition 9(B)(iii)(a) is not
                            complied with, it shall recalculate the number of Shares convertible on
                            such conversion at the first-mentioned price Share under Condition
                            9(B)(iii)(a) and issue the Noteholder the difference between the number
                            of Shares issued to the Noteholder on such conversion and the number of
                            Shares found by such recalculation at no cost to the
                        Noteholder.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1">The parties were free to negotiate the scope of anti-dilution
                    provisions, and so it was unnecessary to imply a term that would allow SVAPF to
                    control SAP’s conversion rights. Such control would have been unnecessary
                    in the face of a suitably drafted anti-dilution clause, which SVAPF could have
                    insisted on prior to its investment.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">iii.   Co-extensive rights</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     I turn now to the co-extensive rights. Some of
                    the more significant rights, <em>inter alia</em>,
                    are:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">1</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">the right to procure the appointment of a majority
                            of the directors of Silverlink;</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">2</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">the right to procure the appointment or removal of
                            the signatories of the bank accounts of Silverlink and its
                            subsidiaries;</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">3</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">the right to veto the acquisition of any freehold or
                            leasehold interest in or licence over land;</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">4</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">the right to veto the establishment of any credit
                            facility or making any borrowing;</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">5</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">the right to veto the approval of Silverlink’s
                            annual budget; and</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">6</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">the right to veto any increase in remuneration or
                            benefits of an employee the total cost of which is likely to exceed
                            US$100,000.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1">According to the defendants, it was incongruous for SAP to insist
                    on having exactly the same rights as SVAPF as “such rights would
                    compromise and even deprive SVAPF of its control over Silverlink if they could
                    be independently exercised”. It was also contended that very real
                    difficulties could arise if there were two Noteholders exercising the same
                    rights. Under the RRA, the Note to be issued to Rockline is defined as “a
                    secured convertible note to be issued by the Purchaser in substantially the form
                    and substance of the US$79.5M Note with necessary amendments but otherwise
                    ranking pari passu with the US$79.5M Note”. The defendants’
                    position was that notwithstanding the word “substantially”, the
                    SVAPF Note and the Rockline Note were in fact “identical” save for
                    the necessary amendments, which I understood to be the identity of the parties
                    and quantum <em>etc</em>. For instance, in submitting that
                    SVAPF Control should be implied as a term of the CRA, the defendants
                    said:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">256.1 Given that all the Notes are to be issued with
                            identical provisions (save for necessary amendments), the SAP Notes will
                            have rights of control over Silverlink which are co-extensive with those
                            of the holder of the USD79.5m Note. As pointed out in paragraph 99
                            above, such rights include the right to appoint the majority of the
                            directors on Silverlink Board, the signatories to the bank accounts of
                            Silverlink and its subsidiaries, the right to veto the acquisition of
                            any freehold or leasehold interest in or licence over land, the right to
                            veto the establishment of any credit facility or borrowing, the right to
                            veto the approval of Silverlink’s annual budget and the right to
                            veto any increase in the renumeration or benefits of an employee the
                            total cost of which is likely to exceed USD100,000.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The grant of veto rights to two different parties would not
                    necessarily create any conflict. However, to give two parties the right to each
                    other to appoint the majority of the directors would be unworkable (unless one
                    party did not insist on having a majority, as in SVAPF which initially requested
                    for only two board seats). It was also apparent that the defendants knew that
                    they would be giving co-extensive (and conflicting) rights to both SAP and SVAPF
                    since (in their own words) the rights given to the latter by the defendants were
                    “identical”. In these circumstances, it would not be necessary for
                    the court to imply any term. Instead, had both parties insisted (hypothetically)
                    on appointing the majority of the board, that would have been a breach (on the
                    defendants’ part) attracting the attendant consequences.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">iv.   SAP’s commercial considerations</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     SVAPF Control would also have been directly in
                    conflict with the limited remaining shelf life of SAP. Along with the reasons
                    set out at <a href="#p1_17">[17]</a> above, this was a strong
                    factor militating against the implication of SVAPF Control <em>vis-à-vis</em> the officious bystander test. For the foregoing
                    reasons, I am of the view that SVAPF Control should not be implied as part of
                    the CRA (assuming in the first place it exists) or in any of the agreements
                    between the plaintiffs and the third parties.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">IV.   MUTUAL COMMON ASSUMPTION/ESTOPPEL BY CONVENTION</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     The defendants contended that even if no
                    agreement on SVAPF Control existed, SVAPF Control was mutually and commonly
                    assumed by the parties and this gave rise to an estoppel by convention which
                    would have precluded the plaintiffs from denying the existence of SVAPF Control.
                    Counsel for the defendants, Mr Ramesh Kannan, submitted that the evidence
                    clearly established that SCPL on behalf of SVAPF operated under the assumption
                    that there would be SVAPF Control and that assumption was encouraged by the
                    conduct of SAP and its advisor Macquarie Asia Property Advisers Ltd. He argued
                    that, alternatively, the defendants were misled by the plaintiffs and the third
                    parties into believing that there would be SVAPF Control. Consequently, the
                    defendants proceeded on the assumption that SVAPF Control would be documented
                    and/or executed prior to the issuance of the SAP Notes. I reiterate my finding
                    that there was no agreement, at any point in time, between SVAPF and SAP on
                    SVAPF Control. There was also no evidence that the parties had acted in a manner
                    suggesting that SVAPF Control was a condition precedent to the issuance of the
                    SAP Notes. The fact that any reference to SVAPF Control was deleted from the
                    Outline as well as the fact that the DPA was not signed in part because of SVAPF
                    Control are incontrovertible evidence that there had been no common assumption
                    between SVAPF and SAP (as well as the defendants) on SVAPF Control. Further,
                    while there might have been an understanding between all parties that SVAPF
                    would have some form of control over Silverlink, control over the latter and
                    control over the SCRNs are distinct. In any event, from a commercial and a
                    reasonable point of view, I think that it would be astonishing for any note
                    issuer to assume that a given series of notes would be controlled by the
                    dominant noteholder in the absence of any clear instructions from the involved
                    parties. Further, if there had been any doubt, the defendants, as issuer, ought
                    to have verified and sought confirmation from the relevant noteholders. In any
                    event, as discussed in the preceding paragraphs, there was scant evidence and no
                    clear conduct (or something close to it) on the part of SVAPF and SAP that could
                    give rise to any assumption or estoppel on the defendants’ part. In my
                    view, therefore, such assumptions by the defendants would have been made by them
                    unilaterally and without any basis, and thus no estoppel could be raised in
                    their favour.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">V.   ISSUES PERTAINING TO THE THIRD PARTIES</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">a.   Whether the Outline is binding on SAP and SVAPF</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     As for the Outline itself (which contained
                    other terms apart from the deleted form of SVAPF Control), a further question
                    was whether it amounted to a binding agreement between SVAPF and SAP. The
                    plaintiffs’ case (while making it clear that SVAPF Control was not agreed
                    upon) on the issue was as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The [Outline] was put before the ICs of SVML and SAPML for formal
                        approval. The ICs approved the same, upon which it became a binding and
                        concluded contract.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The third parties, on the other hand, argued that the Outline was not
                    a binding agreement. Since the DPA was ultimately not signed, a binding Outline
                    would have meant that the plaintiffs should have the downside protection as
                    articulated in the Outline.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     Having considered the parties’
                    submissions on this point, I am of the view that the plaintiffs had failed to
                    discharge the burden of proving that the Outline was a binding agreement. First,
                    the “Outline of the Principle Terms of an Agreement” was described
                    as a “term sheet” by both SAP and SVAPF. Secondly, the signatories
                    to it did not have the authority to enter into binding agreements on behalf of
                    their respective funds. In this regard, it should be pointed out that AT signed
                    off “<em>on behalf of Schroder Capital Partners (Asia)
                        Limited</em>” while DS signed off “<em>on
                        behalf of the Senior Adviser to Schroder Asian Properties
                    LP</em>”. Both SCPL and the Senior Advisor to SAP have no authority
                    to enter into binding agreements for their respective funds (see also <a href="#p1_13">[13]</a> above). Further, the SVML minutes only stated
                    that it had considered the Outline and there was no indication of any agreement
                    or ratification of the same. As the third parties had rightly put it, at the
                    28 November 2002 meeting, “<em>[t]here [was] no
                        suggestion that SVML had agreed to anything else [apart from the US$79.5m
                        injection], in particular they did not agree to being bound by the
                        Outline</em>”. Further, an agreement to agree was not a binding
                    contract. Indeed, it would be commercially untenable to say that an agreement
                    existed simply based on the fact that a company’s board contemplated, in a
                    handful of paragraphs in its board minutes, the possible entry into a series of
                    agreements. On the facts I found, one would have expected that a binding
                    agreement of this nature, complexity and quantum would be entered into only
                    after extended negotiations between all parties with input from counsel (like in
                    the later case of the DPA), and not be based on “in-principle”
                    views to enter into arrangements/agreements outlined on those three pages of
                    paper.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">b.   The Capital Raising Agreement</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     The third parties also denied that they were
                    party to any umbrella agreement (characterised as the CRA by the plaintiffs and
                    the defendants). The plaintiffs and defendants submitted otherwise. In
                    particular, the plaintiffs asserted that the SVML minutes (referred to above)
                    made it clear that the third parties were aware of and were party to the CRA. As
                    I had found, the SVML minutes merely set out, in a brief manner, the various
                    transactions envisaged under the Outline (which I had found to be non-binding).
                    While it might be true that the SVML IC did envisage that certain transactions
                    would take place concurrently, they certainly did not agree to be part of any
                    umbrella agreement, or had agreed to partake in those agreements/transactions.
                    As Mr S Suressh, counsel for the third parties put it, the minutes
                    merely documented an internal consensus to further agreements, and there was no
                    resolution as to whether or not to enter into those agreements. In reality, the
                    only transaction that SVAPF had resolved to enter into at that meeting was the
                    US$79.5m loan to Silverlink as reflected by the recorded resolution. Looking at
                    the SVML minutes itself, one might also wonder why it was not resolved that the
                    Outline (defined as the “term sheet” in the minutes) be approved,
                    or that it be resolved that SVAPF agree to downside protection or the other
                    contemplated co-terminus transactions. The obvious answer to this seemed to be
                    that no binding agreement had been entered into by SVAPF in that regard
                        (<em>i.e</em>. the “Outline” and the
                    “CRA”).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">VI.   BRIEF ACCOUNT OF THE PRINCIPAL WITNESSES</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     PE and AT were a contrast in style and
                    clarity. Although the documentary evidence in this case in itself virtually
                    determined the verdict of this court, the oral testimonies of the principal
                    witnesses including PE and AT were important. PE seemed to me more knowledgeable
                    about the details and his response was calm and measured in the face of a strong
                    and long cross-examination by Mr Ramesh Kannan. AT, on the other hand, was
                    more porous and sweeping in his comments and his oral testimony often could not
                    be supported by the documentary evidence. One example was his assertion that he
                    was confident that the pre-emption rights would be waived, and even if they were
                    not, the first defendant “would just serve the pre-emption
                    notice.” As explained above, it was not that simple because Silverlink
                    could still find itself blocked. I found, in particular, the evidence of NF, DS
                    and Andrew Sykes to be more corroborative of PE’s evidence than SC’s
                    was to AT’s evidence. As I mentioned, this case was largely determined by
                    the documentary evidence and, therefore, the performance (and demeanour) of the
                    witnesses, though important, was not critical to the case. Although
                    discrepancies occurred in the testimonies of witnesses on both sides, that was
                    due mainly to the complexity of the case, the difficulty of a witness to recall
                    all details of a long and complicated story; and partly also, to counsel’s
                    forensic skills. I should, however, say that in judging the oral evidence in the
                    context of explaining the historical accounts, the evidence of AT, impressive in
                    its rhetoric, was, in my view, surpassed by the plaintiffs’ witnesses in
                    substance and coherence, by which I mean that they held up the plaintiffs’
                    case more plausibly than AT and SC did for the defendants.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">VII.   CONCLUSION</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     In conclusion, I hold that:</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">a.</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">Silverlink was in breach of contract for failing
                            to issue the Rockline Note;</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">b.</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">The defendants were in breach of their obligations
                            in relation to the Superon Repurchase;</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">c.</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">The Outline was not binding on the plaintiffs and
                            third parties; and</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">d.</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">The third parties were not parties to the
                            CRA.</div>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">VIII.   REMEDIES &amp; RELIEF</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     The third parties denied that AVL had agreed
                    to act as nominee for SAP. The plaintiffs contended otherwise. Based on the
                    documentation before the court, I am of the opinion that AVL had agreed to act
                    as nominee. In this respect, both the amended SVML minutes and the SAPML minutes
                    (both dated 28 November 2002) stated that “<em>[SVAPF], in the form of Anchor Victory Limited, would act as nominee for
                        [SAP]</em>”. This was supported by the resolutions passed by
                    AVL. As for the contention that AVL was a separate legal entity from SVMI/SVML
                    and ought not be bound by decisions made by the latter, it ran against the
                    resolution passed by SVML, as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">RESOLVED:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">That Schroder Ventures Asia Pacific Fund LP1 and LP2 makes a $79.5 million
                        Secured Convertible Loan [Note] to Silverlink Holdings Limited via an
                        investment holding company called Anchor Victory Limited and that authorized
                        signatories of Anchor Victory Limited be instructed to sign said Note in
                        accordance with its signatory policy.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">It was apparent from the above resolution that AVL took instructions
                    and acted in accordance with the directions of SVAPF. As such, AVL was the alter
                    ego of SVAPF. In the circumstances, I find that SVAPF/AVL did in fact agree that
                    AVL would act as nominee for SAP (there was however no evidence to suggest that
                    documentation of AVL’s agreement to act as nominee was a condition
                    precedent to the issuance of the SAP Notes). However, as the plaintiffs were no
                    longer keen on having AVL act as their nominee, I would be inclined to direct
                    that the SAP Notes be issued directly to the relevant SAP entities. That said,
                    as cl 6(A) of the SVAPF Note specified the repayment date as 30 June
                    2008 (which suggested that the SAP Notes had expired since the issuance terms
                    are identical to the SVAPF Note), I will hear parties (including Overseas Hotels
                    Limited) as to the appropriate remedies and relief before making any order
                    herein.</p>
