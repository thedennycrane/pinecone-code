</div> Chew’s evidence is that Oei was disgruntled about not having been informed of the Placement Agreement ahead of the announcement on 28 September 2017. Chew said that Oei accused him of issuing the Placement Shares to parties acting in concert with him, which Chew denied. Oei also threatened to cause trouble for Chew if he did not give in to his various demands namely, to issue shares to Yang or to cancel the Placement Agreement. Oei denies that any such threats were made. According to him, he merely expressed his concerns over the Placement Agreement, at [8]. He also suggested that the Placement Shares should be issued to Yang as a “strategic investor”.

In a Whatsapp exchange with members of the REC board, he wrote “[w]e will not accept his deferment but will accept his withdrawal.

In contrast, the defendant asserts that he and Oei reached the Agreement with the aim of reconciling and mending their strained relationship.

The plaintiffs’ Notice of Requisition not only called into question the propriety of the Placement Agreement, it also targeted Chew personally by seeking to remove him as Chairman and CEO. This so-called vote of no confidence from a substantial stakeholder applied a very public form of pressure on Chew. It also generated concerns amongst REC’s other shareholders (see [13] above).

The plaintiffs have a slightly different account. According to Oei, he received a call on 16 October itself from Sukma saying that Chew wished to meet him.

</div> However, this contradicts the evidence of Chew and Doris that it was Sukma who initiated the event. As Oei did not call Sukma to give evidence, he cannot rely on what he had heard from Sukma as evidence that it was Chew who initiated it. The best case for the plaintiffs is that it was Sukma who had initiated it, and she had given different accounts to the parties in a bid to convince them to meet. The worst case would be that it was Oei who asked Sukma to arrange it. Whatever it is, there is sufficient evidence that both men were given an indication that the purpose of the 16 October Meeting was for them to hear one another out in an informal setting.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 The overall tone of the meeting also supports this conclusion.

</div> Acknowledging the rift that had emerged between them, Chew explained that he and Oei spoke openly and honestly. There was no need for them to be as close as they had previously been, or even be friends, but there was also nothing to gain from them being enemies. They agreed, “[l]et’s don’t fight” and sought to bury the hatchet.

</div> They submit that Sukma’s evidence would be of little meaning or relevance because she was not party to the discussion between Oei and Chew and would not be able to offer any additional context to the Agreement.

Setting aside the substance of the Agreement, Sukma’s evidence is clearly relevant in either supporting or detracting from the conclusion that the 16 October Meeting was, at its heart, an informal social gathering.

The relatively short duration of the gathering indicates that the parties were focused on business.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 I am not persuaded by this argument. The defendant’s insistence that the 16 October Meeting lasted the entire course of the evening, even when there is evidence to suggest otherwise, can be attributed to a poor recollection of the event or a desire to buttress his case. I do not think that this detracts from the admitted evidence that the meeting was in the informal setting of Sukma’s dining room, with alcohol flowing, if not throughout, certainly at the end of it. When the evidence is considered in its totality, it becomes apparent that the driving force behind the 16 October Meeting was Oei’s and Chew’s personal relationship. This displaces any initial presumption that the Agreement reached between the two men occurred in a “commercial or business context”.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">What was the substance of the agreement? </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 I now consider the substance of the Agreement concluded at the 16 October Meeting and whether it was the common intention of the parties that this be legally binding.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 Preliminarily, the plaintiffs’ case is that this was an oral agreement. Alternatively, it was both oral and written, with the 16 October Note reflecting the written part of the Agreement. I find that if the parties did conclude a legally binding agreement, a point that I have yet to determine, it was both an oral and written contract. The plaintiffs rely on the inclusion of a specific word, the term, “procure”, in the 16 October Note to argue that certain obligations were undertaken by Chew (see [59] below). Whilst Chew gave evidence that the wording of the 16 October Note accurately reflected the preceding oral discussion

</div>, it is unclear whether the word “procure” was specifically used or if it emerged for the first time as Chew was recording the 16 October Note. Oei’s evidence sheds no light on this point because he could not recall the precise wording used by Chew during their conversation.

</div> In fact, he was more concerned with what was recorded in the 16 October Note. Given the importance of this term “procure” to the plaintiffs’ case, it follows that any agreement must have been both oral and written.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 The plaintiffs assert that there were two elements to the Agreement. Firstly, Chew agreed to “procure” a buyer for the plaintiffs’ shares by 15 November 2017 at a price of S$0.44 per share. Secondly, on condition that this was done, the plaintiffs would withdraw their Notice of Requisition.

</div> The defendant argues that the parties could not have intended this to be legally binding because if the terms of the Agreement were as the plaintiffs had characterised them to be, Chew would have been taking on a highly onerous obligation: to secure the sale of the plaintiffs’ shares at a substantial premium within a relatively short period. In the absence of any personal incentive, it is inconceivable that he would have agreed to this.

</div> I agree. The plaintiffs claim that Chew was the one who suggested a sale price of $0.44 per share and the deadline of one month. This account only makes sense if Chew was threatened by the impending EGM and was therefore willing to go to extensive lengths (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, propose and commit to a commercially insensible arrangement) to ensure the plaintiffs withdrew their Notice of Requisition.

</div> I have already found that the evidence does not support this.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 This is reinforced by the fact that there is no reference in the 16 October Note to the plaintiffs’ obligation to withdraw the Notice of Requisition. If the 16 October Note was indeed an accurate reflection of the pair’s discussion, and if the withdrawal of the Notice of Requisition was Chew’s ultimate objective, why did he fail to record this <span class="font-italic">quid pro quo</span>?

</div> Further, on the plaintiffs’ case, they were only obliged to withdraw the Notice of Requisition <span class="font-italic">after</span> the purchase of their shares. It is therefore curious why Oei met with Tan to prepare the draft announcement for the plaintiffs’ withdrawal of the Notice of Requisition, the day after the 16 October Meeting, even when there was no prospective buyer in sight. The plaintiffs’ eventual withdrawal of the Notice of Requisition on 15 November 2017, after the SPA with Peng fell through, raises similar questions. There is no reason why the plaintiffs should have felt compelled to withdraw the Notice of Requisition to uphold their end of the bargain when Chew had not performed. Under cross-examination, Oei accepted that there was no barrier to the plaintiffs simply commencing legal proceedings.

</div> The plaintiffs’ conduct therefore suggests that the withdrawal of the Notice of Requisition was not conditional on Chew securing a buyer. Rather, Oei had agreed to do so voluntarily. This also explains why the condition was absent from the 16 October Note.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 The fact that Chew reminded Oei, on or around 27 October 2017, that the last day to withdraw the Notice of Requisition was 2 November 2017

I accept Chew’s explanation that this was simply a matter of logistics; he needed to know whether the EGM would be going ahead because REC would have to print the relevant notices and secure a venue for the meeting.

</div> The plaintiffs’ withdrawal of their Notice of Requisition, while it would save Chew from embarrassment at the EGM, was not of any other consequence to him as he was certain that Oei’s ploy would fail. Considered holistically, there is only one logical explanation for why Chew agreed to the arrangement with Oei. Oei wished to make a “clean break”

</div> Why, the plaintiffs ask, would they have taken the trouble to prepare a written document when they could have simply told their families about their reconciliation? After all, Sukma and Doris were also present at the 16 October Meeting.

</div> This would only have been done if it had been anticipated that the 16 October Note would carry legal significance.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 In my view, the fact that Chew and Oei supplemented their oral discussion with the 16 October Note does not conclusively demonstrate an intention to create legal relations. Indeed, it suggests the opposite. Both Chew and Oei are experienced businesspersons. Had the Agreement been meant to be legally binding, as commercial men, they would have instructed their lawyers to draft a legal document to capture their obligations accurately. But they did not do so. They considered the 16 October Note, drafted by a layperson, to be adequate precisely because it <span class="font-italic">did not</span> hold a legal function. It is important to reiterate the context of the 16 October Meeting, which was a gathering for Chew and Oei to resolve their differences. Against this backdrop, it is plausible that the pair may have wanted to use the 16 October Note as a symbolic gesture, evidencing their reconciliation.

</div> The objective was simply to capture the essence of the pair’s “amicable solution”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 I add that, contrary to the plaintiffs’ suggestion, the wording of the 16 October Note does not clearly particularise the nature of the defendant’s obligations. The 16 October Note refers to the “last day of transaction” being 15 November 2017. The plaintiffs themselves appear to be unclear on what this would have entailed. On the plaintiffs’ case, “transaction” meant that the buyout of the plaintiffs’ shares would have been completed by 15 November 2017.

</div> There had to be a “done deal” although the sale itself did not have to be completed. The ambiguity stemming from the use of the word “transaction” is not surprising. The parties’ oral discussion lasted less than two minutes. They would not have gone into the specifics of what Chew had to do by 15 November 2017. They also chose not to elaborate on this point in the 16 October Note. The reason for this is clear. This was a voluntary arrangement with no legal force and there was therefore no need to do so.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 In any case, where the language of the 16 October Note <span class="font-italic">is</span> clear, it appears that the plaintiffs themselves did not consider these terms to be binding. The Agreement envisaged a sale of the plaintiffs’ shares to a buyer found by Chew. Yet in his subsequent discussions with Tan and Chew, Oei continued to propose that he buy out the Chews or that Chew buy out the plaintiffs,

The plaintiffs cannot take the position that there was a binding contract when Oei’s subsequent conduct indicates the contrary.

This also coheres with what Oei understood from Chew during their oral discussion, which was that Chew would “guarantee” him or “undertake” to get a buyer.

While Chew was not agreeable to either of these suggestions, he agreed to help Oei look for a buyer.

The simple reason for this is that the word “procure” accurately captured his obligation to conclude a sale of the plaintiffs’ shares.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 As I have already found, the 16 October Meeting was an informal gathering organised in the hope of reconciliation between Oei and Chew. I have also determined that the parties did not actively apply their minds to the significance of the words used in the 16 October Note (at [55] above). They would not have considered the various nuances and connotations to “procure” and why this may have been a preferable word choice over other possibilities. Assessing the parties’ use of “procure” in the context of the events of 16 October 2017, I find that they only intended that Chew would find a <span class="font-italic">bona fide </span>buyer for the plaintiffs by 15 November 2017. He was not obliged to ensure that a deal was concluded or that the plaintiffs’ shares would be sold by 15 November 2017. My reasons are as follows.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 It is clear from the context of the discussions between Oei and Chew that the full terms of any sale and purchase agreement between that buyer and Oei would have to be negotiated as the Agreement only specified the price of the shares and no other term. Both Oei and Chew are experienced businessmen. They could not have contemplated that a transaction involving some $60m would be completed without the involvement of lawyers to sort out the compliance issues as well as the details of how payment would be effected. They would have expected that the buyer might need to obtain funding from a financial institution and there could be negotiations on the terms of payment. Indeed, there was such negotiation. Peng had initially offered to make payment in RMB on account of capital controls in China. However, Oei rejected this and they settled on payment in Singapore dollars (S$) in ten weekly instalments. There was also some toing and froing regarding the sale and purchase documentation. Chew presented a 10-page draft agreement for the sale and purchase to Oei, but the latter wanted it to be simplified to a single page document. Although Oei said in his affidavit of evidence-in-chief that he was not obliged to enter into such negotiations

</div>, this was not communicated to Chew at the time. Given the scale and nature of the transaction, it was a position that I do not think Oei could have held at the time.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 Turning to the second question, whether Chew had fulfilled his obligation to find a <span class="font-italic">bona fide</span> buyer by 15 November 2017, I find that he had done so, for the reasons given below.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 It is common ground that Chew provided Oei with the SPA for Oei to sign on 28 October 2017. The SPA provided for payment in ten weekly instalments with a transfer of the corresponding number of shares to take place at each payment. The SPA was a single page document in accordance with Oei’s request. However, Oei changed his mind and told Chew that he wanted Peng to pay a 20% deposit and the remaining payments to be in eight weekly instalments of 10%. Oei would transfer the first 10% of shares upon receipt of the first weekly instalment, with transfers of further 10% with each subsequent weekly instalment and the balance 30% would be transferred in the final weekly instalment. In short, Oei wanted a 20% down payment without any transfer of shares. He said that he would withdraw the Notice of Requisition only after receipt of the 20% deposit. Chew proceeded to communicate this to Peng who reverted to say that he no longer wished to proceed with the transaction.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 The plaintiffs say that Chew could not have fulfilled his obligations because Peng’s offer was not genuine. The “clear and compelling inference” to be drawn from the circumstantial evidence is that Peng was not a real buyer and Chew was the person behind the alleged offer.

But Oei did not call Sukma to give evidence on the context of his WhatsApp messages to her, which on the face of it, contains protestations by Sukma that there was a <span class="font-italic">bona fide</span> intention by Chew to purchase her Swiss property. For reasons similar to those discussed at [45] above, the plaintiffs’ failure to call Sukma as a witness undermines Oei’s evidence on this point.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 Indeed, Oei does not deny that he changed the terms previously agreed upon, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, payment in ten weekly instalments with 10% of the shares to be transferred upon receipt of each instalment, to the requirement of a 20% down payment and transfer of the first 10% shares to be made only upon payment of the first weekly instalment.

Indeed, after Chew informed Oei of this, Oei told Chew that he was prepared to revert to the previous terms, but it was too late.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 The situation can be summarised as follows. Peng was prepared to purchase the shares at the price stated and negotiations had reached the point where both parties agreed on payment by ten weekly instalments with 10% shares to be transferred on each instalment. However, Oei changed his mind at the last minute, which caused Peng to lose his patience and pull out. The issue is whether, in the circumstances, Chew had fulfilled his obligation under the Agreement to “procure a buyer”. It was Oei’s unreasonable behaviour that caused the deal to be called off by Peng. The parties could not have contemplated that Chew had to find a buyer who would patiently suffer Oei’s last minute requirements to significantly change the terms of the deal they had agreed upon.

</div> In the course of negotiating the sale and purchase agreement with Peng, Oei should have either accepted payment in RMB, which was Peng’s original offer, or agreed to payment in ten weekly instalments. By insisting that Peng pay a deposit of 20% of the purchase price by 30 October 2017 and the balance in weekly instalments, which resulted in Peng backing out of the agreement, Oei did not take all reasonable steps to mitigate the plaintiffs’ losses (citing <span class="font-italic">The “Asia Star”</span> [2010] 2 SLR 1154 (“<span class="font-italic">Asia Star</span>”) at [24]). The plaintiffs contend that this argument is misconceived because the duty to mitigate only arises after an event of breach.

The Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Asia Star</span> held that the question that underpins the reasonableness inquiry is: “what a reasonable and prudent man in the trade … have done in the ordinary course of his business if he had been in the aggrieved party’s shoes” (citing <span class="font-italic">Dunkirk Colliery Company v Lever</span> (1878) 9 Ch D 20 at 25). It added that the standard of reasonableness required is not difficult to meet. An aggrieved party is not expected to “act in a way which exposes it to financial or moral hazard, such as taking steps which might jeopardise its commercial reputation or partaking in hazardous litigation…” (<span class="font-italic">Asia Star</span> at [31]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">73 It was known from the outset that Peng could not make a lump sum payment for the plaintiffs’ shares unless the transaction currency was RMB. It was the plaintiffs’ position that this constituted a breach of contract. Any analysis on damages must proceed on the basis that the plaintiffs’ position is correct, in that Chew’s failure to procure a buyer to complete the purchase of the plaintiff’s shares by 15 November 2017 constituted an actionable breach of the Agreement. Therefore, by 28 October 2017, there was no buyer in sight who could purchase the shares by 15 November 2017 and a breach was imminent. Peng was the <span class="font-italic">only </span>buyer willing to purchase the plaintiffs’ shares at the required premium but it was conditioned on payment in ten weekly instalments. Pursuant to this tentative arrangement, a sale and purchase agreement was drafted by Tham and vetted by Oei. By insisting on a substantial change to the SPA’s terms, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, a 20% deposit, at the eleventh hour, Oei undid an arrangement that would have secured the plaintiffs’ desired purchase price of over $60m.

I do not agree with the plaintiffs’ characterisation that there was no available market at the material time, justifying a departure from the market price rule. The facts of <span class="font-italic">ABD</span> are helpful in illustrating my reasoning. <span class="font-italic">ABD</span> concerned a breach of contract for the sale of 200 tons of high-grade Italian electrolytic zinc of 99.97% purity. This high-grade zinc was not dealt with on the London Metal Exchange (at 465); the market traded on zinc with a purity of 98%. It would have been more difficult for the sellers to re-sell the zinc. Notwithstanding this, Sellers J held that there <span class="font-italic">was</span> an available market (at 466). It was not necessary to establish the existence of a physical market (<span class="font-italic">eg</span>, a fixed place or building). There were sufficient traders, who made deals off the London Metal Exchange, which dealt with this type of high-grade zinc. The takeaway from <span class="font-italic">ABD</span> is this: the fact that there is a potential difficulty in selling goods, due to either quantity or quality, does not mean there is insufficient demand and therefore no available market. A court may adopt a broad interpretation of “market” in making this determination. On the present facts, putting aside the size of the plaintiffs’ stake and the potential difficulties in selling this as one lot, there would have been an even greater likelihood of an available market than in <span class="font-italic">ABD</span>. This is because REC shares are publicly listed shares on the SGX, which offers a broad pool of potential buyers.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">77 I am also unpersuaded by the other authority cited by the plaintiffs in furtherance of this argument. In <span class="font-italic">Scandinavian Bunkering (Singapore) Pte Ltd v MISC </span><span class="font-italic">Bhd </span>[2015] 3 MLJ 753 (“<span class="font-italic">Scandinavian Bunkering</span>”), the parties entered into a fixed price bunker contract to purchase and accept delivery of 102,600 metric tons of marine fuel oil. Pursuant to this, the buyer took delivery of 20,334.59 metric tons of oil. However, following a significant decline in oil prices, the buyer wrongfully refused to accept any further deliveries. The Federal Court of Malaysia held that due to the declining market, the remaining marine oil could not have been disposed of in one lot (at [59]). The Court proceeded to calculate the appropriate measure of damages by determining the difference between the contract price and market price that the oil would have fetched if it had been sold in tranches from October to December 2008. This, the plaintiffs say, illustrates how courts adopt a “commercially realistic approach” in calculating damages where the market cannot absorb the asset at one go.

</div> I am not so certain. The contract between the parties in <span class="font-italic">Scandinavian Bunkering</span> stipulated delivery to take place over a period of three months – from October to December 2008 (at [7]). Seen in this context, the Court in <span class="font-italic">Scandinavian Bunkering</span> was not taking a rough and ready or pragmatic approach in computing damages. It simply considered the market price(s) over the original contractual timeframe for delivery. The contract in <span class="font-italic">Scandinavian Bunkering</span> is quite unlike the nature of the Agreement, which was to conclude the sale of the plaintiffs’ shares by a <span class="font-italic">specific date</span>.

</div> Mr Lie considered this a useful reference because the Placement Shares were placed only about a month before the material date for the assessment of damages, 15 November 2017. Further, because the Placement Shares exceeded the daily trading volume of REC’s shares, the discount offered by REC would be relevant in determining the appropriate discount for an even larger parcel of shares. Minimally, the blockage discount on the plaintiffs’ shares would have had to be higher than 9%.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">82  As for the upper bound of his range, Mr Lie took a two-step approach. First, he referred to the research of Dr Shannon P Pratt (“Dr Pratt”), a well-known authority in the field of business valuation. More specifically, Mr Lie looked at Dr Pratt’s study of nine American tax cases where blockage discounts of between 3.30% and 27.50% had been applied. Using this range, Mr Lie preliminarily concluded that the appropriate range in the present case should be between 9% and 27.5%. He then undertook a second stage of analysis, envisaging a scenario where the plaintiffs’ shares would have been sold in parcels over a period from 15 November 2017 (the “dribble out method”). I pause to note that this differs from the factual premise on which he based his initial calculations (9% and 27.5%), the plaintiffs’ shares being sold as an entire block.

</div> Mr Lie used the same method of calculation at [75] to determine that the plaintiffs would have received approximately $33.57m from the sale of their shares. This is an average price of $0.25 per share, a 25.55% discount to the price of $0.33 per share. He used this second figure to adjust his upper bound value downwards. Applying his blockage discount range, Mr Lie calculated that the resulting range for damages is $19.09m to $26.55m.

</div> The mere fact that the plaintiffs were able to requisition an EGM does not mean that they had a degree of influence over REC’s operations. Mr Nicholson’s assertion that a controlling interest could even be held by a shareholder with a 10% stake, the minimum required to call an EGM pursuant to s 176(1) of the CA, further detracts from the plausibility of his position.

If there <span class="font-italic">was</span> pressure, it is also uncertain whether this would have been due to the size of the plaintiffs’ stake, as opposed to Oei’s business personality and the nature of his relationship with Chew. In any case, the disagreement between the parties on this point is somewhat academic. Mr Nicholson’s own position is that the control premium may well have been 0%. This would place his lower bound value at 9%, the same value identified by Mr Lie. Taking into consideration the discount on the Placement Shares, it is relatively certain that the blockage discount on the plaintiffs’ shares would have been greater than 9%. The question which remains is, how much greater?</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">87 In my view, a blockage discount of 13%, as put forward by Mr Nicholson, is appropriate. Mr Nicholson primarily arrived at this figure via linear extrapolation, using the blockage discount applied to the Placement Shares as a point of reference.

</div> I disagree. The assessment of any applicable blockage discount is not a precise mathematical exercise. The experts can only make educated guesses as to what would have happened had the plaintiffs’ shares been listed on 15 November 2017. When cross-examined on this point, Mr Nicholson clarified that he was not proposing a general method for assessing blockage damages.

</div> In the present case, there was historical data available indicating that a discount of 9% had been applied to a 9% block of REC shares, not long before the material assessment date. <span class="font-italic">Both experts</span> considered this data relevant in the calculation of their blockage discounts. I accept Mr Nicholson’s reasoning that a 12.88% stake would have attracted “a slightly larger discount”

</div>
</div> and that 13% reflects a reasonable estimate.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">88 It is also important to highlight that Mr Nicholson cross-checked his figure of 13% against other cases/resources, as set out at [83(a)] to [83(c)]. None of the blockage discounts applied in those case studies exceeded 15%. This dispels notions that Mr Nicholson’s figure is grossly off the mark. Applying a 13% discount to a 12.88% share value is a fair extrapolation based on data from the listing of the Placement Shares.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">89 Even if I were inclined to reject the figure put forward by Mr Nicholson, there are inherent difficulties with Mr Lie’s methodology. The first is his heavy dependence on Dr Pratt’s research. In his report, Mr Lie acknowledges that blockage discounts are “based on the facts and circumstances of each case”.

</div> Yet he premised his initial upper bound value of 27.5% entirely on Dr Pratt’s research. No analysis was done on how this research is applicable to the present factual matrix. Further, Dr Pratt’s study focused on blockage discounts in the context of American tax cases. This presents a difficulty because, as noted by Mr Nicholson in his report, a number of these cases involved shares that were subject to the US Securities Exchange Commission’s trading restrictions.

</div> Shares subject to such restrictions are considered less valuable than freely traded shares. Separately, four of the cases considered by Mr Lie did not involve publicly traded shares in a listed entity; one related to the sale of real estate properties and three involved shares being traded over the counter rather than being listed on a public exchange.

</div> Given these notable factual differences, the American cases are not a reliable guide in determining the applicable blockage discount.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">90 The second main issue with Mr Lie’s upper bound value relates to his use of the dribble out method. As I have alluded to above, Mr Lie used two different premises to determine the range of his blockage discount. Whilst the calculation of his lower bound value assumed the plaintiffs’ shares as having been sold as a block on 15 November 2017, he relied on hindsight information, details of REC’s share price and trading volume <span class="font-italic">after</span> 15 November 2017, to determine his upper bound of 25.55%.

</div> The dribble out method narrows the range of the blockage discount by calculating the exact amount the plaintiffs would have received from the sale of their shares. This explanation does not address the fact that Mr Lie’s upper bound value is derived from a conceptually different starting point.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">91 There are also practical difficulties with relying on the dribble out method.

Conversely, if they had fallen very strongly, he would have calculated a much bigger discount.
