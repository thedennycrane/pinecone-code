<p class="Judg-Author">
        Choo Han Teck J:</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       The
accused is a 26-years old Malaysian who was arrested and charged
for importing 22.24g of diamorphine when he drove into Singapore
on 12 April 2012 at 5.15am. He was charged under s 7 of the Misuse
of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2008 Rev Ed) (“MDA”). The offence is punishable
under s 33 of the MDA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The
prosecution adduced evidence, unchallenged by the accused, that at
the material time the accused drove a Hyundai Sonata bearing a Malaysian
licence number JHY 93 from Malaysia. The car passed through the
immigration booths at the Woodlands Checkpoint. SSgt Chan Tim Fatt, an
officer from the Immigration and Checkpoints Authority (“ICA”) noticed
the black-tinted windows of the car and stopped the vehicle. He then
told the accused to go to an inspection pit for a thorough check
by other ICA officers.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       ICA
Sergeant Chen Zhongfu Roger searched the accused and his belongings
but nothing incriminating was found. He and ICA Sergeant Aidil Rafael
then searched the car. Sgt Aidil Rafael lifted the tray inside the centre
arm-rest console next to the driver’s seat. He saw a black bundle
in the console under the tray. Officers from the Central Narcotics
Bureau (“CNB”) were alerted and Sgt Goh Yang Lun went to the inspection
pit and took custody of the two black bundles. W/SSSgt Kengadhelagam
and SSgt Chew Tai Waif of the CNB went with Sgt Goh.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       W/SSSgt
Kengadhelagam recorded a statement from the accused at the inspection
pit at 5.43am. She asked the accused about the black bundles. The
accused stated that he did not know anything about them because
the car belonged to his friend ‘Nathan’. The two black bundles were
opened and the contents sent to the Health Sciences Authority of
Singapore (“HSA”). The contents were examined and analysed by an
analyst of the HSA, Miss Lim Jong Lee and she certified that the
contents were diamorphine weighing 22.24g.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       The
accused gave a number of statements to the CNB in the Tamil language
through the Tamil interpreter Mr Manickam. None of his statements
were directly incriminatory. His cautioned statement was recorded
on 12 April 2012 between 3.35pm and 4.46pm. He stated that he had
done nothing wrong and that he only came to Singapore to work. He stated
that the car belonged to his friend.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       The
prosecution also adduced the record of the calls made to and from
the cell phone used by the accused. The record shows that one ‘Balu’ called
at 12.20pm on 11 April 2012. He called again on 12 April 2012 at 1.22am
and the accused subsequently called him at 4.15am on the same day. About
40 minutes later at 4.47am the accused received a call from one ‘Nathan’.
The accused then called one ‘Batte’ at 5.06am and at the same time
also called ‘Nathan’. At 5.12am ‘Batte’ returned call. The accused
was arrested about 5.15am. Thereafter, ‘Balu’ called at 5.20am,
‘Batte’ called at 5.38am, ‘Nathan’ called at 6.03am and ‘Balu’ called
again at 6.34am. All these calls went unanswered because the accused
was in the custody of the ICA officers.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       On
the evidence adduced by the prosecution, I was satisfied that a case
against the accused was sufficiently made out for him to enter upon
his defence. The accused elected to testify. His defence was that
he had no knowledge that there were two black bundles in the console
box, and therefore, there was no knowledge that he was driving a
car with the 22.24g of diamorphine into Singapore.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       Under
ss 18(2) and 21 of the MDA, the law presumes the accused in the
circumstances (as here proved by the prosecution) to be in possession
of the drugs knowing them to be so. These are rebuttable presumptions
and the accused must persuade the court that he did not know that
he was in possession of the drugs in question. I now set out these
provisions below for ease of reference.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-Heading1">
<b>Presumption
of possession and knowledge of controlled drugs</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>18.</b> – …</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(2)    Any
person who is proved or presumed to have had a controlled drug in
his possession shall, until the contrary is proved, be presumed
to have known the nature of that drug.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-Heading1">
<b>Presumption
relating to vehicle</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>21</b>.    If
any controlled drug is found in any vehicle, it shall be presumed, until
the contrary is proved, to be in the possession of the owner of
the vehicle and of the person in charge of the vehicle for the time
being.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       The
accused testified that he was born in Penang, Malaysia on 16 November
1987 and obtained an equivalent of the Secondary Four level education.
His father died about five years ago. His mother works as a security
officer. He told the court his employment history. The accused says that
he worked as a petrol pump attendant in Pasir Panjang, Singapore.
He first worked there in 2006 but subsequently worked in the Port
of Singapore Authority as well as the Jurong Port. He then worked
as an ‘operator’ in a company in Kaki Bukit but stopped working
there about February or March 2012 when he was dismissed for not
reporting for work regularly. He then went back to work at a Caltex
station in Bukit Batok and was still employed there when he was
arrested for the present offence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     He
has been riding motorcycles and driving cars without licence from Malaysia
to Singapore. He bought a motorcycle in Malaysia for RM6,000 and
was making instalment payments of RM250 a month but had not kept up
payment from January to April 2012. He rode his motorcycle to two places
in Singapore on 9 April 2012 looking for a job as a security guard.
He testified that he worked in Caltex in 2006 and ‘did not like
the job and didn’t want to return to the same job’. However, he
returned to Caltex to work as a pump attendant. His first day back
at work was 10 April 2012. He went to work on his motorcycle.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     On
11 April 2012, the younger brother of the accused told him that the
motorcycle shop called asking for payment of arrears of the instalments. The
accused then spoke to a person at the motorcycle shop and asked
for an extension of time till he has been paid by Caltex. He then
left for work. He went home after work that evening about 11.30pm.
He was afraid that the motorcycle will be repossessed by the shop,
so he called his friend ‘Balu’ (whom he had known for four years)
and asked to borrow his motorcycle. ‘Balu’ told him that the road
tax had expired for his motorcycle, and offered to get a car from
a common friend, ‘Nathan’, for the accused.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     On
the morning of 12 April 2012, the accused called ‘Balu’ at 4am and told
him to tell ‘Nathan’ that he (the accused) would be going to ‘Nathan’s’ house
to collect the car. The accused arrived at ‘Nathan’s’ house thirty minutes
later, left his motorcycle there and took the car from ‘Nathan’.
He drove it straight to McDonald’s and left the car unlocked in
the carpark while he went to buy his breakfast. At that point, one
‘Batte’, a close friend of ‘Balu’ telephoned the accused and asked
him where he was. Nothing transpired when the accused told ‘Batte’
that he was at McDonald’s. Thereafter, he returned to the car and
drove to Singapore where he was arrested.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     That
was the summary of the accused person’s effort to rebut the presumption
of knowledge of the contents in the black bundles found in the console
box of the car.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     I
find the story of the accused implausible to have even created any doubt
in my mind as to his knowledge of the drugs in his possession. The reason
for borrowing ‘Nathan’s’ car (through ‘Balu’) was strange and illogical.
The fear that his motorcycle would be repossessed does not justify leaving
it in ‘Nathan’s’ house and taking ‘Nathan’s’ car to work instead.
No explanation was given as to how that helps against the repossession
of the motorcycle by the shop. There was no elaboration as to how
long he intended to keep ‘Nathan’s’ car or how long he intended
to leave his motorcycle at ‘Nathan’s’ house.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     The
accused did not explain why he needed to contact ‘Balu’ and trouble
‘Nathan’ at 4am in the morning. There was no evidence that ‘Balu’ and
‘Nathan’ also believed that the motorcycle would be repossessed
should the accused ride it into Singapore, and thus, it was a situation
that required the three of them to be involved in passing ‘Nathan’s’
car to the accused. Nothing that the accused did or said when he
was arrested and his car searched exculpated him in anyway. They
were mere denials and attempts at passing off ignorance of the illicit
contents in the car. Although the accused testified that he had
left the car unlocked and unattended when he went into McDonalds
to get his breakfast, I find no evidence to suggest that someone
else planted the drugs in the car during that time. If there were such
a person, it would have been utterly senseless for him to plant
the drugs inside the car and hope that the accused would again leave
it unlocked and unattended in Singapore for that person to retrieve
the drugs. By this evidence the accused appears to show that if
he had known that there were drugs in the car he would not have
left the car unlocked. If that were the only reason for this evidence,
I am of the view that it was self-serving and I do not believe it.
There was no other evidence that persuaded me that this evidence
could be accepted.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     I
am of the view that the accused have little room and imagination
to present a more credible account of why he was driving a car with
drugs to Singapore at 5am – when he was only required to start his
shift as a petrol pump attendant at 3pm. The story as he presented
was probably the best he could adduce in the circumstances. I therefore
find that the evidence of the accused to be untrue and that the
presumptions against him under ss 18(2) and 21 of the MDA have not
been rebutted. Accordingly, I found him guilty as charged. The Deputy
Public Prosecutor Mr Lim informed the court that the Public Prosecutor
was not issuing a certificate of substantive cooperation under s 33B(2)(<em>b</em>) of the MDA to the accused. Thereafter,
the accused’s lawyer Mr Kanagavijayan informed the court that he
has no further submissions to make on behalf of the accused. I therefore
sentenced the accused to suffer the mandatory punishment of death.</p>
