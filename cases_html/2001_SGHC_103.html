<p align="justify">2 Section 45, which is within Part V of the Bankruptcy Act which relates to

<u>
<p align="justify">THE APPLICANTS AFFIDAVIT FILED ON 18 SEPTEMBER 2000</p>
</u>
<p align="justify">3 In the Applicants affidavit filed on 18 September 2000, he listed five

reasons for this application:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">(1) the primary reason was to get some form of final settlement to his

  financial problems which were taking a toll on his mind, his health and his career;</p>
<p align="justify">(2) while he was presently unable to repay all his creditors in full, he

  believed that he would be able to repay a substantial amount with an initial lump sum payment of

  $4.4 million within six months of his proposal being accepted;</p>
<p align="justify">(3) if the creditors commenced legal proceedings against him, the costs (which

  would mostly be on an indemnity basis) would add to his financial misery without helping the

  creditors in any way;</p>
<p align="justify">(4) the general scheme of his proposal was to pay an initial lump sum payment

  of $4.4 million within the first six months and to repay at least 50% of his debts over 27 months,

  with a high probability of full repayment; and</p>
<p align="justify">(5) rendering him a bankrupt would not help the creditors in recovering the

  money owed to them.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">4 Various legal proceedings have been commenced against him and one creditor (Coutts

Bank) presented a Bankruptcy Petition against him in February 2000 and which was to be heard on 22

September 2000.</p>
<p align="justify">5 The Applicant wished to have Mr Ho Wah Onn, a practising Advocate &amp;

Solicitor, to be his nominee and trustee for the purposes of this application and to carry into

effect the scheme proposed. Mr Ho has been the solicitor for the Applicant and his companies on

previous occasions. On 12 September 2000, the Applicant gave written notice of his proposal to Mr Ho

which contained a summary of the scheme of voluntary arrangements.</p>
<p align="justify">6 The Applicant then set out his personal history. He is 43 years of age, married

and has a daughter aged eight and a son aged six. He is a director of Mapor Island Resort Pte Ltd

which was set up to market and to manage a resort development project in Bintan, Indonesia.</p>
<p align="justify">7 He completed his A level examinations in Singapore in 1978 as a private

student while serving National Service. He then worked as flight steward until October 1980 when he

became a property agent. He was very successful as a property agent until the 1983 recession. He

then decided to enrol as a student in the Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences, National University

of Singapore.</p>
<p align="justify">8 To support himself through university, the Applicant continued to deal in

property and bought into a hairdressing business. He also traded in seafood on a fairly large scale.

All this were too much a strain on him and he had to apply for a years leave from his studies.</p>
<p align="justify">9 By 1988, his mainstay business was trading in properties. He also ventured with

MBf Holdings Bhd into the food business and set up a company. He has since sold all his shares in

that company to the other shareholders.</p>
<p align="justify">10 In July 1990, he married and then incorporated his family investment company,

Elle Holdings Pte Ltd. Elle performed very well from 1990 to 1995 and even made an extraordinary

gain of some $9 million in 1995 from the sale of its investment properties.</p>
<p align="justify">11 In 1994, the Applicant ventured into the forestry business and incorporated

SINO P.N.G. Resources Pte Ltd. He still owns about 35% of the equity of SINO which has a paid up

capital of nearly $6 million.</p>
<p align="justify">12 Elle has a convertible loan of about $2.5 million due from SINO which, when

converted into equity, would cause Elle and the Applicant to own a combined and controlling stake of

57% of SINO.</p>
<p align="justify">13 In August 1996, the forest assets of SINO (three large concessions in the

Republic of Congo) were valued at US$52 million. In his proposed scheme of voluntary arrangements,

it was stated that these concessions were held through SINOs fully owned subsidiary which owned

80% of them. In 1995, Idris Hydraulics Bhd, a public company listed on the main board of the Kuala

Lumpur Stock Exchange, made an offer to purchase 50% of the equity of SINO for US$40 million. That

offer was rejected by the shareholders as the company was then valued at US$120 million by

Rothschild Ventures Asia. In the said proposed scheme of voluntary arrangements, the Applicant

stated that the Asian financial crisis had caused SINO to suspend its operations since mid-1997.</p>
<p align="justify">14 In 1995, Elle re-entered the property market and purchased 26/A/B/C/D Ewart

Park, Singapore for about $11 million. After spending another $600,000 on renovations, these

properties generated about $300,000 of annual rental income between 1996 to the middle of 1998.</p>
<p align="justify">15 In March 1996, Elle purchased 733 Mountbatten Road, Singapore. The property

was refinanced in July 1997 by Coutts Bank (Schweiz) AG, with a total drawdown of $7.75 million.

Elle also borrowed US$9 million from the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China ("ICBC")

to finance the forestry business and to renovate the Ewart Park properties.</p>
<p align="justify">16 The Applicants liabilities arose as a result of his personal guarantees

given to various banks for loans granted to Elle. Except for Coutts Bank, none of the other banks

had issued any demand for repayment and the Applicant was working cordially with them to resolve his

financial matters. The loan from Coutts Bank was used to repay the previous mortgagee bank $5.8

million, to repay ICBC $200,000, to repay a loan of $1 million to Galleries Development Pte Ltd, to

extend a friendly loan of $500,000 to the Grandlink Group Pte Ltd and to set aside $200,000 to

service the loan. The outstanding debt due to Coutts Bank is $1.45 million.</p>
<p align="justify">17 Elle has sued Grandlink for $450,000 and obtained judgment against Grandlink

and its guarantor, Ricky Goh. Ricky Gohs bankruptcy, execution of that judgment was delayed until

late June 2000 when the bankruptcy order against Ricky Goh was rescinded.</p>
<p align="justify">18 On 18 August 2000, Elle was ordered to be wound up on the petition of Coutts

Bank. Elle was appealing against that order and would proceed to reinstate its claim against Coutts

Bank for fraud and would seek substantial damages arising from the banks action.</p>
<p align="justify">19 The proposed scheme of voluntary arrangement was necessitated by Coutts Banks

relentless pursuit to bankrupt the Applicant and put an end to any further claims against the bank.

Coutts Bank was still holding a parcel of land of about 330,000 square feet in the prime Tanjung

Langsat Industrial Estate in Johor worth RM 2 million as security. When subdivision of that piece of

land was approved, its value could be easily enhanced to at least RM 8 million. As Coutts Bank could

afford to sit and wait for the value of the land to rise over time, it had little to lose in making

the Applicant bankrupt to the disadvantage of his other creditors. Coutts Bank would do everything

to prevent him from succeeding in the proposed scheme. As the matter was being investigated by the

police, the Applicant was unable to disclose further information on it. The Applicant enclosed a

letter dated 12 June 2000 from the AGs Chambers informing him that his letter dated 2 June 2000

had been forwarded to the police for investigations. The subject heading of that letter was

"Report against false Affidavit used in Court proceedings".</p>
<p align="justify">20 The Applicants proposed scheme of voluntary arrangements listed the

following as his assets:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">(1) a three-room HDB flat in Holland Close;</p>
<p align="justify">(2) 1.3 million ordinary shares in Elle, said to be worth about $21.5 million;</p>
<p align="justify">(3) 2.15 million ordinary shares in SINO, said to be worth about $18.4 million;</p>
<p align="justify">(4) 150,000 ordinary shares of Mapor Island Resort Pte Ltd;</p>
<p align="justify">(5) 330,000 square feet of land in Tanjung Langsat, Johor, worth RM 2 million;</p>
<p align="justify">(6) Villa Puteri condominium worth RM 300,000, pledged to RHB Finance Bhd for

  about RM 300,000.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">21 His liabilities to creditors amounted to some S$28 million and RM 300,000. In

addition, he owed his family and friends S$290,000.</p>
<p align="justify">22 The proposed scheme of voluntary arrangements dated 12 September 2000, after

describing Elle and SINO, continued as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"<b>MAPOR ISLAND RESORT PTE LTD ("MAPOR")</b></p>
<p align="justify">This name of this company was changed in 1994 to reflect the change in the

  principal activities of the company. The company has been awarded a project management and

  marketing contract to manage and market a large scale resort development project in Bintan,

  Indonesia. The principal terms of the contract are as follow:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">1. Mapor will procure a project loan of not less than US$20 million. For her

    role, Mapor will be paid a fee of 20% of the loan procured subject to a maximum fee of US$8

    million. The loan must be procured within a 12 month period.</p>
<p align="justify">2. Mapor will also manage the project. For her role, Mapor will be paid a fee

    equivalent to 2% of the project cost. At a projected cost of approximately S$150 million, Mapor

    will earn a gross fee of approximately S$3 million. The net fee is expected to be about S$1.2

    million. This fee is expected to be paid over a 36 month period.</p>
<p align="justify">3. Mapor will market the entire project and is expected to earn approximately

    S$8 million in gross fees. The net fee receivable is expected to be about S$4 million. The

    marketing of the project is scheduled to commence by the first quarter of Year 2001.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">In total, Mapor will earn a net income of approximately US$4 million (S$6.8

  million) within 12 months and another S$5.2 million over another 36 months. This translates to an

  income of about S$450,000-00 every quarter.</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">THE REPAYMENT PROPOSAL</p>
</b>
<p align="justify">It is anticipated that apart from the proposed sale of the forest concession by

  a restructured Elle, the bulk of the income will be derived from Mapor, which anticipate a total

  fee of almost S$12 million within 36 months.</p>
<p align="justify">Setting aside a budgeted sum of S$20,000-00 per month for business expenses,

  this will take up S$72,000-00 over a 36 month period. Personal expenses of S$5,000-00 or

  S$180,000-00 over 36 months will also be provided.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">This will leave not more than S$11.1 million for distribution to the creditors.

  A provision of 20% of the anticipated income or about S$2.2 million should be made, leaving a net

  sum of S$8.9 million for final distribution to creditors.</p>
</b>
<p align="justify">This final sum of S$8.9 million does not include the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">1. Additional fee income to be earned from the procurement of a loan

    exceeding US$20 million.</p>
<p align="justify">2. Additional fee income to be earned from a higher sale value of the

    project.</p>
<p align="justify">3. Repayment of monies due from Grandlink Group Pte Ltd or its guarantor.</p>
<p align="justify">4. Sale of all or part of the Congo forest concession.</p>
<p align="justify">5. Rental income from the lease of the properties estimated at S$360,000-00

    per annum.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">SCHEDULE OF PAYMENT</p>
</b>
<p align="justify">The following schedule of repayment is proposed:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">1. All creditors listed in Annexure B owed less than S$50,000-00 to be fully

    repaid within 6 months from the date of acceptance of the scheme of voluntary arrangement by the

    creditors.</p>
<p align="justify">2. All creditors listed in Annexure B owed more than S$50,000-00 with the

    exception of the creditors listed under (10) to be repaid 50% of all monies due to them. For the

    purpose of determining monies owing, the <b>outstanding debt</b> shall be the gross amount owing

    as at 31 August 2000 less the market value of any security pledged to the creditors.</p>
<p align="justify">3. Further to Paragraph 2 above, a sum of not less than 25% of the

    outstanding will be paid to the creditor within 6 months, failing which an extension of 3 months

    to fulfill the initial lump sum payment is required.("the initial payment")</p>
<p align="justify">4. A further lump sum payment of another 10% of the outstanding debt to be

    made within 6 months from the last payment date.("the second payment")</p>
<p align="justify">5. A further lump sum payment of another 10% of the outstanding debt to be

    made within 6 months of the second payment.("the third payment")</p>
<p align="justify">6. A final lump sum payment of 5% of the outstanding debt to be made within 6

    months of the third payment.</p>
<p align="justify">7. All interest shall cease to be payable from 1 September 2000.</p>
<p align="justify">8. Elle be granted the rights to market the properties held by the creditors

    directly or otherwise to ensure a transparent and orderly disposal of the assets.</p>
<p align="justify">9. Secured creditors to maintain the properties for as long as they remain in

    the possession of the creditors.</p>
<p align="justify">10. In the event of any additional income derived under Clauses 1 to 4 of the

    Repayment Proposal, the proceeds will be divided as follow:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">(a) 80% of the net proceeds to be paid to all secured creditors in

      proportion to their share of the outstanding debt up to the full outstanding as at 1 September

      2000.</p>
<p align="justify">(b) 20% of the net proceeds to be paid to all unsecured creditors in

      proportion to their share of the outstanding debt up to the full amount outstanding as at 1

      September 2000.</p>
<b>
</b></blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">WHY THIS SCHEME WILL SUCCEED</p>
</b>
<p align="justify">The opportunity for Mapor to raise money using the assets of a third party

  gives the scheme a greater probability of success. The minimum amount of money to be raised does

  not exceed 20% of the current valuation of the property to be pledged for the loan. That same loan

  is also utilized to start the project. This will lead to the management and marketing contract to

  crystallize.</p>
<p align="justify">There is sufficient assets in Sino, if properly managed or disposed off, to

  repay a substantial portion of the outstanding loan.</p>
<p align="justify">The property market is in consolidation and improving at a very stable and

  steady rate. The approval of a sub-division of the land in Johor held by Coutts will realize at

  least RM 4 million. Leasehold land sold by the Johor Corporation in the same location is being

  sold for approximately RM 25 per square foot. The land in question is freehold in tenure and will

  support a minimum value of RM 8.25 million.</p>
<p align="justify">The local and regional economies are growing very rapidly after recovering from

  the Asian financial crisis in 1999.</p>
<p align="justify">A large portion of the outstanding loan was caused by foreign exchange loss and

  interest and further penalty interest accrued over the last 30 months.</p>
<p align="justify">In supporting the scheme, creditors stand to be repaid at least 50% of the

  outstanding debt and a high probability of being repaid in full.</p>
<p align="justify">The past 30 months were very unproductive with too much time spent in

  litigation and defending various legal actions brought about by both creditors and debtors alike.

  If the scheme is approved, I will be focused on raising money and looking for opportunities to

  fulfill my legal responsibilities."</p>

<p align="justify">23 On 2 October 2000, the Deputy Registrar of the Supreme Court granted an order

in terms of prayers (1) and (2) of the application and made no order on prayer (3). He granted an

the proposed scheme and to make recommendations. He also asked that the interim order be extended

for another 28 days.</p>

<p align="justify">THE ORDERS OF COURT DATED 6 NOVEMBER 2000 AND 20 NOVEMBER 2000</p>
</u>
<p align="justify">27 The Deputy Registrar extended the interim order by another two weeks to 20

November 2000.</p>
<p align="justify">28 On 20 November 2000, the Applicants solicitor applied for a weeks

adjournment to file the Nominees report on the meeting held on 15 November 2000. The Deputy

Registrar extended the interim order by another week to 27 November 2000.</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<u>
<p align="justify">THE NOMINEES AFFIDAVIT FILED 28 NOVEMBER 2000</p>
</u>
<p align="justify">29 A copy of this affidavit was used at the hearing on 27 November 2000. The

Nominee reported that at the meeting held on 15 November 2000, he raised the issue of a potential

conflict of interests as his law firm had acted for the Applicant in a number of matters. He had

also informed the creditors that he would file an affidavit setting out such matters and would not

act as Nominee should the creditors or he (the Nominee) take the view there might be a potential

conflict of interests.</p>
<p align="justify">30 The Nominee then went on to say that he was of the view that such a conflict

could arise but, in order to facilitate the proceedings, it was decided at the meeting that the

documents relating to Elle, SINO and Mapor requested by the creditors would be produced by the

Applicant by 27 November 2000 for their perusal before they consider the proposed scheme.</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<u>
<p align="justify">THE ORDER OF COURT DATED 27 NOVEMBER 2000</p>
</u>
<p align="justify">31 The Deputy Registrar discharged the Nominee and extended the interim order to

4 December 2000 for another Nominee to be appointed.</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<u>
<p align="justify">THE APPLICANTS AFFIDAVIT FILED 2 DECEMBER 2000</p>
</u>
<p align="justify">32 The Applicant stated that it would be very difficult for him to appoint

another Nominee within a week as it took him more than eight weeks to appoint Mr Ho Wah Onn. He had

earlier sought the assistance of an accountant whom he had known for more than ten years but who

asked him "to place some money into account for the work needed to be done" and he was

unable to comply with that request. Mr Ho Wah Onn later agreed to act as Nominee without any fee or

charge after studying the proposed scheme for more than two weeks.</p>
<p align="justify">33 Only two creditors solicitors had felt uncomfortable with Mr Ho acting as

Nominee and they had agreed to seek their clients instructions to retain Mr Ho as Nominee but had

not reverted to the Applicant. As Mr Hos expertise was in financial restructuring and as it would

be an uphill task for the Applicant to convince a suitable person to be Nominee without some form of

assured payment, the Applicant pleaded that Mr Ho be retained as Nominee.</p>
<p align="justify">34 Alternatively, he asked for four weeks to search for a substitute and "to

search for some funds from family and friends to pay for these services". He would furnish the

documents requested by the creditors through his solicitors.</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<u>
<p align="justify">THE ORDERS OF COURT DATED 4 DECEMBER 2000 AND 8 JANUARY 2001</p>
</u>
<p align="justify">35 On 4 December 2000, the Court granted the Applicants solicitors request

for more time and extended the interim order to 8 January 2000.</p>
<p align="justify">36 On 8 January 2001, the Applicants solicitor requested another four weeks

and if the matter could not be resolved by then, he would leave it to the Court to deal with the

matter as it deemed fit, including the possibility of discharging the interim order. The request was

again granted and the interim order was extended by another four weeks to 5 February 2001.</p>
<u>
<p align="justify"> </p>
</u><u>
<p align="justify">THE APPLICANTS AFFIDAVIT FILED ON 3 FEBRUARY 2001</p>
</u>
<p align="justify">37 Two days before the adjourned hearing, the Applicant filed an affidavit

stating that Ms Winifred Gomez, an Advocate and Solicitor, had consented to act as Nominee and that

she had undertaken to file an affidavit affirming her consent within two weeks as she was then

attending to her mother who had suffered a stroke on 28 January 2001.</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<u>
<p align="justify">THE ORDER OF COURT DATED 5 FEBRUARY 2001</p>
</u>
<p align="justify">38 At the hearing on 5 February 2001, the solicitor holding a watching brief for

Coutts Bank attended and informed the Court that the bank was of the view that the interim order

should be discharged as it was more than three months since the order was made on 2 October 2000

(indeed it was more than four months).</p>
<p align="justify">39 The Deputy Registrar agreed and discharged the interim order as he felt that

the matter had been "outstanding without any positive result for a long time". The

Applicant appealed against this decision.</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<u>
<p align="justify">THE APPEAL</p>
</u>
<p align="justify">40 One day before the hearing of the appeal, the Applicant filed an affidavit

stating that Ms Winifred Gomez had agreed to act as Nominee on or about 15 January 2001 and he had

intended to ask her to file an affidavit a week before the expiry of the interim order on 5 February

2001. Unfortunately, Ms Winifred Gomezs mother became seriously ill from 29 January 2001 and Ms

Gomez was therefore unavailable for the entire week to attend to this matter.</p>
<p align="justify">41 He also informed the Court that Coutts Bank had written to the Court to

restore its bankruptcy petition against the Applicant and that the hearing was scheduled for 23

February 2001. He then repeated his allegations as to why Coutts Bank was bent on making him a

bankrupt despite being a creditor for only 5% of his total debts while ICBC, which was a creditor

for about 85% of his total debts, was willing to explore the proposed scheme.</p>
<p align="justify">42 Since November 2000, he had prepared the documents requested by the creditors.

He stated that the Loan Compensation Agreement and the Project Management and Marketing Agreement in

respect of Mapor Island Resort Pte Ltd "were obtained at great cost to me and only concluded

after several months of negotiation with the other party".</p>
<p align="justify">43 The Applicant also exhibited a list of prices of land published by the Johor

State Economic Development Corporation which showed that 60-year leasehold land in the Tanjung

Langsat Industrial Estate was offered at between RM 15 to 17 per square foot. His enquiries revealed

that 99-year leasehold land was being offered at RM 27 to 30 per square foot. His freehold land in

that industrial estate would be worth RM 8.9 million at RM 27 per square foot.</p>
<p align="justify">44 Further, he had applied to the Johor Land Office for the full conversion and

subdivision of the said land and out of a total of ten departments reporting to the Johor Land

Office regarding his application, only two had not replied. His consultants had advised him that the

entire process would not take more than six months. Once approved, the land could be readily sold or

refinanced for more than the S$1.45 million owing to Coutts Bank.</p>
<p align="justify">45 He had spoken to the Official Receivers office on 14 February 2001 and that

office indicated its support and consent to pursue Elles claim against its judgment debtors. He

wished to make it known to his creditors that there were enough assets and sources of income to

repay them if the proposed scheme was properly executed.</p>
<p align="justify">46 He asked that the interim order be restored and that Thomas Tham Kok Leong, an

Advocate and Solicitor, be appointed Nominee. Mr Thomas Thams consent to so act was enclosed.</p>
<p align="justify">47 At the hearing of the appeal on 21 February 2001, the solicitor for Coutts

Bank held a watching brief but was given permission to take part in the proceedings. I was informed

by the Applicants solicitor that the Applicant was not able to pay the $10,000 or so requested by

people he had approached to be his Nominee. However, by virtue of the Mapor agreement in which he

was the broker, he would get 20% of whatever amount was successfully negotiated and the loan he was

brokering was US$50 million. I was also informed that "the police case against Coutts Bank is

still outstanding".</p>
<p align="justify">48 I was not persuaded that anything useful would come out of the extension of

the interim order and therefore dismissed the appeal against the Deputy Registrars discharge of

the interim order.</p>
<p align="justify">49 I agreed to hear further arguments upon the written request of the Applicants

solicitor.</p>
<p align="justify">50 On 29 March 2001, the same parties attended before me to present further

arguments. As "the bulk of the income will be derived from Mapor" apart from the proposed

sale of the forest concessions, (see the proposed scheme) and since the Mapor Commercial Loan

Fee/Compensation Agreement signed on 11 October 2000 was to expire after 180 days (i.e. on 10 April

2001), I decided to see what the Applicant could come up with in respect of this agreement and

adjourned the hearing to 12 April 2001.</p>
<p align="justify">51 On 11 April 2001, the Applicant filed another affidavit to inform the Court of

the status of the various aspects of his proposed scheme, highlighting "the key issues in

evaluating the feasibility of the scheme". The affidavit stated:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"<b>MAPUR ISLAND RESORT PROJECT</b></p>
<p align="justify">4. The viability for the entire project depends entirely on the ability of the

  developer and/or the project manager to raise the necessary project financing. This task as

  elaborated in my scheme filed on 18 September 2001 (sic) has been assigned to Mapor Island Resort

  Pte Ltd, a company beneficially owned by me.</p>
<p align="justify">5. As at 28 October 2000, a Term Sheet outlining a funding proposal was

  received by Atlas Group Holdings Limited ("Atlas"), a company owned by one Chay Kok Kee,

  an ex-banker with Overseas Union Bank Limited acting on behalf of Mapor Island Resort Pte Ltd.</p>
<p align="justify">6. The funding proposal anticipated a maximum loan of USD$85 million with a

  lump sum drawdown of not less than USD$74 million at closing. Given the difficulties in obtaining

  credit for Indonesian based projects, I decided that despite the very high cost involved in the

  loan proposal, it was a proposal that was worth some consideration.</p>
<p align="justify">7. The loan was structured as a 5 year non recourse term loan with an annual

  interest rate of 275 basis points above the average 10 year U.S Treasury rate. This worked to an

  interest rate of nearly 8.5% per annum. A copy of the Term Sheet is now annexed and exhibited as

  "ELWB-1".</p>
<p align="justify">8. Above the payment of interest, there were an assortment of other one time

  fees amounting to about 17% of the loan amount. There is also a requirement for the lender to

  participate in the business of the borrower. Of the 17% fee requested, 6% will be utilised for the

  payment of credit enhancement of the loan.</p>
<p align="justify">9. The proposed loan is essentially monies raised from the sale of bonds

  guaranteed by an AAA rated financial institution. The syndicate arranging and underwriting

  the loan comprises the following companies:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">a. The Allianz Group Ag acting as Guarantor whose sole responsibility is the

    enhancement of the credit rating of the financial papers issued by the Syndicate for a fixed fee</p>
<p align="justify">b. Seattle Northwest Securities Corporation acting as the Investment bank,

    transfer and placement agent.</p>
<p align="justify">c. MKD Capital Corporation acting as the Syndicator and Correspondent. MKD

    Capital Corp will also participate as a direct lender in a portion of the loan. Information of

    these companies are annexed and now exhibited as "ELWB-2".</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">10. There were various communication between the loan broker and Atlas lasting

  right up to late January 2001 but the parties could not come to any concrete agreement as the land

  owner of the Mapur project is still unable at this point in time to accept the level of

  participation required by the lenders. The lenders have proposed a total equity participation of

  30% of the entire project, a percentage that the land owners felt was too high. The lenders have

  also indicated the willingness to negotiate further.</p>
<p align="justify">11. The loan broker wrote to Atlas on 22 March 2001 to enquire whether we are

  still interested in pursuing the Mapur project financing loan. A copy of their email is now

  annexed and exhibited as "ELWB-3". We have yet to reply to them as I am still

  negotiating with and convincing the land owners to come to terms. As the land value was bout S$192

  million as at 28 June 2000, the cost of the 30% equity participation amounted to about S$13

  million after deducting the loan to be disbursed. A copy of the valuation of the Mapur land as at

  30 June 2000 is annexed and exhibited as "ELWB-4".</p>
<p align="justify">12. It is my belief that with an improvement in the political and economic

  climate of Indonesia, it will become less difficult and cheaper to raise money for projects there,

  even as Indonesian banks financial instruments become more acceptable to other interested

  lenders.</p>
<p align="justify">13. I have in the meanwhile written to the owners of the Mapur project seeking

  an extension of the Loan Fee/Compensation Agreement dated 12 October 2000 for a further period of

  180 days from the current expiry date of 12 April 2001. The owners have agreed to the extension

  and I had on 2 April 2001 despatched the necessary documents for their execution. I understand

  that they have returned the documents duly executed on 6 April 2001 to the mailing address given

  to them. A copy of my letter seeking the said extension and my receipt of the despatch is now

  annexed and exhibited as "ELWB-5".</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<b>
</b></blockquote>
<p align="justify">FOREST ASSETS OWNED BY SINO-PNG RESOURCES PTE LTD</p>
<p align="justify">14. Following the improvement of timber prices worldwide and the ban on logging

  of forest in China, I have received several enquiries from forestry companies in Malaysia and

  China in respect of possible joint ventures in the exploitation of the forest assets in the Congo.

  I have, in particular, renewed communications with a major forestry company in America to discuss

  a previously aborted asset swap to jumpstart the logging operations in Congo. A copy of this

  communication is now annexed and exhibited as "ELWB-6".</p>
<p align="justify">15. The forest assets in Congo remains intact even though logging operations

  have ceased since late 1996. I intend to renew my effort in pursuing the injection of these assets

  into any sound company listed in any of the stock exchanges in the region.</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">LAND IN TANJUNG LANGSAT, JOHOR</p>
</b>
<p align="justify">16. I had on 29 March 2001 obtained a valuation report from Raine &amp; Horne

  International Zaki + Partners advising that the open market value of the properties was RM20-00

  per sq ft. Given a total land area of approximately 330,000 sq ft, the gross value of the land is

  approximately RM6.6 million. A copy of the valuation is now annexed and exhibited as

  "ELWB-7".</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">26A, B, C &amp; D EWART PARK SINGAPORE</p>
</b>
<p align="justify">17. The properties were last valued by the mortgagees valuer, Henry Butcher

  Appraisal Group Pte Ltd on 19 February 2001 at S$10 million. This valuation may now be inaccurate

  in view of the recent changes pertaining to the sub-division of land in that area. I now annex and

  exhibit as "ELWB-8" a Business Times article dated 31 March 2001 in which it was

  reported that a smaller plot of land in the same location was allowed to be sub-divided into 3

  smaller plots. The plots have been put on sale with an expected price of S$11 million to S$11.7

  million. I intend to apply for the same sub-division from the proper authorities as soon as

  possible.</p>
<p align="justify">18. In view of the information shared, the progress and the recent development

  surrounding the viability of the Scheme, I urge the Court to assist me in putting the Scheme into

  effect on a continual basis without disruption of any nature. I can achieve much more if I am left

  to focus on the matters at hand, instead of wrangling with one or two creditors in and out of

  Court. Should I be made a bankrupt, my Scheme will fall apart as all these projects requires my

  personal involvement and efforts. I have to date proven that given the opportunity, I am capable

  of implementing the Scheme with the desired results. The interest and rights of my creditors have

  not been compromised at any time and indeed, the value of the securities that they hold have

  already been enhanced."</p>

<u>
<p align="justify">THE DECISION OF THE COURT</p>
</u>
<p align="justify">52 The Law and Practice of Bankruptcy in Singapore and Malaysia (1999) states (at

page 22):</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"Broadly, a voluntary arrangement is a statutory regime that facilitates

  and enables an insolvent debtor to enter into a binding arrangement with his creditors in respect

  of payment of the debtors debt. The regime was introduced in 1995 as part of Singapore law by

  the Act, and the governing positions can principally be found in Part V of the Act.</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">The local regime is based mainly on the provisions contained in sections 252

   263 of the UK Insolvency Act 1986, the provisions of which, in turn, were first introduced in

  the UK in 1985. In the circumstances, the English cases on the construction of the relevant

  provisions of the UK Insolvency Act 1986 are helpful and persuasive."</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">53 Sections 46 and 48 of our Bankruptcy Act read:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"46. (1) Every debtor making a proposal for the purpose of this Part shall

  in such proposal appoint a nominee to act in relation to the voluntary arrangement either as

  trustee or otherwise for the purpose of supervising its implementation.</p>
<p align="justify">(2) No person shall be appointed as a nominee unless he is </p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">(a) registered as a public accountant under the Accountants Act (Cap. 2A);</p>
<p align="justify">(b) an advocate and solicitor; or</p>
<p align="justify">(c) such other person as the Minister may, by order published in the <i>Gazette</i>,

    prescribe.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">(3) The Minister may make rules prescribing the scale of fees to be charged by

  nominees assisting debtors in respect of voluntary arrangements.</p>
<p align="justify"></p>
<p align="justify">48. (1) The court shall not make an interim order on an application under

  section 45 unless it is satisfied that </p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">(a) the debtor intends to make a proposal for a voluntary arrangement;</p>
<p align="justify">(b) no previous application for an interim order has been made by or in

    respect of the debtor during the period of 12 months immediately preceding the date of the

    application; and</p>
<p align="justify">(c) the nominee appointed by the debtors proposal is qualified and willing

    to act in relation to the proposal.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">(2) The court may make an interim order if it things that it would be

  appropriate to do so for the purpose of facilitating the consideration and implementation of the

  debtors proposal."</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">54 Rule 71 (1) of the Bankruptcy Rules provides:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"71. (1) An application to the court for an interim order under Part V of

  the Act shall be by way of originating summons entitled "<i>In the Matter of Part V of the

  Bankruptcy Act (Cap. 20)</i>" and shall be accompanied by an affidavit stating </p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">(a) the reasons for the making of the application;</p>
<p align="justify">(b) particulars of any execution or other legal process which, to the debtors

    knowledge, has been commenced against him;</p>
<p align="justify">(c) that the debtor is able to petition for his own bankruptcy;</p>
<p align="justify">(d) that no previous application for an interim order has been made by or in

    respect of the debtor in the period of 12 months ending with the date of the affidavit; and</p>
<p align="justify">(e) the name of the person to be appointed as the nominee under the proposal

    and that he is a person who is qualified and willing to act as a nominee in relation to the

    proposal."</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">55 It can be seen from the above statutory provisions that the nominee appointed

must be "qualified and willing to act". It is incumbent on the Applicant to procure such a

Nominee. Willingness to act must of course be coupled with the ability to do so. Nothing useful will

be accomplished by appointing a Nominee who is willing to act but will only be able to do so say two

months later for whatever reasons. It is just too bad if the Applicant is not able to have a Nominee

because no one wants to be one. It is certainly not his creditors fault.</p>
<p align="justify">56 Secondly, the Court will make, and consequently should extend, an interim

order if it would be appropriate to do so for the purpose of facilitating the consideration and

implementation of the Applicants proposal. <i>Muir Hunter on Personal Insolvency</i> (1987),

commenting on the English equivalent of our Section 48, states (at pages 3018 and 3019):</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"The court must be satisfied of the seriousness and bona fides of the

  application, because of the far-reaching effect which its consequent order under section 254 may

  have, in staying proceedings by the debtors creditors.  </p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">The terms "appropriate" and "inappropriate" occur several

  times in this Part, and also in Part IX, <i>post.</i> Little guidance is given as to the criteria

  of appropriateness which are to be applicable to the context. It may imply here that the proposal

  is more complicated than can be digested at the first hearing of the application, or that its

  terms are necessarily incomplete, and that time is needed to perfect them.  </p>
<p align="justify">In determining the "appropriateness" or otherwise of making an

  interim order, the court will consider whether the debtors proposal for voluntary arrangement

  to be put to his creditors is serious and viable. "If, in a particular case, the judge before

  whom the application for an interim order comes concludes that the proposal is not one which can

  be described as serious and viable, it would be expected that as a matter of discretion the judge

  would refuse to make an interim order. Judges must, I think, be careful not to allow applications

  for interim orders simply to become a means of postponing the making of bankruptcy orders, in

  circumstances where there is no apparent likelihood of benefit to the creditors from such a

  postponement": see <i>Hook v. Jewson Ltd</i> [1997] 1 B.C.L.C. 664, Scott, V.-C, following <i>Re

  A Debtor (Cooper v. Fearnley) (1 of 1994)</i> [1997] B.P.I.R. 20, Aldous J.</p>
<p align="justify">Thus, in <i>Hook v. Jewson</i> itself, the Vice-Chancellor upheld the district

  judges refusal to make an interim order to enable a proposal to be put to a meeting under

  section 257, which failed adequately to comply with the requirements of Rule 5.3, and which seemed

  unlikely (if approved) to generate any return for unsecured creditors.</p>
<p align="justify">It is however not a good ground for refusing to make an interim order that the

  return to creditors will be small (though not derisory); it is for the creditors themselves to

  decide on its adequacy: see <i>Knowles v. Coutts &amp; Co.</i> [1998] B.P.I.R. 96."</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">57 It was surprising that the Applicant, at the meeting with the creditors on 15

November 2000, did not have the necessary documents available to back up his assertions in the

proposed scheme. This fact alone would cast doubt on the Applicants sincerity in his proposal.</p>
<p align="justify">58 When documents were exhibited in his subsequent affidavits, they appeared on

the face to be unsigned or spent documents. For instance, the "Loan Proposal/Term Sheet"

referred to in his last affidavit was unsigned, dated 27 October 2000 and was stated explicitly to

expire on 1 November 2000. It should also be noted that this document was not alluded to nor

produced until the eleventh hour. Further, third parties were introduced for the first time without

any concrete evidence of their involvement or participation in the purported elaborate financial

arrangement.</p>
<p align="justify">59 The "Commercial Loan Fee/Compensation Agreement" exhibited in the

Applicants affidavit filed on 20 February 2001 was apparently signed on 11 October 2000. On the

face of that document, it expired after 180 days (or by 10 April 2001). At page 4 of the document,

the "Broker understands and appreciates that time is of the essence to the Borrower". All

we have on record was another bare assertion by the Applicant that the other party to the agreement

had agreed to extend the agreement by another 180 days and had signified such consent on 6 April

2001 by endorsing on the Applicants letter dated 30 March 2001. If that was true, surely the

one-page signed document could have been easily faxed over or even sent by courier from Riau,

Indonesia to Singapore.</p>
<p align="justify">60 Even if there was such an extension, the agreement was with Mapor Island

Resort Pte Ltd in which the Applicant was Managing Director. If his involvement was so crucial and

would be likely to produce results, he could easily seek the Official Assignees permission

(assuming he was made a bankrupt) to carry on with his work in that respect. However, I was informed

by the Applicants solicitor at the final hearing that a third party (the Atlas Group) was

negotiating on the Applicants behalf "because the Applicant on his own does not carry any

weight".</p>
<p align="justify">61 In any event, the proposed resort project, which the developers intended to

commence in the second quarter of 2001 (see "Letter of Appointment" dated 15 December 2000

in the Applicants affidavit filed on 20 February 2001), did not even appear to be at the starting

line. This Letter of Appointment, which the Applicant described as a Project Management and

Marketing Agreement in his affidavit, stated that it was "subject to final agreement to be

executed between us" and even the terms of payment for the Applicants companys services

"shall be negotiated at the agreement stage".</p>
<p align="justify">62 The documents in respect of the purported forestry concessions were old ones

going back to 1998, 1996 and 1995. Again, the Applicant has shown no concrete evidence that he had a

serious and viable venture in respect of these purported concessions.</p>
<p align="justify">63 Similarly, for the property in Tanjung Langsat Industrial Estate, Johor, the

application to subdivide was taken out as long ago as January 1997, more than four years back. No

active step appeared to have been seriously taken over the past several years. Even if the

subdivision would enhance the value of the land, there was no reason why the Official Assignee

(again assuming the Applicant was made a bankrupt) could not carry on the process.</p>
<p align="justify">64 The Ewart Park properties were owned by Elle and that company has been wound

up. These properties were mortgaged to ICBC to which the Applicant owed some $23 million. It was not

clear why the Applicant was including these properties in his affidavit in this application for an

interim order.</p>
<p align="justify">65 Looking at the proposed scheme in the light of all that has transpired, I was

of the view that it would not be appropriate to continue the interim order. The proposed scheme

appeared to be nothing more than the Applicants earnest hopes that somehow, someday, something

would happen to relieve him of his financial woes. I was not persuaded that it was a serious and

viable one meriting the further extension of the interim order. I therefore affirmed the Deputy

Registrars decision discharging that order.</p>
