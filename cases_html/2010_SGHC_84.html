<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       This is an appeal by the second, fourth and
                        fifth<sup></sup>defendants in these proceedings, against an order for pre-action
                    discovery made by an Assistant Registrar (“the AR”).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The parties</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The plaintiff, Singapore Piling &amp; Civil
                    Engineering Pte Ltd is a Singapore company, and was the main contractor for a
                    housing project in Sri Lanka (“the Project”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       The first defendant, Kim Teck Corporation Pte
                    Ltd, is a company incorporated in the British Virgin Islands
                    (“BVI”). It was appointed by the plaintiff as its sub-contractor
                    for the aluminium and glazing works for the Project. Although it was included in
                    the application for pre-discovery inspection, the application papers were not
                    served on it.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       The second defendant, Kim Teck Industries Pte
                    Ltd, is a company incorporated in Singapore.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       The third defendant, Lee Thian Hock, is a former
                    director of the first defendant as well as the second defendant. He has been
                    adjudicated a bankrupt in Singapore. He appeared in person before the AR to
                    oppose the application, but has not appealed against the AR’s
                    orders.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       The fourth defendant, Wong Chai Kim, is a
                    director of the second defendant and the third defendant’s
                wife.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       The fifth defendant, Lee Xiaohong, is also a
                    director of the second defendant, and is the third and fourth defendants’
                    daughter. She became a director on 18 August 2007 after the third defendant
                    resigned on 15 July 2007.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The underlying facts</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       The plaintiff’s former managing director
                    Teng Boon Kwee (“Teng”) was a business associate of the third
                    defendant. Teng informed the latter of the Project and invited the second
                    defendant to submit a quote for the aluminium and glazing works.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       In response to the invitation, the second
                    defendant submitted design drawings and calculations to the plaintiff in
                    November and December 2004. However, in March 2005, a revised quotation was sent
                    to the plaintiff in a letter bearing the letterhead of the first defendant with
                    the address stated as “Balk.133, #03-303 – Jargon East St. 13
                    Singapore 600133”, which bore some similarity to the second
                    defendant’s address at Block 133 Jurong East Street 13 #03-303,
                    Singapore 600133. This was followed by two further revised quotations dated
                    8 October 2005 and 6 January 2006, bearing the same
                letterhead.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     Further discussions took place between Teng
                    and the third defendant which ultimately led to the plaintiff’s award of a
                    sub-contract valued in excess of US$2 million on 9 April 2006. This letter
                    was issued to the first defendant at the address of the second
                defendant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     In the course of the performance of the
                    sub-contract, the plaintiff received instructions on the payments to be made. By
                    a memorandum dated 13 February 2007 from the second defendant, the
                    plaintiff was requested to make progress payments to a bank account in the name
                    of the first defendant with United Overseas Bank Ltd in Ho Chi Minh City,
                    Vietnam. The plaintiff complied with the instructions, and made payments into
                    the account.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     The sub-contract did not progress to the
                    plaintiff’s satisfaction. The plaintiff complained of major defects,
                    including sub-standard and poor quality materials and workmanship. This led to a
                    breakdown in the relationship between the two parties, and eventually to the
                    plaintiff’s application for pre-action discovery against the
                    defendants.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Basis for the application</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     The plaintiff’s application was
                    supported by two affidavits deposed by Lee Kim Huat (“Lee”), a
                    director of the company. He deposed that:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_13-p2_a"></a>(a)     The plaintiff’s intention at
                        the outset was to contract with the second defendant;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_13-p2_b"></a>(b)     Following the discussions between
                        Teng, the plaintiff’s managing director at that time and the third
                        defendant, the plaintiff sent a letter of award of the sub-contract to the
                        first defendant;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_13-p2_c"></a>(c)     As a result of the third defendant’s representations, the
                        plaintiff believed that the first defendant was incorporated in
                        Singapore;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_13-p2_d"></a>(d)     At a
                        meeting between Lee and one Victor Foo, both representing the plaintiff, and
                        the third defendant on 28 May 2008, the third defendant informed Lee
                        and Victor Foo that: <span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">[H]e had incorporated the 1st Defendants in the BVI. The 3rd Defendant
                            also openly admitted that he knew he would make “losses”
                            on the Project and hence decided to set up an offshore company in the
                            BVI. He further said that he had “no qualms” should the
                            Plaintiffs decide to take legal action against the 1st Defendants. These
                            admissions and revelations by the 3rd Defendant came as a total surprise
                            and shock to the Plaintiffs.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_13-p2_e"></a>(e)     The plaintiff
                        made a company search on the first defendant and confirmed that the company
                        was incorporated in the BVI. (It was not stated when the search was made.
                        The certified copy of the certificate of incorporation exhibited was dated
                        9 October 2008);</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_13-p2_f"></a>(f)     A bankruptcy search on the third defendant revealed that he was
                        adjudicated a bankrupt on 5 December 2003 and had remained
                        undischarged;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_13-p2_g"></a>(g)     The plaintiff would not have awarded the sub-contract to the first
                        defendant if the defendants had disclosed that the third defendant was a
                        bankrupt and that the first defendant is a BVI company;
                    and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_13-p2_h"></a>(h)     He believed
                        that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">… the 3rd Defendant conspired with the 1st, 2nd, 4th and 5th
                            Defendants and has used the 1st Defendants to enter into the
                            sub-contract in order to insulate the 2nd, 3rd, 4th and 5th Defendants
                            from any exposure that they may have in respect of the
                                Sub-Contract;<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">that:</p>

                            the 1st Defendants and their bank account in Vietnam as
                            “conduit” to receive payments from the
                                Plaintiffs;<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">and that:</p>

                            subsequent intended legal proceedings to be commenced by the
                                Plaintiffs.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     In its written submissions made in this
                    appeal, the plaintiff acknowledged that: <span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_5" id="Ftn_5_1"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It is not in dispute that the 1st and 2nd Defendants are
                        separate corporate entities. Thus the Plaintiffs will need to justify
                        piercing the corporate veil of the 1st Defendant, and if so, the potential
                        liabilities of the 2nd to 5th Defendants. The potential issues will
                        include:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">a.    What was the true purpose of incorporating the
                                1st Defendant by the 3rd Defendant?</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">b.    Was the 1st Defendant used as a

<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">c.    Whether the 2nd to 5th Defendants used the 1st

                                event of loss, insulate themselves from liabilities?</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">d.    Whether the 3rd Defendant is in fact an
                                    <em>alter ego</em> of the 1st and 2nd
                                Defendants?</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">e.    Whether the 1st and/or 2nd Defendants’
                                entire operations were controlled and managed by the 3rd
                                Defendant?</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">f.    Whether the 2nd to 5th Defendants had intended

<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The defendants’ response</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     The defendants (except the first defendant
                    which was not served) opposed the plaintiff’s application for pre-action
                    discovery. The third defendant deposed an affidavit dated 30 January 2009
                    to respond to the plaintiff’s allegations. He deposed that he had
                    incorporated the first defendant in the BVI on 21 June 2002. He had not
                    represented to Teng or any of the plaintiff’s representatives that the
                    first defendant was incorporated in Singapore. Since its incorporation, the
                    first defendant had undertaken aluminium subcontracting work in Third World
                    countries, and had secured works in Vietnam in 2003, in Japan and Angola in 2004
                    and had submitted quotations for other overseas projects.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     The third defendant added that he and Teng had
                    known one another for many years and were close business associates, and that
                    Teng knew that he had been adjudicated a bankrupt and was undertaking jobs
                    overseas. He also asserted that Teng knew that he was undertaking the work in
                    the Project in the name of the first defendant from the two quotations the first
                    defendant issued to the plaintiff, and that Teng knew that the first defendant
                    and the second defendant were different entities and had intended for the
                    plaintiff to contract with the first defendant. (The plaintiff did not adduce
                    any response from Teng).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     He also explained that the first
                    defendant’s operations were based in Vietnam and the company also used the
                    second defendant’s address as its postal address in Singapore. He had
                    instructed his wife, the fourth defendant, who was in Singapore, to send
                    documents to the plaintiff on behalf of the first defendant, but she may have
                    sent some documents in the name of the second defendant to the plaintiff by
                    mistake.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     In any event, he denied that the first
                    defendant had failed to discharge its obligations under the sub-contract with
                    the plaintiff.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The law on pre-action discovery</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     An application may be made under O 24 of
                    the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R5, 2006 Rev Ed) for pre-action
                    discovery. O 24 r 6(3)(<em>a</em>) prescribes
                    that any application shall be supported by an affidavit which must:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(a) … state the grounds for the application, the material facts
                        pertaining to the intended proceedings and whether the person against whom
                        the order is sought is likely to be party to subsequent proceedings in
                        Court;</p>
<p class="Judg-1">and r 7 provides that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… [T]he Court may, if satisfied that discovery is not necessary, or
                        not necessary at that stage of the cause or matter, dismiss or, as the case
                        may be, adjourn the application and shall in any case refuse to make such an
                        order if and so far as it is of opinion that discovery is not necessary
                        either for disposing fairly of the cause or matter or for saving
                        costs.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     The principal decision on this subject from
                    our courts is the Court of Appeal’s decision in <em>Kuah
                        Kok Kim and others v Ernst &amp; Young</em> [1996]
                    3 SLR(R) 485 (“<em>Kuah Kok
                    Kim</em>”). The Court held at [31] that a party may apply for
                    pre-action discovery when it does not know if it has a viable claim against the
                    defendant, and the pre-action discovery is to assist him in his search for the
                    answer, and the Court went on to hold (at [59]) that when an application for
                    pre-action discovery is made:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… It was not the court’s function, at this stage of the
                        application, to dwell into the merits of the case and to determine, based on
                        what little available evidence, whether there is a good claim or not. The
                        court’s duty is only to ensure that the application was not frivolous
                        or speculative or that the applicants were [not] on a fishing
                        expedition.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The Court referred to a decision of the English Court of Appeal in
                        <em>Dunning v Board of Governors of the United Liverpool
                        Hospitals</em> [1973] 2 All ER 454 which also dealt with
                    pre-action discovery, where James LJ held at 460:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… [T]he applicant for relief must disclose the nature of the claim
                        he intends to make and show not only the intention of making it but also
                        that there is reasonable basis for making it. Ill-founded, irresponsible and
                        speculative allegation or allegations based merely on hope would not provide
                        a reasonable basis for an intended claim in subsequent proceedings.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     When a court has to rule on an application, it
                    has to decide whether the applicant has presented material facts pertaining to
                    the intended proceedings, and whether it has shown that the defendant to the
                    application is likely to be a party in the intended proceedings. The burden on
                    the applicant is not onerous. Nevertheless, an application should be made
                    responsibly. Any application which is frivolous or speculative or in any way an
                    abuse of the process of court will not be allowed.</p>

          <em>Kuah Kok Kim</em> has
                    been applied in subsequent decisions. In <em>Beckkett Pte Ltd v
                        Deutsche Bank AG Singapore Branch</em> [2003] 1 SLR(R) 321,
                    the plaintiff took out an application for the defendant bank to give discovery
                    of valuation reports of the plaintiff’s shares that the bank sold as
                    pledgee. Discovery was not ordered because the plaintiff’s complaint that
                    the shares were worth more than they were sold for was founded on insubstantial,
                    incomplete, irrelevant and out-dated sources, and without obtaining a proper
                    valuation of its own: at [21].</p>

                    were deceived by the brewery company’s finance manager into believing that
                    they were making loans to the company obtained an order for pre-action discovery
                    against the company. On appeal, Belinda Ang Saw Ean J ruled that the banks
                    were not entitled to pre-action discovery as they had already come to the
                    conclusion that they had a case against the company, and they should apply for
                    discovery after proceedings were commenced.</p>

                    [2006] 1 SLR(R) 283, the plaintiff chartered a vessel to Hub Lines Pte
                    Ltd (“Hub Lines”) for two years. Two months into the charter, Hub
                    Lines terminated the charter. The plaintiff obtained an arbitral award against
                    Hub Lines, but the latter company had by then been wound up. The plaintiff then
                    applied for pre-action discovery against Hub Marine Pte Ltd (“Hub
                    Marine”). The application was made on the premise that Hub Lines and Hub
                    Marine shared one common director and Hub Marine was linked to the charter in
                    that:</p>

                            instructions and a circular were sent on the notepaper of the Hub

<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(c)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">The majority of the charter hire payments were

                    against Hub Marine to ascertain if Hub Marine was liable to pay the arbitral
                    award. Tay Yong Kwang J allowed the application. He referred to <em>Kuah Kok Kim</em> and <em>Asia Pacific
                        Breweries</em> and concluded that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">38    Applying the principles set out in O 24
                            rr 6 and 7, as expounded by the cases … it seems to me that
                            necessity must therefore be considered in the light of the purpose for
                            which pre-action discovery is sought. Here, the plaintiff is trying to
                            ascertain whether it has a cause of action against the defendant by
                            lifting the corporate veil to uncover the real charterers of the vessel.
                            …</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">39    The plaintiff has not launched this application in
                            order to try its luck by trawling in the open seas of chance to see
                            whether it can ensnare some bigger fish to look to for the satisfaction
                            of the arbitral award. It has set out several material facts for its
                            belief that the defendant may have a much closer connection with Hub
                            Lines than it has disclosed thus far. The defendant, on the other hand,
                            seems to want the plaintiff to accept its word that it had no nexus
                            whatsoever with Hub Lines. In my opinion, the plaintiff is entitled, in
                            the light of the evidence it has uncovered thus far, to be sceptical
                            about the disavowal of the defendant and to want to be certain that the
                            defendant truly had no connection with Hub Lines beyond what it had
                            acknowledged. The grounds relied on by the plaintiff are not frivolous
                            or far-fetched in any way.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Review of the present application</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     The plaintiff knew that it was contracting
                    with the first defendant. It now asserts that it would not have done so if it
                    had known that the first defendant was a BVI company, and that the third
                    defendant was a bankrupt.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     The plaintiff’s allegation of
                    misrepresentation about the country of incorporation of the third defendant was
                    that: <span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_6" id="Ftn_6_1"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">At that time, based on the representations of the 3rd Defendant during the
                        discussions relating to the various quotations made for and on behalf of
                        himself as well as the 1st and 2nd Defendants, the … documents
                        received from the 2nd Defendants and the various quotations from the 1st and
                        3rd Defendants, the Plaintiffs were led to believe that the 1st Defendants
                        were incorporated in Singapore. Thus, acting on and in reliance upon the
                        1st, 2nd and 3rd Defendants’ representations that Kim Teck
                        Corporations [<em>sic</em>] Pte Ltd (the 1st
                        Defendants) was a company incorporated in Singapore, the Plaintiffs awarded
                        the sub-contract to the 1st Defendants.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     It is to be noted that it fell short of
                    stating that the third defendant had said that the first defendant was a
                    Singapore company, but only that the plaintiff was led to believe that from
                    unspecified representations of the third defendant, and the quotations and
                    documents sent during the negotiations.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     The plaintiff could have requested for direct
                    evidence on the incorporation of the first defendant, or it could have conducted
                    its own search before awarding the sub-contract to the first defendant, but it
                    did not do that, and it could be argued that it should bear responsibility for
                    the consequences of its omissions.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     It was noteworthy that when the third
                    defendant allegedly made the shocking admission on 28 May 2008 that he had
                    incorporated the first defendant in the BVI because he knew he could make losses
                    on the sub-contract, and he was not concerned if the plaintiff took action
                    against the first defendant, the plaintiff did not seek further clarifications,
                    explanations or assurances from the defendants. There was no record of any
                    outrage or other response from the plaintiff.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     The plaintiff’s case was that it had
                    obtained a certified copy of the certificate of incorporation of the first
                    defendant dated 9 October 2008. That date suggested that the plaintiff did
                    not take prompt action after 28 May 2008 to get the
                certificate.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     There were serious doubts whether the third
                    defendant had indeed made the admissions alleged by the plaintiff. It was not
                    disputed that the third defendant was incorporated on 21 June 2002, more
                    than three years before it was awarded the sub-contract by the plaintiff, and
                    that it had taken on other projects before the sub-contract. The third defendant
                    could hardly have incorporated the first defendant specifically in anticipation
                    of losses from the sub-contract. There was no reason for the third defendant to
                    lie about that and make himself out to be more dishonest.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     The plaintiff has to show that there is a
                    reasonable basis to the application. The starting point was that the defendants
                    had led it to believe that the first defendant was a Singapore company. There
                    were no particulars given with respect to this allegation, <em>eg</em>, the terms of the representation and to whom it was made. It
                    appears that Lee had assumed that the first defendant was a Singapore company
                    because the third defendant had not told him that it was not.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     The related point that the plaintiff would not
                    have awarded the sub-contract to the first defendant if it had known that the
                    third defendant was an undischarged bankrupt was not based on any representation
                    by the defendants but on the fact that they had not disclosed it. Beyond that,
                    the third defendant’s assertion that Teng, the then managing director of
                    the plaintiff had known of his status was not refuted by Teng or the
                    plaintiff.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     Against this backdrop the plaintiff’s
                    complaint that it was misled by the defendants’ misrepresentations did not
                    form a reasonable basis for the application.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     There was another difficulty with the
                    application. This was that the plaintiff was not seeking pre-action discovery to
                    decide whether it has a claim against the defendants. The plaintiff had stated
                    in no uncertain terms that it was led into awarding the sub-contract with the
                    first defendant by the misrepresentations of the defendants, and that the third
                    defendant had admitted to two representatives of the plaintiff that the first
                    defendant was incorporated in the BVI specifically for that job to reduce or
                    evade liability.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     That being the case, the plaintiff had enough
                    in hand to sue the defendants. It should have the courage of its conviction and
                    start legal proceedings against them, without seeking the court’s
                    assistance to compel the defendants to give pre-action discovery to obtain more
                    material for that purpose.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Scope of discovery</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     Furthermore, the plaintiff’s application
                    for pre-action discovery was excessive in scope. The scope of the discovery
                    sought should be relative to the justification for the application. In this
                    case, the application was based on the alleged representation that the first
                    defendant was a Singapore company and the third defendant was not a
                    bankrupt.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     The discovery sought with respect to the first
                    and second defendants included all statements of account and audited financial
                    statements of the companies, all credit and debit notes issued by the companies,
                    all invoices issued by the companies and all bank statements and bank documents
                    addressed to the companies, from 2005 in the case of the first defendant, and
                    from 2004 in the case of the second defendant. The discovery sought in relation
                    to the third defendant included all bank statements and bank documents addressed
                    to him from 2004. These documents sought by the plaintiff went beyond the
                    reasons for its application.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     When the classes of discovery sought are
                    unduly extensive the spectre of fishing arises. As an applicant for pre-action
                    discovery must show a reasonable basis for its intended claim, the applicant
                    should also show a reasonable basis for the discovery it seeks.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     The defendants’ appeal is allowed. The
                    AR’s orders for discovery and costs against the appellants are set aside.
                    The plaintiff is to pay costs and disbursements here and below to the
                    appellants, to be taxed if these are not agreed on.</p>
