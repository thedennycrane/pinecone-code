<p class="Judg-Author">
        V K Rajah JA (delivering the judgment of the
                court):</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       This is an extraordinary case. Two brothers,
                    Muhammad bin Kadar (“Muhammad”) and Ismil bin Kadar
                    (“Ismil”) (collectively referred to as “the
                    Appellants”), were charged with the brutal murder of a 69-year-old woman
                    (“the Deceased”) in the High Court. They were convicted by the
                    trial judge (“the Judge”), who gave his grounds in a 214-page
                    judgment (see <em>Public Prosecutor v Ismil bin Kadar and
                        another</em> [2009] SGHC 84) (“the Judgment”) that paid
                    commendable attention to detail, and were sentenced to suffer capital
                    punishment. The trial, one of the longest in the Singapore judiciary’s
                    annals, took 94 days stretching over a period of more than two years from
                    20 March 2006 to 9 May 2008. One of the primary reasons for this
                    lengthy period was the fact that not long after the trial commenced, both of
                    Muhammad’s counsel discharged themselves (for reasons that will be
                    revealed later in this judgment (see <a href="#p1_123">[123]</a>
                    below)) and new counsel had to be engaged.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       At the start of the trial, the Prosecution
                    unequivocally asserted that Ismil was the <em>sole</em>
                    assailant. This initial position can be traced to statements that Ismil made on
                    the day after he was arrested. The Prosecution accepted that Muhammad was not
                    involved in the actual killing of the Deceased, but argued that by virtue of
                    s 34 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 1985 Rev Ed) (“Penal
                    Code”), he was also legally responsible for the killing since he was
                    present at the scene of the crime and shared a common intention with Ismil. But,
                    after Muhammad dramatically testified to his sole involvement in the killing,
                    the Prosecution did a startling <em>volte-face</em> in that
                    it then emphatically contended that Muhammad alone had inflicted the fatal
                    wounds. However, the Prosecution maintained that both the Appellants were
                    equally liable for murder pursuant to s 34 of the Penal Code, as they
                    shared a common intention to commit robbery. The Judge agreed with the
                    Prosecution in this regard in convicting both the Appellants.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       Unsurprisingly, the twists and turns did not end
                    with the trial. Before us, when queried, the Prosecution changed its position
                    yet again. This time, it conceded that the Judge had erred in that only Muhammad
                    should be found liable for murder, and that Ismil should not be held to be
                    equally liable as the evidence on record was insufficient to prove a common
                    intention to cause the Deceased’s death. The Prosecution, however,
                    submitted that Ismil should be found guilty of committing robbery with hurt
                    since he was present at the scene of the crime and there was sufficient evidence
                    to show that he shared a common intention with Muhammad to commit robbery. In
                    maintaining that Ismil should be convicted, albeit for robbery with hurt, the
                    Prosecution referred to statements in which he claimed to be the sole assailant.
                    This, of course, raises a vexing conundrum – a veritable legal
                    curate’s egg – in that it has to be decided whether the Prosecution
                    can rely on the barest residue of evidence from statements that have already
                    been seriously compromised. It should be added that absolutely no objective
                    evidence was placed before the court that tied Ismil to the scene of the crime
                    or the crime itself. Pertinently, the lead investigator acknowledged that more
                    could have been done in the investigations to secure objective evidence (see
                        <a href="#p1_183">[183]</a> below).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       Another unusual feature is that the Judge did
                    not make a finding as to the identity of the actual assailant – whether it
                    was Muhammad or Ismil. He stated that he was unable to do so. Yet, he concluded
                    that by virtue of s 34 of the Penal Code, both should be held liable for
                    murder as they had shared a common intention to rob. In arriving at this
                    determination, he relied on the series of confessions made by the Appellants in
                    their statements. All counsel before us (including Muhammad’s)
                    unreservedly accepted that only Muhammad was responsible for the killing.
                    Counsel for Ismil, however, went further, in that he forcefully maintained that
                    Ismil was never even present at the scene of the crime and that false
                    confessions in statements that had been made by Ismil during police
                    investigations had caused a miscarriage of justice. Several manifest evidential
                    inconsistencies in the said statements were also alluded to.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       Aside from the aforementioned unusual aspects,
                    another aspect of the proceedings that has left us disturbed would be the fact
                    that the Prosecution failed to disclose statements made on 12 May 2005 and
                    5 September 2005 by the Deceased’s bedridden husband, Mr Loh
                    Siew Kow (“Mr Loh”), until nearly 18 months after the trial
                    had commenced. Mr Loh, who passed away due to cancer a few months after the
                    trial began, was no ordinary witness. He was the only person – other than
                    the Deceased and her assailant or assailants – present in the
                    Deceased’s flat throughout the incident. In his detailed statements, he
                    clearly and consistently stated that there was only <em>one
                        intruder</em>. In addition to this lapse, the day before the trial was
                    due to end, it somehow emerged that Mr Loh had made an even earlier
                    statement to the investigators. This was made the day after the murder on
                    7 May 2005. In this statement, Mr Loh unambiguously stated that there
                    was only one intruder and then proceeded to give a detailed description of that
                    person. The Prosecution, when queried by us, acknowledged that with hindsight,
                    the timely disclosure of Mr Loh’s evidence “may have been the
                    … wiser decision”,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span>
                    though it insists it had no legal obligation to disclose those three
                    statements.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       The present appeal, in short, presents knotty
                    issues of both fact and law for this court to resolve. As this is a fairly
                    lengthy judgment, it makes sense to first outline what will be covered in
                    schematic form:</p>

<b><em>The</em></b> dramatis personae</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       The Appellants are brothers who lived in a flat
                    with their family at Block 185 Boon Lay Avenue #04-154, one floor below the
                    Deceased’s flat which was #05-156. Muhammad was 29 years old at the time
                    of his arrest. His highest educational qualification was Primary Seven
                        (extended).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span> At
                    the time of his arrest, he was working as an odd-job general worker on a
                    part-time basis.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span> In terms of criminal history, he has had two
                    stints in the Drug Rehabilitation Centre as well as a number of antecedents in
                    property and drug offences. He started taking drugs at the age of 15. His
                    history of drug abuse began with cannabis and then progressed to various other
                    kinds of drugs, including heroin. From 2003, he started consuming Subutex in
                    place of heroin. He began consuming Dormicum in 2004.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       Ismil was 37 years old at the time of his
                    arrest. His highest educational qualification was Primary Six. At the time of
                    his arrest, he was working as a general worker on a contract basis.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_6" id="Ftn_6_1"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span> He began
                    consuming cannabis and sniffing glue at the age of 15, and continued this habit
                    until the age of 17. He then stopped sniffing glue, and consumed cannabis and
                    opium up till 2004, with various breaks because of time spent in remand either
                    at Queenstown Remand Prison (“QRP”) or the Drug Rehabilitation
                    Centre. Having been released from long-term detention in the Drug Rehabilitation
                    Centre in 2003 – his fifth stint in the Drug Rehabilitation Centre –
                    Ismil managed, for a short period, to cease regular substance abuse.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_7" id="Ftn_7_1"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span> From

                    the description of a chronic substance abuser.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       The Deceased lived with Mr Loh, a bedridden
                    stroke patient, at Block 185 Boon Lay Avenue #05-156. They were both 69
                    years of age as at 6 May 2005. Due to Mr Loh’s poor health, he
                    had to be fed by means of a nasogastric tube. A nurse, Madam Tan Bee Choo
                    (“Mdm Tan”), visited Mr Loh three times a week to
                    provide medical care.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_9" id="Ftn_9_1"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span> One of her duties was to change the nasogastric
                    tube every two weeks.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The discovery of the death of the Deceased</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     On 6 May 2005, at around 8.00pm, the
                    Deceased was found dead in her flat. The circumstances leading to the discovery
                    of the Deceased’s death are as follows. Mdm Tan arrived at the
                    Deceased’s flat at about 4.00pm that fateful day to follow up on an
                    appointment that she had made earlier.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_10" id="Ftn_10_1"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span> She knocked on the door
                    for about five minutes, but there was no response.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_11" id="Ftn_11_1"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span> She then used her mobile phone to
                    call the residential line of the Deceased, and could hear the phone ringing, but
                    again there was no response.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_12" id="Ftn_12_1"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span> Worried by this, she called the
                    Deceased’s daughter, Madam Loh Yim Leng (“Catherine”),
                    and informed her that the Deceased was not responding to her door knocks and
                    phone calls. Catherine said that she would visit the Deceased’s flat after
                    work. Catherine thereafter also tried calling the Deceased’s residential
                    line repeatedly, but without success.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     Catherine arrived at the Deceased’s flat
                    at about 7.30pm. She knocked repeatedly, but there was no response. She then
                    sought the assistance of the police. Two police officers, Sergeant Sim Pui Hong
                    and Sergeant Lee Boon Howe, arrived on the scene at just after 8.00pm. They
                    obtained Catherine’s permission to break open the door. When the door was
                    opened, the Deceased was found lying still on the floor in a pool of blood in
                    the living room next to the refrigerator. One of the two bedrooms in the house
                    had been hurriedly ransacked, and Mr Loh was found in severe distress in
                    the other bedroom. A bloody chopper was found on a rack near to where the
                    Deceased was lying and a knife blade was found on the kitchen toilet
                        floor.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_13" id="Ftn_13_1"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span>
                    The floor, walls and door of the kitchen toilet and some of the living room
                    furniture were splattered with blood.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_14" id="Ftn_14_1"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span> A
                    paramedic later pronounced the Deceased dead at about 8.40pm.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_15" id="Ftn_15_1"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     In his autopsy report, Dr Lai Siang Hui
                    (“Dr Lai”), a pathologist, provided the following summary of
                        findings:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_16" id="Ftn_16_1"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">This was a case of homicide. <em>Autopsy revealed more than
                            110 incised wounds and stab wounds</em> together with blunt trauma
                        to the neck and, head and back. Most of the wounds were of slashes and
                        chopping-type wounds (collectively being described as sharp-force injuries
                        or incised wounds) to the head and neck. There were also numerous incised
                        wounds to the upper limbs consistent with defence injuries. These injuries
                        indicated that the victim had put up significant resistance and self-defence
                        against the assault.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The mechanism of death was due to severe blood loss from exsanguination.
                        …
                        <em>There was no single life-threatening wound or injury that
                            accounted for death. Instead, the collective numbers of wounds had
                            caused a relatively slow venous bleeding</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… The many overlapping and directions of the wounds indicated a
                            <em>prolonged</em> yet somewhat frantic assault on
                        the victim, <em>who was all the while, making great effort to
                            move away from her assailant. …</em></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In summary, the injuries on the body and with correlation of scene
                        evidence was [<em>sic</em>] <em>consistent with the victim having suffered two attacks</em>. The
                        victim had finally succumbed at entranceway [<em>sic</em>] to the kitchen, where the second and final assault
                        occurred. <em>The overall pattern was consistent with two

                            this point, the findings were also consistent with the assault having

<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The arrest of the Appellants</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     The Appellants were not arrested immediately
                    in connection with the killing. Although Ismil was arrested on that very same
                    day, it was for reasons unrelated to the killing of the Deceased. At about
                    3.00pm on 6 May 2005, Mr Yoo Yee Weng (“Yee Weng”), who
                    operated a mobile phone business at Boon Lay Shopping Centre, discovered that
                    two mobile phones were missing from his shop. He informed his friend,
                    Mr Tan Yi Long Jafred (“Jafred”), who also operated a mobile
                    phone business at Boon Lay Shopping Centre, to look out for the phones in case
                    anyone should try to sell them to him. At about 4.30pm, Jafred called Yee Weng
                    to inform him that a male Malay – Ismil – was in his shop trying to
                    sell a mobile phone to him. Yee Weng went over to Jafred’s shop and
                    identified that phone as one of the two that had been taken from his shop. They
                    then called the police, who arrived and arrested Ismil in Jafred’s shop.
                    Ismil, who did not attempt to escape or resist arrest, was brought to Jurong
                    Police Division Headquarters and remanded.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     Although Ismil was initially remanded for
                    theft, the police’s suspicion of him as a possible suspect in the murder
                    was aroused after it was ascertained that he lived just one floor below the
                    Deceased’s flat. As a result, the next morning, investigators proceeded to
                    question Ismil on the killing of the Deceased. Ismil was observed to be tired
                    and in a vulnerable physical and mental state at that point in time (see
                        <a href="#p1_160">[160]</a>–<a href="#p1_165">[165]</a> below). Upon being interrogated, Ismil allegedly provided
                    several statements in which he incriminated himself in the killing of the
                    Deceased. In these statements, Ismil admitted that he had proceeded to the
                    Deceased’s flat on the morning of 6 May 2005 to rob the Deceased as
                    he was in need of money. After the Deceased raised her voice, he went into the
                    kitchen and took a knife in an attempt to scare her. A struggle broke out
                    between him and the Deceased, and he <em>accidentally
                        stabbed</em> her.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     It is noteworthy that the first statement
                    provided by Ismil was given in rather unusual circumstances. On the morning of
                    7 May 2005, the day after he had been remanded, Ismil was brought to the
                    Deceased’s flat at Block 185 Boon Lay Avenue. While Ismil was in a
                    police car with two police officers at a carpark near Block 185, Senior
                    Station Inspector Zainal Abidin bin Ismail (“SSI Zainal”), an
                    officer who was asked to assist in the investigations, entered the car and asked
                    the two officers to leave as he wanted to interview Ismil alone. Ismil initially
                    said that he did not know anything about the murder of the Deceased. However,
                    according to SSI Zainal, after further probing, Ismil voluntarily confessed
                    to having attacked the Deceased alone. SSI Zainal also produced what he
                    claimed to be a recording of the confession, <em>viz</em>,
                    a piece of paper that stated:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_17" id="Ftn_17_1"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[A]t c/p [<em>ie</em>, carpark] of Blk 185 B/L
                            [<em>ie</em>, Boon Lay], interview suspect Ismil b.
                        He said he remember [<em>sic</em>] slashing an old
                        f/Chinese on Fri morning ...</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     Ismil was subsequently brought to a briefing
                    room at Jurong West Neighbourhood Police Centre (“JWNPC”) where
                    SSI Zainal had a second interview alone with him between 11.30am and
                    11.50am. During that interview, Ismil allegedly told SSI Zainal that he had
                    gone to the Deceased’s flat to borrow some money and that he had taken a
                    knife from her flat. Ismil also told him that there was an old man lying on a
                    bed in the Deceased’s flat, and maintained that he had acted alone. This
                    statement was recorded much later in the day, after lunch, by SSI Zainal in
                    his field diary.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_18" id="Ftn_18_1"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a></span> The alleged confession in the police car was
                    also recorded after lunch by SSI Zainal in his field diary (in addition to
                    being written on the slip of paper). No warning was administered to Ismil before
                    these statements were recorded. Further, the statements were neither read back
                    to him nor signed by him.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     It must be pointed out here that these
                    statements implicated Ismil only, and did not implicate Muhammad at all. The
                    early statements provided by Ismil made no reference to Muhammad being present
                    at the scene of the crime. However, subsequent to Muhammad’s arrest and
                    his confession that he was also present at the scene of the crime, the
                    statements provided by Ismil began to allude to Muhammad’s presence at the
                    scene of the crime and his participation in the robbery. In these latter
                    statements, Ismil, nevertheless, continued to maintain that it was he alone who
                    had stabbed the Deceased. Muhammad had merely agreed to join him in committing
                    robbery.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     The circumstances leading to the arrest of
                    Muhammad are also germane. On 27 May 2005, the lead investigating officer
                    for the killing of the Deceased, Station Inspector Raymond Tan (“the
                    IO”), was suddenly informed by Dr Christopher Syn
                    (“Dr Syn”), an analyst attached to the DNA Laboratory for
                    Forensic Science at the Health Sciences Authority, that a black purse, which had
                    been found lying on the ground outside of Block 185 on the night of
                    6 May 2005, contained the Deceased’s DNA and the DNA of a male person
                    who was likely to be one of Ismil’s brothers. Muhammad was then asked to
                    turn up at the Special Investigation Section (“the SIS”) of the
                    Criminal Investigation Department (“the CID”) on 30 May 2005.
                    On that day, the IO received confirmation from Dr Syn that it was indeed
                    Muhammad’s DNA that had been found on the black purse.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     Muhammad reported to the SIS’ office on
                    30 May 2005 and was interviewed from 10.40am onwards. By about 6.00pm, he
                    made the first of several confessions regarding his role and that of Ismil in
                    the killing on 6 May 2005. The statements that were provided by Muhammad
                    were consistent with those that were subsequently provided by Ismil from
                    3 June 2005 onwards; amongst other things, they stated that Ismil alone had
                    attacked and killed the Deceased. While Muhammad admitted to being present at
                    the scene of the crime, his role was just to assist in the
                robbery.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     The Appellants were initially charged with
                    committing murder in furtherance of a common intention under s 302 read
                    with s 34 of the Penal Code. This was later amended to a charge of
                    committing murder in furtherance of a common intention to commit robbery under
                    s 302 read with s 34 of the Penal Code.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The trial in the High Court</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     The trial commenced on 20 March 2006. The
                    evidence that was adduced by the Prosecution and the Appellants has already been
                    comprehensively summarised by the Judge in the Judgment. As such, in this
                    section, we will, instead, broadly describe what transpired during the trial
                    with reference to evidence that we feel should be highlighted in
                    particular.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The trials-within-a-trial</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     The core of the Prosecution’s case
                    against the Appellants consisted of the various statements that they had made to
                    the police. The Appellants, however, launched a root-and-branch attack against
                    the admissibility of a number of their statements (see [27] and [197] of the Judgment for a list of Ismil’s and
                    Muhammad’s respective disputed statements). For this reason, the Judge had
                    to conduct two trials-within-a-trial shortly after the trial commenced. The
                    trials-within-a-trial took place between 27 March 2006 and 18 January
                    2007.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     In the trial-within-a-trial on Ismil’s
                    disputed statements, Ismil alleged, <em>inter alia</em>,
                    that he had been suffering from withdrawal symptoms owing to his moderate to
                    severe Dormicum addiction and that such symptoms included being in a state of
                    confusion and/or being unable to cope with stressful situations. He also alleged
                    that the police had subjected him to threats, inducements and oppressive
                    circumstances. After having considered the evidence, which is summarised at
                        [27]–[126] of the Judgment, the Judge accepted
                    that Ismil was suffering from withdrawal symptoms from 7 May 2005 as a
                    result of not having consumed drugs, but came to the conclusion that the
                    symptoms were mild to, at most, moderate. These symptoms, therefore, did not
                    affect the voluntariness of the statements that he gave (see the Judgment at
                        <a href="#p1_144">[144]</a>). The Judge also dismissed
                    Ismil’s challenges to admissibility based on allegations of threats,
                    inducements and oppressive circumstances. The Judge concluded, accordingly, that
                    all of Ismil’s disputed statements were admissible (see, generally, the
                    Judgment at [127]–[196]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     In the trial-within-a-trial on
                    Muhammad’s disputed statements, Muhammad alleged, <em>inter
                        alia</em>, that he had been suffering from withdrawal symptoms owing
                    to his Dormicum addiction, and this resulted in him being in a state of
                    confusion, being unable to cope with stressful situations and having his will
                    sapped and overborne. He also alleged that the police had subjected him to
                    threats, assault, inducements and suggestion. After having considered the
                    evidence, which is summarised at [197]–[271] of the Judgment, the Judge held that it was likely
                    that Muhammad was suffering from withdrawal symptoms, but not to the degree that
                    would render him susceptible to threats, assault, inducements or suggestion (see
                    the Judgment at [279]). As the Judge was not of the opinion that there was any
                    threat, assault, inducement or oppressive circumstances, he held that all of
                    Muhammad’s disputed statements were admissible (see, generally, the
                    Judgment at [272]–[312]). Before us, the admissibility of these statements
                    was not raised as an issue.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The main trial</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     The main trial continued after the
                    trials-within-a-trial were completed. The evidence that was adduced as part of
                    the main trial has been summarised at [313]–[420] of the Judgment. Many
                    witnesses testified on behalf of the Prosecution, including the IO. The IO was
                    cross-examined on, <em>inter alia</em>, Mr Loh’s
                    statement of 5 September 2005.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_19" id="Ftn_19_1"><sup>[note: 19]</sup></a></span> That statement had not been disclosed
                    during the Preliminary Inquiry proceedings and was eventually only made
                    available to counsel for the Appellants on 4 September 2007, nearly
                    18 months after the trial had commenced and some six months after the
                    trials-within-a-trial had concluded. The material parts of the statement are as
                    follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">3    On [6 May 2005] at about 8.10 am, I saw my
                            wife opened the door and gate to chase away wild cats outside our house.
                            At that moment, I was lying on the bed in the bedroom nearer to the
                            kitchen. There was a clock hung on the wall in front of me. From where I
                            was, I could see portion of the living room practically the main door
                            and the living room near altar. I look back and could see what my wife
                            was doing.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">4    There was nobody outside the house when my wife went
                            to chase the cats. 2 minutes after my wife was outside the house, I saw
                            a thief came into my house. The thief is a man. He was wearing a brown
                            cap and a dark red shirt. …. He was wearing a long pant and I did
                            not know the colour of his pant. I did not see my wife came into the
                            house when the thief came into my house. The thief went to the kitchen
                            and I heard my wife shouted for help twice in Cantonese. Her voice was
                            coming from the kitchen near the refrigerator in the living room. I then
                            heard the theft shouted “<em>shut
                            up</em>” twice in English. Following that, I heard loud
                            “bung, bung” sound. I did not know where it came from.
                            Simultaneously, I heard my wife shouted for help in Cantonese twice. I
                            could not see what had happened as my view was blocked by a
                        wall.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">5    I looked at the clock and noticed that it was 8.20
                            am. Next, the thief came into my bedroom and squeezed my neck hardly
                            using his hand for 5 minutes. I felt a bit dizzy when my neck was being
                            squeezed. When he let go of his hand, he placed a knife on my throat
                            which is meant for chopping chicken. He did not harm me with the knife
                            but merely threatened me. At that moment, I looked at the ceiling and
                            did not pay attention to the clock. I did not know how long he placed
                            the knife on my neck. The thief did not utter any words. At times, I
                            looked at the thief and noticed that he is a Malay and had a tanned
                            complexion. He was still wearing the same cap. He is slim built
                            …. After the thief removed the knife from my neck, he pulled away
                            my feeding tube that was inserted into my nose. Next, he left my
                            bedroom.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">6    After the thief [left] my bedroom, I heard someone
                            pulling the drawers in the other bedroom. I did not hear my wife’s
                            voices. I looked at the clocked again and noticed that the time was
                            8.25 am. Next, I looked at the living room and noticed the same
                            thief opened the main door and left the house. He closed the door before
                            he left the house. After the thief left, I did not see my wife. She is
                            died. I could not do anything and was lying on the bed. I was sacred
                                [<em>sic</em>] and having headache. After the
                            theft left, nobody came into my house.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">7    At about 4.00 pm, I heard the nurse knocking and
                            calling for my wife outside the house. I remained lying on the bed and
                            could not do anything. I also heard the telephone rung in the living
                            room. The nurse could not enter the house and she left
                        shortly.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">8    After the sky turned dark, I heard my daughter
                            knocking and calling for my wife outside the house. A while later, the
                            police banged open the door and rescued me. I was then conveyed to the
                            hospital.</p>

                    both the Appellants were called upon to enter their defence. Muhammad elected to
                    give evidence first. This resulted in what was described by the Judge as a
                    “significant and dramatic twist to the case” (see the Judgment at
                    [329]). Muhammad proceeded to take sole responsibility for the robbery and the
                    murder of the Deceased. He also affirmed that Ismil was not present at the scene
                    of the crime (see the Judgment at [329]). This was a fundamental departure from
                    the statements that had been provided by both the Appellants, which the Judge
                    had earlier ruled to be admissible. In its closing submissions, the Prosecution
                    summarised Muhammad’s evidence on his sole liability as

<em>Confession of sole involvement
                            during court testimony</em>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">96.    Muhammad asserted that he was solely responsible
                            for the robbery and murder of the [D]eceased on 6 May 2005 and
                            exonerated Ismil totally from any involvement. Muhammad testified that
                            at a family gathering at his mother’s flat at Blk 185 Boon
                            Lay Avenue #04-154 attended by his siblings held soon after
                            Ismil’s arrest (7 May 2005), Muhammad had said that Ismil was
                                “<em>bersih</em>” (clean) and did
                            not know anything about the murder. Subsequently, when Muhammad was
                            arrested and remanded in Queenstown Remand Prison (QRP), he told his
                            sisters (Sabariah binte Kadar and Rosnani binte Kadar) sometime in
                            December 2005 when they visited him that he committed the crime alone.
                            He had also made similar admissions to 2 prison inmates (Mohd Zam and
                            Yusuff bin Ahmad) before the trial commenced in March 2006. Muhammad
                            made his first written admission of sole responsibility for the offence
                            on 19 December 2005, which was before the Preliminary Inquiry (PI),
                            when he saw his previous assigned counsel (Amarick Singh Gill ...) for
                            the first time and he [<em>ie</em>, Mr Gill]
                            wrote a note. Muhammad also wrote a 4 page confession ... in QRP about a
                            week before 10 September 2007. Muhammad testified that he wanted to
                            confess in court for his sole responsibility in the offence as he felt
                            guilty and did not want his innocent brother to be punished and he had
                            not admitted earlier as he was afraid of the death sentence.
                            [Notwithstanding] the various statements that Muhammad made to the CID
                            investigators where he described the role played by Ismil in the robbery
                            and killing of the [D]eceased, Muhammad now claims that all these had

                            Ismil was already arrested, Muhammad decided to push the blame to Ismil
                            by fabricating Ismil’s involvement.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">97.    Muhammad gave evidence that he went to the
                            [D]eceased’]s flat on 3 occasions that culminated in him robbing
                            and murdering the [D]eceased on the morning of 6 May 2005 (third
                            occasion). Prior to the three occasions, he had not spoken to the
                            [D]eceased or her husband but he was under the impression that the
                            [D]eceased knew him as her 4<sup>th</sup> floor

                            about 6 p.m. when Muhammad was alone [and] had just returned from
                            work and was about to enter his flat on the
                                4<sup>th</sup> floor when the [D]eceased called him

                            outside her flat, to assist her to help lift her bedridden husband from
                            his bed. Muhammad agreed and spent about 5 minutes in the
                            [D]eceased’[s] flat. He had never seen the [D]eceased’[s]
                            husband before and noticed that he was unable to speak. Muhammad
                            addressed him as “uncle”. Upon returning home, he did not
                            relate this to Ismil.</p>

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">99.    The second occasion that he went to the
                            [Deceased’s] flat was sometime after the first occasion and before
                                6<sup>th</sup> May 2005 when Muhammad went with his
                            drug addict friend, “Mamat Jurong”, to deliver food to the
                            [D]eceased. According to him, this occurred after Muhammad and
                            “Mamat Jurong” had abused Dormicum together in
                            Muhammad’s flat. Muhammad brought some food wrapped in plastic and
                            deliver it to the [D]eceased because he felt pity for the old man that
                            he saw on the first occasion. Muhammad clearly recalled that the
                            [D]eceased accepted the food and that he did not enter the flat. He
                            could, however, see the [D]eceased’[s] husband when he stood

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">100.  The third occasion Muhammad went to the
                            [D]eceased’]s flat was on the morning of 6 May 2005 when he
                            decided to rob the [D]eceased as he was short of money to buy drugs.
                            Although Muhammad was unaware of Ismil’s financial state on
                            6 May 2005 at the time, he acknowledged that Ismil was not working
                            then. Muhammad admitted that he had planned to rob the [D]eceased by
                            himself a few days before 6 May 2005 but did not mention this to
                            Ismil as he wanted [to] commit the offence alone. Muhammad did not have
                            a specific plan for the robbery but he targeted the [D]eceased’[s]
                            corner flat as he felt that few people pass by it. Muhammad also
                            acknowledged that he was prepared to confront the [D]eceased and use
                            force on her if she refused to give him money.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">101.  On 6 May 2005, Muhammad woke up about
                            8 a.m. and noticed that Ismil was still asleep in the same bedroom.
                            He claimed that he went to the toilet to consume Dormicum intravenously
                            as he did not want to share the drug with Ismil. After consuming
                            Dormicum, at which point, Ismil was still sleeping in the bedroom, and
                            proceeded to the [D]eceased’[s] flat on the
                                5<sup>th</sup> floor. He knocked on the door a few
                            times and when the [D]eceased opened the door, he used “hand
                            signals” to tell her that he wanted to see “uncle”
                            and she let him in and closed the front door. Muhammad went straight to
                            the bedroom where [Mr] Loh was lying on the bed and stood by
                            [Mr] Loh’s bed for a very short while before proceeding to
                            the kitchen. Thereat, he signalled the [D]eceased to come to the kitchen
                            and took a knife from a knife holder ... . When the [D]eceased was right
                            in front of him, he immediately thrusted the knife 3 times towards the
                            front of her body. The [D]eceased ran towards the toilet and he followed
                            her there and stabbed her again in the toilet until the knife handle
                            broke. Muhammad did not ask the [D]eceased to “shut up”
                            but she groaned as a result of her injuries. When the knife handle
                            broke, Muhammad took a chopper from the knife holder and returned to the
                            toilet to inflict more injuries on the [D]eceased. He used the chopper
                            at the [Deceased’s] head as she was then crouching on the toilet
                            floor, until she collapsed. Muhammad did not think that the [D]eceased
                            was dead yet as her hand was still moving but he thought that [she] was
                            going to die from the injuries which he inflicted. After he attacked the
                            [D]eceased with the chopper, Muhammad picked up the knife handle from
                            the toilet and threw this into the rubbish chute of the
                            [D]eceased’[s] flat.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">102.  Muhammad then went into [Mr] Loh’s
                            bedroom whilst holding the chopper in his hand. He removed
                            [Mr] Loh’s feeding tube and threatened [Mr] Loh by
                            putting his left finger on his lip whilst holding the chopper with his
                            right hand. Muhammad categorically denied that he placed the chopper at
                            [Mr] Loh’s neck and also that he squeezed
                            [Mr] Loh’s neck for 5 minutes. Muhammad spent only a short
                            time in [Mr] Loh’s bedroom before he went to ransack the
                            first room (near the main door) where he found a black purse containing
                            $15 in a cupboard in the first room and he kept it. When he came out of
                            this room, he saw the [D]eceased at the kitchen area approaching him and
                            he took the chopper ... and went to inflict more injuries on the
                            [D]eceased until she collapsed. Muhammad left the chopper on a shelf ...
                            .</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">103.  In the course of attacking the [D]eceased with
                            the chopper, Muhammad realised there was blood at the kitchen area and
                            he put on a pair of brown “slip on” shoes (belonging to
                            [Mr] Loh) which he found in a shoe rack behind the main door so as to
                            avoid getting his bare feet bloodied. During the time that he was in the
                            [D]eceased’[s] flat, he also washed his hands and feet in the
                            shower room (next to the toilet) and threw buckets of water at the
                            kitchen area to wash away the blood stains on the floor. He also used a
                            cloth to wipe the chopper and cupboard which he ransacked as well as the
                            tap ... before leaving the [D]eceased’[s] flat and closing the
                            door and metal gate. Muhammad wore his slippers and went upstairs to
                            dispose of [Mr] Loh’s brown shoes between the
                                8<sup>th</sup> and 9<sup>th</sup>
                            floor stairs landing. He then returned to his flat on the
                                4<sup>th</sup> floor, took out the $15 from the
                            black purse he stole from the [D]eceased’[s] flat earlier and
                            threw the empty black purse down to the 1<sup>st</sup>
                            floor. Muhammad estimated that he spent about an hour in the
                            [D]eceased’[s] flat. During the period that Muhammad was in the
                            [D]eceased’[s] flat, he attacked the [D]eceased with a knife and a
                            chopper during three distinct episodes, firstly in the kitchen with the
                            knife blade which continued to the toilet until the knife handle broke,
                            secondly, when he took the chopper and attacked her in the toilet until
                            she collapsed and thirdly, when he attacked her in the kitchen area
                            (near the refrigerator) when he came out of the
                                1<sup>st</sup> room and saw her approaching him from
                            the kitchen.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">104.  Muhammad entered his flat and headed to the
                            kitchen where he soaked his clothes (T-shirt, Bermudas and blue jacket)
                            in a pail of water with detergent. When he went to his bedroom, he met
                            Ismil and they abused Dormicum together. Muhammad claimed that he cannot
                            recall whether Ismil was still sleeping when he entered the bedroom
                            after returning from the [D]eceased’[s] flat. Muhammad maintained
                            that he did not tell Ismil anything about what he had done earlier that
                            morning when he went to the [D]eceased’[s] flat.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">105.  The events after Muhammad returned from the
                            [D]eceased’[s] flat are not particularly significant for the
                            purposes of the case before this Honourable Court as he had spent the
                            rest of the day with his brothers, Hathinin and Muhammad and friends,
                            Saini and Mat Hassim, abusing and buying drugs. Muhammad confirmed that
                            no one else knew about the murder and robbery and Mat Hassim arrived at
                            their flat after he had returned from the [D]eceased’[s]

                            T-shirt (P245), a pair of Bermuda shorts (P244), a maroon cap ..., a
                            dark blue jacket and a pair of slippers. During scene investigations,
                            Muhammad had only identified to [the IO] the beige T-shorts and the
                            Bermuda shorts which he wore to the [D]eceased’[s] flat. He lied
                            to [the IO] that the slippers had been stolen and there was no mention
                            of the blue jacket. By the time P244 and P245 had been seized on
                            30 May 2005, Muhammad had already washed P244 and P245. The dark
                            blue jacket was not seized.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">107.  During his court testimony, Muhammad contended
                            that when he learnt about Ismil’s arrest for murder of the
                            [D]eceased on 8 May 2005, he knew that the police had arrested the
                            wrong person but he was afraid of turning himself in. He made a complete
                            denial when he was questioned by the CID officers on 13 May 2005
                            and on 30 May 2005 until SSI Mazlan confronted him with the DNA
                            evidence on the [D]eceased’[s] black purse. Muhammad acknowledged
                            that as at 30 May 2005, had the police not found his DNA on the
                            black purse, he was prepared to let Ismil face the murder

                            30 May 2005 and subsequently, fabricated a minimal role for himself
                            that involved only ransacking the [D]eceased’[s] flat, he did so
                            partly because he was afraid and partly due to suggestions by the CID
                            officers. Muhammad agreed that most of these statements (in particular
                            the account of what Ismil did to the [Deceased] in the
                            [D]eceased’[s] flat and Ismil’s participation and presence

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis in original]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     Muhammad’s main line of defence was that
                    he was suffering from an abnormality of the mind, and was therefore entitled to
                    invoke the defence of diminished responsibility. In support of this,
                    Dr Calvin Fones Soon Leng (“Dr Fones”), a psychiatrist,
                    was asked to give evidence. Dr Fones testified that it was likely that
                    Muhammad was suffering from an abnormality of mind. He agreed that Muhammad did
                    not suffer from paradoxical rage when he attacked the Deceased, but was of the
                    view that Dormicum had affected Muhammad, having regard partly to the nature and
                    extent of the injuries inflicted on the Deceased as well as partly to the fact
                    that Muhammad could not recollect the extent to which he had attacked the
                    Deceased. In Dr Fones’ written report<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_24" id="Ftn_24_1"><sup>[note: 24]</sup></a></span>, he stated:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">1.    Muhammad was NOT of unsound mind during the alleged

                            consumed intravenous Dormicum; as he puts it ‘it made him feel
                            brave when under influence’. It is likely that his intention to
                            kill was formed while under the influence of Dormicum that he had taken.
                            The disinhibitory effects of the drug also contributed to the nature of
                            the crime where he slashed the woman repeatedly without a clear
                            recollection of how many times he had done so. Indeed he remarked that
                            he was ‘shocked’ when told later how many times he had
                            allegedly slashed the woman. The effects of the drug had likely led to a
                            major reduction in self-control and regulation of his own
                            actions.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">4.    It is thus conceivable that [Muhammad] was
                            suffering from such abnormality of mind at the time of the offence, due
                            to the effects of Dormicum, in that it substantially impaired his
                            responsibility for his actions in causing the death of his victim. He
                            had earlier formed the intention to harm the woman while under the
                            influence of Dormicum, and the effects of the drug on his mental state
                            further affected the extent of his actions at the material
                        time.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     To rebut Dr Fones’ evidence, the
                    Prosecution adduced the evidence of Dr G Sathyadevan
                    (“Dr Sathyadevan”), Senior Consultant Psychiatrist and Chief
                    of the Department of Forensic Psychiatry at the Institute of Mental Health
                    (“IMH”). Dr Sathyadevan had re-examined Muhammad on 17 and
                    29 January 2008 and produced a report dated 13 February
                        2008.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_25" id="Ftn_25_1"><sup>[note: 25]</sup></a></span> In his report,
                    Dr Sathyadevan stated that Muhammad has an IQ of 76. In
                    Dr Sathyadevan’s opinion, Muhammad did not suffer from an abnormality
                    of mind or a substantial impairment of judgment. Being high on Dormicum would
                    not amount to an abnormality of mind unless there are psychiatric complications
                    such as paradoxical rage or confusion. Muhammad’s actions had to be
                    consistent with an abnormality of the mind. While Dormicum gave Muhammad
                    boldness, he was in control of his mental faculties and actions.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     Ismil also elected to give evidence. The main
                    thrust of his case was that he was not at the scene of the crime. For
                    completeness, we should also mention that on 3 January 2006, Ismil’s
                    counsel filed a notice of alibi stating that Ismil was at home at the time of
                    the murder. This was contrary to what he had said in his statements (see the
                    Judgment at [348]). Notwithstanding the fact that the Judge had already ruled on
                    the admissibility of the statements made by the Appellants, counsel for Ismil
                    attempted to persuade the Judge to either review the admissibility of his
                    statements or to give no weight to them due to his low IQ and personality
                    coupled with the withdrawal symptoms he had been suffering at the relevant time
                    (see the Judgment at [421]). Ismil’s witnesses included Dr Harold
                    Peter Robers (“Dr Robers”), a clinical psychologist, and
                    Dr Ung Eng Khean (“Dr Ung”), a senior consultant
                    psychiatrist and psychotherapist with Adam Road Medical Centre.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     Dr Robers had conducted an intelligence
                    quotient (“IQ”) test known as the Performance Scale IQ of the
                    Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale, 3rd edition (“the
                    WAIS-III”) and a Comprehensive Test of Nonverbal Intelligence
                    (“the CTONI”) on Ismil on 22 September 2007. The result of
                    the WAIS-III indicated that Ismil had an IQ of 73.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_26" id="Ftn_26_1"><sup>[note: 26]</sup></a></span> This score was
                    accepted by the Prosecution (see the Judgment at [382]). The report dated
                    24 September 2007 that Dr Robers produced contained the following
                        summary:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_27" id="Ftn_27_1"><sup>[note: 27]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">On the WAIS-III, Ismil achieved a Performance Scale IQ of 73, which is in
                        the Borderline range to Mid Mentally Retarded range of scores (95%
                        confidence interval: 68-81). On the CTONI, Ismil achieved a CTONI overall
                        nonverbal IQ of 75. This also places him in the borderline range of
                        intellectual functioning. He achieved a Pictorial IQ score of 70
                        (Poor/borderline to mentally deficient) and a Geometric IQ score of 83 (Low
                        average).</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Both tests indicate that Ismil has mentally deficient skills (Borderline
                        to mild mentally retarded) and while similar individuals function at a
                        higher level than those classified as more severely mentally retarded, their
                            <em>cognitive functioning is nevertheless
                            limited</em>, <em>creating problems for everyday
                            functioning, judgment, and academic or occupational
                            achievement</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">From the results of the testing, Ismil has <em>weak
                            reasoning and comprehension skills</em>. This is likely to be
                        reflected in <em>poorer judgment and he is apt to become more
                            suggestible and more easily influenced by others when pressured or
                            coerced</em>. He is likely to be <em>prone to be
                            vulnerable to suggestions and manipulations when he in

                        Although Ismil can perform and remember concrete tasks and information with
                        some adequacy, he experiences difficulty when he has to deal with
                        information, pictures and material related to common everyday occurrences.
                        He is likely to have significant limitations in processing information that
                        are more abstract or complex in nature.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In view of this information gained through the psychological testing
                        concerning Ismil’s cognitive-intellectual functioning, it is
                        recommended that a psychiatric interview is conducted to ascertain
                        specifically how his deficits have affected and influenced his functioning,
                        behaviour and responses.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     Dr Ung testified that Ismil had been
                    suffering from moderate to severe withdrawal symptoms, having regard to his
                    answers to a questionnaire and oral responses during the interviews that he
                    conducted. He added that even if Ismil had only been experiencing mild
                    withdrawal symptoms, his other conclusions about the likelihood of a coerced
                    false confession remained because of a confluence of factors, <em>viz</em>, Ismil’s low intelligence, personality and the stress
                    he faced. He also stated that Ismil had said that his poor command of English
                    was one of the reasons as to why he had not disclosed the full range of
                    withdrawal symptoms or his innocence to Dr Cheong Hong Fai
                    (“Dr Cheong”), the doctor who had conducted a medical
                    examination of him, and to Dr Stephen Phang
                    (“Dr Phang”), a consultant psychiatrist at the Institute of
                    Mental Health (“IMH”) who had conducted a psychiatric examination
                    of him. Dr Ung produced a report dated 18 March 2008, which contained
                    the following summary of findings:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_28" id="Ftn_28_1"><sup>[note: 28]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">1.    Ismil is a <b>moderate to severe
                                abuser of Benzodiazepines</b>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">2.    Given this level of abuse, a moderate to severe
                            level of withdrawal is likely to manifest on abrupt cessation of
                            Benzodiazepine consumption.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">3.    Ismil was suffering from <b>moderate to severe benzodiazepine withdrawal</b> at the
                            time of his interrogation.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">4.    A psychological assessment by Dr Harold Robers
                            revealed that Ismil’s performance IQ is 73. This is in the
                                <b>Borderline to Mild Mentally Retarded range of
                                intellectual functioning</b>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">5.    I fully concur with Dr Rober’s opinion that
                            Ismil is apt to <b>manifest poor judgment</b> and
                            to <b>become more suggestible</b> and <b>be more easily influenced by others when pressurized or
                                coerced thus being vulnerable to suggestions and manipulations when
                                he is under stress or threat</b>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">6.    
              <b>Drug intoxication and/or
                                withdrawal</b> and <b>mental handicap/low
                                intelligence</b> are prominent factors in Ismil’s case
                            that significantly increase the likelihood of a false
                        confession.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">7.    Because of his withdrawal symptoms, anxiety, low
                            intellect and lack of assertiveness, Ismil was unable to cope with the
                            distress and was preoccupied with alleviating any further distress.
                            There was total preoccupation with the short and immediate term with
                            little regard of the long-term consequences of his action.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">8.    Other personal factors relevant in Ismil’s
                            case that have been implicated in increasing suggestibility thus
                            increasing the likelihood of a false confession are <b>anxiety, lack of assertiveness and poor
                        memory</b>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">9.    External interrogative factors such as <b>exaggeration of the evidence</b> available, the
                            threatened consequences to Ismil by ‘not signing’ and
                                <b>inducements of leniency</b> for confession
                            is likely to have added to Ismil’s likelihood of false
                            confession.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">10.    The constellation of these internal and external
                            factors would synergistically interact to magnify the risks of a false
                            confession.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">11.    Ismil’s confession would conform to a
                                <b>coerced-complaint false confession</b>.
                            His main motive for doing so was to alleviate and minimize his
                            distress.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">12.    Ismil’s highly selective memory gaps in his
                            statements given to the Police are unlikely to be a consequence of
                            anterograde amnesia related to Benzodiazepine use or withdrawal. These
                            would be consistent that he made up a story based on what information
                            and cues he obtained from the Police. In the absence of such cues and
                            information, he would usually claim that “he could not
                            remember.”</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">13.    His behaviour at being confronted after trying to
                            sell the two stolen handphones after the alleged murder is consistent
                            with his assertions of innocence.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">14.    The presence of <b>incontrovertible forensic evidence</b> would seriously
                            detract from Ismil’s claims of innocence and the possibility
                            of a false confession. Conversely, the absence of any such
                            incontrovertible forensic evidence would lend credence to his account of
                            providing a false confession.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">15.    Having considered Ismil’s case carefully in
                            the context of the available information and scientific/medical opinion,
                            I would caution against undue reliance being placed upon his confession
                            as there is a <b>significant likelihood that his
                                confession is false</b>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">16.    Ismil’s poor command of English is likely to
                            have hindered a proper and thorough psychiatric evaluation being
                            conducted by Dr Cheong and Dr Phang shortly after the alleged
                            murder.</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     The Prosecution called a number of witnesses
                    to rebut the evidence of Dr Robers and Dr Ung. Dr Rasaiah
                    Munidasa Winslow (“Dr Winslow”) testified, amongst other
                    things, that Ismil may have had mild physical withdrawal symptoms from Dormicum
                    and/or Subutex during the recording of the statements. However, the withdrawal
                    from drug use was unlikely to have had a significant effect on his ability to
                    provide statements.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_29" id="Ftn_29_1"><sup>[note: 29]</sup></a></span> This opinion was based, in part, on the

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     Dr Phang, himself, testified for the
                    Prosecution as well. He denied that there was any breakdown in communication
                    between him and Ismil even though he had communicated with Ismil in English. To
                    Dr Phang, Ismil did not come across as a credulous, weak-willed individual
                    who had simply confessed because no one believed him.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_32" id="Ftn_32_1"><sup>[note: 32]</sup></a></span>
                    Dr Phang disagreed with Dr Robers that Ismil’s cognitive
                    functioning was limited. While Dr Phang acknowledged that there would be
                    some problems with cognitive functioning for persons who fall within such a low
                    IQ range, this did not pose any problems with daily functioning. Neither did

                    disagreed with Dr Ung and Dr Robers that Ismil was vulnerable to

                    Ismil’s confessions were false.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_34" id="Ftn_34_1"><sup>[note: 34]</sup></a></span> It would be apposite
                    to observe, parenthetically, that it appears that Dr Phang was not made
                    aware of the precise circumstances of Ismil’s initial confession and his
                    physical condition (see, also, <a href="#p1_168">[168]</a>–<a href="#p1_170">[170]</a>
                    below).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The decision of the High Court</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     The following could be regarded as a summary
                    of the main reasons for the Judge’s conclusion that the Prosecution had
                    proven beyond reasonable doubt that both the Appellants should be held to be
                    equally liable for murder pursuant to s 302 read with s 34 of the
                    Penal Code:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_35-p2_a"></a>(a)     Ismil’s withdrawal symptoms
                        were mild to, at most, moderate (see the Judgment at [433]). Dr Ung was
                        too willing to accept Ismil’s responses at face value (see the
                        Judgment at [423]). For all the allegations of withdrawal symptoms, Ismil
                        had already begun to outline his defence – that he had accidentally
                        stabbed the Deceased – from the first time he gave a formal statement
                        on 7 May 2005 and he had steered away from mentioning Muhammad’s
                        presence at the scene of the crime initially, which suggested that his mind
                        was not as affected by withdrawal symptoms as was suggested (see the
                        Judgment at [426] and [427]). The emphasis on poor English was a distraction
                        – it was not clear what Ismil wanted to say to Dr Cheong or
                        Dr Phang on his withdrawal symptoms but could not due to his poor
                        English (see the Judgment at [431]).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_35-p2_b"></a>(b)     The evidence of family members and fellow inmates did not
                        suggest that Ismil had an acquiescent personality (see the Judgment at
                        [437]). Dr Phang’s evidence was more persuasive than
                        Dr Ung’s evidence of an acquiescent personality (see the Judgment
                        at [438]). Ismil’s evidence that he could not understand questions was
                        not convincing, and his latest position that he was not able to understand
                        about half the contents of his statements indicated that he was street-smart
                        and not acquiescent (see the Judgment at [439] and
                    [441]).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_35-p2_c"></a>(c)     Although
                        s 121(3) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 1985 Rev Ed)
                        (“CPC”) requires a statement of a person examined by a police
                        officer to be signed, s 122(5) of the CPC allows any statement of an
                        accused person, whether oral or in writing, to be admitted if the statement
                        is made to a police officer of the rank of sergeant or above. Thus, the two
                        statements Ismil made to SSI Zainal were admissible (see the Judgment
                        at [454]).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_35-p2_d"></a>(d)     The
                        details in the statements provided by Ismil, which suggested that it was
                        likely that he was at the crime scene at the material time (see the Judgment
                        at [462]), carried more weight than the discrepancies (see the Judgment at
                        [463]). Additionally, the statements provided by Muhammad, which
                        incriminated Ismil, were “damning” against Ismil (see the
                        Judgment at [465]).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_35-p2_e"></a>(e)     Muhammad mentioning his sole involvement to his previous lawyers, his
                        fellow inmates and his sisters was part of his “plan” to save
                        Ismil (see the Judgment at [467]–[474]). Mr Loh’s statement
                        of 5 September 2005 did not rule out the presence of more than one
                        perpetrator (see the Judgment at [476]). It was also possible that
                        Mr Loh could have missed seeing someone in the flat due to his position
                        in the bedroom (see the Judgment at [477] and [478]).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_35-p2_f"></a>(f)     Although it could not be said that
                        Muhammad was the assailant beyond reasonable doubt, it could be said that
                        both the Appellants were involved, and that they were both at the scene of
                        the crime at the material time (see the Judgment at [495]). The confessions
                        of Ismil and the broad consistency in his statements, including his
                        knowledge of some details and his statements on Muhammad’s role, as
                        well as Muhammad’s confessions all placed Ismil at the scene of the
                        crime at the material time (see the Judgment at [495]).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_35-p2_g"></a>(g)     A finding as to the identity of the
                        sole assailant would not be required for the operation of s 34 of the
                        Penal Code (see the Judgment at [498]–[499]). There was a plan between
                        the Appellants to rob the Deceased (see the Judgment at [503]). Whether
                        Muhammad or Ismil was the assailant, each must have known that it was likely
                        that the Deceased would have to be killed to avoid any risk of identifying
                        them, and each must have been aware of the attack on the Deceased (see the
                        Judgment at [504]–[506]). Having regard to the law as laid out in
                            <em>Lee Chez Kee v Public Prosecutor</em> [2008]
                        3 SLR(R) 447, it could be concluded that (see the Judgment at
                        [508]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">[the Deceased] was killed in furtherance of the common intention to
                            commit robbery. Accordingly, Ismil and Muhammad would be guilty of
                            murder under s 302 read with s 34 of the Penal Code unless
                            there was some other defence.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_35-p2_h"></a>(h)     Based on the
                        psychiatric evidence, the defence of diminished responsibility would not be
                        available to either of the Appellants, as they had not been suffering from
                        an abnormality of mind (see the Judgment at [521]).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The present appeal</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     We first heard this appeal on 21 January
                    2011. The Prosecution’s position during that hearing was that both the
                    Appellants were guilty of murder committed in furtherance of their common
                    intention to commit robbery. Both Appellants, on the other hand, maintained that
                    it was Muhammad alone who carried out both the robbery and killing. During the
                    course of that hearing, it appeared to us that the Prosecution had not
                    adequately considered various issues that were central to the appeal. We
                    therefore adjourned the hearing to 15 April 2011, and directed the
                    Prosecution to address the court on, <em>inter alia</em>,
                    the following points:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_36-p2_a"></a>(a)     Was s 34 of the Penal Code
                        applied correctly by the Judge?</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_36-p2_b"></a>(b)     If there was only one assailant, what was the position of
                        the other person, <em>ie</em>, the accomplice, in the
                        light of <em>Daniel Vijay s/o Katherasan and others v Public
                            Prosecutor</em> [2010] 4 SLR 1119 (“<em>Daniel Vijay</em>”)?</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_36-p2_c"></a>(c)     Who was the real assailant in the Prosecution’s
                        view?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     The Prosecution was granted leave to file
                    further written submissions to address the above points, and this was
                    subsequently done on 4 March 2011. The Appellants were also granted leave
                    to respond to the Prosecution’s further written submissions. Counsel for
                    Ismil did so and filed written submissions on 18 March 2011. Counsel for
                    Muhammad confirmed that they would not be filing any written submissions, and
                    that Muhammad’s position was unchanged from the position that he had
                    adopted at the hearing on 21 January 2011.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     The Prosecution’s further written
                    submissions and oral submissions at the hearing on 15 April 2011 revealed
                    that the Prosecution had changed its position yet again. In this regard, the
                    Prosecution, in essence, accepted that the Judge erred in convicting Ismil
                    jointly of murder (see <a href="#p1_3">[3]</a> above). However,
                    the Prosecution, as mentioned earlier, submitted that Ismil should not be
                    acquitted completely, but should still be found guilty of an offence, <em>viz</em>, robbery with hurt pursuant to s 394 read with
                    s 34 of the Penal Code. Under this latest position of the Prosecution,
                    Muhammad alone would be guilty of murder. The following is a summary of the
                    final position of parties:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_38-p2_a"></a>(a)     
            <b>Prosecution</b>: Muhammad alone should be found guilty of
                        murder, whereas Ismil should be found guilty of robbery with hurt pursuant
                        to s 394 read with s 34 of the Penal Code;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_38-p2_b"></a>(b)     
            <b>Muhammad</b>: Muhammad was the sole participant in the crime, but he
                        was not guilty of murder as he was entitled to rely on the defence of
                        diminished responsibility; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_38-p2_c"></a>(c)     
            <b>Ismil</b>: Ismil was not guilty
                        of any offence as he was not present at the scene of the crime and was not
                        involved in either the killing or the robbery.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     In their submissions, both the Prosecution and
                    counsel for the Appellants raised numerous issues of fact and law. In dealing
                    with the issues of fact, we shall adopt the approach set out in <em>ADF v Public Prosecutor and another appeal</em> [2010]
                    1 SLR 874, where this court stated (at [16]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[A]n appellate court has a limited role when it is asked to
                        assess findings of fact made by the trial court. In summary, the role is
                        circumscribed as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(a)    Where the finding of fact hinges on the trial
                                judge’s assessment of the credibility and veracity of
                                witnesses based on the demeanour of the witness, the appellate court
                                will interfere only if the finding of fact can be shown to be
                                plainly wrong or against the weight of evidence: see <em>PP v Mohammed Liton Mohammed Syeed Mallik</em>
                                [2008] 1 SLR(R) 601 at [32] and <em>Yap
                                    Giau Beng Terence v PP</em> [1998] 2 SLR(R) 855
                                    (“<em>Yap Giau Beng
                                Terrence</em>” [<em>sic</em>]) at
                                [24]. An appellate court may also intervene, if, after taking into
                                account all the advantages available to the trial judge, it
                                concludes that the verdict is wrong in law and therefore
                                unreasonable: <em>Jagatheesan s/o Krishnasamy v
                                    PP</em> [2006] 4 SLR(R) 45 (“<em>Jagatheesan</em>”) at [43].</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(b)    Where the finding of fact by the trial judge
                                is based on the inferences drawn from the internal consistency (or
                                lack thereof) in the content of witnesses’ testimony or the
                                external consistency between the content of their testimony and the
                                extrinsic evidence, an appellate court is in as good a position as
                                the trial court to assess the veracity of the witness’s
                                evidence. The real tests are how consistent the story is within
                                itself, how it stands the test of cross-examination, and how it fits
                                in with the rest of the evidence and the circumstances of the case:
                                see <em>Jagatheesan</em> at [40]. If a decision
                                is inconsistent with the material objective evidence on record,
                                appellate intervention will usually be warranted.</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(c)    An appellate court is as competent as any
                                trial judge to draw any necessary inferences of fact from the
                                circumstances of the case: see <em>Yap Giau Beng
                                    Terence</em> at [24].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     Having said that, we will begin by considering
                    certain pertinent issues of law, before considering the convictions of each of
                    the Appellants in turn.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Preliminary legal issues</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     The applicable legislation governing criminal
                    procedure for this case is the CPC. Where appropriate, reference will also be
                    made to the Criminal Procedure Code (Act 15 of 2010) (the
                    “CPC 2010”), which came into force on 2 January 2011.
                    Given the several twists and turns in both the Defence’s and the
                    Prosecution’s respective cases, there are four issues of law that we feel
                    should be considered on a preliminary basis. They are:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_41-p2_a"></a>(a)     the admissibility of and discretion
                        to exclude procedurally-flawed statements;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_41-p2_b"></a>(b)     the treatment of subsequent statements with
                        similar content to an excluded statement;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_41-p2_c"></a>(c)     the court’s testing of the veracity of a
                        disputed statement admitted into evidence; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_41-p2_d"></a>(d)     the duty of the Prosecution to the court in
                        relation to the disclosure of relevant material not favourable to the case
                        that it seeks to present.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Admissibility and exclusion of procedurally-flawed statements
            </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     Statements recorded by the police from accused
                    persons can be classified into two categories, <em>viz</em>, “long statements” or “investigation
                    statements” under s 121 of the CPC (now s 22 of the
                    CPC 2010) or “cautioned statements” under s 122(6) of
                    the CPC (now s 23 of the CPC 2010) (see <em>Criminal
                        Procedure</em> vol 2 (Tan Yock Lin) (LexisNexis, Looseleaf Ed,
                    1996, November 2010 Ed) at ch V, para 1905). The power under
                    s 121 of the CPC to examine any person and reduce their statement into
                    writing is one of the powers of investigation that a police officer may exercise
                    in investigating a seizable offence (now an “arrestable offence”
                    under the CPC 2010). Section 121 of the CPC provides:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">

<p class="Judg-1">As can be seen, s 121 of the CPC prescribes certain formal

                    state the consequences of non-compliance with these requirements.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     Cautioned statements are statements that are
                    given in response to the notice in writing that is required pursuant to
                    s 122(6) of the CPC (now s 23 of the CPC 2010) once a person is
                    informed that he may be prosecuted for an offence or is charged with an offence.
                    The notice informs the person, <em>inter alia</em>, that if
                    there is any fact that he wishes to rely on in his defence, he should state it
                    as doing so at trial for the first time may render it less likely to be
                    believed. Any statement given by an accused person, whether pursuant to
                    s 121 or s 122(6) of the CPC, to a police officer of or above the rank
                    of sergeant would be admissible pursuant to s 122(5) of the CPC (now
                    s 258 of the CPC 2010), which prescribes the requirement of
                    voluntariness. Section 122(5) of the CPC states:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<em>Where any person is charged</em> with an offence

                        tenders himself as a witness, any such statement may be used in
                        cross-examination and for the purpose of impeaching his credit:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Provided that the court shall refuse to admit such statement or allow it
                        to be used as aforesaid if the making of the statement appears to the court
                        to have been caused by any inducement, threat or promise having reference to
                        the charge against such person, proceeding from a person in authority and
                        sufficient, in the opinion of the court, to give such person grounds which
                        would appear to him reasonable for supposing that by making it he would gain
                        any advantage or avoid any evil of a temporal nature in reference to the
                        proceedings against him.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     As a general rule, voluntary statements from
                    an accused person recorded by a police sergeant (or more senior officer)
                    pursuant to s 121 and/or s 122(6) would be admissible under
                    s 122(5) even if the procedural requirements set out in ss 121 and
                    122(6) are not met. The Court of Criminal Appeal held in <em>Vasavan Sathiadew &amp; 2 Ors v Public Prosecutor</em> [1992]
                    SGCA 26 (“<em>Sathiadew (CCA)</em>”)
                    that a breach of the signature requirement in s 121(3) would not render a
                    statement inadmissible under s 122(5); it would only affect the weight to
                    be attached to the statement by casting doubt on whether it was actually made.
                    This determination in <em>Sathiadew (CCA)</em> was reached
                    by parity of reasoning with <em>Tsang Yuk Chung v Public
                        Prosecutor</em> [1990] 2 SLR(R) 39 (“<em>Tsang Yuk Chung</em>”), where the court held (at
                        [17]–[20]) that a failure to follow the notice
                    procedure in s 122(6) did not render a statement inadmissible under
                    s 122(5), although it would affect the inferences which could be drawn
                    under s 123(1) of the CPC (now s 261(1) of the CPC 2010) from a
                    failure on the accused person’s part to state his defence upon being
                    cautioned. The principle set out in these cases has been incorporated as
                        Explanation 2(<em>e</em>) of s 258(3) of the
                    CPC 2010.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     If procedural breaches under s 121 or
                    s 122(6) of the CPC of themselves would not render a statement
                    inadmissible, it stands to reason that breaches of the Police General Orders
                    that relate to the recording of statements would also not of themselves render
                    statements inadmissible under s 122(5) of the CPC.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     That having been said, in <em>Public Prosecutor v Dahalan bin Ladaewa</em> [1995]
                    2 SLR(R) 124 (“<em>Dahalan</em>”),
                    S Rajendran J held (at [26]–[27]) that he
                    had the discretion to refuse to admit an accused person’s statement under
                    s 122(5) of the CPC even if it was voluntarily made without threat,
                    inducement or promise. He appeared to have concluded that he had such a
                    discretion based on the fact that s 122(5) made statements
                    “admissible” without mandating that they be
                    “admitted”. He then proceeded to exercise this discretion to
                    exclude the statement in the case before him – this despite making
                    findings that the statement in question had been involuntarily given, which
                    would therefore have obviated the need to consider any general discretion to
                    exclude voluntary statements. In his view, at the time of recording, the accused
                    had been suffering from severe effects of heroin and Erimin consumption such as
                    to make his statement involuntary, applying the standard set by this court in
                        <em>Garnam Singh v Public Prosecutor</em> [1994]
                    1 SLR(R) 1044 (“<em>Garnam
                    Singh</em>”) at [31] (see
                        <em>Dahalan</em> at [74]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     In <em>Dahalan</em>, a
                    police sergeant, one Sergeant Lai Thong Fock (“Sgt Lai”),
                    took a statement from the accused, a drug addict. The accused had consumed
                    heroin and Erimin on the morning that the statement had been recorded. He was
                    interviewed in English without being asked if he wished to speak in Malay. When
                    interviewing the accused, Sgt Lai jotted down the answers in note form on a
                    piece of paper. The statement was not read back to the accused, nor was the
                    accused asked to sign on the paper. Just under four hours later, Sgt Lai
                    wrote an expanded version of the statement in his pocket book, and destroyed the
                    original piece of paper.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     Rajendran J decided to exercise his
                    discretion to exclude the statement based on the fact that (at [86]):</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_48-p2_a"></a>(a)     the accused was under the effects of
                        Erimin and heroin consumption during the recording (see also [74]–[77]);</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_48-p2_b"></a>(b)     an interpreter was not made available despite the
                        accused’s lack of proficiency in English (see also [78]); and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_48-p2_c"></a>(c)     Sgt Lai had disregarded the procedural
                        requirements in s 121 of the CPC and the Police General Orders in the
                        recording of the statements (see also [79]–[85]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Regarding this last point, Rajendran J
                    distinguished <em>Fung Yuk Shing v Public Prosecutor</em>
                    [1993] 2 SLR(R) 771 (“<em>Fung Yuk
                        Shing</em>”), where a similarly irregular statement was
                    admitted. The written recording of the recording officer in <em>Fung Yuk Shing</em> had been found to be honest and accurate; in
                    contrast the “professionalism of Sgt Lai or the accuracy of his memory or
                    record” was questionable in view of, <em>inter
                        alia</em>, his untruths in court and discrepancies between his
                    evidence and that of another police officer (see <em>Dahalan</em> at [82]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     Rajendran J, however, acknowledged that
                    mere non-compliance with s 121 or the Police General Orders would not
                    automatically result in inadmissibility, having regard to <em>Public Prosecutor v Mazlan bin Maidun and another</em> [1992]
                    3 SLR(R) 968 (“<em>Mazlan</em>”)
                    (see <em>Dahalan</em> at [84]). However, he then empathically declared (at [85]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Where, as in this case, the violation of these provisions was <em>flagrant</em>, <em>it was incumbent on the
                            Prosecution to either offer some reasonable explanation for such
                            violation or desist from attempting to adduce statements taken in
                            disregard of these provisions</em> as evidence before the court.
                        [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">To put Rajendran J’s statement in its factual context,
                    Sgt Lai initially claimed that as a plainclothes officer, he was not
                    expected to carry his pocket book with him; he also did not take the trouble to
                    go up to his office and take his pocket book (see <em>Dahalan</em> at [9]). However,
                    when confronted by evidence that his practice was in direct violation of the
                    relevant provisions in the Police General Orders, he merely claimed to have
                    forgotten about those provisions (see <em>Dahalan</em> at
                        [10]–[12]). By his above statement,
                    Rajendran J seems to have meant that the court would refuse to admit
                    statements taken in such “flagrant” violation of the procedural
                    provisions if no reasonable explanation were offered, although he did not say so
                    explicitly.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     Rajendran J also referred to the case of
                        <em>Kong Weng Chong v Public Prosecutor</em> [1993]
                    3 SLR(R) 453 (“<em>Kong Weng
                    Chong</em>”) (see <em>Dahalan</em> at
                        [83]). In that case, the Court of
                    Criminal Appeal held (at [27]–[28]) that
                    the grave procedural irregularities in a statement made by the accused meant
                    that it “should not have been accepted” by the trial judge. These
                    irregularities included the fact that the statement was not reduced into writing
                    until about five weeks after it was made. The recording narcotics officers also
                    admitted that important details had been left out of the statement in question,
                    which was furthermore wholly inconsistent with a cautioned statement recorded
                    from the accused on the same day. In Rajendran J’s view, the decision in
                        <em>Kong Weng Chong</em> to reject the statement was an
                    exercise of the discretion to exclude an irregular statement. In our view,
                    however, it is not clear whether the court in <em>Kong Weng
                        Chong</em> was exercising a discretion to exclude an irregular
                    statement or whether it was admitting the statement but giving it no
                    weight.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     In determining whether a residual discretion
                    exists to exclude voluntary statements made by an accused person, it is
                    necessary to consider the observations of the court in <em>Law
                        Society of Singapore v Tan Guat Neo Phyllis</em> [2008]
                    2 SLR(R) 239 (“<em>Phyllis
                    Tan</em>”). To summarise what was an in-depth discussion, the court
                    observed (at [126]) that the principle
                    relied on in certain cases that the court had a discretion to exclude evidence
                    only on the ground that it was obtained in ways unfair to the accused was
                    incompatible with the Evidence Act (Cap 97, 1997 Rev Ed) (“the
                    EA”). That principle was ousted, in particular, by s 2(2) of the EA.
                    However, the court further held (at [126]) that the key holding of the House of Lords in <em>Regina v Sang</em> [1980] 1 AC 402 (“<em>Sang</em>”) to the effect that there remained a
                    discretion to exclude any evidence that had more prejudicial effect than
                    probative value is “consistent with the EA and in accordance with the
                    letter and spirit of s 2(2), and is therefore applicable in the Singapore
                    context”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     Even before <em>Phyllis
                        Tan</em> was decided, the existence of the <em>Sang</em> type of discretion had been endorsed by this court in
                        <em>Wong Keng Leong Rayney v Law Society of
                        Singapore</em> [2007] 4 SLR(R) 377 (“<em>Rayney Wong</em>”) in the following terms (at
                        [27]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">We know of no principle which states that evidence that has been procured
                        improperly or unfairly in order to prosecute offenders but which is not
                        procured unlawfully is an abuse of process or that it is inadmissible in
                        evidence, <em>except when there would be unfairness at the
                            trial in terms of its prejudicial effect exceeding its probative
                            value</em>. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">In Jeffrey Pinsler SC, <em>Evidence and the
                        Litigation Process</em> (LexisNexis, 3rd Ed, 2010)
                        (“<em>Evidence and the Litigation
                    Process</em>”) at ch 10 (which is a reproduction of the
                    article by Jeffrey Pinsler SC, “Whether a Singapore Court has a
                    Discretion to Exclude Evidence Admissible in Criminal Proceedings” (2010)
                    22 SAcLJ 335), this discretion is regarded as not only approved in
                        <em>Phyllis Tan</em>, but as arising from an inherent
                    jurisdiction of the court to prevent injustice at trial (see <em>Evidence and the Litigation Process</em> at paras 10.20 and
                    10.24).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     For present purposes, it suffices for us to
                    state that from the recent authorities cited above, it is clear that a common
                    law discretion to exclude voluntary statements that would otherwise be
                    admissible exists where the prejudicial effect of the evidence exceeds its
                    probative value (for convenience, this discretion will be referred to hereafter
                    as the “exclusionary discretion” where appropriate). In our view,
                    the discretion exercised by Rajendran J in <em>Dahalan</em> was none other than this exclusionary discretion. This
                    is evident from [74], [77], [78] and [82] of
                        <em>Dahalan</em>, where Rajendran J’s
                    discussion focused on the effect that certain conditions had on the evidential
                    value of the statement’s content. In his view, the powerful effects of
                    drugs on the accused’s mind, the lack of necessary language interpretation
                    and the destruction of the original record of the statement coupled with
                    Sgt Lai’s unreliability as a witness all combined to make it
                    “unsafe” to admit the statement (see [86]). The approach of the court in <em>Kong Weng
                        Chong</em>, in so far as it also focused on the poor probative value
                    of the accused’s statement in the light of the facts surrounding its
                    recording, should also be regarded as consistent with the existence and correct
                    exercise of the exclusionary discretion.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     Other examples of cases where the exclusionary
                    discretion appears to have been exercised include <em>Public
                        Prosecutor v Vasavan Sathiadew and others</em> [1989]
                    2 SLR(R) 357 (“<em>Sathiadew
                    (HC)</em>”), <em>Public Prosecutor v Syed Abdul Aziz
                        Bin Syed Mohd Noor and Another</em> [1992] SGHC 197 and <em>Public Prosecutor v Hanafiah bin Bedullah</em> [1993] SGHC
                    211, where statements of accused persons were not admitted due to the absence of
                    language interpretation (or sufficiently competent language interpretation) at
                    their recording. These exclusions were not disturbed on appeal (see <em>Sathiadew (CCA)</em>, <em>Syed Abdul Aziz and
                        another v Public Prosecutor</em> [1993] 3 SLR(R) 1 and
                        <em>Hanafiah bin Bedullah v Public Prosecutor</em>
                    [1994] 1 SLR(R) 101).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     In our view, there is no reason why a
                    discretion to exclude voluntary statements from accused persons should not exist
                    where the prejudicial effect of the evidence exceeds its probative value. For
                    one, where prejudicial effect exceeds the probative value, the very reliability
                    of the statement sought to be admitted is questionable. It appears to us that
                    this is an area of judicial discretion that Parliament has left to the courts.
                    In this regard, we agree with Rajendran J’s perceptive interpretation
                    of s 122(5) of the CPC in <em>Dahalan</em> (see
                        [46] above). Probative value is, in
                    other words, the crucial factor <em>vis-à-vis</em>
                    admissibility or non-admissibility of statements from accused persons under the
                    CPC. This is already the settled position under the EA, as evident from the
                    following passage from <em>Phyllis Tan</em> at [127]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In this connection, it may also be pertinent to note that under the EA,
                        the only kind of incriminating evidence that has expressly been denied
                        admissibility is admissions and confessions made involuntarily by an accused
                        to a person in authority. …</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Even a confession obtained in consequence of a deception
                        practised on the accused person or when he was drunk is similarly relevant
                        and admissible. Section 29 of the EA provides:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">If such a confession is otherwise relevant, it does not
                            become irrelevant merely because —</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-3">(<em>a</em>)    it was made
                                    under a promise of secrecy, or in consequence of a deception
                                    practised on the accused person for the purpose of obtaining it,
                                    or when he was drunk ...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Relevant evidence obtained in the situations referred to in s 29 may be
                        said to be unfair to the accused. <em>Yet, these kinds of
                            evidence are admissible because of their probative value. This being the
                            overarching principle of the EA</em>, we are of the view that in
                        so far as the High Court in <em>Cheng Swee Tiang</em>
                            [<em>v PP</em> [1964] MLJ 291] recognised a
                        discretion to exclude relevant evidence on the ground of unfairness to the
                        accused, such a proposition is not entirely consonant with the provisions of
                        the EA.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     Plainly, procedural irregularities may be a
                    cause for a finding that a statement’s prejudicial effect outweighs its
                    probative value. As stated in <em>Halsbury’s Laws of
                        Singapore</em> vol 10 (LexisNexis, 2006 Reissue) at
                    para 120.138:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">If the breach of procedure or impropriety casts serious doubts on the
                        accuracy of the accused’s statement that has been recorded, the court
                        may exclude evidence of the statement on the ground that its prejudicial
                        effect outweighs its probative value.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">It cannot be denied that the rules prescribed by the CPC for the
                    recording of statements are in existence to provide a safeguard as to
                    reliability. The same can be said in respect to the Police General Orders that
                    pertain to the recording of statements. As stated in <em>Dahalan</em> by Rajendran J (at [84]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">There is … good reason why the Legislature has in s 121 [of
                        the CPC] spelt out the manner in which statements are to be recorded.
                        Similarly, there is good reason why the Commissioner of Police under powers
                        given to him under s 55 of the Police Force Act issued General Orders
                        specifying in lucid detail the manner in which pocket books are to be kept.
                            <em>The fact that s 122(5) provides that oral
                            statements are admissible in evidence should not be treated as licence
                            for police officers to ignore the [Police General Orders] and the
                            provisions of s 121 and render these safeguards
                            meaningless</em>. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">In our view, Rajendran J was articulating a salutary principle.
                    The Police General Orders, especially, set out basic but essential practices for
                    police officers – including those who are investigating officers. When
                    fully complied with, the Police General Orders thus help ensure that statements
                    are reliably recorded. It follows as a logical conclusion that a serious breach
                    of procedural rules, whether prescribed by the CPC or the Police General Orders,
                    would necessarily render such statements less reliable.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     In our criminal justice system, accused
                    persons are entitled, as a constitutional right, to have access to counsel
                    – but this entitlement does not extend to immediate access (see <em>Jasbir Singh and another v Public</em> Prosecutor [1994]
                    1 SLR(R) 782 at [45]–[49]). Even
                    after the accused engages counsel (assuming he does), there is no legal rule
                    requiring the police to let counsel be present during subsequent interviews with
                    the accused while investigations are being carried out. In fact, an adverse
                    inference may be drawn against the accused under s 123(1) of the CPC for
                    remaining silent at his interview on the ground that he wishes to take legal
                    advice before answering a question (see <em>Yap Giau Beng Terence
                        v Public Prosecutor</em> [1998] 2 SLR(R) 855 at [38]). Plainly, in Singapore, the law provides
                    police officers with great freedom and latitude to exercise their comprehensive
                    and potent powers of interrogation in the course of investigations. This means
                    that the evidential reliability of any written statements taken from accused
                    persons rests greatly on the conscientiousness with which the police
                    investigators who conduct the process of examination and recording observe the
                    prescribed safeguards.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a>58     It also appears to be the case that written
                    statements taken by the police are often given more weight by finders of fact as
                    compared to most other kinds of evidence. This is because formal statements
                    taken by the police have the <em>aura of reliability that comes
                        from their being taken (as would be normally, and correctly, assumed) under
                        a set of strict procedures strictly observed by a trustworthy officer
                        well-trained in investigative techniques</em>. This aura is further
                    enhanced by the admissibility requirement in s 122(5) that the recording
                    police officer must be of the rank of sergeant or above. It is, it may be said,
                    statutorily assumed that such senior police officers are competent and will
                    discharge their obligations conscientiously. All in all, it seems that public
                    policy is in favour of trusting the integrity of the police, and this gives them
                    a certain freedom to conduct their investigations more effectively and
                    efficiently, statement-taking included. However, such an approach comes with
                    certain inherent risks.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a>59     There is always a small but real possibility
                    that an overzealous police officer who believes that a suspect is guilty will
                    decide, perhaps half-consciously, that strict compliance with the procedural
                    requirements for statement-taking may contribute to a factually guilty offender
                    being let off. He may not go so far as to extract an incriminatory statement by
                    threat, inducement or promise, or a statement that is otherwise involuntary. All
                    that is required for a miscarriage of justice to occur is for such a police
                    officer to record the statement with embellishments, adding nothing more than a
                    few carefully-chosen words to the suspect’s own account. If the statement
                    is not read back or signed soon after by the suspect (with proper interpretation
                    where appropriate), there is no assurance that the statement faithfully reflects
                    what he had actually disclosed. Alternatively, a police officer might simply be
                    indolent, leaving the recording of the statement to well after the examination.
                    His memory of the interview having faded, such an officer might fill in the gaps
                    based on his own views about the suspect’s guilt. Such questionable
                    statements could, standing alone, form the basis for wrongful convictions even
                    for capital offences if an accused, disadvantaged by the lapse of time and
                    memory, is unable to convince the court that he did not say what appears in
                    writing to be his words. The salutary requirements of the CPC and the Police
                    General Orders, especially those requiring statements to be promptly reduced to
                    writing, immediately read back to their maker, and corrected if necessary and
                    signed, are the only prescribed safeguards standing in the way of such an
                    unacceptable possibility.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a>60     Police investigators are aware when they
                    record statements that they are likely to be tendered as evidence before a court
                    and that there is therefore an <em>uncompromising need</em>
                    for <em>accuracy</em> and <em>reliability</em>. The objective of the relevant provisions in the CPC
                    and the Police General Orders is to ensure that both these twin objectives are
                    met in every investigation. For this reason, as well as what we have articulated
                    earlier, we think that a court should take a <em>firm</em>
                    approach in considering its exercise of the exclusionary discretion in relation
                    to statements recorded by the police in violation of the relevant requirements
                    of the CPC and the Police General Orders (or other applicable legal
                    requirements). This means that the court should not be slow to exclude
                    statements on the basis that the breach of the relevant provisions in the CPC
                    and the Police General Orders has caused the prejudicial value of the statement
                    to outweigh its probative value.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a>61     If the Prosecution seeks to admit a statement
                    recorded in breach of the relevant provisions in the CPC and/or the Police
                    General Orders, it will bear the burden of establishing that the probative value
                    of the statement outweighs its prejudicial effect. The Prosecution can discharge
                    this burden if, for instance, some reasonable explanation is given for the
                    irregularity such that the court can find that the probative value of the
                    statement exceeds its prejudicial effect.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_62"></a>62     Statements taken in deliberate or reckless
                    non-compliance (or “flagrant” violation, to adopt the words of
                    Rajendran J in <em>Dahalan</em> at [85]) in relation to procedural requirements
                    will generally require more cogent explanation from the Prosecution to discharge
                    its burden, as compared to where the irregularities are merely careless or
                    arising from some pressing operational necessity. This would be because the
                        <em>bona fides</em> of a recording police officer who
                    deliberately breaches the requirements or knowingly disregards them would
                    necessarily be more questionable. Further, such conduct should not be
                    encouraged. The court should be wary of accepting any explanation by way of
                    ignorance of the correct procedures, considering that s 122(5) imposes an
                    admissibility requirement that the recording police officer is to be at least of
                    the rank of sergeant (a rank implying a certain level of responsibility and
                    competence). That having been said, the court should always evaluate probative
                    value and prejudicial effect on the facts of each scenario.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_63"></a>63     Where there is a dispute of fact regarding
                    whether the statement was indeed irregularly recorded, or where the Prosecution
                    wishes to adduce evidence to explain an irregularity, a trial-within-a-trial
                    should be held. This is in accordance with the general principle stated in
                        <em>Beh Chai Hock v Public Prosecutor</em> [1996]
                    3 SLR(R) 112 (“<em>Beh Chai
                    Hock</em>”) by Yong Pung How CJ (at [25]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Counsel did not cite to me any authority directly covering the question of
                        whether it is necessary for a trial judge to hold a <em>voir
                            dire</em> to determine the admissibility of a statement when the
                        only dispute is over the identity of the officer who recorded the statement.
                        In my view, nevertheless, the position is clear. <em>The
                            necessity for a</em> voir dire <em>encompasses
                            situations other than when the voluntariness of a confession is in
                            dispute. As a general rule, it would cover all situations when the
                            admissibility of a confession is challenged</em>. In this case,
                        since the question of the identity of the recorder of the statement was
                        effectively a challenge to its admissibility, the trial judge should have
                        held a <em>voir dire</em> to resolve the question of
                        admissibility. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_64"></a>64     Because an objection to admission of a
                    statement based on procedural irregularity in recording seems similar to an
                    allegation that the statement was partly or wholly fabricated, the following
                    hypothetical scenario described in <em>Seeraj Ajodha v The
                        State</em> [1982] 1 AC 204 (“<em>Ajodha</em>”) at 222 by Lord Bridge of Harwich should be
                    considered briefly:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">On the face of the evidence tendered or proposed to be tendered by the
                        prosecution, there is no material capable of suggesting that the statement
                        was other than voluntary. The defence is an absolute denial of the
                        prosecution evidence. For example, if the prosecution rely upon oral
                        statements, the defence case is simply that the interview never took place
                        or that the incriminating answers were never given; in the case of a written
                        statement, the defence case is that it is a forgery. In this situation no
                        issue as to voluntariness can arise and hence no question of admissibility
                        falls for the judge's decision. The issue of fact whether or not the
                        statement was made by the accused is purely for the jury.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">In our view, where there is evidence of serious procedural
                    irregularity that raises the issue of inadmissibility, a trial-within-a-trial
                    ought to be held if there is a relevant dispute of fact to be resolved. However,
                    where a statement has been seemingly recorded in accordance with procedure and
                    the allegation is simply that part or all of it was fabricated without the
                    maker’s knowledge, Lord Bridge’s views should apply and no
                    trial-within-a-trial need be held. Courts should be careful to distinguish
                    between these two situations with the assistance of counsel.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_65"></a>65     For completeness, we would caution defence
                    counsel against burdening the court with unmeritorious technical defences. Only
                    serious irregularities, meaning those that materially affect the evidential
                    value of a voluntary statement, will suffice to cause the court to exercise the
                    exclusionary discretion. Examples of irregularities that would not suffice can
                    be drawn from the following cases:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_65-p2_a"></a>(a)     In <em>Sathiadew
                            (CCA)</em>, the statement of one of the appellants had been read
                        back to him by the recording officer but the recording officer had failed to
                        obtain his signature. That being the only omission, the Court of Criminal
                        Appeal held that the trial court was entitled to admit the statement. We
                        observe that the finding, essentially, was that the irregularity did not
                        greatly impact the probative value of the statement on the
                    facts.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_65-p2_b"></a>(b)     In <em>Tsang Yuk Chung</em>, the question raised was whether a
                        statement would be inadmissible due only to a failure on the part of the
                        recording police officer to give a notice to the maker in the form stated in
                        s 122(6) of the CPC. The Court of Criminal Appeal held that the trial
                        court was entitled to admit the statement, as, <em>inter
                            alia</em>, the admission of the statement was favourable to the
                        appellant’s case or, at least, did no damage to it. We observe that
                        this meant that the prejudicial effect of the statement was
                    low.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_65-p2_c"></a>(c)     In <em>Mazlan</em>, there was a failure to inform the maker of a
                        statement of his right against self-incrimination under s 121(2) of the
                        CPC. It was indicated by this court that such an irregularity, without more,
                        was in fact irrelevant to both the admissibility and the evidential value of
                        the statement.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_65-p2_d"></a>(d)     In <em>Foong Seow Ngui and others v Public
                            Prosecutor</em> [1995] 3 SLR(R) 254 (“<em>Foong Seow Ngui</em>”), one objection raised was
                        that the recording officer failed to indicate at the end of the statement
                        that the statement had been read over to the accused and that the accused
                        had been offered the opportunity to make corrections. In this regard, this
                        court stated (at [44]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">We are unable to agree [with the objection]. In our view, what is
                            important is not whether that clause was included at the end of the
                            statement, but whether the statement was read over to the maker and,
                            after correction, if any, signed by him. This is a requirement stated in
                            s 121(3) of the CPC. The mere absence of such a clause does not make the
                            statement inadmissible <em>if the requirements of that
                                subsection have been fulfilled</em>. In the present case, the
                            learned trial judge had directed his mind to this question and had
                            adequately dealt with it. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_66"></a>66     In support of the decisions in <em>Tsang Yuk Chung</em> and <em>Mazlan</em>, we would further add that a failure to be cautioned under
                    s 122(6) of the CPC or to be informed of rights under s 121(2) of the
                    CPC may affect <em>what a person chooses to say</em> in his
                    statement, but it does not affect the accuracy or reliability or voluntariness
                    of <em>what he actually says</em>. Such failures therefore
                    should not, of themselves, form grounds for exclusion of a statement under the
                    exercise of the exclusionary discretion. In relation to the decision in
                        <em>Foong Seow Ngui</em>, we would add that, strictly
                    speaking, the inclusion of a clause in a statement that the requirements of
                    s 121(3) of the CPC have been fulfilled is helpful but not essential under
                    that provision. Even if the omission of such a clause is in fact an
                    irregularity, if the substantive requirements of s 121(3) have been
                    complied with, as it was in that case, the probative value of the statement
                    would not be affected by such an omission.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_67"></a>67     It remains for us to clarify that even if a
                    trial court has wrongly exercised (or omitted to exercise) the exclusionary
                    discretion, an appellate court will not alter the decision of the trial court
                    unless the improper exercise of the exclusionary discretion occasions a
                    miscarriage of justice (see s 169 of the EA and s 396(<em>c</em>) of the CPC (now s 423(<em>c</em>) of the CPC 2010)). The decision of this court in <em>Fung Yuk Shing</em> should be considered in this regard. The
                    recording police officer in that case had taken down the appellant’s
                    statement on a piece of paper but did not show the paper to him or allow him to
                    sign it. The next day, the officer transcribed the contents into his pocket
                    book. The pocket book was produced and admitted at the trial but not the
                    original piece of paper. This court stated that the admission of the pocket book
                    entries did not “occasion the appellant such prejudice as to deprive him
                    of a fair trial” (at [14]). The
                    failure to produce the original paper had not prejudiced the appellant as the
                    officer was made available for cross-examination and the trial judge had found
                    his account of the interrogation to be credible. Furthermore, the trial judge
                    did not ultimately rely on the contents of the pocket book as evidence against
                    the appellant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_68"></a>68     Before moving on to the next preliminary legal
                    issue to be considered, we emphasise that the court should be careful to avoid
                    basing the exercise of the exclusionary discretion primarily on a desire to
                    discipline the wrongful behaviour of police officers (or officers of other
                    enforcement agencies) or the Prosecution. The importance of distinguishing an
                    evidential discretion from a disciplinary function was highlighted by the courts
                    in <em>Sang</em> at 436 and <em>Mazlan</em> at [23] (see also
                        <em>Evidence and the Litigation Process</em> at
                    paras 5.38, 10.07 and 10.11). In the light of <em>Rayney
                        Wong</em> and <em>Phyllis Tan</em> (see <a href="#p1_52">[52]</a> and <a href="#p1_55">[55]</a>
                    above respectively), courts also should refrain from excluding evidence based
                    only on facts indicating unfairness in the way the evidence was obtained (as
                    opposed to unfairness in the sense of contributing to a wrong outcome at trial).
                    That being said, a vigilant emphasis on the procedural requirements in the
                    recording of statements can have a positive effect on the quality of such
                    evidence generally. By making it clear that non-compliance with the required
                    procedures could actually weaken the Prosecution’s case against an accused
                    person, we hope to remove the incentive for such non-compliance on the part of
                    police officers. This will help ensure that all evidence in the form of written
                    statements coming before the court will be as reliable as
                possible.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Treatment of subsequent statements with similar content to an
                excluded statement </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_69"></a>69     Given the principles laid down above, the
                    question arises as to whether statements recorded subsequent to an excluded
                    statement can be admitted and/or given weight, especially if they contain
                    similar content. Such statements will be referred to as “subsequent
                    statements” (or “subsequent statement”) for convenience
                    where appropriate.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_70"></a>70     Section 28 of the EA, which was repealed
                    and replaced by a similar provision in the CPC 2010, <em>viz</em>, s 258(4), previously provided for the admissibility of
                    confessions that would be otherwise inadmissible due to what could be regarded
                    as an inducement, threat or promise. Section 28 of the EA stated:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">If a confession referred to in section 24 is made after the
                        impression caused by any such inducement, threat or promise has, in the
                        opinion of the court, been fully removed, it is relevant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">To our knowledge, the only case that has applied this section would be
                        <em>Public Prosecutor v Somporn Chinphakdee</em> [1994]
                    SGHC 209. One application of this section would be where a person makes two
                    similar confessions in two statements, the first of which is caused by
                    inducement, threat or promise but the second of which is made after the
                    inducement, threat or promise is fully removed. In such cases, although the
                    subsequent statement would be admissible, the fact that it is similar to an
                    earlier statement should lead the court to be especially vigilant in inquiring
                    whether the effect of the inducement, threat or promise was really
                    removed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_71"></a>71     In the context of voluntary statements being
                    excluded due to their prejudicial effect being greater than their probative
                    value as a result of serious procedural irregularity, different considerations
                    should apply. For a subsequent statement that follows an <em>involuntary</em> statement, the question before the court is whether
                    the subsequent statement is untainted by involuntariness. For a subsequent
                    statement that follows a <em>voluntary</em> but <em>irregularly recorded</em> statement, the real concern is
                    whether what the maker said in the subsequent statement was accurately
                    represented in writing. If all the applicable procedural requirements are fully
                    complied with and the subsequent statement is voluntary, admission should
                    generally be allowed. However, where the subsequent statement contains similar
                    content to a previous excluded statement, caution ought to be exercised. It may,
                    for instance, be necessary for the court to satisfy itself that the fear of
                    being inconsistent with the previous statement did not act as an inducement on
                    the maker such as to render the subsequent statement involuntary.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_72"></a>72     Police work, of course, has to be acknowledged
                    as being often unpleasant, stressful, complex and not infrequently punctuated by
                    unpredictable developments. An accused person’s statement may
                    inadvertently turn out to have been affected by serious irregularities in
                    recording. Once this is discovered, a conscientious investigating officer need
                    not call off the investigation. He may proceed to have a subsequent statement
                    taken from the accused as long as he ensures that it is voluntary, and this will
                    be admissible. In addition, he may proceed to find other material or witness
                    evidence relevant to the case based on what was revealed by the accused person
                    in the first statement. Under s 27 of the EA (which was repealed and
                    replaced by a similar provision in the CPC 2010, <em>viz</em>, s 258(6)(<em>c</em>)), any fact
                    discovered in consequence of information obtained through a statement may be
                    proved, even if the statement in question may be inadmissible of itself (see the
                    application of this section in <em>Public Prosecutor v Chin Moi
                        Moi</em> [1994] 3 SLR(R) 924).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Testing the veracity of a disputed statement admitted into
                evidence</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_73"></a>73     The issue of when and how a court should test
                    the veracity of a statement that has been admitted into evidence but whose
                    contents are disputed must also be briefly considered. Just like any other form
                    of evidence, the truth of an admitted statement’s contents (and therefore
                    the weight to be given to that statement) is to be evaluated on an ongoing basis
                    throughout the trial. This should be done regardless of whether its truth is
                    disputed by its maker, but especially if it is so disputed. The court and
                    counsel should be bear in mind that even if a statement has, standing alone,
                    more probative value than prejudicial effect (and is therefore admitted), this
                    does not mean that its contents should, as a matter of course, be given some or
                    any weight after being assessed alongside all the other evidence in the case.
                    The standard tools available to the court can all be used for this assessment,
                    including examination of internal consistency, corroborating evidence,
                    contradictory evidence, evaluation of the credibility of the witnesses, and so
                    on and so forth.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_74"></a>74     Confessions admitted into evidence that are
                    partly or wholly retracted by the maker should be the subject of special care.
                    This, as well as other general principles concerning retracted statements, was
                    enunciated in <em>Jagatheesan s/o Krishnasamy v Public
                        Prosecutor</em> [2006] 4 SLR(R) 45 (“<em>Jagatheesan</em>”), in the following passage (at
                        [84]–[87]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">84    The retraction of his own statement by a witness
                            may or may not be treated with circumspection by the court depending on
                            the circumstances. For instance, it is settled law that an accused can
                            be convicted solely upon his own confession even though that statement
                            is subsequently retracted: <em>Lim Thian Lai v
                                PP</em> [2006] 1 SLR(R) 319 (“<em>Lim Thian Lai</em>”) at [43]. It has also been
                            held by the Court of Appeal that a retracted confession of a co-accused
                            implicating the accused in the offence may also be relied upon to
                            establish the accused's guilt: <em>Panya Martmontree v
                                PP</em> [1995] 2 SLR(R) 806 (“<em>Panya Martmontree</em>”) at [50]. By parity of
                            reasoning, the fact that a witness (in this case, an accomplice) may
                            have retracted his statement inculpating the accused does not, <em>ipso facto</em>, render the statement of little
                            evidential weight.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">85    
              <em>However</em>, both
                                <em>Lim Thian Lai</em> and <em>Panya Martmontree</em> have cautioned that the evidential
                            weight to be assigned to the retracted statement should be assiduously
                            and scrupulously assessed by the courts. In particular, I would add, if
                            the retracted statement forms the only evidence upon which the
                            Prosecution's case rests, such statements should attract painstaking if
                            not relentless scrutiny. Therefore, in <em>Lim Thian
                                Lai</em> ([84] <em>supra</em>) at [43],
                            it was held that it was necessary for the court to be satisfied that the
                            retracted confession is voluntary, <em>true</em>
                            and reliable. In fact, the court in <em>Lim Thian
                                Lai</em> cited <em>Taw Cheng Kong v
                                PP</em> [1998] 1 SLR(R) 78 as an example of where it
                            was correct for the court to have accorded precious little weight to the
                            accused’s statements because of how he had changed his story
                            repeatedly.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">86    I pause here only to emphasise that the
                            requirements of the proviso to the general principle that a retracted
                            statement may still be relied upon as being true, <em>viz</em>, that the statement should <em>be
                                voluntary and objectively reliable</em> should be required
                            conjunctively. Therefore, it is not sufficient for the Prosecution
                            merely to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the statement was made
                            voluntarily. A statement by a witness (or even an accused) even if it
                            was given voluntarily may or may not be reliable depending on the
                            circumstances of the case and the cogency of the statement itself and
                            may to that extent, be dubious.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">87    In my view, it is neither productive nor meaningful
                            to treat retracted statements as a separate class of evidence attracting
                            its own peculiar rules of analysis. Rather, I prefer to regard retracted
                            statements as an instance of inconsistency in the witness’s
                            testimony. In other words, the fact that a witness admits to a statement
                            and later withdraws it constitutes, both, in principle and in effect, a
                            discrepancy or inconsistency in his evidence. Accordingly, the weight to
                            be assigned to such statements and the assessment of the witness’s
                            credibility falls to be determined by the general <em>corpus</em> of case law relating to inconsistencies,
                            discrepancies and falsehoods in a witness’s statement. In other
                            words, whether the fact that a witness has retracted his statement
                            should be allowed to cast about the credibility of that witness and the
                            veracity of his statement depends on whether a <em>reasonable and reliable</em> explanation can be furnished for
                            the retraction; see, in this regard, the Court of Appeal decision in
                                <em>Syed Abdul Mutalip bin Syed Sidek v PP</em>
                            [2002] 1 SLR(R) 1166 at [22] where it was held, in the context
                            of an accused retracting his confession, that “While the court
                            should consider any explanation that the accused person gives for his
                            change of position, the explanation can be rejected if it is found to be
                            untrue.” I would respectfully add that if the explanation for the
                            retraction is unsatisfactory then this may cast doubt on the entire
                            evidence of that witness.</p>

                    intends to rely on would, in practice, be disclosed to the defence as part of

                    Subordinate Courts, a “criminal case disclosure conference” (or
                    “CCDC” for short) will be held, with the Prosecution having to

                    CPC 2010 regimes, there is no statutory requirement for the Prosecution to
                    disclose any kind of <em>unused material</em>. For
                    instance, statements made by an accused which the Prosecution does not intend to
                    rely on at trial need not be disclosed. Potential exhibits, including the
                    results of forensic tests, need not be disclosed if they are not intended to be
                    tendered as evidence. The existence and identity of persons who may have
                    information about the case but who will not be called as Prosecution witnesses
                    need not be disclosed. More importantly, the written statements of potential
                    material witnesses that the Prosecution does not wish to rely on need not be
                    disclosed, even where those statements would otherwise be admissible in evidence

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_81"></a>81     The issue of disclosure of unused material was
                    considered by the High Court in <em>Selvarajan James v Public
                        Prosecutor</em> [2000] 2 SLR(R) 946 (“<em>Selvarajan James</em>”). This was an appeal against a
                    decision of a district judge who had convicted the appellant of abetting an
                    offence of theft by a servant under s 381 read with s 109 of the Penal
                    Code. The appellant’s accomplice had given three statements to the police,
                    of which two were adduced at trial by the Prosecution as evidence against the
                    appellant. The appellant was not aware of the existence of the third statement,
                    which was apparently exculpatory, at the trial. The appellant filed an appeal
                    and also took out a criminal motion for an order to compel the Prosecution to
                    produce the third statement. In dismissing the motion, Yong CJ stated the
                    following (at [18]–[19]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">18    The procedure for criminal discovery in Singapore
                            is governed by the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68) (the
                            “CPC”). The CPC does not impose on the Prosecution an
                            onerous duty of disclosure. This differs from the requirements in civil
                            cases where extensive rules of discovery are provided for in the Rules
                            of Court. For criminal cases, there is no requirement in the CPC for the
                            Prosecution to disclose witnesses’ statements to the Defence.
                                <em>In this case, the Prosecution did not intend to
                                rely on the third statement given by Kanan and was not compelled by
                                law to disclose or produce the statement to the
                            Defence</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">19    The present duty of disclosure on the part of the
                            Prosecution in criminal cases, as provided for in the CPC, is minimal.
                            This position is not necessarily the most ideal and it has been argued
                            on numerous occasions that more disclosure and early disclosure on the
                            part of the Prosecution are desirable to ensure that the accused knows
                            the case that has to be met and as such would get a fairer trial.
                                <em>However, it is not for this court to impose such
                                requirements on the Prosecution</em>. It is for Parliament to
                            decide if it wants to enact these revisions when it updates the CPC and,
                            until then, <em>the court cannot direct the
                                Prosecution</em> to produce witnesses’ statements to the
                            Defence.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_82"></a>82     This holding in <em>Selvarajan
                        James</em> was framed in absolute terms and based entirely on
                    statutory grounds – in particular, the absence of a provision in the CPC
                    requiring prosecutorial disclosure of unused material. If this reasoning is
                    valid, it applies with equal force to the new regime under the CPC 2010, which
                    also does not mention unused material. However, in <em>Selvarajan
                        James</em>, the authorities and principles relating to the common law
                    on prosecutorial disclosure, which had by that time been well-developed in
                    England and adopted in other mature common law jurisdictions, were not
                    considered. Such principles could have been relevant under s 5 of the CPC
                    (as elaborated on at <a href="#p1_105">[105]</a> and <a href="#p1_107">[107]</a> below), although they may not have made a
                    difference to the outcome. For this and other reasons explained below (see
                        <a href="#p1_101">[101]</a>–<a href="#p1_112">[112]</a> below), we believe that <em>Selvarajan
                        James</em> should not be followed on this point. That having been
                    said, we will explore the common law principles on prosecutorial disclosure in
                    other jurisdictions before setting out what we believe is the position in
                    Singapore.</p>

                other jurisdictions</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">England</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_83"></a>83     Since the passage of the Criminal Procedure
                    and Investigations Act 1996 (c 25) (UK) (“the CPIA 1996”),
                    the scheme of prosecutorial disclosure in England has been largely governed by
                    statute. However, English jurisprudence had been developing in this area even
                    before the enactment of the CPIA 1996. The House of Lords in <em>Regina v Brown (Winston)</em> [1998] 1 AC 367 (“<em>Brown</em>”) gave an outline of the English common law
                    on prosecutorial disclosure, including a summary of key decisions. The common
                    law rules were applicable in that case as the defendant was convicted before the
                    CPIA 1996 disclosure regime came into operation. The leading judgment was
                    delivered by Lord Hope of Craighead, who stated (at 374–376):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-Heading1">
<em>The common law duty of
                            disclosure</em>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The rules of disclosure which have been developed by the common law owe
                        their origin to the elementary right of every defendant to a fair trial. If
                        a defendant is to have a fair trial he must have adequate notice of the case
                        which is to be made against him. Fairness also requires that the rules of
                        natural justice must be observed. In this context, as Lord Taylor of
                        Gosforth C.J. observed in <em>Reg. v. Keane</em>
                        [1994] 1 W.L.R. 746, 750G, the great principle is that of open justice.
                        It would be contrary to that principle for the prosecution to withhold from
                        the defendant material which might undermine their case against him or which
                        might assist his defence. <em>These are the rules upon which
                            sections 3 and 7 of the [CPIA] 1996 have been based. But they had
                            already found their expression in decisions by the courts</em>. It
                        is necessary to mention only a few of them in order to identify the extent
                        of the duty of disclosure, and to trace its development, as background to
                        the issue which arises in this case.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In <em>Dallison v. Caffery</em> [1965]
                        1 Q.B. 348, 369 Lord Denning M.R. described the duty of the
                        prosecution in these terms:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">“<em>The duty of a prosecuting counsel or
                                solicitor, as I have always understood it, is this: if he knows of a
                                credible witness who can speak to material facts which tend to show
                                the prisoner to be innocent, he must either call that witness
                                himself or make his statement available to the defence. It would be
                                highly reprehensible to conceal from the court the evidence which
                                such a witness can give</em>. If the prosecuting counsel or
                            solicitor knows, not of a credible witness, but a witness whom he does
                            not accept as credible, he should tell the defence about him so that
                            they can call him if they wish. Here the solicitor, immediately after
                            the court proceedings [for committal before the magistrates], gave the
                            solicitor for the defence the statement of Mr. and Mrs. Stamp; and
                            thereby he did his duty.”</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In the same case, at p. 375G, adopting the words of Lord
                        Goddard C.J. in <em>Rex v. Bryant and Dickson</em>
                        (1946) 31 Cr.App.R. 146, Diplock L.J. observed that the
                        proposition that it is the duty of the prosecution to place before the court
                        all the evidence known to him, whether or not it is probative of the guilt
                        of the accused person, was erroneous. It is clear, then, that in his view
                        the principle of open justice did not extend that far. As he put it, at
                        pp. 375-376:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">“A prosecutor is under no such duty. His duty is to prosecute,
                            not to defend. If he happens to have information from a credible witness
                            which is inconsistent with the guilt of the accused, or, although not
                            inconsistent with his guilt, is helpful to the accused, the prosecutor
                            should make such witness available to the defence.”</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I do not need, for the purposes of this case, to examine these dicta,
                        which are not wholly consistent with each other, in greater detail. …
                        The plaintiff, whose action was for damages for false imprisonment and
                        malicious prosecution, had put forward a defence of alibi. The statement
                        which the police had obtained from Mr. and Mrs. Stamp supported his alibi.
                        This was information in the hands of the prosecutor which might have
                        assisted the defence case on an issue of fact which was relevant to the
                        plaintiff's guilt or innocence.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In <em>Reg. v. Ward (Judith)</em> [1993]
                        1 W.L.R. 619, 645, the court adopted the words of Lawton L.J. in
                            <em>Reg</em>. v. <em>Hennessey
                            (Timothy)</em> (1978) 68 Cr.App.R. 419, 426, where he
                        said:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">“those who prepare and conduct prosecutions <em>owe a duty to the courts</em> to ensure that all relevant
                            evidence of help to an accused is either led by them or made available
                            to the defence.”</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The court went on to observe:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">“We would emphasise that ‘all relevant evidence of help
                            to the accused’ is not limited to evidence which will obviously
                            advance the accused's case. It is of help to the accused to have the
                            opportunity of considering all the material evidence which the
                            prosecution have gathered, and from which the prosecution have made
                            their own selection of evidence to be led.”</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The effect of that decision was to widen the scope of the
                        duty. But the instances of non-disclosure with which it was concerned
                        related mainly to scientific evidence which had been obtained during the
                        process of investigation. … The court explained the rules of
                        disclosure which were relevant to the case in this way, at
                        p. 674:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">“An incident of a defendant's right to a fair trial is a right
                            to timely disclosure by the prosecution of all material matters which
                            affect the scientific case relied on by the prosecution, that is,
                            whether such matters strengthen or weaken the prosecution case or assist
                            the defence case. This duty exists whether or not a specific request for
                            disclosure of details of scientific evidence is made by the
                            defence.”</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In <em>Reg. v. Keane</em> [1994]
                        1 W.L.R. 746 the court was concerned with the problems which arise when
                        a trial judge is invited by the defence to order disclosure of documents and
                        is invited by the Crown in the public interest to refuse such disclosure.
                        After noting that the court must then conduct a balancing exercise,
                        Lord Taylor of Gosforth C.J. said, at
                        pp. 751–752:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">“<em>If the disputed material may prove the
                                defendant's innocence or avoid a miscarriage of justice, then the
                                balance comes down resoundingly in favour of disclosing
                                it</em>. But how is it to be determined whether and to what
                            extent the material which the Crown wish to [<em>sic</em>] withhold may be of assistance to the defence?
                            First, it is for the prosecution to put before the court only those
                            documents which it regards as material but wishes to withhold. As to
                            what documents are “material[”] we would adopt the test
                            suggested by Jowitt J. in <em>Reg</em>. v.

                            1993. The judge said: ‘I would judge to be material in the realm
                            of disclosure that which can be seen on a sensible appraisal by the
                            prosecution: (1) to be relevant or possibly relevant to an issue in
                            the case; (2) to raise or possibly raise a new issue whose
                            existence is not apparent from the evidence the prosecution proposes to
                            use; (3) to hold out a real (as opposed to fanciful) prospect of
                            providing a lead on evidence which goes to (l) or (2).’

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_84"></a>84     Lord Hope proceeded to endorse the view
                    of Steyn LJ expressed in the Court of Appeal’s decision in <em>Brown</em> (see <em>Regina v Brown
                        (Winston)</em> [1994] 1 WLR 1599 at 1606–1607) and the
                    Court of Appeal’s stance in <em>Regina v Ward</em>
                    [1993] 1 WLR 619 (“<em>Ward</em>”, at
                    645) that the phrases “an issue in the case” and “all
                    relevant evidence of help to the accused” must be given a broad
                    interpretation, as illustrated by the obligation on the Prosecution to disclose
                    any (a) previous statements, (b) requests for a reward, and
                    (c) previous convictions of a Prosecution witness. Lord Hope concluded
                    his overview with the following statement of general principles (at 377):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[T]he common law rules are concerned essentially with the disclosure of
                        material which has been gathered by the police and the prosecution in the
                        course of the investigation process for use in the case to be made for the
                        Crown. In the course of that process issues of fact will have been
                        identified which may assist or undermine the Crown case. <em>The prosecution is not obliged to lead evidence which may undermine the
                            Crown case, but fairness requires that material in its possession which
                            may undermine the Crown case is disclosed to the defence</em>. The
                        investigation process will also require an inquiry into material which may
                        affect the credibility of potential Crown witnesses. <em>Here
                            again, the prosecution is not obliged to lead the evidence of witnesses
                            who are likely in its opinion to be regarded by the judge or jury as
                            incredible or unreliable. Yet fairness requires that material in its
                            possession which may cast doubt on the credibility or reliability of
                            those witnesses whom it chooses to lead must be disclosed</em>.
                        The question [of] whether one or more of the Crown witnesses is credible or
                        reliable is frequently one of the most important “issues” in
                        the case, although the material which bears upon it may be ... collateral.

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_85"></a>85     From <em>Brown</em> and
                    other key English cases we may list the main English common law principles on
                    the Prosecution’s duty of disclosure as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_85-p2_a"></a>(a)     Prosecutors owe a duty to the courts
                        to ensure that all relevant evidence of help to an accused is either led by
                        them or made available to the Defence (see <em>Brown</em> at 375 and <em>Ward</em> at
                        645).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_85-p2_b"></a>(b)     The
                        obligation of disclosure extends beyond material which could be admissible
                        in evidence, as inadmissible information may lead by a train of inquiry to
                        evidence which is admissible. The test is materiality, not admissibility
                        (see <em>Regina v Preston (Stephen)</em> [1994]
                        2 AC 130 at 163–164).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_85-p2_c"></a>(c)     The test of materiality would require disclosure of
                        whatever can be seen on a sensible appraisal by the Prosecution to be (see
                            <em>Regina v Keane</em> [1994] 1 WLR 746
                            (“<em>Keane</em>”) at 752):</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_85-p2_c-p3_i"></a>(i)       relevant or possibly
                            relevant to an issue in the case;</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_85-p2_c-p3_ii"></a>(ii)       to raise or possibly raise a new issue whose
                            existence is not apparent from the evidence that the Prosecution
                            proposes to use; or</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_85-p2_c-p3_iii"></a>(iii)       to hold a real (as opposed to a fanciful)
                            prospect of providing a lead on evidence which goes to (i) or
                            (ii).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_85-p2_d"></a>(d)     The court may permit the non-disclosure of material if an exception
                        (such as public interest immunity) is found to apply. However, where the
                        material may prove the defendant’s innocence or avoid a miscarriage of
                        justice, the balancing exercise comes down resoundingly in favour of
                        disclosure (see <em>Brown</em> at 376 and <em>Keane</em> at 751–752).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_85-p2_e"></a>(e)     Fairness requires that the Prosecution
                        discloses material in its possession which may cast doubt on the credibility
                        or reliability of its witnesses (see <em>Brown</em> at
                        377). Material relevant to that issue of credibility embraces
                        “collateral” material (see <em>Brown</em>
                        at 376–378).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_85-p2_f"></a>(f)     The obligation on the Prosecution to consider making disclosure
                        begins at the moment of arrest, albeit with practical limitations. Although
                        this will be rare, material to be disclosed at this stage may include (see
                            <em>Regina v Director of Public Prosecutions, Ex parte
                            Lee</em> [1999] 1 WLR 1950 (“<em>Lee</em>”) at 1962):</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_85-p2_f-p3_i"></a>(i)       information about a
                            complainant’s or deceased’s previous convictions which may
                            reasonably be expected to assist the accused in applying for
                            bail;</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_85-p2_f-p3_ii"></a>(ii)       material which might enable the accused to make an application to
                            stay proceedings as an abuse of process;</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_85-p2_f-p3_iii"></a>(iii)       material which would enable the
                            accused to make a submission against committal or for committal on a
                            lesser charge; and</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_85-p2_f-p3_iv"></a>(iv)       material which will enable the accused to make
                            preparations for trial which may be significantly less effective if
                            disclosure is delayed (<em>eg</em>, names of
                            eye-witnesses whom the Prosecution do not intend to
                    use).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_85-p2_g"></a>(g)     The
                        disclosure obligation is a continuing one, subsisting for as long as the
                        proceedings remain at first instance or on appeal (see <em>R
                            v Stephen Christopher Makin</em> [2004] EWCA Crim 1607 at
                            [36]).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_85-p2_h"></a>(h)     A breach of the disclosure obligation
                        may:</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_85-p2_h-p3_i"></a>(i)       justify an order made by
                            the trial court to disclose the material (see <em>Brown</em> at 376 and <em>Lee</em> at
                            1957);</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_85-p2_h-p3_ii"></a>(ii)       in rare cases, justify a court other than the trial court
                            reviewing the Prosecution’s decision and compelling disclosure
                            (see <em>Lee</em> at 1957 and 1963);
                        or</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_85-p2_h-p3_iii"></a>(iii)       cause a conviction to be overturned on appeal if the breach had led to
                            a miscarriage of justice at trial (see <em>Ward</em> at 641–642).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_85-p2_i"></a>(i)     Once the Prosecution’s duty of
                        disclosure is satisfied, it is not its duty to conduct the case for the
                        Defence. Once the duty has been satisfied, the investigation and preparation
                        of the Defence’s case is a matter for the Defence. That includes the
                        tracing, interviewing and assessment of possible witnesses (see <em>Brown</em> at 379–380).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_86"></a>86     As can be seen, the pre-CPIA 1996 approach
                    developed by case law had many intricacies, complexities and difficulties,
                    including a potential burden on the Prosecution to disclose masses of material
                    of only speculative relevance. It was partly in response to these practical
                    problems that the report of the Royal Commission on Criminal Justice (United
                    Kingdom, Royal Commission on Criminal Justice, <em>Report</em> (Cmnd 2263, 1993) (Chairman: Viscount Runciman of
                    Doxford)) recommended that a new regime of disclosure be created, which
                    eventually resulted in the enactment of the CPIA 1996 (see, also, <em>Lee</em> at 1956–1957). Knowing this history, it would
                    be imprudent for us to lightly import the full scope of the English common law
                    rules. Much of it (<em>eg</em>, disclosure from the point
                    of arrest) would also be incompatible with the CPC and the CPC 2010.
                    However, we have nevertheless laid out the English position because the
                        <em>rationale</em> and <em>general
                        principles</em> therein remain highly instructive in so far as they
                    relate to our courts’ fundamental purpose in criminal trials. This purpose
                    is <em>to secure the conviction and punishment of the guilty and
                        the acquittal and vindication of the innocent</em> – in short,

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_87"></a>87     The English common law disclosure regime is
                    consistent with the position prevailing in all the other common law
                    jurisdictions that we have surveyed. As Kirby J observed in his judgment in the
                    High Court of Australia’s decision in <em>Mallard v The
                        Queen</em> (2005) 224 CLR 125 (“<em>Mallard</em>”) at [76], “[t]he English authorities have been influential
                    throughout Commonwealth countries”. In his judgment, Kirby J
                    summarised his conclusions from his survey of other jurisdictions as follows (at
                        [81]–[82]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">81    ... The foregoing review of the approach of courts,
                            in national and international jurisdiction, indicates the growth of the
                            insistence of the law, <em>particularly in countries
                                observing the accusatorial form of criminal trial</em>
                                ...<em>, of the requirement that the prosecution may
                                not suppress evidence in its possession, or available to it,
                                material to the contested issues in the trial. It must ordinarily
                                provide such evidence to the defence. Especially is this so where
                                the material evidence may cast a significant light on the
                                credibility or reliability of material prosecution witnesses or the
                                acceptability and truthfulness of exculpatory evidence by or for the
                                accused</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">82    According to the principles expressed (as in
                                <em>Apostilides</em> [(1984) 154 CLR
                            563]), this Court will not second guess the prosecutor in the decisions
                            that have to be made in presenting the prosecution case. Still less is
                            the prosecutor burdened with an obligation to present the defence case
                            (which, in any event, may not always be known in advance of the trial).
                                <em>The obligation imposed by the law is to ensure a
                                fair trial for the accused, remembering the special requirements
                                that descend upon a prosecutor, who represents not an ordinary party
                                but the organised community committed to the fair trial of criminal
                                accusations and the avoidance of miscarriages of

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Kirby J concluded (at [83]–[84]) that
                    where the Prosecution fails to disclose or suppresses material evidence, thereby
                    creating a risk of miscarriage of justice (for instance where the non-disclosure
                    may have seriously undermined the effective presentation of the Defence’s
                    case), a conviction will be set aside on appeal unless the non-disclosure is
                    found to be unlikely to have altered the outcome of the trial. The joint reasons
                    given by the other judges of the court referred to a similar common law
                    principle at [17], although not with the
                    same level of detail.</p>

                        [155]). The following penetrating
                    statements, in our view, are especially helpful (at [142] and [152]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">142    Although breach of the prosecutor's duty of
                            disclosure may result in the setting aside of a conviction, the law
                            relating to the duty of disclosure was not developed in tandem with the
                            principles governing the grounds on which a conviction will be set
                            aside. The two areas of law intersect, however, when non-disclosure by
                            the prosecutor results in an unsafe or unsatisfactory conviction, a
                            material irregularity or miscarriage of justice. Non-disclosure to the
                            defence of relevant material, even if not attributable to any breach by
                            the prosecutor of his duty to disclose, can result in material
                            irregularity and an unsafe conviction, as it did in <b><em>R v Maguire</em></b> [1992] QB 936 and <b><em>R v
                                Ward</em></b> [1993] 1 WLR 619, where forensic scientists
                            called by the prosecution failed to disclose to the prosecution
                            information which tended to weaken their expert evidence. An
                            understanding that these two areas of law do not necessarily co-extend
                            and correspond is essential to an appreciation of the

<p class="Judg-Heading-4">Canada</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_90"></a>90     The Supreme Court of Canada’s decision
                    in <em>William B Stinchcombe v Her Majesty The Queen</em>
                    [1991] 3 SCR 326 (“<em>Stinchcombe</em>”), should be considered next. Sopinka J, who
                    delivered the court’s judgment, held that the Prosecution had an extensive
                    duty to disclose to the Defence “all material evidence whether favourable
                    to the accused or not” (at 338–339), and that this would be a
                    continuing obligation and should first occur before the accused is called upon
                    to elect the mode of trial or to plead (at 342–343). Although the court
                    reached its decision partly with reference to the right of the accused to
                    “make full answer and defence” to a criminal charge under s 7
                    of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms (at 336), there are general
                    statements about the duty of the Prosecution in Sopinka J’s judgment
                    that strike us as being of wider application. The following passage, in
                    particular, should be highlighted (at 333):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It is difficult to justify the position which clings to the
                        notion that the Crown has no legal duty to disclose all relevant
                        information. The arguments against the existence of such a duty are
                        groundless while those in favour, are, in my view, overwhelming. … In
                            <em>Boucher v. The Queen</em>, [1955] S.C.R. 16,
                        Rand J. states, at pp. 23-24:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">It cannot be over-emphasized that <em>the purpose of a
                                criminal prosecution is not to obtain a conviction, it is to lay
                                before a jury what the Crown considers to be credible evidence
                                relevant to what is alleged to be a crime</em>. Counsel
                            have a duty to see that all available legal proof of the facts is
                            presented: it should be done firmly and pressed to its legitimate
                            strength but it must also be done fairly. <em>The role of
                                prosecutor excludes any notion of winning or losing; his function is
                                a matter of public duty than which in civil life there can be none
                                charged with greater personal responsibility</em>. It is
                            to be efficiently performed with an ingrained sense of the dignity, the
                            seriousness and the justness of judicial proceedings.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I would add that <em>the fruits of the investigation which
                            are in the possession of counsel for the Crown are not the property of
                            the Crown for use in securing a conviction but the property of the
                            public to be used to ensure that justice is done</em>.</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_91"></a>91     Turning to jurisdictions with legislation
                    similar to our CPC, the current position in India is represented by <em>Sheshrao and others v The State</em> 2001 Cri LJ 3805
                        (“<em>Sheshrao</em>”), a decision of the
                    Karnataka High Court on appeal from the decision of a sessions judge to convict
                    the appellants of murder. In that case, H N Narayan J, who
                    delivered the judgment of the court, noted (at [22]) that “[o]n careful perusal of the prosecution
                    papers, we find that there is an attempt to suppress some material facts from
                    the purview of the Court.” Although the court did not refer to the
                    English cases, it cited decisions (at [24]–[25]) of the
                    Supreme Court of India for the propositions:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_91-p2_a"></a>(a)     that a prosecutor “is
                        … an officer of the Court … and the Court is entitled to have
                        the benefit of the fair exercise of his function”;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_91-p2_b"></a>(b)     that the Public Prosecutor is an
                        independent statutory authority not part of the investigating agency;
                        and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_91-p2_c"></a>(c)     that the
                        Public Prosecutor holds a public office and the primacy given to him under
                        the law of criminal procedure has a social purpose.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_92"></a>92     Narayan J then came to the following
                    findings on the duty of the Prosecution (at [26]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">There should be on the part of the Public Prosecutor no unseemly eagerness
                        for or grasping at conviction. His duty as Public Prosecutor is not merely
                        to secure the conviction of the accused at all costs but to place before the
                        Court whatever evidence is in his possession, whether it be in favour or
                        against the accused and to leave it to the Court to decide upon all such
                        evidences whether the accused had or had not committed the offence with
                        which he stood charged. <em>The Public Prosecutor is not
                            supposed to go out of his way to secure a conviction. He has to be
                            truthful and impartial. A Public Prosecutor is not a mouthpiece for the
                            State. He must not consciously mis-state the facts, nor knowingly
                            conceal the truth. The Public Prosecutor must not suppress or keep back
                            from the Court evidence relevant to the determination of the guilt or
                            innocence of the accused. He must present a complete picture and not be
                            partial. He has to be fair to both sides in the presentation of the
                            case</em>. The ideal Public Prosecutor is not concerned with
                        securing convictions, or with satisfying the departments of the State
                        Government, with which he has to be in contact. <em>He must
                            consider himself as an agent of justice</em>. [emphasis
                        added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Narayan J then held (at [29]) that the evidence suppressed by the Prosecution suggested
                    that the material incriminating the appellants had been concocted and could not
                    be relied on, and ordered the setting aside of the convictions and sentences of
                    the appellants.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">Malaysia</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_93"></a>93     The Malaysian case of <em>Sukma
                        Darmawan Sasmitaat Madja v Public Prosecutor</em> [2007] 5 MLJ
                    666 (“<em>Sukma</em>”) concerned an appellant
                    who had pleaded guilty before a sessions court to a charge of gross indecency
                    under s 377D of the Penal Code (Act 574, 1997 Rev Ed)
                    (M’sia). The appellant had appealed as well as sought criminal revision
                    before the High Court, but his appeal and application for revision were
                    dismissed on procedural grounds. He then appealed to the Malaysian Court of
                    Appeal, which stated the following (at [8]–[10]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>8</b>
                … [I]t is our opinion that the
                            decision of the High Court cannot stand for several
                        reasons.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>9</b>
                First, there was evidence placed before the
                            High Court that at the time when the accused pleaded guilty the
                            prosecution had in their possession material which, at the very least,
                            cast a doubt on the guilt of the accused. The material in question was a
                            medical report by a Government doctor who had examined the accused. In
                            his report he says that there were no signs of any penetration in the
                            accused’s anus, whether recent or old. … If you look at the
                            charge, in substance it alleges penetration. That is the particular act
                            of gross indecency which the prosecution says brings the case under
                            s 377D. ... So, it comes to this. The prosecution had in its
                            possession evidence favourable to the defence. What should it do in such
                            circumstances? The answer is to be found in the decision of the English
                            Court of Appeal in <em>Dallison v Caffrey</em>
                                [<em>sic</em>] [1965] 1 QB 348. In that
                            case Lord Denning MR said:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">The duty of a prosecuting counsel or solicitor, as I have always
                            understood it, is this: if he knows of a credible witness who can speak
                            to material facts which tend to show the prisoner to be innocent, he
                            must either call that witness himself or make his statement available to
                            the defence. It would be highly reprehensible to conceal from the court
                            the evidence which such a witness can give. If the prosecuting counsel
                            or solicitor knows, not of a credible witness, but a witness whom he
                            does not accept as credible, he should tell the defence about him so
                            that they can call him if they wish. Here the solicitor, immediately
                            after the court proceedings, gave the solicitor for the defence the
                            statement of Mr and Mrs Stamp; and thereby he did his duty.</p>

                In the present case, the sessions judge was
                            denied access to information favourable to the accused. Had it been made
                            available to her, she may well have rejected the plea of guilt on the
                            ground that an offence may not have been committed for the want of proof
                            of an essential allegation in the charge. For it is trite law that in a
                            case where an accused pleads guilty, the prosecution when reciting the
                            facts, confine itself to only those facts it can prove. See, <em>Abdul Kadir bin Abdul Rahman v Public Prosecutor</em>
                            [1984] 1 MLJ 80; <em>Mohammad bin Hassan v Public
                                Prosecutor</em> [1998] 5 MLJ 65. We are satisfied that
                            the accused’s conviction based on his plea of guilt may be quashed
                            on this ground alone. But, as it happens, there are other grounds as
                            well. And before moving onto them we must express our deep regret that
                            the suppression of material evidence by the prosecution occurred in this
                            case despite the reminder given by Vincent Ng JC (as he then was) in
                                <em>Public Prosecutor v Lee Eng Kooi</em>
                            [1993] 2 MLJ 322 when he said that the duty of deputy public
                            prosecutors is (at p 336):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">... to help the court arrive at the truth and to honour truth itself
                            overrides any lingering ill-founded eagerness that they may harbour, to
                            satisfy their superiors that they have robotically objected to the
                            objectable. Surely, the eternal question of which version if any, abides
                            by the truth is solely and exclusively within the domain of judicial
                            determination and not within the purview of counsel or DPPs.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_94"></a>94     The proposition followed in <em>Sukma</em> that the Prosecution’s statement of facts should
                    only contain facts it is able to prove (first stated in <em>Lian
                        Kian Boon v Public Prosecutor</em> [1991] 1 MLJ 51) is one that
                    has not been considered in the Singapore courts. We would tentatively accept
                    that if there is reason for a court to suspect that part of a statement of facts
                    relating to an essential element of the offence charged is false (for instance
                    due to contradiction between facts in the statement of facts), it should not
                    accept a plea of guilt based on that statement of facts. That aside, as a matter
                    of general principle we empathically agree with the Malaysian Court of
                    Appeal’s view in <em>Sukma</em> that there is an
                    inextricable link between the Prosecution’s specific duty not to suppress
                    material evidence and its general duty to the court, and that where a breach of
                    the duty against suppression threatens to cause a miscarriage of justice the
                    court should prevent it by any permissible means.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">Brunei</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_95"></a>95     Finally, we consider the position in Brunei.
                    The Bruneian case of <em>Yeo Tse Soon &amp; Anor v Public
                        Prosecutor</em> [1995] 3 MLJ 255 (“<em>Yeo
                        Tse Soon</em>”) concerned several offences committed by the
                    appellants accompanied by one Lau Foo Tze (“Lau”). Lau had given a
                    statement to the police in the course of investigations but he later disappeared
                    and was not traced by the time of trial. The appellants believed that
                    Lau’s statement contained material that tended to exonerate them. They
                    applied to the trial judge thrice for Lau’s statement to be produced by
                    the Prosecution, the first two times based on a common law duty of disclosure
                    and citing <em>Dallison v Caffery</em> [1965] 1 QB 348
                        (“<em>Dallison</em>”) (see <a href="#p1_83">[83]</a> above) and the third time based on
                    s 117(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 7, 1984 Ed) (Brunei)
                    (“the Brunei CPC”) which would be similar to s 122(5) of the
                    CPC except that it does not limit the statement’s admissibility to the
                    trial of its maker. The trial judge dismissed all three applications and
                    convicted the appellants after the trial. The appellants subsequently appealed
                    to the Brunei Court of Appeal against their convictions.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_96"></a>96     The Brunei Court of Appeal agreed with the
                    trial judge’s application of s 117(1) of the Brunei CPC. However, it
                    went on to find (at 268I) that “[t]he matter stands very differently in
                    relation to the bearing of common law principle on this application for
                    disclosure”. The court then (at 268–270) considered the relevant
                    English cases, and summarised their effect as follows (at 270F):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">At p 632 of [<em>Ward</em>],
                        Glidewell LJ, giving the judgment of the court, summarized the
                        principles of law and practice which now govern the disclosure of evidence
                        by the prosecution before trial in criminal trials in the United Kingdom.
                        Having first recited the duty of the prosecution to make available a witness
                        whom the prosecution has decided not to call, the learned judge went on to
                        say:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">Unless there are good reasons for not doing so, the duty should
                            normally be performed by supplying copies of the witness statements to
                            the defence or allowing them to inspect statements and make copies: see
                                <em>R v Lawson</em> [[1990] 90 Cr App R
                            107]. Where there are good reasons for not supplying copies of the
                            statements, the duty to disclose can be performed by supplying the name
                            and address of the witness to the defence.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In the present state of authority in the United Kingdom it would seem,
                        therefore, that only if there are good reasons for withholding a statement
                        should the prosecution refuse to disclose it and make it available.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_97"></a>97     Applying the common law principles to the
                    facts, the court held (at 270–271) that the non-disclosure of Lau’s
                    statement had materially hampered the Defence in the cross-examination of the
                    complainant, who had given the only testimony supporting the serious charges
                    against the appellants. The court considered the refusal of the trial judge to
                    order production a material irregularity. The court then considered some
                    additional grounds for allowing the appeal before stating the following
                    conclusion (at 272H):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">These matters taken together with the refusal by the prosecution to make
                        Lau’s statement available to the defence have persuaded us, after
                        anxious consideration, that the convictions were unsafe and accordingly we
                        allowed the appeals of both appellants and set aside the sentences.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_98"></a>98     It is very clear that although the main
                    developments in the common law occurred in England, all major common law
                    jurisdictions (besides Singapore) have imposed some kind of non-statutory
                    disclosure obligation on the Prosecution. This grounds the duty of disclosure by
                    the Prosecution firmly in the common law, not just the law of England. In our
                    view, it seems that the courts of the jurisdictions that have been discussed
                    have generally perceived this obligation to be based on “the elementary
                    right of every defendant to a fair trial” (see <em>Brown</em> at 374; see, also, <em>Mallard</em>
                    at [82] and <em>Lee Ming
                        Tee</em> at [139]), on
                    “the rules of natural justice” including “open
                    justice” (see <em>Brown</em> at 374) and on a duty
                    owed by prosecutors to the court (see <em>Brown</em> at
                    375; see, also, <em>Mallard</em> at [82] and <em>Sheshrao</em> at [24]).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The Prosecution’s duty of disclosure under the common law in
                Singapore</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_99"></a>99     On 23 May 2011, we directed the parties
                    to make further submissions on the following question:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Is the Prosecution under a duty (legal and/or ethical) to the Court to
                        disclose to it material that is a) not part of the Prosecution's case,
                        b) from a seemingly credible source, c) that would be admissible
                        in evidence and d) that may have a direct bearing on the guilt or
                        innocence of an accused? If so, when ought this to be done?</p>
<p class="Judg-1">In its further written submissions dated 30 May 2011, the
                    Prosecution began by stating that “the question, as phrased, must be
                    answered affirmatively but with qualifications”. Specifically, the
                    Prosecution made a distinction between an <em>ethical duty to the
                        Court to disclose certain material</em> and a <em>legal
                        duty of (criminal) discovery</em>. The Prosecution took the position
                    that it did not bear any <em>legal</em> duty of discovery
                    (what we have called disclosure) whether at the pre-trial or trial stage, based
                    on the analysis of the CPC in <em>Selvarajan James</em>.
                    This means that “<em>not all prima facie inconsistent
                        evidence</em> must or needs or ought to be disclosed by the
                    Prosecution” [emphasis in original].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_100"></a>100    However, the Prosecution acknowledged that
                    it bore an <em>ethical</em> duty to produce before the
                    court any evidence, including evidence inconsistent with its case, which was
                    credible and material to the matter before the court. The Prosecution stated
                    that this was a continuing obligation, but submitted that the question of
                    whether a piece of evidence was credible and/or material, and, therefore,
                    whether there is a duty to disclose it, should be for the Prosecution <em>alone</em> to decide in a <em>bona
                        fide</em> exercise of discretion, considering the effect of other
                    evidence available to it. For this last proposition, which we interpret as
                    implying a subjective prosecutorial discretion not to disclose, the Prosecution
                    relied on Diplock LJ’s speech in <em>Dallison</em> (the same passage quoted in <em>Brown</em> at 345 (see <a href="#p1_83">[83]</a>
                    above)). This proposition, in our view, is plainly wrong (see <a href="#p1_114">[114]</a>–<a href="#p1_115">[115]</a> below).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_101"></a>101    As a convenient starting point to address
                    the Prosecution’s submissions and to discuss whether there is any common
                    law disclosure obligation in Singapore, we will first deal with the decision in
                        <em>Selvarajan James</em> (see <a href="#p1_81">[81]</a> above). That case actually stood for two distinct
                    propositions relating to disclosure:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_101-p2_a"></a>(a)     that the Prosecution has <em>no duty</em> to produce unused material in the form of a
                        witness statement to the Defence (at [18]); and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_101-p2_b"></a>(b)     that the court has <em>no
                            power</em> to order the Prosecution to produce witness statements
                        to the Defence (at [19]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_102"></a>102    Regarding the Prosecution’s duty of
                    disclosure, it is true that neither the CPC nor the CPC 2010 prescribe a
                    statutory obligation to disclose unused material. However, we believe that the
                    statutes do not prevent us from acknowledging the existence of a similar duty at
                    common law. This proposition is amply supported by the second reading speech of
                    the Minister for Law (“the Minister”) for the Criminal Procedure
                    Code Bill, which was subsequently enacted as the CPC 2010, in the following
                    excerpt (see <em>Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official
                        Report</em> (19 May 2010) vol 87 at cols 563–564
                    (K Shanmugam, Minister for Law)):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Ms Lee asked why witness statements are not provided to the defence.
                            <em>Witness statements are not provided to the defence
                            for public policy reasons</em>. The police rely quite
                        substantially on the assistance of the public to solve crimes. <em>If witnesses know that statements that they have given in the
                            course of investigations may be supplied to the accused for his counsel,
                            they may not be inclined to come forward</em>. We also cannot rule
                        out the possibility that threats may be made to witnesses or that they may
                        be otherwise suborned.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Mr Kumar queried whether there will be consequences for deliberate
                        concealment of material evidence and that the State can be compelled to
                        provide disclosure on pain of contempt. Where there is inadequate
                        discovery given by a party, the Court can ask for an explanation and draw
                        such inferences as it thinks fit.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<em>The Bill does not seek to prescribe all the
                            consequences for inadequate disclosure as it can occur in a wide range
                            of circumstances. If documents are being deliberately withheld, the
                            appropriate remedy should be left as a matter of judicial discretion to
                            the Court. It should be noted that lawyers appearing in Court, whether
                            prosecution or defence lawyers, are officers of the Court. If they
                            deliberately suppress material evidence, they will be acting in gross
                            breach of their duties</em>. <b><em>One cannot put
                            forward evidence in Court while holding back other evidence which could
                            put a different complexion on the evidence that has in fact been
                            tendered in Court. I have no doubt that the Court will take a serious
                            view of such conduct</em></b>.</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_103"></a>103    This significant statement was not drawn to
                    our attention by the counsel for the Appellants or the Prosecution. In our view,
                    this indication of parliamentary intent is contrary to the view expressed in
                        <em>Selvarajan James</em> that it is not for the court
                    to impose a duty of disclosure on the Prosecution, although in all fairness it
                    should be noted that similar legislative statements were not in existence at
                    that point in time. In our view, as seen through the Minister’s
                    statements, Parliament had expressly contemplated that:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_103-p2_a"></a>(a)     the absence of statutory
                        prescription did not imply the absence of any duty of disclosure or of any
                        consequences for non-disclosure;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_103-p2_b"></a>(b)     prosecutors and defence counsel, as officers of the
                        court, have a duty not to suppress material evidence; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_103-p2_c"></a>(c)     the court would have the discretion
                        to prescribe appropriate remedies for the serious act of deliberately
                        suppressing evidence (which would include the deliberate non-disclosure of
                        unused material).</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Regarding (b) specifically, the
                    Minister very correctly pointed out that a party cannot fulfil its duty to the
                    court by adducing evidence, however compelling, while suppressing other evidence
                    that “put[s] a different complexion” on what has been adduced.
                    Although the speech was in respect of what would become the CPC 2010, in
                    our view, the same sentiments would be equally applicable in the context of the
                    CPC. In relation to the Minister’s earlier comments on the disclosure of
                    witness statements, it can be said that the public policy concerns alluded to
                    would ordinarily become valid only where statements that <em>inculpate</em> the accused are concerned; if the statements are
                        <em>exculpatory</em>, ordinarily there seems no reason
                    for them not to be disclosed, even from the makers’
                perspective.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_104"></a>104    Beyond the Minister’s statements, it
                    may further be observed that neither the CPC nor the CPC 2010 contain any
                    provision equivalent to s 21(1) of the CPIA 1996, which states that the
                    common law rules in relation to the Prosecution’s duty of disclosure do
                    not apply after certain specified stages in criminal proceedings. In addition,
                    the CPIA 1996 was specifically intended to prescribe a less extensive scheme of
                    disclosure than the common law rules it was replacing (as seen in its different
                    approach to unused material), which led the court in <em>Lee</em> to conclude (at 1962E) that “[t]he disclosure
                    required by the [CPIA 1996] is, and is intended to be, less extensive than would
                    have been required prior to the Act at common law”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_105"></a>105    In contrast with the CPIA 1996, s 5 of
                    the CPC states the following:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-Heading1">
<b>Laws of England, when
                            applicable</b>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">

                            law relating to criminal procedure for the time being in force in
                            England <em>shall be applied</em> so far as the
                            procedure does not conflict or is not inconsistent with this Code and
                            can be made auxiliary thereto.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The new equivalent of this section is s 6 of the CPC 2010, which
                    states:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-Heading1">

                            and which is not inconsistent with this Code or such other law,
                                <em>may be adopted</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">In our view, the reference to what “the justice of the case may
                    require” must include procedures that uphold established notions of a
                    fair trial in an adversarial setting where not already part of the written
                    law.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_106"></a>106    It can be seen that s 5 of the CPC
                    gives courts a wide scope to consider and apply English criminal procedure where
                    the CPC was silent. <em>Criminal Procedure</em> vol 1
                    (Tan Yock Lin) (LexisNexis, Looseleaf Ed, 1996, November 2010 Ed) at
                    ch I, para 603 points out that where s 5 applies it imposes a
                    mandatory application of English law: see also <em>Tay Charlie v
                        Public Prosecutor</em> [1965–1967] SLR(R) 788 at
                        [9]. This is unlike s 6 of the
                    CPC 2010, which is phrased in discretionary terms. In <em>Kulwant
                        v Public Prosecutor</em> [1985–1986] SLR(R) 663
                        (“<em>Kulwant</em>”),
                    P Coomaraswamy J declined to use s 5 to apply a common law duty
                    of disclosure in relation to an accused’s previous statements for four
                    reasons (see [46] and [47]):</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_106-p2_a"></a>(a)     there was no lacuna in the CPC

                            (<em>Practice Note (Criminal Evidence: Unused
                            Material)</em> [1982] 1 All ER 734) (“the
                        guidelines”) cited by the Defence did not have the status of
                        law;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_106-p2_c"></a>(c)     the
                        guidelines did not support the Defence’s application on the facts;
                        and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_106-p2_d"></a>(d)     the
                        English cases cited by the Defence dealt with witnesses’ statements
                        rather than statements of the accused.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_107"></a>107    In our view, it is clear that the CPC makes
                    “no special provision” for the disclosure of unused material and
                    that the English common law on disclosure (as it had developed at that time)
                    would generally not have conflicted with any part of the CPC. In other words,
                    the English common law on disclosure could, to a large extent, have been adopted
                    and applied via s 5 of the CPC in <em>Kulwant</em>. As
                    for <em>Selvarajan James</em>, we find that the court, upon
                    observing the absence of any statutory duty to disclose unused material, should
                    have used this absence as a basis to consider the use of English law under
                    s 5 of the CPC. Thus, <em>Selvarajan James</em> should
                    no longer be considered to represent the law on the issue of disclosure by the
                    Prosecution, although the subsequent findings on the adduction of fresh evidence
                    in that case point to a correct outcome on the facts. The Prosecution’s
                    position that there is no legal obligation of disclosure of material evidence
                    inconsistent with its case (or in the Minister’s words, evidence
                    “which could put a different complexion on the evidence that has in
                    fact been tendered in Court” (see <a href="#p1_102">[102]</a> above)) in Singapore, based as it was on the reasoning in
                        <em>Selvarajan James</em>, cannot be
                sustained.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_108"></a>108    It is striking that the Minister
                    unequivocally stated that if prosecutors withhold material evidence “they
                    will be acting in <em>gross breach of their
                    duties</em>” [emphasis added]. In our view, this is true in
                    relation to the general duty of prosecutors who are called as advocates and
                    solicitors of the Supreme Court, and are, hence, officers of the court (see
                        <em>Law Society of Singapore v Ang Boon Kong
                        Lawrence</em> [1992] 3 SLR(R) 825 at [13]). For a practicing advocate and solicitor
                    conducting a prosecution, this duty is partly expressed in r 86 of the
                    Legal Profession (Professional Conduct) Rules (Cap 161, R 1,
                    2010 Rev Ed) (“the LP(PC)R”) as a duty to “assist the
                    Court at all times before the conclusion of the trial, by drawing attention to
                    any apparent errors or omissions of fact … which in his opinion ought to
                    be corrected”. Although the Minister also referred to a duty on defence
                    counsel not to suppress evidence, we should make it clear that this duty takes a
                    different form. While r 74 of the LP(PC)R emphatically states that defence
                    counsel cannot set up an affirmative case inconsistent with any confession made
                    to them by their client, they are not obliged to proactively disclose evidence
                    of their client’s guilt. Such disclosures would normally be covered by
                    legal professional privilege under s 128(1) of the EA and r 24(1) of
                    the LP(PC)R. The reason for this asymmetry in duty is linked to the presumption
                    of innocence. To require Defence counsel to disclose evidence of guilt would be
                    to undermine the fundamental principle that the Prosecution must prove its case
                    beyond reasonable doubt (see <em>Jagatheesan</em> at
                        [61]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_109"></a>109    There are, however, also duties inherent to
                    the role of the prosecutor which apply whether or not a prosecutor is an
                    advocate and solicitor. In <em>Lee Ming Tee</em> at
                        [144], Sir Anthony
                    Mason NPJ (citing <em>R v Banks</em> [1916] 2 KB
                    621 at 623) stated that prosecutors, in conducting a criminal trial,
                    “should “regard themselves” rather “as ministers of
                    justice” assisting in its administration than as advocates”.
                    Similar sentiments were expressed in <em>Mallard</em> at
                        <a href="#p1_82">[82]</a> (see <a href="#p1_87">[87]</a> above), <em>Stinchcombe</em> at 333
                    (see <a href="#p1_90">[90]</a> above), <em>Sheshrao</em> at <a href="#p1_26">[26]</a> (see
                        <a href="#p1_91">[91]</a> and <a href="#p1_92">[92]</a> above) and <em>Sukma</em> at <a href="#p1_10">[10]</a> (see <a href="#p1_93">[93]</a>
                    above). The duty of prosecutors is not to secure a conviction at all costs. It
                    is also not their duty to timorously discontinue proceedings the instant some
                    weakness is found in their case. Their duty is to assist the court in coming to
                    the correct decision. Although this assistance often takes the form of
                    presenting evidence of guilt as part of the adversarial process, the
                    prosecutor’s freedom to act as adversary to defence counsel is qualified
                    by the grave consequences of criminal conviction. The certainty required by the
                    court before it will impose these consequences is recognised in the presumption
                    of innocence enjoyed by the accused. <em>For this reason, a
                        decision to prosecute in the public interest must be seen as compatible with
                        a willingness to disclose all material that is</em> prima facie
                        <em>useful to the court’s determination of the truth,
                        even if it is unhelpful or even detrimental to the Prosecution’s
                        case</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_110"></a>110    We therefore are of the view that there is
                    indeed a duty on the Prosecution to disclose a limited amount of unused material
                    in Singapore, although the precise scope of this will have to be the subject of
                    further development (see <a href="#p1_113">[113]</a>–<a href="#p1_119">[119]</a> below and
                    onwards). This duty is based on the general principles in the common law and
                    supported by parliamentary intention (see <a href="#p1_102">[102]</a> above), the wide scope of s 5 of the CPC and the even
                    wider scope of s 6 of the CPC 2010, which permits the court to adopt
                    “such procedure as the justice of the case may require” where no
                    provision is made in the CPC 2010 or other law and where that procedure is
                    not inconsistent with written law. Although this duty has its basis in an
                    ethical duty (as the Prosecution has recognised in its further submissions), it
                    is not a “mere” ethical duty (such as the duty of courtesy) the
                    breach of which attracts censure but has no effect on the substantive outcome of
                    the trial. Because of its significance to the legal outcome of the trial, this
                    duty is accompanied by a substantive legal obligation which can be enforced by
                    the court. To hold that there is no such legal obligation would be to
                    effectively sanction unscrupulous methods of prosecution with the court’s
                    stamp of approval. It would be thoroughly disingenuous to suggest (and the
                    Prosecution, to its credit, has not so suggested) that the Prosecution, being
                    obliged by the committal threshold (in preliminary inquiry proceedings and
                    committal hearings) and the “no case to answer” procedure (at
                    trial) to reveal the <em>absence of evidence</em> going to
                    the elements of an offence, nevertheless has the right to conceal <em>positive evidence</em> of the accused’s innocence from
                    the court at any of those proceedings.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_111"></a>111    The proposition in <em>Selvarajan James</em> that the court lacks <em>power</em> to compel prosecutorial disclosure will now be considered
                    in brief. In <em>Tan Khee Koon v Public Prosecutor</em>
                    [1995] 3 SLR(R) 404 at [61]–[62],
                    Yong CJ held that the court had the power under s 58(1) of the CPC
                    (now s 235(1) of the CPC 2010) to compel the production of any
                    document or thing necessary or desirable for the purposes of trial, although an
                    application could only be made “to the court before which the actual
                    trial was taking place and … only … after the recording of the
                    prosecution evidence had commenced”. Notably, s 58(1) cannot be used
                    in relation to a “general demand” for an unspecified class of
                    documents; an applicant must be precise in specifying the documents that are
                    desired (see <em>Public Prosecutor v IC Automation (S) Pte
                        Ltd</em> [1996] 2 SLR(R) 799 at [63]). The Malaysian courts have also stated that s 51 of
                    the Criminal Procedure Code (Act 593, 1999 Rev Ed) (M’sia) (the
                    equivalent to s 58(1) of the CPC) should not be taken to allow for access
                    to materials in a manner akin to discovery and inspection in civil proceedings
                    (see <em>Public Prosecutor v Raymond Chia Kim Chwee &amp; Anor;
                        Zainal Bin Haji Ali v Public Prosecutor</em> [1985] 2 MLJ 436 at
                    439 and <em>Muzammil Izat bin Hashim v Public
                        Prosecutor</em> [2003] 6 MLJ 590 at 594).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_112"></a>112    It remains to be seen whether the decision
                    in <em>Sukma</em> (see <a href="#p1_93">[93]</a> above) will have any effect on the Malaysian position. For
                    present purposes, recognising the limitations on s 58(1) of the CPC imposed
                    by its wording, we are inclined to say that any power necessary for enforcing
                    the Prosecution’s common law duty to disclose unused material may have to
                    be itself based on the common law as applied through s 5 of the CPC or
                    s 6 of the CPC 2010. It would be an absurd result if, having found
                    that a common law disclosure duty exists, we hold that a trial court is unable
                    to enforce that duty because of the lack of a relevant statutory power even in a
                    case of grave and deliberate breach. We cannot see why it should be left to an
                    appellate court to correct a miscarriage of justice in such a situation. In the
                    final analysis, we would say that the necessary power arises from the inherent
                    jurisdiction of the court to prevent injustice or an abuse of process (see
                        <em>Public Prosecutor v Ho So Mui</em> [1993]
                    1 SLR(R) 57 at [36], <em>Salwant Singh s/o Amer Singh v Public Prosecutor</em> [2005]
                    1 SLR(R) 632 at [11] and
                        <em>Evidence and the Litigation Process</em> at
                    paras 10.24–10.29 (albeit in a different context)).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Scope of the Prosecution’s duty of disclosure under the common
                law in Singapore </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_113"></a>113    In our view, it is not necessary, for
                    present purposes, for us to attempt a comprehensive statement of what the law of
                    Singapore should be in this area. There is still ample scope for the development
                    of the fine details in subsequent cases or by legislative intervention. It
                    suffices for us to say that we agree with the Prosecution that the duty of
                    disclosure certainly does not cover all unused material or even all evidence
                    inconsistent with the Prosecution’s case. However, the Prosecution must
                    disclose to the Defence material which takes the form of:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_113-p2_a"></a>(a)     any unused material that is likely
                        to be admissible and that might reasonably be regarded as credible and
                        relevant to the guilt or innocence of the accused; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_113-p2_b"></a>(b)     any unused material that is likely to
                        be inadmissible, but would provide a real (not fanciful) chance of pursuing
                        a line of inquiry that leads to material that is likely to be admissible and
                        that might reasonably be regarded as credible and relevant to the guilt or
                        innocence of the accused.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">This will not include material
                    which is neutral or adverse to the accused – it only includes material
                    that tends to undermine the Prosecution’s case or strengthen the
                    Defence’s case. To ensure congruence with the statutory scheme for
                    disclosure this material should initially be disclosed no later than seven days
                    before the date fixed for the committal hearing for High Court trials or two
                    weeks from the CCDC for Subordinate Court trials (corresponding to the timelines
                    in ss 176(3)(<em>b</em>) and 161(2) of the
                    CPC 2010 respectively). Where under s 159 of the CPC 2010 the
                    statutory criminal case disclosure procedures do not apply, the common law
                    disclosure described here should take place at the latest before the trial
                    begins. The obligation of disclosure (as the Prosecution has correctly
                    acknowledged in its further submissions) is a continuing one and only ends when
                    the case has been completely disposed of, including any appeal. Throughout this
                    period, the Prosecution is obliged to continuously evaluate undisclosed material
                    in its possession to see if it ought to be the subject of further
                    disclosure.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_114"></a>114    When we use the phrase “material ...
                    that might reasonably be regarded as credible and relevant”, we refer to
                    material that is <em>prima facie</em> credible and
                    relevant. This is to be determined on an <em>objective</em>
                    test. We reject the Prosecution’s submission that it should have an
                    exclusive and an unquestionable right to assess an item of inconsistent evidence
                    alongside other evidence available to it, <em>which may never be
                        seen by the court</em>, and in that way <em>unilaterally</em> decide on its credibility and/or relevance (and
                    therefore disclosability) based on its own <em>bona
                        fide</em> exercise of <em>subjective</em>
                    discretion. <em>Such a procedure provides an unacceptably low
                        level of accountability</em>. The Prosecution has curiously relied on
                    Diplock LJ’s speech in <em>Dallison</em> at 375
                    to justify its position. Diplock LJ, as pointed out in <em>Brown</em> at 375, was relying on the earlier case of <em>Rex v Bryant and Dickson</em> (1946)
                    31 Cr App R 146. This case was overruled by the House of Lords in
                        <em>Regina v Mills</em> [1998] AC 382
                        (“<em>Mills</em>”) at 402–404 in so
                    far as it stood for the proposition that the Prosecution should disclose
                    statements of witnesses regarded as credible but need not do so for witnesses
                    not regarded as credible. The House of Lords emphatically disapproved of this
                    distinction on the basis that it gave too much discretion to the Prosecution,
                    and that this could lead to injustice.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_115"></a>115    The above approach (at <a href="#p1_113">[113]</a>) gives more discretion to the Prosecution
                    than <em>Mills</em>, which seemed to exclude all
                    considerations of credibility from the disclosure exercise. That having been
                    said, in the area of criminal law, where the life or liberty of an individual is
                    at stake, it is axiomatic that there must be accountability in the process of
                    assessing the weight of apparently-credible, relevant and admissible evidence.
                    Where the Prosecution finds material objectively <em>prima
                        facie</em> credible and relevant, it should be disclosed to the
                    Defence. Any dispute or uncertainty that the Prosecution wishes to raise
                    regarding the credibility and relevance of the disclosed evidence should be the
                    subject of examination and submissions before the court, not of an opaque,
                    purely internal and subjective exercise of discretion. It is true that
                    prosecutors will still have to apply their minds as to whether material
                    objectively falls under the disclosure obligation. However, where there is any
                    doubt about whether a piece of unused evidence is credible, the court should be
                    allowed to make the final decision. Counsel for the appellant in <em>Mills</em> argued (at 387A) that “[c]redibility cannot
                    be determined in advance”. We prefer to say that credibility may be
                        <em>difficult</em> to determine in advance, and the
                    critical question of whether exculpatory evidence is true ultimately resides
                    within the domain of the court and not within that of the Prosecution.
                    Similarly, if the Prosecution has any doubt about the relevance of a piece of
                    unused evidence, it should be drawn to the attention of the court so the court
                    can rule on it (see, also, <em>Keane</em> at 752 and
                        <em>Lee Ming Tee</em> at [152]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_116"></a>116    By limiting disclosure to material that is
                        <em>prima facie</em> relevant (as opposed to <em>possibly</em> relevant) and adding a threshold of <em>prima facie</em> credibility to the Prosecution’s
                    consideration, this reasonably limits the amount of material to be disclosed and
                    thereby avoids some of the practical difficulties of the common law regime as it
                    evolved in England. Some examples of unused material that the Prosecution is not
                    obliged to disclose might include:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_116-p2_a"></a>(a)     an anonymous letter mailed to
                        investigators stating that the accused is not guilty (this would not be
                        admissible and <em>prima facie</em> credible, nor would
                        it provide a real prospect of a relevant line of
                    inquiry);</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_116-p2_b"></a>(b)     the
                        statement of a person saying that he himself had committed the crime instead
                        of the accused, except that it is incontrovertible that the person was not
                        at the place of the crime at the time (this would not be <em>prima facie</em> credible, nor would it provide a real prospect
                        of a relevant line of inquiry); and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_116-p2_c"></a>(c)     a photograph of the scene of the crime a long time after
                        it was committed (this in most cases would not be <em>prima
                            facie</em> relevant, although it <em>may</em>
                        become relevant in the course of the trial and may then have to be
                        disclosed).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_117"></a>117    For a related reason, the duty of disclosure
                    is limited to material that would likely be admissible in evidence or provides a
                    real chance of leading to such “likely-admissible” material. This
                    is a departure from the English position. Our statutory rules of admissibility
                    as governed by the CPC, the CPC 2010 and the EA impose a certain minimum
                    standard of credibility and materiality. For the most part they reflect the
                    common law exclusionary rules, except that they are framed in terms of
                    inclusionary categories of relevance and admissibility (see <em>Evidence and the Litigation Process</em> at para 2.16). As
                    summarised by Jeffrey Pinsler SC in <em>Evidence and
                        the Litigation Process</em> (at para 2.15):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-Heading1">
<b>Rationale of the exclusionary
                            rules</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The exclusionary rules evolved because of the recognition that certain
                        types of evidence were <em>not the best available</em>,
                        or could be <em>unreliable</em>, or that their
                            <em>prejudicial effect outweighed their probative
                            value</em>, or because they gave rise to side issues which would
                        complicate the case or distract the trier of fact and take up the time of
                        the court. …</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">For this reason, it appears to us that obligatory disclosure is
                    primarily limited to such material as is likely to pass the standard of legal
                    admissibility, in addition to an exceptional category of material providing a
                        <em>real chance</em> of leading to such evidence by a
                    line of inquiry. However, we would expect (as the court has always expected)
                    investigators and the Prosecution to pursue inquiries arising from non-disclosed
                    material as far as practicable, and where these produce material falling under
                    the disclosure obligation, the Prosecution should consider whether to make
                    further disclosure.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_118"></a>118    The Prosecution has taken the position that
                    its duty of disclosure is owed “<em>to the
                        Court</em>” [emphasis in original]. Its submissions firmly
                    reject any duty that involves discovery by or disclosure to the Defence. While
                    the duty has also been expressed in the authorities as being owed to the
                        <em>court</em> (see the passage from <em>Brown</em> at <a href="#p1_83">[83]</a> above (quoting
                        <em>Ward</em> at 645)), the authorities agree that in
                    practice, it is fulfilled by disclosure to the <em>Defence</em> (see, <em>eg</em>, <em>Lee Ming Tee</em> at [155]). We believe that the reason for this is two-fold. First,
                    to the extent that there is an obligation to disclose some material not
                    admissible in evidence, it stands to reason that such material should not be
                    placed before the court.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_119"></a>119    The second reason is as follows. To oblige
                    the Prosecution to present material for disclosure directly to the court rather
                    than to the Defence seems tantamount to compelling the Prosecution to present
                    part of the Defence case. This would not be correct (see <a href="#p1_85">[85]</a>(i)). The Prosecution will be placed in a
                    situation of conflict by having to explain to the court why the material (which
                    it may well subjectively regard as untrue or immaterial) is objectively
                        <em>prima facie</em> credible and relevant to the case,
                    especially since this disclosed material supports the Defence case or undermines
                    the Prosecution’s case (see <a href="#p1_113">[113]</a>
                    above). The Prosecution also should not be obliged to pursue further inquiries
                    concerning the material on behalf of the Defence, nor is it in a position to
                    make tactical decisions about when, how and whether to use the material in
                    court. These all support the practice that disclosure should generally be made
                    to the Defence, which will then decide what to do with the
                material.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Consequences of non-disclosure and late disclosure</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_120"></a>120    In our view, there is no reason why a
                    failure by the Prosecution to discharge its duty of disclosure in a timely
                    manner should not cause a conviction to be overturned if such an irregularity
                    can be considered to be a material irregularity that occasions a failure of
                    justice, or, put in another way, renders the conviction unsafe (see, also,
                        <em>Lee Yuan Kwang and others v Public Prosecutor</em>
                    [1995] 1 SLR(R) 778 at [40]).
                    The usual rules and procedures for the adducing of fresh evidence in appellate
                    proceedings would be applicable. It should be pointed out that not all
                    non-disclosures will be attributable to fault on the part of the Prosecution (or
                    a lack of <em>bona fides</em>); nevertheless, as pointed
                    out in <em>Lee Ming Tee</em> at [142] (see <a href="#p1_89">[89]</a> above), where such non-disclosures result in a conviction
                    being unsafe the result will still be the overturning of that conviction. In
                    considering whether to order a retrial, the following passage from <em>Beh Chai Hock</em> (at [38]) should be noted:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">When exercising its discretion whether to order a retrial, the court must
                        have regard to all the circumstances of the case. The court must also have
                        regard to two competing principles. One is that persons who are guilty of
                        crimes should be brought to justice and should not be allowed to escape
                        scot-free merely because of some technical blunder by the trial judge in the
                        course of the trial. The countervailing principle is one of fairness to the
                        accused person. The Prosecution has the burden of proving the case against
                        the accused person; if the Prosecution has failed to do so once, it should
                        not ordinarily get a second chance to make good the deficiencies of its
                        case. These principles are summarised in <em>Chee Chiew Heong
                            v PP</em> [1981] 2 MLJ 287.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_121"></a>121    Where disclosure, for whatever reason, is
                    made after the beginning of trial, the court may have to grant an adjournment of
                    sufficient duration to allow defence counsel time to consider the effect of the
                    disclosed material and to incorporate it into their case if
                necessary.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Muhammad’s conviction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_122"></a>122    All counsel now accept that Muhammad was the
                    sole assailant (the Prosecution maintains that Ismil was at the scene as well,
                    but concedes that only Muhammad attacked the Deceased). Counsel for Muhammad
                    submitted, however, that Muhammad is entitled to rely on the defence of
                    diminished responsibility and because of this is not guilty of murder.
                    Accordingly, the first issue that must be considered is the admissibility and
                    reliability of the statements provided by Muhammad.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Admissibility and reliability of Muhammad’s
                statements</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Muhammad’s confessions as to his sole involvement</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_123"></a>123    Muhammad first revealed his sole involvement
                    in court on 18 September 2007. Prior to that, in early September, he wrote
                    a statement while in QRP in which he unequivocally admitted to his sole
                    involvement (“the statement of September 2007”). This statement
                    was produced and admitted into evidence. Prior to that, he had on two occasions
                    confessed his sole involvement to his previous lawyers,
                    Mr B J Lean (“Mr Lean”) and Mr Amarick
                    Singh Gill (“Mr Gill”). Both subsequently testified that
                    Muhammad had previously disclosed his sole involvement to Mr Gill as early as
                    19 December 2005. Mr Gill testified that when he visited Muhammad in
                    QRP, he recorded a statement from Muhammad which stated, <em>inter alia</em>, that “[m]y brother did not [<em>sic</em>] involve in this case” and that “[t]he
                    person who do [<em>sic</em>] it is me … [h]e was not
                        there”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_35" id="Ftn_35_1"><sup>[note: 35]</sup></a></span> Muhammad made a second
                    admission of sole involvement around March 2007 to Mr Lean. On
                    20 March 2007, Mr Lean and Mr Gill applied to be discharged as
                    counsel for Muhammad as they found themselves in a situation where they could no
                    longer continue to act for him.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_124"></a>124    Aside from his counsel, Muhammad confessed
                    his sole involvement to his fellow inmates at QRP and two of his family members.
                    Mohammad Zam bin Abdul Rashid (“Zam”), Yusuff bin Ahmad
                    (“Yusuff”) and Ahmad Habibullah Salafi bin Haron
                    (“Habibullah”), fellow inmates of Muhammad’s at QRP,
                    testified that Muhammad had told them in 2005 (sometime in 2005 in the case of

                    in December 2005 in the case of Yusuff) that he was solely responsible for the
                    murder of the Deceased.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_36" id="Ftn_36_1"><sup>[note: 36]</sup></a></span>
                    Sabariah bte Kadar (“Sabariah”) and Rosnani bte Kadar
                    (“Rosnani”), sisters of the Appellants, testified that the family
                    had gathered prior to Muhammad’s arrest in the flat to discuss the murder
                    case. He had informed them that Ismil was innocent.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_37" id="Ftn_37_1"><sup>[note: 37]</sup></a></span> Sabariah and Rosnani subsequently visited
                    Muhammad in prison in 2005. During that visit, he reaffirmed that he alone had
                    committed the murder.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_38" id="Ftn_38_1"><sup>[note: 38]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_125"></a>125    The Judge erred, in our opinion, in
                    dismissing the evidence of Muhammad’s fellow inmates, his sisters and his
                    former lawyers as part of a fabricated plan on Muhammad’s part to save
                    Ismil. The weight of the evidence, which we will come to below, is consistent
                    with Muhammad being the sole assailant and offender, and supports the evidence
                    of the inmates, family members and former lawyers. Moreover, it should be
                    emphasised that Muhammad had no knowledge of Mr Loh’s account of a
                    single assailant when he confessed his sole involvement to his fellow inmates,
                    his family members and his former lawyers, or when he wrote the statement of
                    September 2007. The fact that Mr Loh was aware of only one assailant was
                    only disclosed on 4 September 2007.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_39" id="Ftn_39_1"><sup>[note: 39]</sup></a></span> In their written submissions that were
                    provided to us, counsel for Ismil pointed out:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_40" id="Ftn_40_1"><sup>[note: 40]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">When Muhammad wrote [the statement of September 2007], told his previous
                        counsel on 19 December 2005 [and March 2007], told his sisters and
                        fellow inmates in [August 2005 and from] December 2005 to April 2006 of his
                        sole involvement, Muhammad had no knowledge of Mr. Loh’s
                        account.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">This submission was not challenged by the Prosecution.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_126"></a>126    That Muhammad was the sole assailant and
                    offender would also account for several curious aspects of this matter which the
                    Judge did not address. It would explain why neither DNA particles nor blood
                    belonging to the Deceased was found on Ismil. In this regard, it should be noted
                    that Dr Lai had stated that he would have expected some blood to have been
                    splashed on the assailant’s hands.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_41" id="Ftn_41_1"><sup>[note: 41]</sup></a></span> It could also be added that the
                    nail clippings obtained from Ismil on 7 May 2005 (one day after the murder)
                    did not reveal any trace of the Deceased’s DNA. Muhammad, on the other
                    hand, was only apprehended about three weeks after the attack, and therefore had
                    ample time to erase all traces of evidence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_127"></a>127    That Muhammad was the sole assailant and
                    offender would also explain the graphic account of the crime that he was able to
                    give to the court. This is to be contrasted with the “skeletal”
                    details Ismil gave (see <a href="#p1_188">[188]</a>–<a href="#p1_189">[189]</a> below).
                    The level of detail provided in Muhammad’s statement of September 2007 and
                    his confession in court go well beyond what was stated in Mr Loh’s
                    statements. He was able to provide a vivid and coherent account of three
                    different episodes of attacks that took place at the flat.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_42" id="Ftn_42_1"><sup>[note: 42]</sup></a></span>
                    Indeed, the Prosecution submitted that “Muhammad’s intimate
                    knowledge of the layout of the [D]eceased’s flat, and .., of a room in the
                    [D]eceased’s flat made it perfectly clear that he had been in the flat
                    when the incident happened.”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_43" id="Ftn_43_1"><sup>[note: 43]</sup></a></span> Importantly, his
                    account does not appear to be inconsistent with the objective evidence and
                    Dr Lai’s findings (see <a href="#p1_12">[12]</a>
                    above). In this regard, the following can be highlighted:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_127-p2_a"></a>(a)     Two different weapons were found at
                        the scene – a knife blade and a chopper – and Dr Lai opined
                        that the injuries suffered by the Deceased were consistent with the use of
                        two weapons. Muhammad admitted to using a knife and a chopper and was also
                        able to provide an explanation as to why two weapons were used – the
                        knife handle broke, which was why he then used a chopper.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_127-p2_b"></a>(b)     Dr Lai opined that two assaults
                        took place because the most significant blood spatters were found in two
                        locations. Although Muhammad’s account was that three attacks took
                        place, this is not inconsistent with the objective evidence that the attacks
                        were confined to two locations.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_128"></a>128    Muhammad was able to fill in significant
                    gaps in the investigation’s conclusions through his statement of September
                    2007 and testimony in court. He testified that he had worn a pair of brown shoes
                    that had belonged to Mr Loh after the attack, as the “place was
                    bloody”, and that he had taken the shoes from a shoe rack located behind
                    the front door of the Deceased’s flat.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_44" id="Ftn_44_1"><sup>[note: 44]</sup></a></span> The evidence until then had not
                    indicated the presence of the shoe rack in question. However, the presence of
                    the shoe rack was subsequently confirmed by the IO.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_45" id="Ftn_45_1"><sup>[note: 45]</sup></a></span> The shoes in
                    question were disposed of, according to Muhammad, by placing them at the
                    staircase landing on either the 8th or 9th floors of the Deceased’s block
                    (he could not remember exactly which floor).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_46" id="Ftn_46_1"><sup>[note: 46]</sup></a></span> The IO could not conclusively
                    state that the police searched the staircase landings on or between the 8th and
                    9th floors,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_47" id="Ftn_47_1"><sup>[note: 47]</sup></a></span> and this logically explains why the pair of
                    shoes worn by Muhammad during the cleanup after the attack was not recovered.
                    Muhammad’s testimony that he had thrown the knife handle in question into
                    the rubbish chute also solves the mystery as to why no knife handle was found at
                    the crime scene.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_129"></a>129    It was established that Muhammad is not
                    particularly bright. In his report dated 13 February 2008,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_48" id="Ftn_48_1"><sup>[note: 48]</sup></a></span> Dr Sathyadevan
                    stated that Muhammad has an IQ of 76.Yet it was not suggested by his counsel or
                    counsel for Ismil that his confessions were likely to be false confessions due
                    to his low IQ. We see no reason to come to such a conclusion, especially given
                    that the factors above corroborate and point to the truth of the confessions of
                    sole involvement by Muhammad. His ability to recollect striking details of the
                    incident is pertinent. Further, unlike Ismil (see below at <a href="#p1_166">[166]</a>, <a href="#p1_167">[167]</a>
                    and <a href="#p1_173">[173]</a>) there is no reason to conclude
                    that he has a particularly malleable personality.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Muhammad’s other statements</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_130"></a>130    As for the other statements (<em>ie</em>, the statements other than those confessing to sole
                    involvement) provided by Muhammad, little weight, if any, in our view, ought to
                    be accorded to them. Those statements were contradicted in a material way in
                    that they stated that Ismil was the assailant while Muhammad was there merely to
                    commit robbery. That was inconsistent with Muhammad’s position in court
                    and in the statement of September 2007, where he confessed to being the sole
                    offender. Muhammad’s explanation for the inconsistency was that the
                    initial statements were fabrications. He stated that certain parts were his
                    concoctions, while other parts were embellishments as the recording officers had
                    suggested to him what he should say in response to their questions. The
                    Prosecution, in view of the stance that it has now taken on Muhammad’s
                    sole responsibility for the killing, has to accept that it is unsafe to place
                    any weight whatsoever on these statements.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The defence of diminished responsibility </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_131"></a>131    Counsel for Muhammad has submitted that
                    Muhammad is entitled to rely on the defence of diminished responsibility. The
                    defence of diminished responsibility is set out in Exception 7 to
                    s 300 of the Penal Code as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Culpable homicide is not murder if the offender was suffering from such
                        abnormality of mind (whether arising from a condition of arrested or
                        retarded development of mind or any inherent causes or induced by disease or
                        injury) as substantially impaired his mental responsibility for his acts and
                        omissions in causing the death or being a party to causing the death.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_132"></a>132    In <em>Ong Pang Siew v Public
                        Prosecutor</em> [2011] 1 SLR 606 (“<em>Ong
                        Pang Siew</em>”), this court elaborated that to establish the
                    defence of diminished responsibility, three elements have to be established on a
                    balance of probabilities (at [58]):</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_132-p2_a"></a>(a)     The appellant must have been
                        suffering from an abnormality of mind;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_132-p2_b"></a>(b)     Such abnormality of mind must have:</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_132-p2_b-p3_i"></a>(i)       arisen from a condition of
                            arrested or retarded development of mind; or</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_132-p2_b-p3_ii"></a>(ii)       arisen from any inherent
                            causes; or</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_132-p2_b-p3_iii"></a>(iii)       been induced by disease or injury;
                        and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_132-p2_c"></a>(c)     Such abnormality of mind as in (b)(i) to (b)(iii) must have substantially
                        impaired the appellant's mental responsibility for his acts and omissions in
                        causing the death or being a party to causing the
                death.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_133"></a>133    As to what constitutes an
                    “abnormality of mind”, this court in <em>Ong Pang
                        Siew</em> agreed (at [61])
                    with the English Court of Appeal’s observations in <em>Regina v Byrne</em> [1960] 2 QB 396 at 403 that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">‘Abnormality of mind,’ ... means a state of mind so different
                        from that of ordinary human beings that the reasonable man would term it
                        abnormal. It appears to us to be wide enough to cover the mind's activities
                        in all its aspects, not only the perception of physical acts and matters,
                        and the ability to form a rational judgment as to whether an act is right or
                        wrong, but also the ability to exercise the will power to control physical
                        acts in accordance with that rational judgment.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_134"></a>134    On the evidence before the Judge, it was
                    clear that Muhammad did not suffer from an abnormality of mind. Dr Fones,
                    who testified on behalf of Muhammad, stated in his report that it was likely
                    that Muhammad was suffering from an abnormality of mind at the material time due
                    to the effects of Dormicum.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_49" id="Ftn_49_1"><sup>[note: 49]</sup></a></span> Dormicum had made
                    Muhammad so bold that he decided to rob and subsequently inflict the numerous
                    wounds on the Deceased. This abnormality of mind, caused by Dormicum,
                    substantially impaired his responsibility for the killing. In his testimony,
                    Dr Fones stressed the nature and extent of the injuries caused as
                    indicating the impairment of Muhammad’s judgment. Dr Sathyadevan
                    vigorously disagreed with Dr Fones’ evidence. He was of the view that
                    Muhammad was in control of his mental faculties and actions and did not suffer
                    from an abnormality of mind.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_50" id="Ftn_50_1"><sup>[note: 50]</sup></a></span> In his view, being
                    high on Dormicum would not amount to an abnormality of mind unless there were
                    psychiatric complications such as paradoxical rage or confusion, which Muhammad
                    did not experience. Additionally, Muhammad had not taken an unusual quantity of
                    Dormicum that morning.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_51" id="Ftn_51_1"><sup>[note: 51]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_135"></a>135    We see no reason to differ from the
                    Judge’s assessment of Muhammad’s state of mind at the material time
                    (see [521]–[524] of the Judgment). Dr Fones, in his report, was
                    unable to satisfactorily establish that Muhammad was suffering from an
                    abnormality of mind. Rather, he was only able to state that<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_52" id="Ftn_52_1"><sup>[note: 52]</sup></a></span>:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[it] is ... <em>conceivable</em> that [Muhammad] was
                        suffering from such abnormality of mind at the time of the offence, due to
                        the effects of Dormicum, in that it substantially impaired his
                        responsibility for his actions in causing the death of his victim. [emphasis
                        added].</p>
<p class="Judg-1">When cross-examined on this, Dr Fones acknowledged that the term
                    “conceivable” was used by him because of
                    “limitations” in the evidence.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_53" id="Ftn_53_1"><sup>[note: 53]</sup></a></span> Indeed, Dr Fones
                    subsequently conceded that “some of [his opinion was]
                        speculative”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_54" id="Ftn_54_1"><sup>[note: 54]</sup></a></span> As such, we agree with the Judge’s
                    non-acceptance of Dr Fones’ evidence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_136"></a>136    The conduct of Muhammad after attacking the
                    Deceased also indicates that he was firmly in control of his mental faculties
                    and was able to think and act rationally. According to the statement of
                    September 2007, after the attack, Muhammad grabbed a bucket of water and poured
                    it over the kitchen floor, and wiped the chopper. During this cleanup he wore
                    Mr Loh’s shoes (see <a href="#p1_128">[128]</a>
                    above), presumably to avoid leaving a footprint. He then disposed of the shoes
                    by placing them on the staircase landing between the 8th and 9th floor. When he
                    returned to his flat, he washed his hands, legs and face and then changed his
                    clothing. In our view, all these steps to conceal his role in the killing
                    cumulatively suggest clarity of thought and that a rational mind was at work,
                    and further support the conclusion that he was not suffering from an abnormality
                    of mind.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Conclusion on Muhammad’s conviction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_137"></a>137    Having reviewed the statement of September
                    2007, Muhammad’s testimony in court, and all other relevant facts and
                    circumstances, we are satisfied that the case against him for murder of the
                    Deceased was proven beyond reasonable doubt and that he should not be allowed to
                    avail himself of the defence of diminished responsibility.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Ismil’s conviction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_138"></a>138    In relation to Ismil, the only evidence
                    against him (apart from the evidence of Muhammad which we earlier described as
                    unsafe (see <a href="#p1_130">[130]</a> above)) is found in the
                    statements that he gave to the police. His conviction therefore pivots on the
                    admissibility of and weight to be attached to his statements (if they are held
                    to be admissible). We turn first to the issue of admissibility, starting with
                    the admissibility of the initial statements provided by Ismil that were recorded
                    by SSI Zainal.</p>

<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Admissibility of the initial statements</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">Non-compliance with s 121 of the CPC</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_139"></a>139    There was, in our view, clearly a failure on
                    the part of the police to comply with s 121 of the CPC in relation to the
                    first statement of Ismil recorded by SSI Zainal on 7 May 2005 in the
                    police car (which will be referred to hereafter as “the police car
                    statement” for convenience) and the second statement of Ismil recorded by
                    SSI Zainal on 7 May 2005 at JWNPC (which will be referred to hereafter
                    as “the JWNPC statement” for convenience). The two statements were
                    described by the Prosecution in its written submissions after the
                    trials-within-a-trial before the High Court as “[o]ral statement[s]
                    reduced into writing under Section 121 of [the CPC]”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_140"></a>140    The recording of the police car statement
                    and the JWNPC statement contravened s 121(3) of the CPC in that both
                    statements were not read back to Ismil, he was not given the opportunity to
                    correct either statement, and both statements were not signed by him. It seems
                    to us that the police car statement and the JWNPC statement were obtained in
                    deliberate non-compliance with the procedural requirements of s 121(3)
                    rather than mere carelessness or operational necessity. The Prosecution has not
                    been able to give any plausible (let alone persuasive) reason as to why
                    SSI Zainal, a seasoned investigator with some 28 years of experience,
                    failed to observe the basic requirements of s 121(3).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">Non-compliance with the Police General Orders</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_141"></a>141    There were also breaches of the Police
                    General Orders in the recording of the police car statement and the JWNPC
                    statement. Here, we should mention that the Judge did not have sight of the
                    relevant extracts from the Police General Orders. They were only produced to us
                    after we indicated that it was a crucial document for us to consider in
                    evaluating whether a breach had taken place and what the consequences ought to
                    be in such an event.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_142"></a>142    The relevant provisions of the Police
                    General Orders may be found in “PGO A18”, which sets out the
                    procedures for the issue, use and maintenance of pocket books. The Prosecution,
                    in response to our query, expressed its acceptance that the provisions in
                    PGO A18 apply equally to both field diaries and pocket books. Field
                    diaries, it was explained, serve the precise same function as that served by
                    pocket books and are carried by investigative officers in lieu of pocket
                        books.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_55" id="Ftn_55_1"><sup>[note: 55]</sup></a></span> For completeness, we
                    should point out that the maintenance of field diaries was governed by
                    s 127 of the CPC (now s 19 of the CPC 2010). While the accused
                    has no right to call for or inspect a field diary, the court’s powers have
                    not been similarly circumscribed. To summarise the relevant parts of
                    PGO A18 (for ease of reference PGO A18 is reproduced in full as an
                    Appendix to this Judgment):</p>

                        following:</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_142-p2_h-p3_i"></a>(i)       all entries are to be

                            legible, and the cancellation must be initialled and dated in
                            ink;</p>

                            purpose.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_143"></a>143    SSI Zainal did not record the initial
                    statement in his pocket book or field diary. Rather he recorded it on a slip of
                    paper, as he claimed not to have his field diary with him. As an aside, it is
                    not clear why even if he did not have a field diary he was not carrying a pocket
                    book. The relevant entry was not transferred to the field diary until much later
                    in the day, after lunch, contrary to Order 12. This is clearly
                    unacceptable. It would not have taken long for SSI Zainal to record the
                    entry in his field diary upon arriving at JWNPC, or at the very least prior to
                    lunch rather than after lunch. It also seems rather curious that such a crucial
                    statement allegedly made by Ismil in relation to a capital case would not be
                    properly recorded immediately thereafter, given that in all probability the
                    statement would subsequently be relied upon by the Prosecution at trial. It is
                    also not clear why the other officers who were with SSI Zainal could not
                    have recorded the “confession” made by Ismil immediately in their
                    field diaries or pocket books if told about this by SSI Zainal. If he did
                    not disclose this to them contemporaneously, this of course raises other issues.
                    Pertinently, Assistant Superintendent Ng Poh Lai (“ASP Ng”)
                    (who was standing outside the police car while SSI Zainal was questioning
                    Ismil) claimed that while SSI Zainal had in fact told him that Ismil had
                    admitted to “stabbing” the Deceased, he (ASP Ng) had
                    “misplaced” his field diary which covered the relevant
                        period.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_56" id="Ftn_56_1"><sup>[note: 56]</sup></a></span> We also remain puzzled as to why
                    SSI Zainal asked the other officers to leave Ismil and him alone in the car
                    before he managed to obtain the police car statement from Ismil (see <a href="#p1_15">[15]</a> above).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_144"></a>144    The JWNPC statement was likewise not
                    recorded by SSI Zainal in his pocket book or field diary during or
                    immediately after it was provided, and it was only recorded in his field diary
                    after lunch. The police car statement, as well as the JWNPC statement, was also
                    not read back to Ismil. He was not given the chance to correct either statement,
                    nor was he given the chance to initial the pages on which the statements were
                    recorded, contrary to Order 10. As it was extremely likely that the police
                    car statement and the JWNPC statement would be the subject of legal proceedings,
                    SSI Zainal was required, pursuant to Order 13, to submit the field
                    diary to his supervisor for endorsement. It is not clear whether SSI Zainal
                    had complied with Order 13, or whether his supervisor had complied with
                    Order 14 in signing and dating the field diary during endorsement. If this
                    was done immediately after the entry was made, it would have been additional
                    verification of the date and time of the entry.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_145"></a>145    It is clear that the provisions of the
                    Police General Orders that deal with punctilious maintenance of pocket books and
                    field diaries (see <a href="#p1_142">[142]</a> above) are meant
                    to ensure reliability in the records kept by police officers. The fact that many
                    of these provisions were breached obviously must raise some awkward question
                    marks in this matter. There were no particular exigencies that could explain the
                    rather flagrant breaches. SSI Zainal’s explanation for not carrying
                    his field diary with him on the morning of 7 May 2005 was this – as
                    he was just assisting in the investigations of the case, and was not the
                    investigating officer, there was no need for him to bring the field diary out to
                    the field with him.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_57" id="Ftn_57_1"><sup>[note: 57]</sup></a></span> As for why he did not have Ismil sign off on
                    the statements that he had provided, SSI Zainal’s explanation was
                    that he wanted to refer Ismil to another officer to record a proper statement.
                    SSI Zainal attempted to justify the delay in recording the statements in
                    his field diary by claiming that after bringing Ismil to JWNPC and interviewing
                    him further, he went out for lunch before returning to his office at the Police
                    Cantonment Complex. As his field diary was in his office, it was only then that
                    he made the relevant entries in his field diary. Given the profound implications
                    of Ismil’s purported confession, we are far from convinced that this is a
                    satisfactory explanation.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">Our view on the admissibility of the initial statements</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_146"></a>146    In our view, the breaches of s 121 of
                    the CPC and the Police General Orders are serious enough to compromise in a
                    material way the reliability of the police car statement and the JWNPC
                    statement. Having regard to all the circumstances, it is not apparent to us that
                    the probative value of the two statements can be said to exceed the prejudicial
                    effect of the statements against their maker. It could, perhaps, be said that
                    this is more so in respect to the police car statement, as there was a major
                    discrepancy between the contents of the piece of paper on which SSI Zainal
                    recorded the statement and the field diary entry made based on the contents of
                    the paper. On the piece of paper, it was stated that Ismil remembered
                        “<em>slashing</em> an old f/Chinese on Fri
                    morning” [emphasis added]. However, in the field diary entry made later
                    that day, the description changes materially in that it is stated that Ismil
                    “had <em>stabbed</em> an old F/Chinese lady”
                    [emphasis added]. When cross-examined by counsel for Ismil, SSI Zainal
                    admitted that he was aware that a slash is different from a stab.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_58" id="Ftn_58_1"><sup>[note: 58]</sup></a></span> When
                    re-examined, he admitted that the use of the word “slash” would be
                        “inaccurate”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_59" id="Ftn_59_1"><sup>[note: 59]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_147"></a>147    For the above reasons, we find that both
                    statements should have been found inadmissible under the exclusionary
                    discretion. The burden was on the Prosecution to convince the court that the
                    probative value of each of the two statements, which had been compromised by the
                    manifest irregularities that took place when each of them was supposedly
                    recorded, was higher than their prejudicial effect against their maker. As the
                    breaches of the CPC and the Police General Orders also appeared to be
                    deliberate, the explanation given needed to be especially cogent (see <a href="#p1_61">[61]</a>–<a href="#p1_62">[62]</a> above). The Prosecution has been unable to discharge this
                    burden.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Admissibility of subsequent statements</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_148"></a>148    The remaining ten statements provided by
                    Ismil were essentially a repetition of facts already known to the investigators.
                    The statements were also obtained after the investigators had already allegedly
                    obtained two confessions from Ismil, <em>ie</em>, in the
                    police car statement and the JWNPC statement, in circumstances that can be
                    described as troubling, to say the least. Ismil abruptly changed the narrative
                    in his final two statements (recorded on 3 June 2005 and 9 June 2005)
                    by alleging that Muhammad was present at the scene of the crime too. However,
                    this change in narrative coincided with the investigators unexpectedly
                    uncovering evidence suggesting that Muhammad was at the scene of the crime, as
                    well as after obtaining statements from Muhammad confessing to his presence at
                    the scene of the crime. The change in narrative of Ismil’s statements
                    corresponded entirely to the new information found by the
                investigators.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_149"></a>149    Earlier (at <a href="#p1_71">[71]</a>), we mentioned that a measure of caution ought to be
                    exercised where a subsequent statement contains similar content to an earlier
                    statement that has been excluded. In our view, the possibility that it may not
                    have been clear to Ismil that he could have departed from the first two
                    statements he provided cannot be dismissed easily. On the facts and
                    circumstances, it is plausible that the fear of departing from the contents of
                    the first two statements acted as an inducement or threat on Ismil so as to make
                    his subsequent statements involuntary. In forming this view we also take into
                    account his vulnerable mental state (see <a href="#p1_160">[160]</a>–<a href="#p1_165">[165]</a> below).
                    The fact that his final two statements contained information that had
                    conveniently just been independently discovered by the investigators renders the
                    voluntariness of those statements even more doubtful. There is, however, no need
                    for us to come to a firm conclusion in this regard, as for the reasons that
                    follow, it is our view that little weight, if any, ought to have been attached
                    to any of Ismil’s statements.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The reliability of the statements made by Ismil</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_150"></a>150    As stated earlier (at <a href="#p1_73">[73]</a>–<a href="#p1_75">[75]</a> above), the court should be careful to test the veracity of
                    a statement that has been admitted into evidence but whose contents are disputed
                    on an ongoing basis throughout the trial. This is especially so in the context
                    of retracted confessions, and in particular, retracted confessions that are
                    entirely uncorroborated by objective evidence. The confessions provided by Ismil
                    were uncorroborated, retracted confessions. No objective evidence was produced
                    to corroborate the truth of the confessions. The truth of the confessions ought
                    to have been tested on an ongoing basis throughout the trial. In our view, even
                    if the statements provided by Ismil had been admissible, the following factors
                    create real doubt as to their reliability.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Inconsistencies with Mr Loh’s statements</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_151"></a>151    Had Ismil been at the Deceased’s flat
                    that fateful day, it is likely that Mr Loh would have seen him. Mr Loh
                    was present during the attack, and would have disclosed to the investigators if
                    there had been more than one intruder present. However, he maintained
                    throughout, in all his statements on 7 May 2005, 12 May 2005 and
                    5 September 2005, that there was just one intruder. In his statement of
                    5 September 2005 (see <a href="#p1_25">[25]</a> above),
                    Mr Loh stated:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">There was nobody outside the house when my wife went to chase the cats. 2
                        minutes after my wife was outside the house, I saw a thief came into my
                        house. The thief is a man. He was wearing a brown cap and a dark red
                        shirt.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_152"></a>152    It emerged on the penultimate day of the
                    trial <em>ie</em>, 8 May 2008 that Mr Loh had
                    provided an even earlier statement to SSI Lai Chun Hoong
                    (“SSI Lai”) on 7 May 2005. The fact that this statement
                    and the statements of 12 May 2005 and 5 September 2005 were not disclosed
                    in good time troubles us. Why did not the Prosecution disclose these documents
                    in good time? SSI Lai revealed that he had taken a statement from
                    Mr Loh on 7 May 2005,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_60" id="Ftn_60_1"><sup>[note: 60]</sup></a></span> with assistance from his niece. The
                    statement reads:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… In the present [<em>sic</em>] of Loh Siew
                        Kow’s niece, Yong Sook Chee, F/28 yrs of Blk 428 Woodlands St 41,
                        #08-230, [I] interview[ed] the witness.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Mr Loh informed that at about 8.10 am, his wife (deceased)
                        opened the gate to chase away the cats. While lying on his bed in room
                        nearer to the kitchen, he saw a male Malay look like drug addict came into
                        his house.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The male malay entered the kitchen. He heard his wife shouting for help.
                        Thereafter he heard nothing from his wife.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The male malay then came to him. He was holding a chopper and came near me
                        and put his other hand on my throat. After a while, the male Malay opened
                        the door and left the house. Mr Loh could remembered [<em>sic</em>] the description of the male Malay. Wearing Cap,
                        Dark complexion, Skinny built, about 1.58 m tall, wearing shirt wif
                            [<em>sic</em>] 2 pockets.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Mr Loh also revealed that 2 days ago the same male Malay came to his
                        house to offer him cake but was turned away by his wife ...</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_153"></a>153    The Judge and the Prosecution were of the
                    view that Mr Loh may not have seen the alleged accomplice due to his restricted
                    view. The Judge concluded (see the Judgment at [478]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It was unlikely that Mr Loh would have been able to keep his head
                        constantly turned to the right and his eyes constantly looking upwards.
                        Therefore, he could have missed seeing someone else in the Deceased’s
                        flat.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The Prosecution submitted, similarly, that Mr Loh may not have
                    fully seen what took place as he may not have had an unobstructed view of the
                    living room:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_61" id="Ftn_61_1"><sup>[note: 61]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Counsel for Ismil sought to rely on 4 photographs taken inside the
                        [D]eceased’s flat (#05-156, Blk 185 Boon Lay Avenue) to show that
                        [Mr] Loh, when lying on his nursing bed with his head on the pillow
                        … would have a clear unobstructed view of the living room, the main
                        entrance of the flat and outside the main entrance of the flat. However, it
                        must be emphasised that this simulation exercise is seriously undermined by
                        the fact that the entire flat was completely bare when the photographs were
                        taken. More importantly, the impression of unobstructed line of vision is
                        misleading as the photographs were taken at a straight line point of view
                        where [Mr] Loh’s head is assumed to have been. A more accurate
                        depiction would be for the photograph to be taken in a lying position on the
                        nursing bed and tilted backwards. There are also uncertainties about the
                        manner in which the nursing bed was aligned as different alignments would
                        give result in different lines of vision.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_154"></a>154    In our view, it is plain that Mr Loh
                        <em>did</em> have a clear view of the door and entrance
                    to the flat from his bed, and would not have missed seeing someone. First, the
                    statements given by Mr Loh indicate that he was able to see persons
                    standing outside the flat. In his statements of 7 May 2005 and
                    5 September 2005, he described having seen the assailant previously, when
                    the assailant came to offer the Deceased food outside the flat, and that the
                    Deceased turned him away. He must have had an unobstructed view of the entrance
                    to the flat in order to have been able to observe the assailant offering the
                    Deceased food. Secondly, Mr Loh’s unobstructed view was confirmed by
                    Catherine, who testified that Mr Loh was able to see her standing outside
                    the flat from his bed when she first arrived on 6 May 2005.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_62" id="Ftn_62_1"><sup>[note: 62]</sup></a></span> Thirdly, the
                    IO testified that Mr Loh did have a good view of the main door and would
                    have seen anyone entering or leaving the flat:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_63" id="Ftn_63_1"><sup>[note: 63]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">Q:</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">[W]ould you agree that from Mr Loh’s bed
                            and from where he was lying on his bed, he had a good view of the main
                            door---main door to the flat?</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">A:</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">Yes, your Honour.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">Q:</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">So he would have seen anyone entering the flat, you

<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">A:</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">Yes, your Honour.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_155"></a>155    Fourthly, the IO, after he was recalled, on
                    being referred to photographs taken from the proximity of Mr Loh’s
                    bed again confirmed that there was an unobstructed view of the main door from
                    the bed.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_64" id="Ftn_64_1"><sup>[note: 64]</sup></a></span> Additionally, the statements given by
                    Mr Loh indicate that he was alert and acutely aware of what was going on
                    during the attack. In his statement of 7 May 2005, Mr Loh described
                    hearing the Deceased shouting for help, and thereafter hearing nothing from her.
                    He recounted in riveting detail seeing the assailant come into his room with the
                    chopper. He was able to recognise the assailant as the same person who came to
                    his house two days before the attack to offer the Deceased cakes. In his
                    statement of 5 September 2005, Mr Loh described the clothes the
                    assailant was wearing. He also stated that the assailant came with a male Malay
                    to his flat a few days prior to the incident. He saw the male Malay offer his
                    wife some food outside his house, but his wife did not accept the offer. In both
                    statements, he described the assailant coming into the flat at about 8.10am, a
                    time which he specifically noted from the clock that was hung on the wall in
                    front of his room. He further noted the time when the Deceased shouted for help
                    (at about 8.20am) after the assailant entered the flat. There was <em>no issue as to Mr Loh’s mental faculties at the time the
                        statements were recorded</em>. Dr Ngui, for one, testified that
                    when he saw Mr Loh on 5 September 2005, he found him <em>fit to testify in court</em> (see <a href="#p1_26">[26]</a> above).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_156"></a>156    It is a matter of profound significance that
                    there are troubling differences between the statements made by Ismil and those
                    made by Mr Loh. Yet, it appears that the investigators made no serious
                    attempt to clarify these differences with Mr Loh between 7 May 2005
                    and 5 September 2005 when his second statement was obtained from him.
                    Instead of attempting to assess the veracity of Ismil’s
                    “confessions” they were apparently content to sit back. The IO
                    acknowledged that he did not ask Mr Loh if it was possible that there was
                    someone else in the flat during the commission of the crime:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_65" id="Ftn_65_1"><sup>[note: 65]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<em>I did not specifically ask Mr Loh whether he was
                            sure that there was only one person he saw in his flat on 6 May
                            2005</em>. Those are my---though my investigation revealed there
                        [were] two persons, and I have two accused persons with me at the time,

                            not see the other persons. I did not ask him these questions</em>.
                        [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_157"></a>157    When questioned, during cross-examination,
                    as to why he did not ask Mr Loh on 5 September 2005 if it was possible
                    that there was somebody else in the flat, the IO’s unsatisfactory response
                    was that Mr Loh was very traumatised and shocked, and could not speak very
                    well. This was despite that the fact that by 5 September 2005, the
                    investigations had already revealed that there was a possibility of two persons
                    being involved and two persons had already been remanded on the suspicion of
                    having been involved in the murder.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_66" id="Ftn_66_1"><sup>[note: 66]</sup></a></span> Even if Mr Loh was
                    traumatised for a period after the incident, this was not true as of
                    5 September 2005, as Mr Loh was certified medically fit (see <a href="#p1_26">[26]</a> above). In our view, the investigators ought
                    to have diligently clarified this grave discrepancy in the number of intruders
                    that Mr Loh saw and the number of accused that they suspected were involved
                    in the crime.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_158"></a>158    Other than the number of intruders, there
                    were several other material discrepancies between the contents of Ismil’s
                    statements and what Mr Loh observed (as recorded in his statements). These
                    ought to have been obvious to the investigators. In his statements, Mr Loh
                    stated that the assailant entered the flat at around 8.10am. Ismil, however,
                    stated that the attack took place at around 10.00am. Secondly, Mr Loh
                    stated, in his statement of 5 September 2005, that he heard the assailant
                    shout “shut up” twice in English. In his statements, Ismil stated
                    that he communicated with the Deceased in Malay, and there was no mention of him
                    shouting “shut up” twice in English. In his statement of
                    5 September 2005, Mr Loh stated that the assailant came into his
                    bedroom after attacking the Deceased, and squeezed his neck for about five
                    minutes. When he let go, he placed a chopper on Mr Loh’s neck. The
                    assailant then removed the knife, and pulled away the feeding tube that had been
                    inserted in Mr Loh’s nose. This striking account is missing from the
                    statements provided by Ismil. These material inconsistencies would reduce the
                    apparent reliability of Ismil’s statements significantly, were they held
                    admissible. These material differences between Ismil’s statements and
                    Mr Loh’s statements were not addressed by the Judge in his assessment
                    of the reliability of Ismil’s statements.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Confession of sole involvement by Muhammad</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_159"></a>159    Muhammad apparently had disclosed his sole
                    involvement in the crime to his family members, his former counsel and fellow
                    inmates (see <a href="#p1_123">[123]</a>–<a href="#p1_124">[124]</a> above). The Judge was of the view that this
                    was a “contrived plan” to save Ismil (see the Judgment at
                    [467]–[474]). For reasons that we have already enunciated (see <a href="#p1_125">[125]</a>–<a href="#p1_129">[129]</a> above), we are unable to agree with this. The testimony of
                    Muhammad’s former counsel, family members and fellow inmates is consistent
                    with the weight of the evidence. The confession of sole involvement by Muhammad,
                    which we have accepted as reliable and true, not only leads to the conclusion
                    that Muhammad was the sole intruder, but also that the confessions by Ismil were
                    palpably false.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Physical condition of Ismil on the morning of 7 May
                2005</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_160"></a>160    Ismil was in a decidedly vulnerable physical
                    and mental state – appearing to be weak and under the influence of drugs
                    – on the morning of 7 May 2005, the day after his arrest for theft. A
                    police officer testified that Ismil was limping and appeared tired earlier that
                    morning at around 4.50am.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_67" id="Ftn_67_1"><sup>[note: 67]</sup></a></span> Another officer,
                    Inspector Steven Wee Chee Keong (“Insp Wee”), observed Ismil
                    having bloodshot eyes and slurred speech and appearing tired and restless that
                    morning when the officer was with him from 5.55am to 7.30am. Insp Wee thought
                    that this could be an indication that Ismil was under the influence of
                        drugs.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_68" id="Ftn_68_1"><sup>[note: 68]</sup></a></span> Yet another officer stated that
                    Insp Wee had told him at a briefing at 9.00am on 7 May 2005 that Ismil
                    appeared “high”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_69" id="Ftn_69_1"><sup>[note: 69]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_161"></a>161    Ismil testified that he was feeling unwell
                    on 7 May 2005. His “body felt very cold and as though [he] was going
                    to fall sick, that is, sickness in relation to drug consumption”. He went
                    on to elaborate that he felt withdrawal symptoms, his bones and joints were
                    aching, and he felt like vomiting. Additionally, he wore only a pair of shorts
                    and T-shirt and the air-conditioning was very cold.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_70" id="Ftn_70_1"><sup>[note: 70]</sup></a></span>
                    Later in the day, when he was being questioned at JWNPC, he told the officers
                    that he was feeling sick, cold and confused.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_71" id="Ftn_71_1"><sup>[note: 71]</sup></a></span> Dr Winslow testified that
                    the worst withdrawal symptoms are generally experienced the day after cessation
                    of Dormicum. The addict may continue to feel weak or experience cravings for the
                    drug for up to two weeks or more after cessation.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_72" id="Ftn_72_1"><sup>[note: 72]</sup></a></span> As Ismil had last consumed
                    Dormicum prior to his arrest on 6 May 2005, the withdrawal symptoms he was
                    experiencing would have been worst on 7 May 2005. He was therefore quite
                    plainly vulnerable when he was being interrogated on 7 May
                2005.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_162"></a>162    In his report dated 18 March 2008 (see
                        <a href="#p1_32">[32]</a> above), Dr Ung notes (at
                    para 44): “I concur with [Dr Phang’s] and
                    [Dr Winslow’s] opinion that Ismil is at least a moderate and possibly
                    heavy drug abuser”. In our view, upon noticing that Ismil was clearly
                    unwell and in some distress, be it due to withdrawal symptoms or other reasons,
                    the investigators ought to have sought medical advice to ascertain whether he
                    was fit for questioning. This, regrettably, was not done.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_163"></a>163    The Judge made a finding of fact that the
                    withdrawal symptoms experienced by Ismil were mild to, at most, moderate. They
                    were worst in the early morning of 7 May 2005 when he was observed at
                    around 4.55am and “thereafter his condition improved instead of
                    [deteriorated] as alleged” (see the Judgment at [144]). The Judge took into account the fact
                    that at para 14 of Ismil’s statement of 17 May 2005,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_73" id="Ftn_73_1"><sup>[note: 73]</sup></a></span> he stated that he was
                    slightly more sober later in the day on 7 May 2005 when he was interviewed
                    by SSI Zainal at the carpark than when he was observed at around 4.55am.
                    The Judge also noted that in the early morning of 7 May 2005, Ismil was
                    “alert enough to deny any involvement in the murder of the
                    [D]eceased” (see the Judgment at [144]). The Judge came to the conclusion that Ismil had
                    exaggerated his withdrawal symptoms (other than some aches in his bones and
                    joints and feeling cold, which the Judge accepted). He concluded that the
                    symptoms did not affect the voluntariness of the statements given by Ismil (see
                    the Judgment at [144]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_164"></a>164    In our view, there are serious difficulties
                    with these findings. The Judge appears to have concluded that Ismil’s
                    withdrawal symptoms were worst in the early morning of 7 May 2005 and
                    thereafter dramatically improved by the time SSI Zainal interviewed him at
                    11.10am. It should be noted, however, that in his statement of 17 May 2005,
                    Ismil maintained that when he was interviewed at the carpark on 7 May 2005,
                    he was “having a <em>hangover</em> due to the drug
                    that [he] had taken the day before” [emphasis in original].<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_74" id="Ftn_74_1"><sup>[note: 74]</sup></a></span> In our view, the
                    objective facts and the medical evidence did not permit the Judge to determine
                    that he could have miraculously recovered just shortly before the police car
                    statement was made to SSI Zainal. With respect, the inference drawn as to
                    his alertness simply due to his ability to deny involvement in the crime is
                    incorrect. Plainly he was not delirious and could to a degree understand what
                    was happening but that does not mean he was not vulnerable and prone to
                    suggestion under stress (see <a href="#p1_166">[166]</a> below).
                    We also note that the Prosecution’s own witness, Dr Winslow, appeared
                    somewhat uncertain that the withdrawal from drug use did not affect
                    Ismil’s ability to provide the statement (see <a href="#p1_33">[33]</a> above).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_165"></a>165    Further, SSI Zainal conceded that
                    Ismil’s legs were shaking while he was being questioned in the
                        car.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_75" id="Ftn_75_1"><sup>[note: 75]</sup></a></span>
                    This is an indication of the state of physical distress or fear (or both) that
                    Ismil was in while being questioned in dubious circumstances (as described at
                        <a href="#p1_15">[15]</a> above) by SSI Zainal, and is
                    further evidence of his vulnerability that morning.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Ismil’s malleable personality</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_166"></a>166    It is not disputed that Ismil has a low IQ
                    (see <a href="#p1_31">[31]</a> above). Dr Robers stated in
                    his report dated 24 September 2007 (see <a href="#p1_31">[31]</a> above) that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">From the results of the testing, <em>Ismil has weak
                            reasoning and comprehension skills. This is likely to be reflected in
                            poorer judgment and he is apt to become more suggestible and more easily
                            influenced by others when pressured or coerced. He is likely to be prone
                            to be vulnerable to suggestions and manipulations when he is under
                            stress or threat</em>. Although Ismil can perform and remember
                        concrete tasks and information with some adequacy, he experiences difficulty
                        when he has to deal with information, pictures and material related to
                        common everyday occurrences. He is likely to have significant limitations in
                        processing information that are more abstract or complex in nature.
                        [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_167"></a>167    Dr Ung reached a similar conclusion in
                    his report dated 18 March 2008 (see <a href="#p1_32">[32]</a> above). Dr Ung stated (at para 41):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Ismil’s confessions conform to <b>coerced-compliant
                            false confession</b>, the characteristics of which are described
                        below. Both internal factors (factors related to the individual such as drug
                        withdrawal, mental illness, low intelligence and personality factors such as
                        low assertiveness) and external factors (such as the nature of the
                        interrogation) contribute to increase the likelihood of a false confession.
                        [emphasis in original]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Dr Ung summed up his report as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">66.    External interrogative factors such as <b>exaggeration of the evidence</b> available, the
                                <b>threatened consequences</b> to Ismil by
                            ‘not signing’ and <b>inducements of
                                leniency</b> for confession is likely to have added to
                            Ismil’s likelihood of false confession.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">67.    The constellation of these internal and external
                            factors would synergistically interact to magnify the risks of a false
                            confession.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">68.    Ismil’s confession would conform to a
                                <b>coerced-compliant false confession</b>.
                            His main motive for doing so was to alleviate and minimize his
                            distress.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">69.    
              <em>Ismil’s highly selective
                                memory gaps in his statements given to the Police are unlikely to be
                                a consequence of anterogate amnesia related to Benzodiazepine use or
                                withdrawal. These would be consistent that he made up a story based
                                on what information and cues he obtained from the Police. In the
                                absence of such cues and information, he would usually claim that
                                “he could not remember</em>.”</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">70.    His behaviour at being confronted after trying to
                            sell the two stolen handphones after the alleged murder is consistent
                            with his assertions of innocence.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">71.    
              <em>The presence of</em>
<b><em>incontrovertible forensic evidence</em></b>
<em>would seriously detract from Ismil’s claims of
                                innocence and the possibility of a false confession. Conversely, the
                                absence of any such incontrovertible forensic evidence would lend
                                credence to his account of providing a false
                            confession</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">72.    Having considered Ismil’s case carefully in
                            the context of the available information and scientific/medical opinion,
                            I would caution against undue reliance being placed upon his confession
                            as there is a <b>significant likelihood that his
                                confession is false</b>.</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_168"></a>168    Although Dr Phang gave rebuttal
                    evidence, we note that he examined Ismil much earlier on 15, 17 and 21 June
                    2005 purely for the limited purpose of ascertaining his fitness to
                        plead,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_76" id="Ftn_76_1"><sup>[note: 76]</sup></a></span> rather than examining if he was prone to
                    suggestion and was weak-willed. Dr Phang did not subsequently conduct
                    interviews specifically to examine if Ismil was vulnerable to suggestion due to
                    his low IQ, and the likelihood of his confessions being false. Dr Phang was
                    first told by the Prosecution that he needed to testify in court with regard to
                    the issue of false confessions (rather than just fitness to plead) a few weeks
                    before his testimony in court, which was on 7 May 2008.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_77" id="Ftn_77_1"><sup>[note: 77]</sup></a></span> It was around
                    that time that he first received the report prepared by Dr Ung, and formed
                    his opinion that there was no likelihood of a false confession on the part of
                    Ismil. This was nearly three years after he had conducted his interviews with
                    Ismil.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_169"></a>169    In his interviews with Dr Phang, Ismil
                    had confessed to being at the scene of the crime at the material time, although
                    he stated that he had killed the Deceased accidentally. This, we now know, is a
                    fundamental untruth as even the Prosecution now agrees that Ismil had nothing to
                    do with the actual killing of the Deceased. The fact that this was repeatedly
                    told to Dr Phang means that the dependability of the examination by
                    Dr Phang and his assessment of the fragility of Ismil’s mental state
                    at all material times had been critically eroded. We also note that in his
                    interviews with Dr Phang, Ismil, even when pressed, could not explain the
                    presence of “2 bloodstained weapons” at the crime scene.
                    Dr Phang’s notes of the interview that was conducted on 21 June
                    2005 reveal the following exchange:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_78" id="Ftn_78_1"><sup>[note: 78]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">SOF states that there were 2 bloodstained weapons – chopper &amp;
                        knife believed to have been used in the attack</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Accused claimed he couldn’t remember – then said one knife
                        (“pisau”) only</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Previously clearly stated that he actually used a knife for cutting
                        “vege”, but now claims “I can’t remember if big
                        one or small one, I also don’t know ... [”]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_170"></a>170    The reliability of Dr Phang’s
                    assessment is also eroded by the fact that he was not aware of crucial aspects
                    of the murder. He testified that when he first examined Ismil, he had no idea
                    what the number of incised wounds were, and became aware of this only during the
                    preliminary inquiry proceedings when he happened to sit outside the courtroom
                    with the pathologist; this was at least six months after he had examined Ismil.
                    That was the first time he realised that there were actually more than one or
                    two stab wounds. The statements given by Ismil to the investigators were only
                    provided to him subsequently.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_79" id="Ftn_79_1"><sup>[note: 79]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_171"></a>171    Dr Phang testified that he conducted
                    his interviews with Ismil in English, with “an occasional smattering of
                        Malay”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_80" id="Ftn_80_1"><sup>[note: 80]</sup></a></span> According to him, there were no difficulties
                    in understanding the accused during the interview process on all three
                    occasions. This testimony is contradicted by the Prosecution’s own
                    witness, Dr Winslow. Dr Winslow testified that he communicated with
                    Ismil in Malay, and that Ismil had difficulty expressing himself purely in
                    English, especially when it came to specific withdrawal symptoms:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_81" id="Ftn_81_1"><sup>[note: 81]</sup></a></span></p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_172"></a>172    Dr Ung, on the other hand, conducted
                    the interviews with the aid of a Malay language interpreter.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_82" id="Ftn_82_1"><sup>[note: 82]</sup></a></span> In his report
                    of 18 March 2008 (see <a href="#p1_32">[32]</a> above), Dr
                    Ung stated that Ismil’s “poor command of English is likely to have
                    hindered a proper and thorough psychiatric evaluation being conducted by
                    … Dr Phang shortly after the alleged murder”. That the
                    interviews were conducted in English without a Malay language interpreter, in
                    our view, reduces the reliability of Dr Phang’s evaluation of Ismil.
                    It should also be noted that Dr Ung, who is a Malaysian and had been
                    educated in the Malay medium for 8 years, stated that he would have
                    “found it very difficult without an interpreter to actually interview
                    [Ismil] in Malay”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_83" id="Ftn_83_1"><sup>[note: 83]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_173"></a>173    As such, we are of the view that the Judge
                    erred in preferring the evidence of Dr Phang over that of Dr Ung. As
                    far as the issue of the likelihood of the confessions being false is concerned,
                    the evidence of Dr Ung with regards to the IQ and personality of Ismil
                    ought to be preferred. It has even been conceded by the Prosecution in
                    submissions before us that very significant aspects of what Ismil repeatedly
                    told the investigators about his role in the killing are false (although the
                    Prosecution now maintains that he did this to protect Muhammad (see <a href="#p1_186">[186]</a>–<a href="#p1_190">[190]</a> below). Interestingly, the Prosecution’s own
                    witness, Dr Winslow, accepts that due to Ismil’s low intelligence
                    level, he would omit to mention key matters even when examined for the purposes
                    of a capital offence trial, and may not have been aware of the consequences of
                    things happening around him:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_84" id="Ftn_84_1"><sup>[note: 84]</sup></a></span></p>

                            examined for purposes of his trial which involves the death

<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">A:</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">When I examined him, er, yes.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1">Dr Winslow also testified that Ismil’s low IQ and
                    general withdrawal symptoms such as impairment of memory, impaired concentration
                    and insomnia all would have had an impact on his mental state.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_85" id="Ftn_85_1"><sup>[note: 85]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Striking changes in details in statements as more facts were
                uncovered</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_174"></a>174    Pertinently, the narrative in the statements
                    provided by Ismil dramatically changed as the investigators uncovered more key
                    facts. Ismil initially claimed sole responsibility for the murder and did not
                    implicate Muhammad. The former provided ten statements between 7 May 2005
                    and 24 May 2005, not one of which made any mention, whatsoever, of
                    Muhammad. Subsequent to the IO receiving confirmation that the DNA of Muhammad
                    was found on the Deceased’s purse (see <a href="#p1_18">[18]</a> above), and after Muhammad had confessed to being at the
                    scene of the crime, the statements provided by Ismil changed in that they stated
                    that he and Muhammad had both agreed to commit robbery, and he (<em>ie</em>, Ismil) had knifed the Deceased in the course of the
                    robbery. Why did Ismil change his narrative and implicate Muhammad, having
                    already provided ten statements without mentioning Muhammad? The Prosecution now
                    says that he had concealed his brother’s role to protect him. The
                    Prosecution, however, was unable to cogently explain why the strength of the
                    fraternal ties was, in this case, so strong that for almost a month he was
                    willing to accept sole responsibility for a capital offence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_175"></a>175    It appears to us that the investigators
                    mistakenly thought that they had an open and shut case against Ismil alone once
                    they obtained the police car statement and the field diary statement. After
                    this, they made little or no attempt to search for objective evidence at the
                    scene of the crime (see <a href="#p1_182">[182]</a>–<a href="#p1_183">[183]</a> below).
                    This state of affairs continued until Dr Syn unexpectedly informed the IO
                    that the DNA trace on the Deceased’s purse belonged to one of his
                    brothers. The investigators then secured Muhammad’s confession that he was
                    present at the flat during the killing but had not participated in the attack of
                    the Deceased. The Prosecution’s evidence as to the change in narrative by
                    Ismil is as follows. Ismil first implicated Muhammad in his statement of
                    3 June 2005,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_86" id="Ftn_86_1"><sup>[note: 86]</sup></a></span>
                    after Muhammad had already confessed to being at the scene of the crime. The
                    statement was given to Assistant Superintendent Bahar Bakar
                    (“ASP Bakar”), although Senior Station Inspector Mazlan
                    bin Shariff (“SSI Mazlan”) was present initially.
                    SSI Mazlan testified that Ismil was told that Muhammad had revealed that he
                        (<em>ie</em>, Muhammad) was present at the scene of the
                    crime, and Ismil was asked for his response.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_87" id="Ftn_87_1"><sup>[note: 87]</sup></a></span> Ismil was not
                    forthcoming initially, before he acknowledged the involvement of Muhammad in the
                    robbery. On the other hand, Ismil’s evidence in this regard is that
                    SSI Mazlan had informed him that Muhammad had implicated him and that he
                    should do something to save Muhammad:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_88" id="Ftn_88_1"><sup>[note: 88]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Mazlan told me that my younger brother had informed him everything from A
                        to Z. Mazlan also had told me to save my younger brother.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_176"></a>176    The Judge held (see the Judgment at
                        [185]) that SSI Mazlan’s
                    evidence “was the more probable of the two”. The Judge reasoned
                    that by 3 June 2005, Ismil had already given various statements which were
                    effectively confessions. The police investigators were not trying to make Ismil
                    implicate himself further, but, rather, were trying to ascertain whether he was
                    going to corroborate Muhammad’s limited involvement in the
                murder.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_177"></a>177    With respect, we disagree. First and
                    foremost, the Judge’s remarks, which were given as part of his reasons for
                    upholding the voluntariness of Ismil’s statements, appear to reveal an
                    application of an incorrect standard <em>vis-à-vis</em> the
                    burden of proof that the Prosecution had to discharge. The standard with respect
                    to the voluntariness of a statement in the context of a trial-within-a-trial is
                    that the Prosecution has to establish the voluntariness of the contested
                    statements beyond reasonable doubt, not on a balance of probabilities. In
                    justifying one explanation as being “more probable” than the
                    other, the Judge appears to have applied the “balance of
                    probabilities” standard rather than the “beyond reasonable
                    doubt” standard. We ought to pause here to also mention that despite the
                    in-depth analysis of the facts and law by the Judge in the Judgment, it is not
                    clear to us after a close reading of the Judgment which standard he had applied
                    in establishing the voluntariness of the series of confessions made by
                    Ismil.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_178"></a>178    Second, the explanation given by the
                    Prosecution cannot withstand closer scrutiny. At the point in time where Ismil
                    acknowledged the involvement of Muhammad, Ismil had already confessed to facts
                    that would have attracted capital punishment. He had nothing to fear from not
                    cooperating with the investigators. If he stuck to his original confession,
                    Muhammad would not have been incriminated at all. Further, there was nothing
                    Muhammad could have said that could have further exacerbated Ismil’s
                    predicament. Why did he not maintain the original version of events if he wanted
                    to protect Muhammad? Why is it that his statements thereafter bore an uncanny
                    resemblance to Muhammad’s? Was it because they were true? But it is common
                    ground now that, at the very least, all of Muhammad’s evidence on his own
                    subsidiary role was false.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Absence of any objective evidence</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_179"></a>179    There is a <em>startling</em> lack of any objective evidence that links Ismil to the
                    attack on the Deceased. It should first be noted that Ismil, unlike Muhammad,
                    was apprehended on the very day of the offence. He had not changed his clothes
                    that day and the investigators later seized other apparel belonging to him from
                    his home. Clippings of his fingernails were also sent for testing. Yet, no
                    bloodstains or DNA traces from the Deceased were found on any of these items
                    (see <a href="#p1_126">[126]</a> above). In contrast, by the time
                    Muhammad was apprehended almost a month later, it was too late to conduct
                    similar tests on his apparel or his fingernails. It is odd that if Ismil was
                    involved in an attack as vicious as the attack on the Deceased, with over 110
                    wounds being inflicted and copious amounts of blood being splattered all over
                    the flat, including the kitchen floor, furniture and the walls and floor of the
                    toilet, no trace of the Deceased’s blood or DNA was found on him or his
                    apparel. There was also evidence that the assailant may have used the wash basin
                    in the kitchen to clean his hands.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_89" id="Ftn_89_1"><sup>[note: 89]</sup></a></span> If some washing up
                    was necessitated as a result of the attack, it would be reasonable to expect
                    some remnants or particles of blood to have been found on Ismil. Even if he was
                    not the assailant surely he would have assisted Muhammad in the washing up if he
                    was present?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_180"></a>180    The investigators also did not report seeing
                    any abrasions or bruises on the hands of Ismil, despite him allegedly wielding a
                    knife and a cleaver and striking the Deceased over 110 times. When Ismil was
                    sent for a pre-statement medical examination at about 6pm on 7 May 2005,
                    the day after the attack, Dr Cheong, who conducted the medical examination,
                    noted in his report dated 21 June 2005 that “[n]o other visible
                    injuries were noted” aside from superficial abrasions on the chin and in
                    front of the right ear, a 1.5cm scab on the right arm, and a 2cm abrasion on the
                    right knee.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_90" id="Ftn_90_1"><sup>[note: 90]</sup></a></span>
                    For completeness, we should add that the Prosecution has not suggested that any
                    of these are connected with the incident.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_181"></a>181    The Prosecution maintains in its further
                    written submissions that even if Ismil is not guilty of murder, he was present
                    in the Deceased’s flat during the commission of the crime, and is guilty
                    of having committed robbery with hurt. There is, however, absolutely no physical
                    evidence of Ismil ever having been present in the Deceased’s flat.
                    Assuming he was present in the Deceased’s flat, what was he doing when
                    Muhammad was attacking the Deceased? It is not disputed that <em>the duration of the incident was about an hour</em>.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_91" id="Ftn_91_1"><sup>[note: 91]</sup></a></span> Only one room,
                    the bedroom adjacent to the one that Mr Loh was in, was ransacked. This was
                    a very small room and a search of it would have taken no more than a few
                    minutes. And Mr Loh only noticed one “thief” despite
                    remaining alert throughout the incident (see <a href="#p1_151">[151]</a>–<a href="#p1_155">[155]</a> above).
                    If there had been a second person in the flat, what would he have been doing for
                    the duration of the attack on the Deceased? Also, why was there no communication
                    at all between the two of them? Mr Loh did not hear anything. Why did the
                    “second person” not assist in the washing up? It seems to us
                        <em>on these facts that the Prosecution’s case theory
                        that there was a second intruder who managed to conceal himself from
                        Mr Loh for about an hour, did not participate in the attack nor
                        cleaning up, and remained silent throughout, is more than
                        farfetched</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_182"></a>182    When queried about the precise steps he took
                    in searching for evidence at the scene of the crime, the IO’s replies
                    revealed a worrying lack of meticulousness in the discharge of his duties. The
                    IO admitted that the following inquires were not carried out:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_92" id="Ftn_92_1"><sup>[note: 92]</sup></a></span></p>

                        where there was an attack episode, despite it being highly likely that while
                        attacking the Deceased, the assailant would have touched the wall at some
                        point;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_182-p2_d"></a>(d)     no

                        despite there being blood and hair on the sink trap, which strongly suggests
                        that the assailant must have used the water tap as he was the only person

                        handle that was likely to been thrown out of the flat by some

                        in the flat; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_182-p2_g"></a>(g)     no search was made by the IO for evidence on any floor of the block
                        other than the 6th floor, and he was unsure if any of his men searched other
                        floors.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_183"></a>183    The IO eventually had no alternative but to
                    acknowledge shortcomings in the investigations in the following exchange with
                    counsel for Ismil:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_93" id="Ftn_93_1"><sup>[note: 93]</sup></a></span></p>

                            totality of the evidence now, especially with the statement of
                            Mr Low, that you should have taken more DNA samples at the scene of
                            crime and lift more fingerprints there?</span></p>

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_184"></a>184    The Prosecution accepted that there is
                    absolutely no objective evidence of Ismil being present. It is trite that where
                    there is doubt, it ought to be resolved in favour of the accused. Surely, in a
                    case where there has been an absence of diligence on the part of the
                    investigators in completing their enquiries, doubts on material issues cannot be
                    resolved in favour of the Prosecution, which bears the burden of establishing
                    their case theory beyond a reasonable doubt. As stated in <em>Eu
                        Lim Hoklai v Public Prosecutor</em> [2011] SGCA 16 at [64]: “<em>... where the
                        court cannot decide with any degree of certainty between alternate case
                        theories, the benefit of the doubt has to be given to the
                    accused</em>” [emphasis in original].</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Our view on the reliability of Ismil’s statements</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_185"></a>185    All of the above considerations, when
                    considered in totality, collectively cast grave unresolved doubts about the
                    reliability of the confessions provided by Ismil. It should be stated that the
                    analysis in relation to the considerations above is distinct from that in
                    relation to non-compliance with the CPC and the Police General Orders. For
                    non-compliance with the CPC and/or the Police General Orders, any statement
                    taken in breach would be inadmissible should its prejudicial effect exceed its
                    probative value (see <a href="#p1_60">[60]</a>–<a href="#p1_61">[61]</a> above). The considerations above, however,
                    when taken in the round, ineluctably lead us to the conclusion that even if the
                    statements were held to be admissible, little weight, if any at all, ought to be
                    placed on them.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Flaws in the Prosecution’s case theory against Ismil</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_186"></a>186    The Prosecution’s case theory against
                    Ismil is that he falsely confessed to committing the murder in order to shield
                    his brother from prosecution. However, there was no question of Muhammad’s
                    involvement at the time of Ismil’s false confession and no objective
                    evidence of Muhammad being at the scene of the crime. Indeed, there was also no
                    evidence at that point of Muhammad being at the scene of the crime or that Ismil
                    was even aware of Muhammad’s involvement. Why would Ismil therefore
                    confess to a crime and link himself to it unnecessarily?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_187"></a>187    It is accepted by the Prosecution that
                    Ismil’s IQ is low (see <a href="#p1_31">[31]</a> above). Is
                    it likely that he would have been able to formulate a plan to shoulder the blame
                    for his brother, all in the span of his first night in remand (since he could
                    not have thought of the need to come up with such a plan until he was arrested
                    and remanded), while he was suffering from the severe effects of drug
                    withdrawal?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_188"></a>188    Furthermore, if Ismil had indeed been
                    present in the flat when the Deceased was attacked, it would seem odd that his
                    “voluntary” account of what transpired that day would be only
                    “skeletal”, as acknowledged by the Prosecution in submissions
                    before us. Counsel for Ismil quite rightly made the following pertinent
                    observation that “it simply is striking that Ismil [(unlike Muhammad)]
                    did not mention any “fact” that was at that time not known to the
                        investigators”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_94" id="Ftn_94_1"><sup>[note: 94]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_189"></a>189    If the confessions were voluntarily made,
                    why were they so lacking in material details unlike Muhammad’s eventual
                    confession? Whenever key details were sought regarding the events that
                    transpired that day, Ismil was unable to provide the same. Crucially, Ismil was
                    unable to state if the Deceased had sustained more than one injury purportedly
                    caused by him, something which he surely would have been able to confirm had he
                    been the assailant:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_95" id="Ftn_95_1"><sup>[note: 95]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">Q61:</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">How many injuries did the [D]eceased
                            sustain?</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">A62:</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">I could not remember.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">Q62:</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">Could she had [<em>sic</em>]
                            sustained more than one injury caused by the knife that you were
                            holding?</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">A62:</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">I cannot answer this question. I cannot remember.
                            I do not know.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_190"></a>190    That the Prosecution conceded in submissions
                    before us that Ismil’s statements were “skeletal” is not
                    surprising. The statements do not account for the use of two weapons, nor for
                    the numerous wounds inflicted on the Deceased, both of which were noted by
                    Dr Lai in his autopsy report (see <a href="#p1_12">[12]</a>
                    above). Has the Prosecution established that Ismil, who has a low IQ and who was
                    plainly in real physical distress immediately after his arrest because of the
                    withdrawal effects arising from his substance abuse problem, was ingenious
                    enough to concoct a narrative that provided the barest of details of what might
                    have transpired in the flat while taking extreme care not to give any details
                    that might implicate the real assailant, his brother? On this score, we note
                    that the Prosecution did not challenge Dr Robers’ evidence that
                    Ismil’s “speed of processing novel information is weak and
                        inefficient”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_96" id="Ftn_96_1"><sup>[note: 96]</sup></a></span>
                    What made Ismil, when he was unwell, precipitately confess his sole involvement
                    to SSI Zainal when they were alone in the car? Why did the statements given
                    by Ismil on 7 May 2005 unerringly echo the key facts then known to the
                    investigators but lack details that only the real assailant would have been
                    aware of? Why did Ismil only later implicate Muhammad? These are troubling
                    questions that seem to point unequivocally towards a series of false confessions
                    procured by questionable means.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Conclusion on Ismil’s conviction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_191"></a>191    As stated earlier (see <a href="#p1_36">[36]</a>–<a href="#p1_38">[38]</a> above), the Prosecution’s position at present is that
                    Ismil is not guilty of murder, but is guilty of robbery with hurt. However, the
                    inadmissibility of certain statements made by Ismil (see <a href="#p1_139">[139]</a>–<a href="#p1_149">[149]</a> above) and the irresolvable doubts as to the reliability
                    of the rest of the statements made by him (assuming they are admissible),
                    coupled with the complete absence of other evidence, means that the Prosecution
                    has failed to even establish that Ismil was present at the flat when the
                    Deceased was killed, let alone that he shared in any common intention to commit
                    robbery. The Prosecution has thus failed to prove that Ismil is guilty of any
                    offence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_192"></a>192    For completeness, it should be added that
                    the approach of the Judge in applying s 34 of the Penal Code to the facts
                    at hand was wrong, having regard to the decision of this court in <em>Daniel Vijay</em> (which, in fairness to the Judge, was
                    released only on 3 September 2010, some seven months after the Judgment was
                    delivered). Section 34 of the Penal Code states:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">When a criminal act is done by several persons, in furtherance of the
                        common intention of all, each of such persons is liable for that act in the
                        same manner as if the act were done by him alone.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The Judge held that s 34 did not require him to make a finding as
                    to who the assailant was (see the Judgment at [498]–[501]). He also found
                    that there was a plan between the Appellants to rob the Deceased, and whether
                    Muhammad or Ismil was the assailant, “each must have known that it was
                    likely that the [D]eceased would have to be killed to avoid any risk of
                    identifying them” (see the Judgment at [504]). The Judge then added that
                    (see the Judgment at [506]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[T]he accomplice of the assailant must also have been aware of the attack
                        on the [D]eceased in view of the small size of the [D]eceased’s flat,
                        the numerous blows inflicted upon the [D]eceased over a prolonged period of
                        time and the presence of blood spatters in the kitchen facing the hall and
                        the presence of her body in the hall.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">For these main reasons, the Judge concluded that the Deceased was
                    killed in furtherance of the common intention to commit robbery and that both
                    the Appellants were jointly liable for murder pursuant to
                s 34.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_193"></a>193    For joint liability under the doctrine of
                    common intention as set out in s 34, it was stated by this court in
                        <em>Daniel Vijay</em> that the common intention of all
                    the offenders must include an intention to commit the very criminal act done by
                    the actual doer which resulted in the offence charged. The conclusion of the
                    Judge was that the Deceased was killed in furtherance of a <em>common intention to commit robbery</em>. Applying <em>Daniel Vijay</em>, such a common intention would not suffice for
                    joint liability for murder to be established, and neither the statements nor any
                    other evidence adduced by the Prosecution establishes that there was any common
                    intention by the Appellants that would suffice (<em>eg</em>, to commit an injury that “is sufficient in the ordinary
                    course of nature to cause death” (see [145], [146] and
                        [167] of <em>Daniel
                        Vijay</em>)).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_194"></a>194    In the result, we dismiss Muhammad’s
                    appeal and substitute Muhammad’s conviction for murder in furtherance of
                    common intention to commit robbery under s 302 read with s 34 of the
                    Penal Code with a conviction for murder under s 302 of the Penal Code. We
                    allow Ismil’s appeal and set aside his conviction. Ismil can be said to be
                    a petty handphone thief and a chronic drug abuser, but the Prosecution has been
                    unable to even begin to establish that he was at the scene of the crime, let
                    alone being a party to the robbery or the killing of the Deceased. We are also
                    constrained to point out that these proceedings have revealed several serious
                    lapses on the part of the investigators who had carriage of this matter (see
                        <a href="#p1_140">[140]</a>, <a href="#p1_143">[143]</a>–<a href="#p1_148">[148]</a>,
                        <a href="#p1_156">[156]</a>–<a href="#p1_157">[157]</a>, <a href="#p1_175">[175]</a> and <a href="#p1_182">[182]</a>–<a href="#p1_183">[183]</a> above). We have raised several unanswered questions in
                    this appeal (see, <em>eg</em>, <a href="#p1_152">[152]</a>, <a href="#p1_179">[179]</a>, <a href="#p1_181">[181]</a>, <a href="#p1_189">[189]</a>
                    and <a href="#p1_190">[190]</a> above as well as <a href="#p1_203">[203]</a> below). One, of course, hopes for one set
                    of answers. One fears, that in reality, there might be another.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Coda on the Prosecution’s conduct of these
                proceedings</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_195"></a>195    Before we end, we have some observations on
                    the Prosecution’s conduct of the case that we feel we should set out in
                    the interests of the administration of justice. To our consternation, three
                    vital items of evidence were not provided to counsel for the Appellants by the
                    Prosecution until very late in the proceedings.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_196"></a>196    The first piece of evidence is
                    Mr Loh’s statement of 5 September 2005. Mr Loh’s
                    statement would have corroborated Ismil’s alibi defence (of being at home
                    at time of the murder).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_97" id="Ftn_97_1"><sup>[note: 97]</sup></a></span> Yet,
                    Mr Loh’s statement was only belatedly made available to counsel for
                    the Appellants on 4 September 2007, two years after it was obtained and 61
                    days into the hearing. By then the IO had already completed giving his
                    evidence-in-chief. When the IO was cross-examined it was revealed that another
                    statement had been recorded from Mr Loh on 12 May 2005 and that this
                    statement was consistent with the statement of 5 September
                2005.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_197"></a>197    What is even more startling is that the
                    third key piece of evidence, Mr Loh’s first statement taken on
                    7 May 2005, was disclosed even later – only on the penultimate day of
                    the trial. On that day, counsel for Ismil was cross-examining SSI Lai, and,
                    during the course of cross-examination, SSI Lai revealed that he had taken
                    a statement from Mr Loh on 7 May 2005. It bears mention that
                    SSI Lai was less than forthcoming initially. He insisted, at first, that
                    Mr Loh could not talk:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_98" id="Ftn_98_1"><sup>[note: 98]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">Q:</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">Okay. What did [Mr Loh] tell

<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">Q:</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">Okay. So he didn’t tell you anything about

<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">A:</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">He’s unable to talk.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1">After some probing cross-examination by counsel, he eventually
                    disclosed that he had recorded a statement in his diary from Mr Loh with
                    assistance from his niece. Crucially, all three statements are consistent with
                    each other in all material aspects.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_198"></a>198    The Prosecution when queried by us explained
                    that Mr Loh’s statements were not disclosed earlier because they were
                    “not credible and would not have any bearing on the decision of the case
                    at the commencement of the trial” [original emphasis
                        omitted].<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_99" id="Ftn_99_1"><sup>[note: 99]</sup></a></span>
                    It was added that Mr Loh was very emotional and could not speak in complete
                        sentences.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_100" id="Ftn_100_1"><sup>[note: 100]</sup></a></span>
                    Further, at the identification parade, he was unable to identify the intruder
                    and had pointed at three individuals, none of which was one of the
                        Appellants.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_101" id="Ftn_101_1"><sup>[note: 101]</sup></a></span>
                    The Prosecution also asserted, for good measure, that Mr Loh was
                    “never in a sufficiently fit state to clarify his evidence” and
                    “the intention was to revisit this assessment if and when
                    Mr Loh’s condition improved”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_102" id="Ftn_102_1"><sup>[note: 102]</sup></a></span> As Mr Loh subsequently
                    passed away, the occasion to “revisit” his evidence never
                    arose.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_199"></a>199    We find it difficult to accept these belated
                    attempts by the Prosecution to justify their mistaken stance in leisurely
                    revealing Mr Loh’s statements in dribs and drabs for the following
                    reasons:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_199-p2_a"></a>(a)     First, it is plain that the
                        investigators had found Mr Loh’s account credible enough to
                        issue, on 7 May 2005, a Media Release based solely on his account that
                        there was a single intruder who appeared to be a “male Malay look
                        like a drug addict” during the incident.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_103" id="Ftn_103_1"><sup>[note: 103]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_199-p2_b"></a>(b)     Second, the IO testified in re-examination that
                        he did not ask Mr Loh why he had picked three persons as Mr Loh
                        “was not in a very good condition to participate in the ID
                            parade”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_104" id="Ftn_104_1"><sup>[note: 104]</sup></a></span> and was in some “form of
                        shock” when the ID parade was being conducted.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_105" id="Ftn_105_1"><sup>[note: 105]</sup></a></span>
                        Surprisingly, Catherine, his daughter, was not asked to accompany him. She
                        was his interlocutor in both the earlier and subsequent interviews. Indeed,
                        she also affirmed that Mr Loh was “very emotional” around
                        the 12 and 13 May 2005.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_106" id="Ftn_106_1"><sup>[note: 106]</sup></a></span> While the parade was
                        conducted, Mr Loh, apart from being unwell, did not speak or
                        communicate at all. Subsequently, even though his condition had improved by
                        5 September 2005 when a detailed statement was obtained, the
                        investigators did not show him any photographs of the two accused to verify
                        if he could identify either of them. Catherine affirmed that by the
                        5 September 2005 her father could “speak better” because
                        he “was calm”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_107" id="Ftn_107_1"><sup>[note: 107]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_199-p2_c"></a>(c)     Third, when the IO was queried on the
                            63rd<sup></sup>day of the trial why the investigators had not disclosed
                        Mr Loh’s statements earlier he claimed that “<em>[i]t’s simply because we are not using him as a
                            witness</em>” [emphasis added].<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_108" id="Ftn_108_1"><sup>[note: 108]</sup></a></span>
                        However, he had no alternative but to concede that Mr Loh’s
                        statements were indeed “<em>very
                        material</em>” [emphasis added].<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_109" id="Ftn_109_1"><sup>[note: 109]</sup></a></span> There was absolutely
                        no suggestion from him that Mr Loh was not a credible witness. It bears
                        mention that he had direct contact with Mr Loh, unlike the
                        Prosecutors.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_199-p2_d"></a>(d)     Fourth, the Prosecution also led evidence in the trial from Catherine, his
                        daughter, that Mr Loh’s mind was “not affected by his
                            stroke”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_110" id="Ftn_110_1"><sup>[note: 110]</sup></a></span> and that he had no difficulties with
                        his ability to recollect.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_111" id="Ftn_111_1"><sup>[note: 111]</sup></a></span> She confirmed that if
                        one were to speak audibly and “pay attention when he spoke”
                        her father could be understood.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_112" id="Ftn_112_1"><sup>[note: 112]</sup></a></span> He used reading
                        glasses when he had to read and had no problems differentiating
                            colours.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_113" id="Ftn_113_1"><sup>[note: 113]</sup></a></span> She also affirmed that “[f]or
                        small things [Mr Loh] will not be able to see it properly, but for big size
                        thing he---he had no problem. When we returned home he knew who we were. He
                        could see us.”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_114" id="Ftn_114_1"><sup>[note: 114]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_199-p2_e"></a>(e)     Fifth, when the IO was examined as to
                        why he did not closely query Mr Loh about the presence of a second
                        intruder, he acknowledged his oversight. He did not mention anything in
                        relation to Mr Loh’s alleged lack of credibility that the
                        Prosecution presently relies on to justify its decision for not making the
                        necessary disclosure earlier. It could be added that even the Judge did not
                        conclude that Mr Loh was not a credible witness notwithstanding his
                        opinion that Mr Loh may have “missed” noting a second
                        intruder (for reasons that we have explained are wrong (see <a href="#p1_153">[153]</a> above and onwards)).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_199-p2_f"></a>(f)     Sixth, while Mr Loh was
                        undoubtedly distraught by his wife’s murder and had difficulties
                        communicating, it cannot be gainsaid that a great deal of pertinent detailed
                        information was eventually obtained from him. Several of the details he gave
                        in the three statements were objectively verifiable and resonated with the
                        established facts.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_115" id="Ftn_115_1"><sup>[note: 115]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_199-p2_g"></a>(g)     Seventh, Mr Loh was medically certified to
                        be fit to give evidence as of 5 September 2005 (see <a href="#p1_26">[26]</a> above). This certification was apparently procured by
                        the police investigators.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_199-p2_h"></a>(h)     Eighth, it bears mention that all three of
                        Mr Loh’s statements were consistent with each other. He never
                        once wavered from his firm belief that there was a single male Malay
                        intruder. The investigators failed to properly clarify with him whether he
                        could be mistaken (see <a href="#p1_157">[157]</a> above).
                        This was a serious oversight.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_200"></a>200    In the light of the above it is surprising
                    for the Prosecution to now assert that Mr Loh was not a reliable witness.
                    The Prosecution’s present position that Mr Loh’s statements
                    “would not have any bearing on the decision of the case at the
                    commencement of the trial” is disappointing as even the IO acknowledged
                    the statements are indeed “<em>very
                    material</em>” [emphasis added]. We earlier concluded (at <a href="#p1_115">[115]</a>) that the Prosecution ought not to arrogate
                    to itself the decision to withhold from the court material evidence from a
                    seemingly credible witness. <em>To reiterate, the duty of the
                        Prosecution is not to secure a conviction at all costs. Rather, the
                        Prosecution owes a duty to the court and to the wider public to ensure that
                        only the guilty are convicted, and that all relevant material is placed
                        before the court to assist it in its determination of the truth</em>.
                    The fruits of investigations are after all the property of the community to
                    ensure that justice is done, as was aptly stated in <em>Stinchcombe</em> (see <a href="#p1_90">[90]</a>
                    above).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_201"></a>201    This case amply illustrates the profoundly
                    disturbing consequences that the wrong exercise by the Prosecution of its
                    perceived unfettered discretion on disclosure could have on the administration
                    of justice. There is no doubt in our minds that Mr Loh was on any account a
                    credible witness who gave an entirely consistent account of crucially material
                    facts. Even if there was indeed some genuine doubt about his reliability
                    entertained by the Prosecution, on the basis of the prevailing facts and
                    considering this was a matter that attracted capital punishment, disclosure of
                    his statements was not an option but, plainly, an obvious necessity. It was for
                    the court and not the Prosecution to have made that assessment. This ought to
                    have been obvious to those responsible for the prosecution from the onset of
                    this matter. They must have appreciated that all the <em>known
                        objective evidence</em> pointed to only one intruder being present at
                    the flat during the incident.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_202"></a>202    In our view, all of Mr Loh’s
                    statements ought to have been provided to counsel for the Appellants and to the
                    court prior to the trial. The Prosecution relies on the High Court decision in
                        <em>Selvarajan James</em> to justify their omission to
                    produce the three statements. But even if that decision may be said to suggest
                    that it had no legal obligation to produce the statements there remains the
                    ethical duty the prosecutors owed the court to produce them as they were highly
                    pertinent to the issue of the guilt of Ismil and they came from a credible
                    source. The number of intruders present during the incident went to the very
                    heart of these proceedings. Had they been so provided at an earlier stage, the
                    Judge could well have held the initial statements of Ismil to be
                    inadmissible.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_203"></a>203    At the very latest, the Prosecution ought to
                    have disclosed Mr Loh’s statements to counsel for the Appellants soon
                    after Ismil filed his notice of alibi on 3 January 2006. The Prosecution
                    must have appreciated that these statements were important not just to counsel
                    for the Appellants but to the court in its assessment of the charges that the
                    Appellants faced. Yet Mr Loh’s statements of 12 May 2005 and
                    5 September 2005 were only provided on 4 September 2007, more than a
                    year and a half later. The existence of these two statements only incidentally
                    emerged when the IO was being cross-examined. Mr Loh’s statement of
                    7 May 2005 was provided later still, on 8 May 2008, more than two
                    years after the notice of alibi was filed, also having been discovered during
                    the course of the cross-examination of another investigator, SSI Lai. It
                    ought also be mentioned that the testimony of Muhammad’s former counsel,
                    Mr Lean, that the IOhad informed him that as far as Mr Loh was
                    concerned no statements were recorded from him and it was a case of “[n]o
                    hear, no see”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_116" id="Ftn_116_1"><sup>[note: 116]</sup></a></span> was not challenged by the Prosecution.
                    Clearly, there was a conscious decision by all involved in the investigation and
                    prosecution of the appellants not to reveal Mr Loh’s statements prior
                    to the commencement of the High Court proceedings. Why? It does not appear to us
                    that this decision was solely underpinned by concerns about Mr Loh’s
                    credibility or the materiality of his statements.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_204"></a>204    Here, Ismil’s counsel was deprived of
                    crucial information which would have considerably assisted his case. The Judge
                    was also kept in the dark until well after he had ruled on the admissibility of
                    Ismil’s confession. By the time Mr Loh’s statements were
                    revealed the Judge was placed in the entirely invidious position of having to
                    reassess the correctness of his earlier decisions on admissibility and the
                    reliability of certain witnesses.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_205"></a>205    We would end by emphasising the important
                    role the Prosecution plays in the administration of justice. <em>It is of paramount importance that the Prosecution discharge its duties
                        conscientiously and ethically, and not just zealously</em>. The
                    ultimate determination as to innocence or guilt is to be made by the court, and
                    it is the duty of the Prosecution to ensure that all known material evidence
                    that is credible is fairly placed before the court in a timely
                manner.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_206"></a>206    We do not think that the prosecutors who had
                    carriage of this matter in the High Court properly assessed their ethical
                    obligations to the Court (even assuming they were entitled rely on the decision
                    in <em>Selvarajan James</em>). They made a deliberate
                    decision not to disclose Mr Loh’s statement dated 5 September 2005 to
                    the court until late in the proceedings - and even then, the
                    remaining statements had to be teased out through an achingly drawn-out process.
                    This failure to make timely disclosure was disappointing.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_207"></a>207    Finally, we would like to acknowledge
                    Mr Thrumurgan for his impassioned advocacy and the commendable
                    conscientiousness with which he has conducted Ismil’s defence. He deserves
                    credit for placing on the record of proceedings many of the facts we have
                    referred to above.</p>
