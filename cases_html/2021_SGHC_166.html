The AR felt that the background to the signing of the SPAs would be important, given the defendant’s claim that all the monies had been channelled back to Honestbee (which this court has already noted is untrue). The AR added that as at the dates of the hearings before him of the summary judgment application (on 24 November and 3 December 2020 respectively), Brian Koo had yet to file his defence to the defendant’s counterclaim.

</div> With respect, it is of no concern to the defendant and it certainly does not give rise to a triable issue, that the plaintiff was prepared to take the risk of buying the Shares and parting with USD5.1m without undertaking the standard due diligence exercise. Further, why was there a need for interaction between the parties when the defendant had expressly appointed Brian Koo as his fundraising agent?  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 In the euphoria created by Honestbee’s rapid (and successful) expansion in its early days, the defendant (and perhaps Brian Koo as well) held an overly optimistic (and I dare say unrealistic) view of the Company’s prospects and its valuation. If indeed Honestbee was worth USD330m as stated in the PN, one can understand the defendant’s reluctance to part with 86,865 shares by selling them to the plaintiff for USD5.1m unless there was a buy-back arrangement with Brian Koo (which the defendant pleaded there was). The search from ACRA (see [40] above) showed that Honestbee had issued 311,863 ordinary shares.

</div> It is settled law that “[f]ailure of consideration occurs when one party has not enjoyed the benefit of any part of what it bargained for. In the determination of this question, one has to judge it from the perspective of the payor plaintiff … For a plaintiff to succeed in a claim for a refund there must be a <span class="font-italic">total</span> failure of consideration” (<span class="font-italic">per</span> Chao Hick Tin JA in <span class="font-italic">Ooi Ching Ling </span><span class="font-italic">v Just Gems </span>[2003] 1 SLR(R) 14 at [43]–[44]; emphasis original). It can hardly be disputed that in this case, the plaintiff received nothing in return from the defendant for its payment to him of the Claim amount. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">81 It appeared to this court that the defendant and the AR conflated the plaintiff’s claim with the alleged fundraising exercise for Honestbee (which Brian Koo refuted in any case) and other matters extraneous to the plaintiff’s claim. Any fundraising arrangement/agreement between Brian Koo and the defendant is a red herring. The plaintiff was not involved in Brian Koo’s dealings with the defendant. Any dispute arising therefrom including the PN and the defendant’s counterclaim against Brian Koo, can go to trial but it has no relevance to the plaintiff’s claim. The court therefore does not accept the defendant’s argument that there are factual disputes surrounding the plaintiff’s claim. The factual disputes if any were between Brian Koo and the defendant. What then are the triable issues between the plaintiff and the defendant? The court can see none. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">82 Courts should take a robust approach when considering summary judgment applications (<span class="font-italic">per</span> GP Selvam J in <span class="font-italic">Hua Khian Ceramics Tiles Supplies Pte Ltd v Torie Construction Pte Ltd</span> [1992] 1 SLR 884 (“<span class="font-italic">Hua Khian</span>”) at [21]–[22])<span class="font-italic">.</span> This court agrees and adopts the approach here. Instead of being distracted by the defendant’s irrelevant facts and arguments, this court separated the wheat from the chaff to determine the plaintiff’s claim based on relevant and undisputed facts. In this regard, there are major flaws in the defendant’s case which are set out below at [88]. Hence, this court saw no triable issues that warranted this Suit going to trial. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">83 The court in<span class="font-italic"> Hua Khian</span> had also said (at [23]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… If there is no defence to a claim other than a plausible counterclaim then judgment must be entered on the claim and the cross-claim should proceed to trial with a stay of execution so that the defendant is not unjustly injured.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">The above comment is equally pertinent here since the defendant joined Brian Koo to this suit. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">84 The defendant’s denial of the authenticity of the SPAs does not sit well with the facts that were extracted from the documents exhibited or affirmations made in the five affidavits referred to at [30].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">85 First, as the plaintiff said in its submissions,

</div> the defendant’s alternative defence to the plaintiff’s claim (that he had fulfilled his obligations under the SPAs) is diametrically opposite to his primary defence that he did not sign the SPAs. His alternative defence is unsustainable. The defendant cannot on the one hand deny signing the SPAs and in the next breath contend that he performed his obligations thereunder.

He cannot, as the plaintiff pointed out, hedge his bets. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">86 Brian Koo’s defence as well as the emails exhibited in Jong’s second affidavit showed the likely sequence of events to be as follows:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The defendant authorised Brian Koo as his agent to source for a buyer urgently for his shares in Honestbee. The defendant was in urgent need of funds, having borrowed money from a moneylender at a very high interest rate;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Brian Koo found a buyer for the defendant’s shares in the plaintiff;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) The SPAs were executed in a hurry to accommodate the defendant’s urgent need for funds; </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) The defendant authorised Brian Koo to execute the SPAs on his behalf but Brian Koo forwarded soft copies of the SPAs to the defendant to execute instead. The defendant emailed to Brian Koo the execution pages of both documents that he had signed which Brian Koo then forwarded in turn to the plaintiff. The defendant has not denied the relevant emails.  </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) Having received the Claim amount, the defendant deliberately refused and/or failed to comply with cl 3 of the SPAs (see [12] above) to effect a transfer of the Shares to the plaintiff because he knew (although the plaintiff did not) that there were transfer restrictions in the shareholders’ agreement(see [64] above). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">87 Even if <span class="font-italic">arguendo</span>, this court erred in its above surmise of how events transpired, Brian Koo was the defendant’s fundraising agent, by the defendant’s own admission.

</div>), this is a self-serving argument. The defendant was himself the CEO of Honestbee from July 2018 to May 2019 when the Company was not in any financial trouble (as reflected in Honestbee’s repayment to the defendant of S$4m of his loan(s) in October 2018 (see [56] above)). Brian Koo by contrast was only the interim CEO of Honestbee from 2 May 2019 to 15 July 2019 before Ong took over. Further, Brian Koo was a director of Honestbee for four months between 2 May 2019 and 12 September 2018. He was however a creditor of the Company for SGD24,104,214.90 (USD17,854,974) representing 8.28% of the secured and unsecured debts of the Company.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">89 Given Brian Koo’s short tenure as CEO of Honestbee as compared with the defendant’s, the court is mystified by the defendant’s self-righteous and unreasonable contention that Brian Koo, not him, had the duty/responsibility to ensure the defendant transferred the Shares to the plaintiff. Why did the defendant himself not effect the transfer(s) during his (longer) tenure as CEO? In any case, no transfers could have taken place as the defendant did not obtain the consent of his fellow shareholders to waive in favour of the plaintiff, their first right of refusal to buy the Shares. Even if he wanted to, Brian Koo could not have arranged for the transfer of the Shares without the approval of the other shareholders. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">90 At this juncture, I need to digress.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">93 It bears remembering that Brian Koo had denied signing the PN. In the absence of any explanation from the defendant, the court can only assume that the document emanated from the defendant. Other than the defendant’s bare assertion, he did not produce an iota of evidence (including emails) that would support his contention that Brian Koo not only knew of, but also signed, the PN. The court’s doubts on the authenticity of the PN is reinforced by the defendant’s refusal or inability to produce the original document when the plaintiff requested its inspection a year ago (see [98] below. That said, the PN is a document that has nothing to do with the plaintiff’s claim.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">94 The defendant had raised the defences of affirmation and/or acquiescence to the plaintiff’s claim. These defences are wholly unmeritorious. Citing <span class="font-italic">Genelabs Diagnostics Pte Ltd v Institut Pasteur and </span><span class="font-italic">another</span> [2000] 3 SLR(R) 530 (“<span class="font-italic">Genelabs</span>”) at [78], the plaintiff submitted (which this court accepts) that in order to be able to invoke the doctrine, the defendant must show that the plaintiff had stood by in such a manner as to induce the person committing the act (<span class="font-italic">ie</span> the defendant) and who might otherwise have abstained from it, to believe that the plaintiff consented to it being committed. The emails in Jong’s second affidavit showed that the plaintiff repeatedly pressed the defendant for the share certificates for the Shares, conduct which is inconsistent with the plea of acquiescence. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">95 Moreover, the defendant must – but failed to – show that his position had changed on account of the acquiescence (see <span class="font-italic">Genelabs </span>at [78]). Here, as in <span class="font-italic">Koh Wee Meng v Trans Eurokars Pte Ltd</span> [2014] 3 SLR 663, the plaintiff never indicated to the defendant that it would not enforce its rights. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">96 The defendant had also argued that the plaintiff’s silence (between December 2018 and January 2020) and failure to sue constituted acquiescence. The short answer to this argument is that at law, mere silence is not tantamount to acquiescence. “To succeed in the defence, the defendant must prove that the plaintiff, by ‘standing by’, has made some representation or given some indication to the defendant that he does not intend to insist on his legal rights” (<span class="font-italic">per</span> Vincent Hoong J in <span class="font-italic">Eller, Urs v Cheong Kiat Wah</span> [2020] SGHC 106 at [106]).  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">97 If the defendant’s defences of affirmation and/or acquiescence are not made out, what more his other defence of laches? </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">98 In the course of the Appeal hearing, the court was informed that on 25 June 2020, the plaintiff requested inspection from the defendant of eight (8) documents he had referred to in his D&amp;CC filed on 22 June 2020, including the PN. As at the date of the hearing of the Appeal, those documents were not produced by the defendant. The defendant’s omission was telling – the plaintiff’s request related to the defendant’s <span class="font-italic">own </span><span class="font-italic">pleaded case</span> set out at [25] above. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">99 Although this court has dismissed the PN as being irrelevant to the plaintiff’s claim (at [93] above), it should be noted that the defendant’s refusal or inability to produce the PN is another damning factor. It can only lead one to surmise that the PN never existed as Brian Koo asserted in his defence to the defendant’s counterclaim. What the defendant probably did was to copy and paste Brian Koo’s signature from documents in his possession onto the alleged PN. The defendant can do that with the soft copy of a document sent via email. He cannot <span class="font-italic">paste </span>a signature onto the hard copy of an unsigned document. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">100 As alluded to at [90] above, it is telling that the defendant is unable to provide any F&amp;BP of his pleadings and of his counterclaim on conspiracy, even when ordered by the court. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">101 I had at [51] above referred to the defendant’s surmise that because the Shares are now worthless, the plaintiff is taking action against him to improve its position in the Company’s insolvency. The court finds that the position is the reverse. Because Honestbee (prior to its liquidation) was not/never worth USD330m or anywhere near that valuation, the defendant’s dreams of perhaps becoming a Jack Ma (of e-commerce giant Alibaba) never came to fruition, Having expended the Claim amount and realised his shares in Honestbee are now worthless, the defendant decided to dispute liability under the SPAs and conjured up unmeritorious defences to the plaintiff’s claim.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">102 This court would add that the defendant’s counterclaim is unsustainable as the requirements of a conspiracy to injure are not satisfied. However, it is unnecessary to address the counterclaim as it was not part of the Appeal before this court. Equally, this court does not see the need to deal with the plaintiff’s other submissions over and above those already referred to earlier.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">103 It was clear to this court that the defendant had not raised any triable issues that warranted the plaintiff’s claim going to trial. Hence, final judgment was awarded to the plaintiff with interest and costs.  </div><div class="Judg-Sign text-left">Lai Siu Chiu</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">Senior Judge</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right"></div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Nandakumar Ponniya Servai and Danitza Hon Cai Xia (Wong &amp; Leow LLC) for the plaintiff and first defendant in counterclaim;</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Yeo Lai Hock Nichol and Qua Bi Qi (Solitaire LLP) for the defendant and plaintiff in counterclaim;</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Teo Jia Hui Veronica (Focus Law Asia LLC) for the second defendant in counterclaim (watching brief).</div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
