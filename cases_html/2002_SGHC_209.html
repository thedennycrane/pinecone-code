<font color="#000080" size="4">Judgment</font>
</strong>
</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font color="#800000"><strong><u>GROUNDS OF DECISION</u></strong></font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">         This was an appeal

against the decision of district judge Audrey Lim. The appellant, Tan Choon Kin

(‘Tan’), was convicted of an offence under s 57(1)(e) of the Immigration Act

(Cap 133) (‘the Act’) for employing a Thai national, Sommai Maneethap

(‘Sommai’), who had entered Singapore without a valid passport or work permit.

The trial judge sentenced Tan to 12 months’ imprisonment. Tan appealed against her

conviction. I dismissed the appeal and now give my reasons.</p>
<b xmlns="">
<p align="justify">The charge</p></b>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">2        The appellant was charged

as follows:</p>
<font size="3" xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">You, Tan Choon Kin, F/55 yrs, NRIC No. S0408140D, are charged that you,

    sometime between February 2001 and 13<sup>th</sup> July 2001, at a stall located at No. 35

    Fishery Port Road, Jurong Fishery Road, Singapore, did employ one Sommai Maneethap, M/29

    yrs, a Thai National as a stall assistant, whom you had reasonable grounds for believing

    to be a person who entered Singapore without being in possession of a valid pass lawfully

    issued by the Controller of Immigration, in contravention of section 6(1)(c) of the

    Immigration Act, Chapter 133 and you have thereby committed an offence under section

    57(1)(e) of the Immigration Act, Chapter 133, and punishable under section 57(1)(ii) of

    the said Act.</p>
</blockquote></blockquote></font>
<b xmlns="">
<p align="justify">The facts </p></b>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">3        Tan was at the material

time director of First Choon Frozen Food Pte Ltd (‘First Choon’). She operated

two stalls dealing in wholesale seafood and ice at the Jurong Fishery Port (‘the

Port’). At 4.45 am on 13 July 2001, Ministry of Manpower (‘MOM’) officers

raided Tan’s stalls. Outside one of her stalls, they arrested a Thai national pushing

a trolley. He was later ascertained to be Sommai. He was subsequently charged and

convicted of offences of illegal entry and possession of a forged Agri-Food and Veterinary

Authority (‘AVA’) pass. Sommai’s photograph was on the pass, but the name

was incorrect.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">4        At trial, Sommai testified

that he entered Singapore illegally sometime in January 2001, whereupon he met an agent by

the name of Peter. Peter showed Sommai a photocopy of a work permit with the name

‘Prachan Ritongrak’, which he was asked to memorise. Then he brought Sommai to

Tan’s office outside the Port. There, his employment was confirmed. Tan provided him

with accommodation beside the office. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">5        Sommai worked for Tan at

her stall from 12.00 am to 12.00 pm daily until his arrest. He saw Peter three times

during this period. According to Sommai, Tan paid his salary in cash every month. This

amounted to $700 for the first month and $800 for each subsequent month. Sommai also

stated that he regarded Tan as his boss. Peter did not instruct him on his daily work.

This was also what he told the MOM officers after his arrest. When Cisco took over port

security in or around June 2001, however, it was Peter who gave Sommai the forged AVA

pass. </p>
<b xmlns="">
<p align="justify">The prosecution’s case</p></b>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">6        At trial, the prosecution

adduced oral testimony from Sommai and the MOM officers who conducted the raid and

investigation to show that Tan, and not Peter, had had control over Sommai. Sommai himself

was able testify in some detail with regards to the nature and workings of Tan’s

wholesale seafood and ice business at the Port. He also testified that he received

instructions from Tan and from Tan’s children, who could speak some Thai.

Furthermore, Tan had never asked for nor verified Sommai’s passport and work permit.

From the outset, when he was arrested by the MOM officers during the raid, he maintained

that Tan, and not Peter, was his employer.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">7        The MOM officers who

conducted the raid (PW1, PW2 and PW3) confirmed that they had observed Sommai unloading

ice from a sack into a trolley and pushing the trolley in front of Tan’s stalls at

the Port. In addition, PW3 testified that when Sommai was shown a photograph of Tan while

he was being interviewed by the MOM officers, and was asked if that was his employer, he

answered in the affirmative.</p>
<b xmlns="">
<p align="justify">The defence</p></b>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">8        Essentially, Tan’s

defence at trial was that Sommai was Peter’s employee, not hers. It was her case that

since four or five of her workers had quit after Chinese New Year, she needed workers to

transport seafood from the boats to her stalls. In this regard she approached Peter, whom

she first came to know of five or six years previously. As the workers belonged to Peter,

she would pay Peter and not the workers directly. Peter brought three Thai workers,

including Sommai, to her stalls on 30<sup>th</sup> or 31<sup>st</sup> January 2001. Tan

also stated that she subsequently did not pay Sommai at all. Instead, she paid Peter $580

per month per worker. She produced invoices, receipts and copies of cheques to support

this contention at trial. There was no dispute that the monies were paid. At trial and on

appeal, the only dispute was the purpose of these payments. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">9        Tan also stated that she

obtained Sommai’s work permit and passport from Peter at the outset, but had

neglected to take copies of them. Also, Sommai did not work exclusively at her stalls, but

at a number of different stalls at the Port. Peter was at the Port daily to instruct his

workers as Tan could not speak Thai. When Cisco took over port security, she terminated

the ‘sub-contract’ with Peter as he did not show her valid work permits for his

Thai workers. She last saw Peter in July or August 2001. </p>
<b xmlns="">
<p align="justify">The decision below</p></b>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">10        The trial judge made the

following findings of fact:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p>(a)    Sommai had been employed by Tan, not Peter;</p>
<p>(b)    Tan had never checked Sommai’s passport and work permit;</p>
<p>(c)    the payments of $580 per worker per month made by Tan to

    Peter’s company from February to May 2001 were probably commissions for introducing

    the Thai workers;</p>
<p>(d)    Tan had the necessary <i>mens rea</i> for the offence as she knew

    Sommai was a Thai national and was worried about his immigration status, yet failed to

    perform the requisite due diligence checks under sections 57(9) and 57(10) of the Act.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">11        Having examined the

evidence before her and observed the demeanour of the witnesses, the trial judge concluded

that the prosecution had proved its case beyond a reasonable doubt and convicted Tan

accordingly.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">12        In reaching her

conclusion, the trial judge was mindful of her reliance on Sommai’s testimony in

doing so. She applied the test enunciated in <i>Farida Begam d/o Mohd Artham v PP</i>
<a class="remove" href1="/scripts/lp/dll/prospect.dll?GetHTML_lpqs&amp;type=1&amp;CaseID=62390&amp;freetext=" target="LWBMainFrame">[2001] 4 SLR 610</a>, in which this court stated that ‘a judge can make a finding on the

credibility of a witness based on some or all of the following: </p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">(1) his demeanour.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">(2) the internal consistency (or lack thereof) in the content of his

    evidence. </p>
<p align="justify">(3) the external consistency (or lack thereof) between the content of

    his evidence and extrinsic evidence (for example, the evidence of other witnesses,

    documentary evidence or exhibits).’</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">She found Sommai to be a truthful and credible witness on material

issues based on this test. In contrast, she found Tan’s testimony to be inherently

contradictory and inconsistent on material issues. Significantly, this included the issue

of whether she had checked Sommai’s passport and work permit at all.</p>
<b xmlns="">
<p align="justify">The appeal</p></b>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">13        Before me, counsel for Tan

raised three main points. First, he argued that the oral evidence of Sommai was the only

basis that the conviction was founded upon, which evidence lacked any or any adequate

corroborative support in the entirety of the trial. Second, he contended that the trial

judge had erred in fact in finding that the payments made by Tan to Peter were not wages,

but were commission payable to Peter for introducing Sommai to Tan. Finally, he argued

that Tan did not perform the due diligence checks required under ss 57(9) and 57(10) of

the Act as she had no reason to believe Sommai was an illegal immigrant. The corollary to

this was that she did not have the requisite <i>mens rea</i> for conviction under s

57(1)(e), and should therefore not have been convicted.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">14        In counsel’s view,

these three points were sufficient to raise a reasonable doubt in the prosecution’s

case.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">15        I considered each of these

points in turn.</p>
<i xmlns="">
<p align="justify">(a) The lack of corroborative support for Sommai’s evidence</p></i>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">16        The trial judge was well

aware of her reliance on Sommai’s testimony in convicting Tan. She also noted the

weakness of Tan’s own testimony, including her demeanour in court and the internal

and external inconsistencies in her evidence. In contrast, Sommai was able to testify in

detail about Tan’s business, and as to activities outside the Port with regard to

Tan’s business.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">17        With respect to Tan’s

business Sommai knew:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p>(a)    that Tan had a lorry, and had many workers comprising Thais,

    Malaysians, PRC nationals and Indians;</p>
<p>(b)    that Tan’s children helped in the business;</p>
<p>(c)    the types of activities that took place at Tan’s stalls,

    such as delivering ice and seafood to customers, and weighing seafood; and</p>
<p>(d)    that there were regular customers who came to collect ice from

    Tan.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">18        With respect to Tan’s

business activities outside the Port, Sommai knew that:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p>(a)    Tan had an office outside but near the Port;</p>
<p>(b)    she provided accommodation for her workers near her office;</p>
<p>(c)    the office had two female staff; and</p>
<p>(d)    she paid her workers in cash.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">19        It is worth quoting the

trial judge’s opinion on the strength of Sommai’s testimony at some length:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<font size="3"><p align="justify">If Sommai was not Tan’s employee, had never been to

    her office, did not stay at Tan’s lodgings, was not paid wages by her, and had never

    been transported in her company lorry, how would he have known all these [sic], since he

    was allegedly assisting Tan only at the Port, and only to transport seafood from the boats

    to Tan’s stalls? Sommai would not have been able to observe these details of

    Tan’s business, especially those outside the Port, given his allegedly limited scope

    of work at a limited place. Moreover he could not have obtained these information [sic]

    from Tan, her children or her workers, since allegedly, none of them could or did speak to

    him as testified by defence witnesses.</p>
<p align="justify">As such, I concluded that Sommai would only have known of all the above

    only because he had been employed by Tan to work at her stalls, had been paid by her in

    cash every month, had been to her office and had been provided lodgings by her.</p>
</font>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">20        As for Tan’s

contention that Sommai’s evidence required corroborative support, this was clearly

not a situation where witness testimony needed to be corroborated. Section 136 of the

Evidence Act excludes any multiplicity of witnesses requirement. Quite apart from that,

there was no reason why Sommai should be treated as a witness unworthy of credit or with

an interest to serve since he had already been convicted of the offences he was charged

with, especially in the light of the trial judge’s findings of fact as to his

credibility: see <i>Chua Keem Long v PP</i> <a class="remove" href1="/scripts/lp/dll/prospect.dll?GetHTML_lpqs&amp;type=1&amp;CaseID=9947&amp;freetext=" target="LWBMainFrame">[1996] 1 SLR 510</a>. In this regard it is

pertinent to bear in mind the Court of Appeal’s observation in <i>Abdul Ra’uf

bin Abdul Rahman v PP</i> <a class="remove" href1="/scripts/lp/dll/prospect.dll?GetHTML_lpqs&amp;type=1&amp;CaseID=50958&amp;freetext=" target="LWBMainFrame">[2000] 1 SLR 683</a>, applying <i>Lim Ah Poh v PP</i> <a class="remove" href1="/scripts/lp/dll/prospect.dll?GetHTML_lpqs&amp;type=1&amp;CaseID=6012&amp;freetext=" target="LWBMainFrame">[1992] 1 SLR 713</a>:</p>
<font size="3" xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">An appellate court will not disturb findings of fact unless they are

    clearly reached against the weight of the evidence. In examining the evidence, an

    appellate court has always to bear in mind that it has neither seen nor heard the

    witnesses and has to pay due regard to the trial judges’ findings and their reasons

    therefor.</p></blockquote></blockquote></font>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">In light of the trial judge’s reasoning and the relevant case law,

I saw no reason to disturb her finding of fact on this issue.</p>
<i xmlns="">
<p align="justify">(b) The nature of Tan’s payments to Peter</p>
</i>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">21        The dispute at trial and

on appeal was whether the payments of $580 per month per worker (totalling $1,740 per

month) from February to May 2001 were the workers’ salaries or commissions payable to

Peter for introducing the Thai workers to Tan. If they were the former, then it was Peter

who employed them. If the latter, they were Tan’s workers. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">22        The trial judge found that

they were commissions payable to Peter. Her reasoning was that it was not unbelievable

that Tan could have expended $1,300-1,400 per month on Sommai (inclusive of the

commission), given that she paid her Malaysian and Singaporean workers $1,400-1,500 each

(not including workers’ levies). She found that there was no ‘sub-contract’

between Tan and Peter for Sommai’s employment as Tan contended. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">23        She reached her conclusion

based on a comparison of the rates at which all of Tan’s workers were paid, and the

scope of the duties they had to perform at Tan’s stalls. I could not fault the trial

judge’s reasoning on this issue. Therefore, I saw no basis for me to disturb the

trial judge’s findings of fact. </p>
<i xmlns="">
<p align="justify">(c) Whether Tan had the requisite </p></i>mens rea<i xmlns=""> for conviction</i>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">24        Tan would have had a

defence to the charge had she been able to show that she had fulfilled the due diligence

requirements set out in section 57(10)(b) of the Act. At trial, Tan gave evidence that her

illiteracy and inability to read or understand English hindered her from making a

photocopy of Sommai’s passport and work permit. The trial judge found, and rightly

so, that Tan was using illiteracy as an excuse, and that, moreover, she was lying with

respect to her inability to understand English. If anything, her illiteracy ought to have

compelled her to be more careful, retaining a photocopy of Sommai’s passport and work

permit for future verification since ‘the employer’s task of checking the

identification papers of his foreign workers remains a non-delegable one. An employer who

fails to comply with s 57(10) does so at his own peril’: see <i>Cheong Choon Bin v PP

</i><a class="remove" href1="/scripts/lp/dll/prospect.dll?GetHTML_lpqs&amp;type=1&amp;CaseID=62131&amp;freetext=" target="LWBMainFrame">[2001] 4 SLR 190</a>.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">25        Furthermore, it is not at

all clear from the Notes of Evidence that Sommai testified that Tan was looking at <i>his</i>

passport, as counsel contended in the proceedings below. Sommai testified from the outset

that his passport had been taken away before he entered Singapore. He also testified that

Tan had looked at <i>the</i> passport, not at what was purportedly his passport. One might

infer from the context of this question in the cross-examination that Tan might have been

looking at a forged document provided by Peter, but the basis for such an inference is

tenuous at best. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">26        Finally, the trial judge

concluded, based on the internal inconsistencies within Tan’s own testimony, that she

had never insisted on looking at Sommai’s passport and work permit and had never

checked them, either personally or through her son as she claimed. </p>
<b xmlns="">
<p align="justify">Conclusion</p></b>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">27        In the main, the essence

of this appeal was to dispute the trial judge’s findings of fact, which, as I have

observed, the appellate court will not disturb unless they were ‘clearly reached

against the weight of the evidence.’ I did not find this to be the case in the

premises, especially given the trial judge’s careful observations on the demeanour of

the witnesses in the proceedings below.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">28        For the foregoing reasons,

I dismissed the appeal against conviction and upheld the sentence of 12 months’

imprisonment.</p>
