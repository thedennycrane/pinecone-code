<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       This was an appeal against the decision of the
                    District Court (see <em>Leow Fa Dong v Cai Xiao Qing</em>
                    [2011] SGDC 285) by Cai Xiao Qing (“the appellant”)
                    where the District Judge (“DJ”) found the appellant who was the
                    driver of a car, liable for an accident involving Leow Fa Dong (“the
                    respondent”) who was a cyclist.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The facts</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       On 8 April 2009, at approximately 11 pm,
                    the appellant was driving her vehicle on the slip road leading off from Tampines
                    Avenue 9 to Tampines Avenue 7 when her car hit the respondent at a zebra
                    crossing. The respondent, who was 16 years old at the time, collided into the
                    right-hand wing mirror of the appellant’s vehicle and suffered a fracture
                    to his left collarbone.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       Based on a map and pictures of the accident
                    scene, it was noted that Tampines Avenue 9 and Tampines Avenue 7 run
                    perpendicular to one another and intersect at a cross junction. The appellant
                    was then driving along Tampines Avenue 9 in the direction of Tampines Avenue 2.
                    She had been driving along the left-most lane so as to take the exit by the slip
                    road to Tampines Avenue 7 and merge with traffic headed in the same direction.
                    On the other hand, the respondent had been travelling along Tampines Avenue 7 on
                    the side closer to Block 452. He had crossed Tampines Avenue 9 at the cross
                    junction where it met Tampines Avenue 7, and mounted what parties termed
                    “the island” to get to the side of Tampines Avenue 7 nearer
                    Tampines Junior College. To do so he crossed the slip road at the zebra crossing
                    and so collided with the appellant’s vehicle.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       The respondent’s case before the District
                    Court was that the collision was caused by the negligence of the appellant in
                    her driving, control and management of her vehicle. In particular she had driven
                    at an excessive speed, failed to come to a halt before the zebra crossing to
                    give way to users and failed to keep a proper lookout. To establish his claim,
                    the respondent called a witness one Mohd Nuruddin (“Nuruddin”) who
                    had allegedly witnessed the accident. The appellant also had a witness in
                    Ms Song Hao (“Ms Song”) who was one of two passengers in
                    the appellant’s vehicle at the material time. The appellant had a
                    counterclaim against the respondent, alleging that the latter was negligent in,
                        <em>inter alia</em>, failing to keep a proper lookout
                    for vehicles that could be reasonably be expected on the road, failing to yield
                    to the appellant’s car that had already crossed the first white line of
                    the zebra crossing at the material time, and for abruptly dashing across the
                    zebra crossing.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       Nuruddin had in his affidavit of
                    evidence-in-chief (“AEIC”) deposed that the respondent had been
                    (i) walking next to his bicycle at the material time and (ii) that the
                    appellant’s vehicle had knocked into the respondent whilst he was on the
                    zebra crossing. However, Nuruddin subsequently changed his evidence. On
                    14 July 2010 before the DJ in the Subordinate Court’s Primary Dispute
                    Resolution Centre Nuruddin stated that: (i) the respondent had been
                        <em>cycling</em> at the material time, and
                    (ii) the respondent had not stopped prior to crossing the zebra crossing
                    and this caused him to cycle into the appellant’s vehicle that was already
                    on the crossing. This change was recorded on 17 February 2011 as an
                    amendment to Nuruddin’s AEIC just before his cross-examination.
                    Nuruddin’s oral testimony was as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">Q:</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">Are there any changes or amendments you like [sic]
                            to make to your affidavit or the statement at [Exhibit]
                        MN1?</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">A:</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">I can’t read.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">Q:</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">You have no idea what you have signed here
                            (referring to the statement)?</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">A:</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">At that time, my brother in law read for
                        me.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">Yeo:</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">Could the statement be read over in Malay to
                            him?</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       It is also worth mentioning at this stage that
                    counsel for the respondent, in anticipation of Nuruddin changing his testimony,
                    orally applied at the start of the trial to amend para 3 of the Statement
                    of Claim in the following manner:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">3.    On 8 April 2011, the Plaintiff was walking
                            next to his bicycle <u>or riding his bicycle</u>
                            across a zebra crossing near the junction of Tampines Avenue 7 and
                            Tampines Avenue 9. [emphasis original]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The DJ noted that the application was premature because it was not
                    clear (at that point) whether Nuruddin would amend his evidence. Nevertheless,
                    he granted the Plaintiff leave to amend <em>prospectively</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       In the course of trial, Nuruddin gave further
                    oral evidence to the effect that the appellant’s vehicle had “sped
                    by” and that the appellant had “further said she was in a
                    hurry”. In contrast, the appellant and Song averred that the
                    appellant’s car was “going slowly” and that the respondent
                    had been travelling “at a very fast speed”.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The decision below</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       After considering all the evidence presented
                    before him, the DJ assessed Nuruddin to be an “independent witness of
                    truth” who had witnessed the collision in its entirety. This was
                    notwithstanding the changes he had made to his AEIC. The DJ then inferred from
                    the language used by Nuruddin in his oral testimony (see <a href="#p1_7">[7]</a> above) that the appellant had been speeding. It
                    was on this premise that the DJ found the appellant negligent. At para 25
                    of his judgment, he said:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It was not disputed that the accident before me took place on a clear
                        night when the view of the zebra crossing and its environs were clear. The
                        plaintiff was riding slowly, according to [Nuruddin], at walking pace, which
                        I accept. The collision occurred because the defendant, who was travelling
                        at some speed, had completely failed to see the plaintiff approach the zebra
                        crossing. Had the defendant spotted the plaintiff, which I find she should
                        have done but failed to do, she would and should have slowed down and come
                        to a stop.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       The DJ then proceeded to find in favour of the
                    respondent, although he held the respondent 10% contributorily negligent. He did
                    so because “there is a corresponding duty on the part of pedestrians as
                    road users” to take “reasonable care for [their] own
                    safety”. In his view, the respondent was blameworthy for not checking for
                    oncoming traffic before crossing the road.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     In the light of his decision, the DJ also
                    dismissed the appellant’s counterclaim in its entirety.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Summary of the parties’ submissions</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     Counsel for the appellant, Patrick Yeo
                    (“Mr Yeo”) argued that the DJ should not have relied on
                    Nuruddin’s evidence to make his findings of fact. This is because Nuruddin
                        <em>had not witnessed the actual collision</em>, as his
                    testimony in cross-examination would imply:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">Q:</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">How far were you away from the zebra crossing when
                            you saw all these things happening?</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">A:</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">There were four traffic lights. The zebra crossing
                            was at the school, near the school. And I was at the block. And I was
                            walking near the block. <em>I heard something collided
                                [sic]. When my friend saw, he called me.</em> Then he told me
                            to help. Then both of us went over to the boy and asked him what
                            happened. [emphasis added]</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1">The above extracts from the notes of evidence Mr Yeo
                    contended, would explain why Nuruddin’s account of the accident was
                    inconsistent with other objective and circumstantial evidence. For instance,
                    Mr Yeo surmised that the injuries the respondent sustained would have been
                    far more severe if the appellant had been speeding at the material time. The
                    respondent also testified that the appellant’s vehicle was not travelling
                    too fast, <em>even though it was detrimental to his case to say
                        as such.</em></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     Next, Mr Yeo demonstrated how the
                    respondent would have to cycle quite a distance to get to the zebra crossing: at
                    the very least he would have to cycle past 8 lanes (across Tampines Avenue 9) at
                    the traffic light and mount the traffic island. One can thereby conclude that he
                    would have built up enough momentum to be travelling at a speed rather than at
                    walking pace, as Nuruddin testified. Even more significant was the fact that the
                    respondent had left his wallet at the 7-11 Store he was returning to. It was
                    thus more likely than not that the respondent was in a rush to retrieve his
                    wallet, despite his denial to the contrary. This was also more consistent with
                    the testimony of Ms Song and the appellant that the respondent “came
                    at a fast speed”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     Finally, casting even more doubt on the
                    reliability of Nuruddin’s testimony was the fact that he stated he
                    “arranged for [an] ambulance to take the [respondent] to the
                    hospital”. This contradicted both parties’ evidence that the
                    respondent was sent to hospital in the appellant’s car.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     In reply to this submission, counsel for the
                    respondent, Adrian Heng (“Mr Heng”) reiterated that the DJ
                    carefully considered all aspects of Nuruddin’s evidence (including the
                    fact that he said he had <em>heard</em> a collision) before
                    assessing him to be a reliable witness. This could be seen from <a href="#p1_3">[3]</a> of the DJ’s oral judgment:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The plaintiff has invited me to hold that [Nuruddin] did not in fact see
                        the accident as it happened and that his change of evidence was really a
                        change of inference on his part in effect. <em>I do accept
                            that [Nuruddin] also did say that he heard a collision and that he was
                            told by a friend to go help out.</em> While the last point
                        appeared to contradict his other point that he saw the plaintiff riding his
                        bicycle, I think it behoved Mr Heng to clarify these perceived
                        inconsistencies with [Nuruddin], particularly since it was his own witness
                        who had changed his evidence in a way that would damage the
                        plaintiff’s case. As this was not done, I find that [Nuruddin’s]
                        testimony about the plaintiff’s riding his bicycle was unchallenged by
                        the plaintiff. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     Next, Mr Yeo mounted his second argument
                    that the DJ in his finding that Rule 5 of the Road Traffic (Pedestrian
                    Crossings) Rules (“rule 5”) applied, by extension, to give the
                    respondent a right of way. Rule 5 states:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>Vehicle approaching crossing to slow
                        down</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>5</b>.    The driver of every
                            vehicle approaching a pedestrian crossing shall, <em>unless he can see that there is no pedestrian thereon</em>,
                            proceed at such speed as will enable him to stop his vehicle before
                            reaching the crossing. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Mr Yeo’s point was that the respondent as a cyclist was
                    a “driver” within the meaning of s 2 of the Road Traffic Act
                    (Cap 276, 2008 Rev Ed). As such, the respondent had no business being
                    on the zebra crossing designated for pedestrians and it was this failure to
                    adhere to the rules that led to the accident. The DJ, however, disagreed. In his
                    view, the strict interpretation of rule 5 as advocated by Mr Yeo was not
                    “in the spirit” of the wording of the rule. In his words:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">23.    It is an everyday occurrence that cyclists cross
                            at zebra crossings and other pedestrian crossings. Indeed, they even,
                            and also wrongly, share pedestrian walkways, but really this is another
                            story were a pedestrian to come to harm on account of a cyclist’s
                            negligence. In the same way, the common sense, experience and decency of
                            a reasonable motorist is to stop to give way to a cyclist crossing or
                            about to cross a zebra crossing. With respect, to say, by extension from
                            rule 5 of the Pedestrian Crossing Rules, that the plaintiff, <em>qua</em> cyclist, had no right of way is overly
                            pedantic. This was the most appropriate place for the plaintiff to cross
                            to the other side...</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     If this Court were minded to agree with the DJ
                    that the respondent should be given right of way pursuant to rule 5, Mr Yeo
                    then made the alternative argument that rule 5 came with an important
                    qualification: that the driver must <em>see</em> the
                    pedestrian. Given that the respondent was travelling at a speed, the
                    appellant’s inability to notice his approach was completely reasonable in
                    the circumstances.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     Finally, Mr Yeo submitted that even if
                    this Court were to find the appellant liable in negligence, the respondent
                    should also be found to have contributed significantly to the accident. As for
                    what appeared to be the DJ’s “policy reasons” for reducing
                    the respondent’s liability by a mere 10% for contributory negligence,
                    Mr Yeo argued that the reasoning was flawed. For completeness the
                    DJ’s reasoning (at [18]) is set
                    out below:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">As His Honour, VK Rajah JC noted in <em>Cheong Ghim
                            Fah</em>, as cited at [95] in <em>Khoo Bee
                            Keong</em> (above), the burden of trying to weigh an accident
                        victim’s contribution and give it a numerical percentage cannot be
                        weighed on fine, mathematical scales. In my humble view, given the presence
                        of insurance - that cushion designed for motorists to communally bear the
                        load of damages when things go wrong on the roads - one should be slow to
                        pare away a victim’s recovery of his indubitable damages on account of
                        his perceived contribution, which really is his failure to take care of
                        himself, as it were. Other things being equal, that is to say (even) where
                        both a motorist and a cyclist such as the plaintiff before me, have both
                        supposedly acted in contravention of a traffic law, and where issues of
                        negligence and contribution are in question owing to such breaches of
                        traffic laws or more, the motorist should be made to bear the greater
                        blame.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Accordingly, Mr Yeo submitted, contributory negligence on the
                    part of the respondent should be in the region of 30-50%.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The decision</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     As the parties had rightly identified, much of
                    this appeal turned on the treatment of Nuruddin’s evidence by the DJ.
                    Mr Yeo alleged that Nuruddin did not witness the accident. However, this
                    position was not “put” to Nuruiddin in cross-examination as
                    required under the rule of <em>Browne v Dunn</em> [1893] 6
                    R 67. Rather, it was Mr Heng who invited the DJ to find that Nuruddin did
                    not in fact see the accident (see <a href="#p1_14">[14]</a>
                    above). In the absence of giving Nuruddin an opportunity to provide an
                    explanation for his story, the consensus was that the court is free to regard
                    his evidence as undisputed, regardless of the nature of the
                    cross-examiner’s case: Pinsler, <em>Evidence and the
                        litigation process</em>, 3<sup>rd</sup> Student
                    Edition (Lexis Nexis, 2010) at [20.98].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     Fortunately, this failure to cross-examine
                    Nuruddin was not fatal. As observed by Pinsler at [20.100]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">...although the general proposition is that testimony not subjected to
                        contradiction in cross-examination may be treated as unchallenged and thus
                        accepted by the opposing party, <em>the court is nevertheless
                            entitled to reject such testimony. A careful evaluation of the totality
                            of the evidence must still be undertaken to determine the cogency and
                            weight of such testimony.</em> [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">This position was applied in the case <em>Liza bte
                        Ismail v Public Prosecutor</em> [1997] 1 SLR(R) 555 where
                    the court found that the accused person’s story in relation to one of the
                    charges was “obviously fanciful” and “wholly unsupported by
                    the documentary evidence”. In my view, this position also neatly aligns
                    itself with the appellate court’s test for overturning a judge’s
                    finding of fact in both civil and criminal cases. Per <em>Seah
                        Ting Soon t/a Sing Meng Co Wooden Cases Factory v Indonesian Tractors Co Pte
                        Ltd</em> [2001] 1 SLR(R) 53 at [22], the judge’s evaluation must be
                    “plainly wrong”
                    <em>i.e. </em>his finding must go against the weight
                    of the evidence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     Returning now to the case before me, the crux
                    of the matter was whether Nuruddin’s testimony went against the weight of
                    the evidence (both circumstantial and objective). I was inclined to answer this
                    question in the positive. The points raised by Mr Yeo as set out in
                        <a href="#p1_11">[11]</a>-<a href="#p1_13">[13]</a> above although not conclusive when considered separately,
                    did cumulatively shed great doubt on whether Nuruddin actually witnessed the
                    collision. As for Mr Heng’s submission that the DJ had taken this
                    factor into account in his analysis of the evidence, the context in which he
                    considered it was quite different. The DJ was more concerned with whether the
                    respondent bore the burden of proof of clarifying inconsistencies in
                    Nuruddin’s evidence by way of re-examination. Accordingly, I would
                    disregard Nuruddin’s evidence in its entirety. It is trite law that an
                    appellate court, not being in a position to see witnesses to observe their
                    veracity and credibility should be slow in overturning a lower court’s
                    assessment of witnesses in the absence of good reason. However, I was of the
                    view there was good reason in this case.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     I should state that I did not find
                    Nuruddin’s act of amending his AEIC to be material. The exercise I was
                    more concerned with was whether his final testimony was corroborative with the
                    rest of the evidence. Furthermore, as the DJ noted, Nuruddin had supplied a
                    plausible reason for the change, namely, that his brother-in-law had read the
                    statement on his behalf and he had signed it without any further
                    questions.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     Unfortunately, the rejection of the only
                    independent witness’ testimony left this Court in the invidious position
                    of having to choose one party’s word over that of another. Nevertheless,
                    some reasonable inferences may still be drawn from the evidence before this
                    Court. The inferences, albeit grounded in circumstantial evidence, are arguably
                    more reliable than the allegations of Ms Song and the parties since they
                    were motivated to help either their own or their friend’s respective
                    cases.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     It was clear to me that the respondent was
                    cycling at the material time, and not walking beside his bicycle as he claimed.
                    My reasons for this finding are threefold:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_23-p2_a"></a>(a)     In a medical report of
                        Dr Faizal bin Kassim attached to the statement of claim, it stated that
                        “Mr Leow was allegedly involved in a road traffic accident
                        earlier the same day where he was a cyclist that was <em>cycling</em> past a zebra crossing...” (emphasis added);
                        and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_23-p2_b"></a>(b)     In a stern
                        warning issued by the traffic police to the respondent, it was recorded that
                        “the cyclist has been given a warning letter for <em>riding</em> other than in an orderly manner and without due
                        regard to the safety of others” (emphasis added).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_23-p2_c"></a>(c)     The respondent applied to amend his
                        pleadings in the midst of trial (see <a href="#p1_6">[6]</a> above). This seemed to be a concession on his
                        part.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     On (a), I noted that during cross-examination,
                    the respondent averred that he had never told Dr Faizal how he got injured.
                    When asked how Dr Faizal formed the impression that he had been cycling, he
                    attributed the brief to his mother, who he claimed was mistaken. I find this
                    explanation suspect. If the respondent did not agree with Dr Faizal’s
                    medical report, it was his prerogative to write to the doctor to correct the
                    report to support his statement of claim. Instead, he submitted a report that
                    contradicted his case.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     On (b), in the police reports by the appellant
                    and respondent the latter was classified as a “cyclist”. When
                    cross-examined on this point, the respondent was evasive:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">Q:</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">First page of this report—type of
                            informant—you told the policeman that you were a cyclist when you
                            were injured in the accident?</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">A:</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">I don’t remember.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">Q:</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">Agree your report states that you are a
                            cyclist?</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">A:</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">Yeah.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[...]</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">Q:</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">Can you explain to the court how the policeman
                            would know these details.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">A:</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">Maybe I told him. But I really can’t
                            remember.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">Q:</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">Suggest that you did tell him on that
                        day.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">A:</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">Yeah, perhaps I did tell him.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[...]</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">Q:</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">Agree that when you made this report, you did not
                            tell the policeman that you were walking across pushing your
                            bicycle.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">A:</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">I did tell the policeman that I was pushing my
                            bicycle.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1">Even taking the respondent’s position at its highest,
                        <em>i.e.</em> that the policeman had recorded his
                    statement wrongly, by the time the stern warning was issued by the traffic
                    police stating that the respondent was cycling at the material time, he should
                    have written to the traffic police to clarify his position. The fact that he did
                    not constitutes, in a way, an admission to liability.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     I move on next to examine the conduct of the
                    parties. I note that in cross-examination the respondent insisted that he had
                    stopped to check for traffic. The transcript states:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">Q:</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">You saying you stopped to check for
                        traffic?</span></p>

<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">Q:</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">You checked and didn’t see the bit [sic]

<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">Q:</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">How far was this car from the pedestrian

<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">Q:</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">You said that you were standing and you saw this
                            car in this position, and next moment you started to cross the zebra

<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">A:</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">Yeah. Next moment. I looked around. I thought the
                            car would stop and let me cross the crossing.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1">This account however, did not explain why the site of impact was
                    the right-hand side of the appellant’s vehicle, rather than the front. If
                    the appellant truly had been at a distance, she would have had to accelerate
                    very quickly as she exited the slip road to hit the respondent. This would be
                    counter-intuitive to most drivers, since one would have to stop at the end of
                    the slip road to check for merging traffic.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     Conversely, the more plausible explanation was
                    that the appellant was much closer to the zebra crossing than the respondent
                    claimed, and the respondent, noticing her as he cycled to the edge of the
                    crossing due to her headlights, miscalculated that there would be enough time
                    for him to clear the short distance. As such, instead of waiting for the car to
                    come to a halt, he had proceeded with cycling and collided with her vehicle.
                    Admittedly this situation is, to some extent based on a hypothesis. However,
                    this was in part due to the paucity of objective evidence before me. I note in
                    particular that no evidence was led to confirm that the damage appraisal of the
                    appellant’s car dealt only with damage <em>as a result of
                        the accident</em>, and not a result of other day to day causes. As
                    such, I would accept the evidence at its face value.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     In summary, I prefer the evidence of
                    Ms Song and the appellant to that of the respondent’s. In my view,
                    their account was consistent with the objective evidence before me. I would thus
                    overturn the DJ’s findings of fact and hold that:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_28-p2_a"></a>(a)     The respondent was cycling at a
                        speed at the material time;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_28-p2_b"></a>(b)     The appellant was not driving at an excessive speed at
                        the material time; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_28-p2_c"></a>(c)     The respondent noticed the appellant’s presence,
                        due to her headlights, but proceeded nevertheless to cross before her
                        vehicle came to a halt;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_28-p2_d"></a>(d)     The appellant was not aware of the respondent’s
                        presence until the collision occurred. This was partly because he was
                        travelling quite fast (see <a href="#p1_12">[12]</a>
                        above); and</p>
<p class="Judg-1">As for the DJ’s decision in respect of
                    rule 5, I would agree with Mr Yeo’s submission at <a href="#p1_16">[16]</a> above.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     Consequently, I allow the appeal with costs.
                    The appellant’s share of blame for the accident is reduced by 20% to 70%,
                    while the respondent’s contributory negligence is increased by 20% to 30%
                    to reflect the fact that he collided into her vehicle, notwithstanding the fact
                    that appellant should have but failed to notice the respondent’s approach
                    and stop in time. I further award judgment to the appellant on her counterclaim
                    with costs, based on 30% of $1,521.13. The assessment of damages for the
                    respondent’s claim will therefore proceed on the basis of the
                    appellant’s 70% liability. The appellant’s solicitors are discharged
                    from the undertaking dated 19 July 2011 that they provided as security for
                    costs of the appeal.</p>
