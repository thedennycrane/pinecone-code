Mr Sia claimed for certain sums of money amounting to a total of $1,192,090.80, which he had transferred to Mr Yong from sometime between 2010 to 2012. Mr Sia also claimed for certain reliefs in relation to his share in a property known as 33 Club Street, #04-16, Emerald Garden Condominium, Singapore (“the Emerald Garden property”) which was transferred to Mr Yong on 12 February 2012. In response, Mr Yong admitted to receipt of certain sums of money amounting to $1,027,684 from Mr Sia, but explained that these were meant as gifts and for other purposes. He denied any wrongdoing towards Mr Sia, and disputed the claims. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 Less than a year after the action was commenced,  Mr Sia passed away on 24 March 2016. He left behind a widow, a daughter,  Sia Tze Ming (“Ms Sia”) and a younger brother, Chua Seng Kee (“Mr Chua”). He also left behind no less than four wills. Mr Yong claims to be the rightful executor of the estate, duly appointed by Mr Sia in the second will dated 14 February 2012 (“the second will”). It is only under the second will that Mr Yong is a beneficiary, and in fact, the major beneficiary of the estate. On the other hand, Ms Sia and Mr Chua claim to be the rightful executors of the estate, duly appointed by Mr Sia in the fourth will dated 28 December 2015 (“the last will”). Under any of the four wills, as well as in the event of intestacy, Ms Sia would be a beneficiary, albeit with different beneficial interests. Separate proceedings to contest the validity of the second and the fourth wills, and to determine the rightful executor(s) of the estate, are underway, which I shall refer to as “the probate proceedings”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">3 Pending the resolution of the probate proceedings, there is no personal representative of the estate to be substituted in place of Mr Sia so as to carry on with the action under Order 15 rule 7(2) of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2014 Rev Ed) (“ROC”). For that reason, a stay of the action was ordered on 10 August 2016 (“the stay order”). On 22 September 2017, Ms Sia applied to lift the stay order, and for her to be added as a second plaintiff under Order 15 rule 6(<span class="font-italic">b</span>)(ii) of the ROC (“the application to intervene”). As a beneficiary of the estate, Ms Sia sought to intervene so as to take the necessary steps in the action to protect the assets of the estate. To that end, Ms Sia concurrently applied for an injunction prohibiting Mr Yong from disposing of his assets up to the value of $1,453,153.31 in Singapore (“the interim injunction application”), although that amount was subsequently reduced to $1,255,184 in written submissions. Both the applications were resisted by Mr Yong. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">4 On 29 November 2017, I granted the application to intervene, lifting the stay order for limited purposes. Also, I granted the interim injunction application, prohibiting Mr Yong from disposing of his assets in Singapore up to the value of $1 million. Essentially, Ms Sia was permitted to intervene in the action, for the restricted purposes of dealing with the interim injunction application, any application to vary or discharge the interim injunction, as well as any appeal arising from the interim injunction application or the application to intervene. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">5 On 5 January 2018, I granted Mr Yong leave to appeal against my decisions in the two applications. He has filed the appeals, and I now provide my reasons. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Background </span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Relationship between the parties  </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">6 In 1988, Mr Sia was an engineer with the Public Utilities Board, while Mr Yong was a project manager and electrical engineer of a supplier to the Public Utilities Board. Mr Yong was 14 years younger than Mr Sia. They met in the course of work, and became close friends. From sometime in 2003, they became business partners in a business known as S&amp;Y M&amp;E Consultants. Separately, Mr Sia owned a business known as Zhi Pin Enterprise,

Three years later, Mr Sia commenced the action which concerns events that occurred between 2010 to 2012. By then, Mr Sia was a man of little means. To pursue the action, he sought and was granted legal aid. Before he commenced the action, Mr Sia made a statutory declaration on 19 June 2015, setting out material facts in support of his claims.

In June 2012, Mr Sia managed to complain to his sister about Mr Yong controlling his life, and keeping his identity card and bank cards. He also complained that Mr Yong intended to bring him to China. With the help of his family members, Mr Sia managed to move out of Mr Yong’s home.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">My decision    </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 In <span class="font-italic">Wong Moy</span>, the Court of Appeal agreed with the reasoning in <span class="font-italic">Omar Ali bin Mohd </span><span class="font-italic">and others v Syed Jafaralsadeg bin Abdulkadir Alhadad and others </span>[1995] 2 SLR(R) 407 <span class="font-italic">(“Omar”</span>), and held that a beneficiary may, in special circumstances, institute action to protect and recover assets belonging to the unadministered estate: see [11] and [12]. Since then, the legal principle has been applied or cited in various cases relied upon by the parties, including <span class="font-italic">Ching</span><span class="font-italic"> Chew Weng Paul v Ching Pui Sim </span>[2010] 2 SLR 76 (“<span class="font-italic">Ching</span><span class="font-italic"> Chew Weng Paul</span>”) at [55] – [58], <span class="font-italic">Fo</span><span class="font-italic">ng Wai Lyn Carolyn v Kao Chai-Chau Linda and others </span>[2017] 4 SLR 1018 (“<span class="font-italic">Carolyn Fong</span>”) at [35] and <span class="font-italic">Lakshmi Anil </span><span class="font-italic">Salgaocar v Vivek Sudarshan Khabya </span>[2017] 4 SLR 1124 at [41]–[61]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 As the facts of <span class="font-italic">Wong Moy </span>are pertinent to my analysis, I set them out in some detail<span class="font-italic">. </span>The appellant, Wong Moy, claimed to be the lawful widow of the deceased, married under Chinese customary rites in 1952. In 1964, the deceased purported to marry the respondent, Soo Ah Choy, at the Registry of Marriages. The deceased died intestate in 1995. Before extracting the letters of administration, on 30 August 1995, the appellant commenced an action to seek a declaration that two properties were held by the respondent on trust for the estate. As the two properties had been sold in April 1981 and January 1995, well before the proceedings commenced, the appellant’s claim was directed at their proceeds of sale, and the appellant obtained an <span class="font-italic">ex</span><span class="font-italic"> parte </span>injunction restraining the respondent from disposing of her assets up to a value of $3.5m. In particular, there was an order stating that the <span class="font-italic">assets </span>included the balance of the proceeds from the sale of the two properties. The respondent applied to discharge the injunction on the ground that the appellant lacked <span class="font-italic">locus </span><span class="font-italic">standi </span>to bring the proceedings. The High Court struck out the action, and discharged the <span class="font-italic">ex</span><span class="font-italic"> parte </span>injunction on the basis that the appellant’s failure to extract the grant of letters of administration to the estate meant that she had no capacity to sue and as such the writ was a nullity. On appeal, the Court of Appeal held that special circumstances existed to enable the appellant to bring the action <span class="font-italic">qua </span>beneficiary, and reinstated the writ, the statement of claim, as well as the interim injunction. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 With that in mind, I turn to the first point made by Mr Yong’s counsel that based on <span class="font-italic">Wong Moy</span><span class="font-italic">,</span> a beneficiary does not have <span class="font-italic">locus </span><span class="font-italic">standi </span>to pursue purely pecuniary claims on behalf of an estate. It bears noting in this regard that the High Court in <span class="font-italic">Omar</span> cited the following remarks from <span class="font-italic">Re Atkinson, deceased </span>[1971] VR 612 (“<span class="font-italic">Re Atkinson</span>”) at 700 to explain that the basis for such proceedings by a beneficiary is that “they are taken on behalf of the estate and if they are successful, they can only result in the lost property being restored to the estate for use in the due course of administration. Thus, while they assert the beneficiary’s right of remedy, they assert the estate’s right of property…” Therefore, I agreed with Mr Yong’s counsel’s contention that a beneficiary would not have <span class="font-italic">locus </span><span class="font-italic">standi </span>to pursue a personal claim with pecuniary reliefs on behalf of the estate. Any proceedings must be grounded in the need to protect and preserve the assets of the estate.   </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 However, did the action involve purely pecuniary claims? This was the second point argued by Mr Yong’s counsel, and in my view, the argument can be broken down to two aspects. First, Mr Yong’s counsel appeared to suggest that based on the cases, the assets to be protected should be restricted to certain classes of assets, and exclude money. Second, as I understood it, the contention was that the Statement of Claim did not include a claim for recovery of any of Mr Sia’s assets (and therefore, any assets of the estate). The action involved personal claims only. Taken together, I believe this was what Mr Yong’s counsel meant when he contended that there were no “proprietary claims” in the action by Mr Sia.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 On both counts, I was unable to agree with Mr Yong’s counsel. I deal with the first aspect quickly. I saw no reason to read <span class="font-italic">Wong Moy </span>restrictively so as to limit its applicability only to the protection of certain classes of assets, excluding money. Money belonging to an estate is as much an asset or property of the estate as any other asset of the estate. I did not see any basis to distinguish between the money transferred by Mr Sia to Mr Yong from the balance proceeds from the sale of the two properties claimed to be in the hands of the respondent in <span class="font-italic">Wong Moy</span>: see [26] above<span class="font-italic">. </span>Money is a fungible asset and in fact, as argued by Ms Sia’s counsel, money which has flowed into the hands of a defendant is at greater risk of further dissipation by the defendant. The difficulty lies in providing suitable interim relief to protect such a fungible asset, which is set out from [68] below.    </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 On the second aspect, I deal first with the sums of money transferred from Mr Sia to Mr Yong. From a perusal of the Statement of Claim, it was my view that a proprietary claim over the sums of money had been asserted. To support the proprietary claim, Mr Sia prayed for a tracing order, so as to identify money, proceeds or assets held by Mr Yong traceable to the money of the estate: see [13] above.   </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 I deal next with Mr Sia’s share in the Emerald Garden property. As things stood, it was true that the Statement of Claim did not disclose a proprietary claim for the 7/20 share in the Emerald Garden property. Nonetheless, based on the facts as pleaded, there was sufficient material to sustain a proprietary claim over the share in the Emerald Garden property, and to specifically seek proprietary relief over the asset. In particular, Mr Sia detailed how the transfer was carried out not only at an undervalue, but that the consideration paid by Mr Yong of $290,000 was transferred back to Mr Yong’s account. In other words, Mr Sia alleged that there was no consideration for the transaction, providing the basis for challenging the transaction.    </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 In this connection, I disagreed with the contention by Mr Yong’s counsel that Ms Sia was seeking to be in a better position than Mr Sia (or the estate). Rather, in my view, Ms Sia was seeking to put forth a position that was available to Mr Sia, and would be available to the estate. Mr Sia’s position was not cast in stone. Nor is the estate’s. Depending on the outcome of the probate proceedings, it is open to the estate to seek leave to amend the pleadings in the action in relation to its claim concerning the Emerald Garden property. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 In terms of the objection by Mr Yong’s counsel that there was no evidence available from Mr Sia to support a proprietary claim in relation to the Emerald Garden property, it would suffice for me to observe that this was not a case where such a claim would be untenable because of the demise of Mr Sia. Apart from the statutory declaration made by Mr Sia, documentary evidence would also be available, and the overall facts and circumstances of the transaction would also fall to be evaluated by the court. While this was not the appropriate stage to evaluate the merits of such a claim, Ms Sia’s position would not be factually unsustainable. Indeed, in relation to such a claim, there was a serious question to be tried. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 Further, even if Ms Sia’s position could be said to be inconsistent with that taken in the action by Mr Sia, this should not weigh against Ms Sia’s case. Her position would not be prejudicial to the estate, but instead would serve to protect the assets of the estate. Admittedly, at some point, the estate might have to clarify its position. But I should highlight that unlike the beneficiaries in <span class="font-italic">Wong Moy </span>and the other cases<span class="font-italic">, </span>Ms Sia did not commence the action. Instead, Ms Sia merely sought to intervene in an action commenced by Mr Sia. In principle, I see no reason why the rule in <span class="font-italic">Wong Moy </span>should not be applicable to provide a basis for a beneficiary of the estate to be added to proceedings so as to protect or recover assets of the estate. More importantly, I see no reason to consider the case purely on the basis of the claims and remedies as originally pleaded by Mr Sia. If a proprietary claim might have been sought by Ms Sia should she have started the proceedings as a beneficiary, with the appropriate relief so as to protect an asset of the estate, such matters may be considered by the court. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 To sum up, in relation to the second point contended by Mr Yong’s counsel, I would not characterise the Statement of Claim as one disclosing purely pecuniary reliefs. Instead, the action is one giving rise to both personal and proprietary claims in relation to the money belonging to the estate. In relation to the share in the Emerald Garden property, a proprietary claim with consequential relief is supportable based on the material facts as pleaded in the Statement of Claim.   </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 Moving on, I go to the third point raised by Mr Yong’s counsel that there were no special circumstances so as to allow Ms Sia to intervene. In <span class="font-italic">Wong Moy, </span>it is said that “special circumstances” should not be read too inflexibly as it may lead to injustice, and are not confined to cases where the personal representative has defaulted in acting. All the circumstances of the case should be considered including the nature of the assets, the position of the personal representative and the reason for the default of the personal representative in taking action. It may be pertinent to see whether the circumstances made it impossible, or at least seriously inconvenient for the representatives to take proceedings: see [24] and [28]. In <span class="font-italic">Carolyn</span><span class="font-italic"> Fong</span>, the High Court added that establishing “special circumstances” is a fact-specific inquiry which includes taking cognisance of factors such as the executor’s willingness or inability to sue, the merits of the case and the potential loss to the beneficiaries: see [9].   </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 Having considered the facts and circumstances, I agreed with Ms Sia’s counsel that there were indeed special circumstances present in this case which justified adding Ms Sia in the action to protect the assets of the estate. Ordinarily, the proper party to obtain a remedy on behalf of and for the benefit of the estate is the executor (<span class="font-italic">Carolyn</span> <span class="font-italic">Fong </span>at [7]). In this case, pending the resolution of the probate proceedings, the estate was without any executor, and thus, any personal representative. Indeed, the application for substitution taken out by Ms Sia and Mr Chua had failed. As such, it was impossible for the estate to take any action to protect its position in the action, and to protect the assets of the estate, should Mr Yong take any action which might be prejudicial to the estate such as dissipating the assets in Singapore so as to frustrate the recovery of any of the assets of the estate. There was also added need for Ms Sia to intervene, given that the nature of some of the assets was money.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 In light of the foregoing, I found that there were special circumstances present in this case which warranted Ms Sia’s intervention. On the mechanism for doing so, O 15 r 6(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>)(ii) of the ROC states:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Subject to the provisions of this Rule, at any stage of the proceedings in any cause or matter, the Court may, on such terms as it thinks just … or on application –</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(b) order any or the following persons to be added as a party, namely: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-2 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(ii) any person between whom and any party to the cause or matter there may exist a question or issue arising out of or relating to or connected with any relief or remedy claimed in the cause or matter which in the opinion of the Court it would be just and convenient to determine as between him and that party as well as between the parties to the cause or matter.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 As a beneficiary of the estate, Ms Sia was seeking to protect the assets of the estate which formed the subject matter of the action. The questions between Ms Sia and Mr Yong as to whether any assets belonged to the estate, and whether such assets required any interim protection were related to the action by Mr Sia. Based on all of the discussion above, it was just and convenient under Order 15 rule 6(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>)(ii) of the ROC to add Ms Sia as a second plaintiff in the action. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 I should add that in order to grant leave for Ms Sia to intervene, I also had to lift the stay order. Relying on <span class="font-italic">Rotary Engineering Ltd </span><span class="font-italic">and others v Kioumji &amp; Eslim Law Firm and another and another appeal</span> [2017] 1 SLR 907 (“<span class="font-italic">Rotary </span><span class="font-italic">Engineering</span>”) at [24], Ms Sia’s counsel submitted that a court is empowered to lift a stay it made where the premise of the stay no longer holds. <span class="font-italic">Rotary </span><span class="font-italic">Engineering</span> involved a stay of proceedings on the ground of <span class="font-italic">forum non </span><span class="font-italic">conveniens. </span>There<span class="font-italic">,</span> the Court of Appeal held that the effect of the stay was suspensory only such that the court remains seised of the proceedings and may in principle lift the stay at a later stage. In this case, the stay order was granted so that the question of who the rightful executor of the estate should be would be litigated in the probate proceedings. There can be no doubt that the court is empowered to lift the stay order. As it had become necessary for Ms Sia, the beneficiary of the estate to take steps to protect the estate in the action, it was appropriate for the court to lift the stay. As stated above at [4], the stay was lifted for limited purposes only. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 To end off, I should deal with Mr Yong’s counsel’s argument that this was a re-litigation of the application for substitution, and by the operation of <span class="font-italic">res judicata</span>, the application to intervene should not be permitted<span class="font-italic">. </span>I found this submission to be misconceived. The two applications were brought on wholly different bases. The application for substitution was meant for Ms Sia and Mr Chua to be substituted as the plaintiff in the action to proceed with the litigation, and was premised on them being the rightful executors of the estate. This application to intervene was entirely different, and was premised on Ms Sia’s interest as a beneficiary of the estate, so as to protect the assets of the estate. As such, the factual and legal issues in the two applications were completely different, and <span class="font-italic">res judicata </span>did not operate to bar the application to intervene. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The interim injunction application</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The parties’ cases</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 Turning to the interim injunction application, again, Ms Sia’s counsel relied on <span class="font-italic">Wong Moy, </span>and sought an interim injunction similar to that granted in there: see [26] above<span class="font-italic">.</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>Ms Sia’s counsel characterised the interim injunction granted in <span class="font-italic">Wong Moy </span>as a Mareva injunction, and sought an order prohibiting Mr Yong from disposing of his assets in Singapore up to the amount of $1,255,184 to protect the anticipated fruits of the litigation.

In relation to the application to intervene, Mr Yong’s counsel highlighted the distinction between personal and proprietary claims. This was to support his contention that the Statement of Claim did not contain proprietary claims, and therefore Ms Sia was not entitled to intervene as a beneficiary. However, Mr Yong’s counsel did not go further to articulate the dichotomy between two types of injunctive relief available – the Mareva injunction and the proprietary injunction – which serve to support personal and proprietary claims respectively, and whether a beneficiary is entitled to pursue the former relief. It is to this question that I now turn.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 As explained by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Bouvier</span><span class="font-italic">, Yves Charles Edgar and another v Accent Delight International Ltd</span> <span class="font-italic">and another and another appeal </span>[2015] 5 SLR 558 (“<span class="font-italic">Bouvier</span>”) at [144], a proprietary injunction is a relief that “fastens on the specific asset” in which the plaintiff asserts a proprietary interest, and prevents the defendant from dealing with that asset and its traceable proceeds. The applicable test would be that set out in <span class="font-italic">American Cyanamid Co v Ethicon Ltd </span>[1975] AC 396 (“<span class="font-italic">American Cyanamid</span>”). In contrast, as set out in <span class="font-italic">Bouvier</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [143], a Mareva injunction is granted in support of a claim for personal relief, which does not latch on to any specific asset of the defendant, but prevents the defendant from disposing of his assets beyond a certain value to defeat a possible judgment that may be rendered against him.  <span class="font-italic"> </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 In preparing these grounds of decision, I have come to the view that the interim injunction in <span class="font-italic">Wong Moy</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>was proprietary in nature. This issue was not specifically discussed in either in <span class="font-italic">Wong Moy </span>or the High Court grounds of decision in <span class="font-italic">Wong Moy (</span><span class="font-italic">administratrix of the estate of Theng Chee Khim, deceased) v Soo Ah Choy </span>[1995] 3 SLR(R) 822. I noted that while the interim injunction in <span class="font-italic">Wong Moy</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>appeared to prohibit the respondent from disposing of her assets up to a value of $3.5m, the order also specified that the assets include “the net sale money of the properties”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 To reiterate, the legal proposition in <span class="font-italic">Wong Moy</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>is that under special circumstances, a beneficiary of an estate may take proceedings to protect the assets of an unadministered estate. I note that in <span class="font-italic">Omar, </span>the High Court cited from <span class="font-italic">Re Atkinson </span>that “any beneficiary would be entitled to the remedy in a court of equity to which the estate was entitled”. Expanding on this, in<span class="font-italic"> </span><span class="font-italic">Ching Chew Weng Paul</span>, the High Court concluded that a beneficiary was not confined to seeking declaratory reliefs, and may claim <span class="font-italic">any </span>reliefs on behalf of the estate (at [58]-[59]). While <span class="font-italic">Omar </span>and <span class="font-italic">Ching</span><span class="font-italic"> Chew Weng Paul </span>seemed to suggest that a beneficiary may claim <span class="font-italic">any </span>reliefs on behalf of the estate, this should be circumscribed by a requirement that the reliefs must be in support of proprietary claims to protect and preserve the assets of an estate. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 To the extent that Ms Sia’s counsel relied on <span class="font-italic">Wong Moy </span>to seek to protect the entire benefit which might accrue to the estate by virtue of an anticipated monetary judgment flowing from a successful claim for personal relief, this was misplaced. Ms Sia was not in the position to protect the fruits of litigation which might accrue to the estate out of purely personal claims. It was open to Ms Sia, however, to rely on <span class="font-italic">Wong Moy </span>to seek an interim injunction to protect the assets of the estate. As I shall explain shortly, in my view, Ms Sia had satisfied the test for doing so.   </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Applicable legal test for a proprietary injunction   </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 Before me, the parties argued the twin issues whether there was a good arguable case, and whether there was a real risk of dissipation of the assets. In my decision on 29 November 2017, I accepted that both elements had been established. Given my view of the nature of the interim injunction in <span class="font-italic">Wong Moy,</span> and therefore, the nature of relief that Ms Sia could avail herself of, the <span class="font-italic">American Cyanamid</span> principles would be applicable instead.

<div class="FootnoteRef text-justify">  In <span class="font-italic">Wong Moy, </span>the interim injunction was originally granted on an <span class="font-italic">ex parte </span>basis on 30 August 1995, and reinstated by the Court of Appeal.

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> Therefore, the two key questions should be whether there was a serious question to be tried, and whether the balance of convenience favoured the grant of such an injunction. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 I am mindful that parties did not provide submissions based on the <span class="font-italic">American Cyan</span><span class="font-italic">amid </span>principles. However, I found their arguments in relation to a Mareva injunction relevant to the two key requirements to be met under <span class="font-italic">American Cyan</span><span class="font-italic">amid. </span>Also, the parties had thoroughly ventilated the pertinent facts and circumstances of the case. Therefore, I shall explain how my findings relate to the <span class="font-italic">American Cyanamid </span>principles, and expand on the reasons for my findings on 29 November 2017.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 First, there is a serious question to be tried as long as the applicant can show that it has “a seriously arguable case that [the applicant has] a proprietary interest”: <span class="font-italic">Bouvier</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [151]. As I stated in my findings on 29 November 2017, there was a good arguable case made out by Ms Sia. For the same reasons, I am of the view that Ms Sia had established that there was a seriously arguable case that the estate has a proprietary interest which should be protected.    </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 The key cause of action relied on was undue influence exercised by Mr Yong to Mr Sia’s detriment. Broadly speaking, to establish presumed undue influence (which Ms Sia’s counsel argued on), a plaintiff must show the existence of a particular relationship in which one party reposed trust and confidence in the other party, and that the transaction in question is not readily explicable by the relationship of the parties: see <span class="font-italic">First Asia Capital Investments Ltd v </span><span class="font-italic">Société Générale Bank &amp; Trust and another </span>[2017] SGHC 78 at [83].<span class="font-italic"> </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 On the requirement of a relationship of influence, the Statement of Claim stated that when Mr Sia faced marital problems, suffered from ill health and was abandoned by his family, he confided in and stayed with Mr Yong over a period of time from 2010 to 2012. The same position was stated by Mr Sia in his statutory declaration of 19 June 2015. In Mr Yong’s Defence, as well as in his various affidavits filed for the action, Mr Yong did not deny that Mr Sia placed trust and confidence in him, including in relation to his financial affairs. The fact of a relationship of trust and confidence was not seriously disputed. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 As for the transactions, within less than two years between 2010 to 2012, Mr Sia transferred a sum of $1,192,090.80 to Mr Yong. He also transferred the share of the Emerald Garden property to Mr Yong for no consideration. At the end of the day, it would appear that these assets formed the bulk of what Mr Sia owned. By the time Mr Sia commenced the action, he could not afford to pay for legal representation, and instead had to resort to obtaining legal aid. There was evidence to support the case that the transactions were disadvantageous to Mr Sia.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 Of course, Mr Yong’s explanations for these transactions were that these were gifts, or transfers made willingly by Mr Sia for various reasons. In due course, the court would have to evaluate the parties’ positions. Admittedly, the Statement of Claim is not drafted very clearly, and might well have to be amended. For this reason, Mr Yong’s counsel contended that the cause of action of “undue influence” was not specifically pleaded. Notwithstanding the lack of clarity in the Statement of Claim, I was of the view that sufficient material facts had been disclosed so as to give Mr Yong notice that the gravamen of the claim against him included undue influence. As for the contention by Mr Yong’s counsel that Ms Sia has taken a position different from Mr Sia in relation to the Emerald Garden property, I have already set out my views above at [33]. Any inconsistency did not detract from the strength of the cause of action based on undue influence as disclosed by the material facts. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 By the above, I found that there was a seriously arguable case of undue influence such that the estate has a proprietary claim in the assets, being the money and the share in the Emerald Garden property.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 In considering the balance of convenience, whether there was a real risk of Mr Yong dissipating his assets in Singapore was a significant consideration. Based on the facts and circumstances, I found that that there was a real risk that Mr Yong would dissipate his assets in Singapore, and that this would in turn frustrate the recovery of the assets of the estate.   </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 It was undisputed that Mr Yong had disposed of the 13/20 share in the Emerald Garden property for the sum of $942,500. This would include the 7/20 share transferred from Mr Sia to Mr Yong. Contrary to the submission by Mr Yong’s counsel that there was nothing untoward about this transaction, I was gravely concerned by the circumstances surrounding the transaction. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 While it is true that Mr Sia did not specifically stake a proprietary claim for the 7/20 share in the Emerald Garden property, it was an asset involved in the proceedings. As Ms Sia’s counsel pointed out, prior to the transaction, Mr Sia had tried to take a loan from United Overseas Bank using his share of the Emerald Garden property as security. The bank rejected him because of the claims which involved the Emerald Garden property in the action and the probate proceedings. Indeed, Mr Yong used this to explain that “he had no choice but to sell it” to his daughter.

</div>
</div> However, in my view, this background should have alerted Mr Yong to the fact that there might be concerns about any dealings with his share in the Emerald Garden property. Therefore, I disagreed with Mr Yong’s counsel that by so acting, Mr Yong was not seeking to dissipate his assets, or that there was any risk that he would do so. In general, the liquidation of immovable property raises a degree of concern as to a risk of dissipation of assets, and this case was no different.   </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63  Further, I was not convinced by Mr Yong’s explanation that he sold his share of the Emerald Garden property for the sole reason of raising funds for litigation purposes. According to Mr Yong, funds were required to pay for the legal costs of the action and the probate proceedings.

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> No reasons were provided as to why the funds needed for Mr Yong’s litigation of the action and the probate proceedings suddenly ballooned to close to four times the initial amount. It was also troubling that Mr Yong would dispose of the entire 13/20 share in the Emerald Garden property, rather than his original 6/20 share. Taking the consideration of $942,500 for transfer of the 13/20 share, the transfer of the 6/20 share would have been worth around $435,000, which would have been almost double the $240,000 which Mr Yong originally thought was necessary. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 In relation to the transaction, I placed little weight on the fact that there appeared to be a proper valuation and legal advice underpinning it. Given that Ms Yong had to obtain a bank loan, it would probably have been necessary for them to do so.   </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 In my view, the transaction posed a threat to the assets of the estate in two ways. First, given that Mr Sia’s claims centred on the recovery of money from Mr Yong, the fact that Mr Yong has disposed of the real asset into a large sum of money increased the difficulty of tracking and tracing the money belonging to Mr Sia (and the estate), and facilitated the disposal of the money belonging to Mr Sia (and the estate). Second, Mr Yong’s need for such a huge amount of money caused concerns as well. If it were true that Mr Yong required the sum of $942,500 for legal costs, this suggested that Mr Yong was expending his assets (and assets which might be due to the estate) at a very fast pace. After all, Mr Yong had received more than $1,000,000 from Mr Sia about five years ago. He claimed that he lived a modest lifestyle, and appeared to be getting income from at least two sole proprietorships. This was a fairly alarming situation. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 Based on the foregoing, I was of the view that there was a real risk of dissipation of any remaining assets of the estate which remained in the hands of Mr Yong, making it difficult for the estate to recover such assets. On a balance of convenience, a proprietary injunction should be granted. The fact of the matter is that given the tussle between Mr Yong and Ms Sia (and Mr Chua) over the rightful executor(s) of the estate, the estate was not able to act to protect its position in full. Given the context, the factors weighed in favour of the grant of an interim injunction so as to secure the assets of the estate. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 For completeness, I should deal with the contention by Mr Yong’s counsel that there had been undue delay on Ms Sia’s part in filing the interim injunction application, and that it was not a <span class="font-italic">bona fide </span>application. It was pointed out that the application was lodged close to three months after discovering Mr Yong’s disposal of the 13/20 share in the Emerald Garden property, and was meant to oppress Mr Yong. At the same time, Mr Yong’s counsel contended that Ms Sia was delaying the probate proceedings. However, Ms Sia explained that having lost the application for substitution, she had to consider the merits of the present applications carefully. She also had to take into account her financial position. I did not find undue delay on Ms Sia’s part in taking the present applications such that she should be denied relief. As for concerns about the progress of the probate proceedings, it was incumbent on both parties to ensure that they proceed expeditiously.    </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Scope of the interim injunction     </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 I turn to the terms of the interim injunction order granted. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 I note that the interim injunction in <span class="font-italic">Wong Moy </span>was crafted in wide terms up to the value of $3.5m, with the respondent’s assets to include the balance of the proceeds from the sale of the two properties. The order<span class="font-italic"> </span>did not specify any bank account, any repository of the balance sale proceeds or any asset which might represent the balance sale proceeds. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 I ordered that Mr Yong be prohibited from disposing of his assets in Singapore up to the value of $1 million only. I had capped this amount, and not taken into account the sum of $227,000 which Ms Sia’s counsel submitted to be the profit made by Mr Yong arising from the transfer of Mr Sia’s share in the Emerald Garden property, and which he specifically asked to be included in computing the value to be stipulated in the order. This was in recognition of the fact that Ms Sia’s interest was to protect the assets of the estate, and not to protect a pure monetary claim. The sum of $1 million was meant to broadly represent the value of the assets of the estate which had flowed to Mr Yong, and in any event, Mr Yong had admitted that he received around that amount from Mr Sia. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">71 However, rather than stating that Mr Yong’s assets to be covered by the interim injunction would include the full sale proceeds of the 13/20 share of the Emerald Garden property, I should have stated that only the sale proceeds of the 7/20 share of the same (which would translate to about $507,500) would be included. In line with the discussion above, it would be the balance sale proceeds of the 7/20 share which fall to be protected as assets to be recovered for the estate.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">72 Further, I had included the assets of Mr Yong’s businesses within the interim injunction. This was because of the allegation by Mr Sia that some of the transfers of money were purportedly for investments, and as purported “loans” to Mr Yong’s maid business: see [11] above.     </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">73 In conclusion, I granted the applications, with costs to be reserved.    </div><div class="Judg-Sign text-left"></div><div class="Judg-Sign text-left"></div><div class="Judg-Sign text-left"></div><div class="Judg-Sign text-left"></div><div class="Judg-Sign text-left"></div><div class="Judg-Sign text-left"></div><div class="Judg-Sign text-left">Hoo Sheau Peng  <br/>Judge</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Lok Vi Ming SC, Lee Sien Liang Joseph, Tang Jin Sheng, Tan Jia Hui and Ng Hian Pheng Evans (LVM Law Chambers LLC) for the non-party;<br/>Christopher Anand s/o Daniel and Ang Si Yi (Advocatus Law LLP) for the defendant.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-List text-justify"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
