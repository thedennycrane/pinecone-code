<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       The two accused persons are Malaysians from the
                    state of Johor, Malaysia. The first accused is Mas Swan Bin Adnan (“Mas
                    Swan”), 27 years old and unemployed at the time of his
                        arrest;<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span>
                    the second accused is Roshamima Binti Roslan (“Roshamima”),
                    nicknamed “Wawa”,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span> a 24-year-old recovery officer for
                    a bank in Malaysia at the time of her arrest.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span> The two were in a romantic
                    relationship and were due to be engaged on 6 June 2009 and get married
                    the following day. Their marriage plans came to an abrupt halt, however, after
                    they were arrested on 6 May 2009 when entering Singapore in a
                    Malaysian-registered motor car bearing registration number JHA 7781
                    (“JHA 7781”). Three bundles comprising 123 packets containing
                    a total of 21.48 grams of diamorphine were found in the car.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       As a result, they were committed to stand trial
                    on one joint charge under s 7 of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2008 Rev
                    Ed) (“MDA”) for importing not less than 21.48 grams of diamorphine
                    read with s 34 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed”)
                    (“Penal Code”) (“the Charge”):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">That you [both] on the 6<sup>th</sup> day of May 2009, at
                        or about 9.56 p.m. in a Malaysian registered motor car JHA 7781, at
                        Woodlands Checkpoint, Singapore ... in furtherance of the common intention
                        of you both, did import into Singapore a controlled drug specified in Class
                        A of the First Schedule of the [MDA], Chapter 185, to wit, one hundred and
                        twenty-three (123) packets of substances containing not less than 21.48
                        grams of diamorphine, without any authorization under the said Act or the
                        Regulations made thereunder, and you have thereby committed an offence under
                        section 7 of the [MDA] read with section 34 of the Penal Code, Chapter 224
                        and punishable under section 33 of the [MDA].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       In their respective defences, both accused
                    persons adopted different and sometimes conflicting positions. Essentially, Mas
                    Swan admitted to importing bundles which he believed contained
                    “ecstasy” pills and implicated Roshamima as well, whereas
                    Roshamima denied having any knowledge of the existence or presence of the
                    bundles in the car altogether.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Background facts</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The events leading up to the arrests</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       On 6 May 2009, at about 9.56 pm, Mas
                    Swan and Roshamima arrived at the Woodlands Immigration Checkpoint
                    (“Woodlands Checkpoint”) from Malaysia in JHA 7781. When
                    Corporal Muhammad Ilhan Bin Rahmat, the Immigration and Checkpoints Authority
                    (“ICA”) officer who was on duty at Counter 28, screened Mas
                    Swan’s passport for clearance, he was immediately alerted that Mas Swan
                    had been blacklisted. The ICA Quick Response Team (“QRT”) was
                    notified and they dispatched two officers to Counter 28. After they arrived, the
                    QRT officers gave instructions to Mas Swan to drive to the ICA Arrival Car
                    Secondary Team Office (“ST Office”) and to park JHA 7781 at
                    one of the parking lots, with which instructions Mas Swan
                complied.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       Mas Swan and Roshamima were later directed to
                    drive JHA 7781 to the Inspection Pit with an ICA officer in the rear seat.
                    At the Inspection Pit, a manual search of the interior and undercarriage of
                    JHA 7781 was carried out but nothing incriminating was found. Mas Swan was
                    then instructed to drive JHA 7781 to the Scanning Area where a backscatter
                    scan (<em>ie</em>, an X-ray scan using a Backscatter Van)
                    was conducted on the car. The scan detected three dark spots in the front left
                    door panel of JHA 7781. One of the ICA officers shone his torchlight into
                    the door panel and spotted a green bundle inside.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       The Police K-9 unit was mobilised but the dogs
                    did not detect the presence of any drugs. JHA 7781 was then driven to the
                    Detention Yard for a more thorough inspection, and Mas Swan and Roshamima were
                    escorted there on foot. At the Detention Yard, the front left door panel was
                    opened partially and three bundles were retrieved from within the door panel:
                    two were wrapped in green tape (the “green bundle” or
                    “green bundles”, as the case may be) and one was wrapped in black
                    tape (the “black bundle”). One of the green bundles was cut open
                    by Sergeant Muhammad Jasman Bin Sinwan (“Sgt Jasman”) using a pen
                    knife in the presence of Mas Swan and Roshamima and it was found to contain
                    brown granular substances. Sgt Jasman could not recall, however, whether he had
                    shown the brown substance to Mas Swan or Roshamima.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span> Both Mas Swan and Roshamima
                    were immediately placed under arrest and officers from the Central Narcotics
                    Bureau (“CNB”) were notified accordingly.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       One green bundle consisted of 61 smaller packets
                    which subsequent analysis by the Health Science Authority (“HSA”)
                    showed to contain 6.81 grams of diamorphine. The other green bundle comprised 61
                    smaller packets which were found to contain 6.55 grams of diamorphine. The black
                    bundle comprised just one packet and was found to contain 8.12 grams of
                    diamorphine. The diamorphine found in all three bundles formed the subject of
                    the Charge against both Mas Swan and Roshamima (see <a href="#p1_2">[2]</a> above). Mas Swan and Roshamima did not challenge the
                    analysis by the HSA of the nature or of the weight of the granular substances
                    contained in the bundles seized from JHA 7781.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       Mas Swan and Roshamima were then taken to the
                    CNB B3 Office at Woodlands Checkpoint at about 12.40 am on
                    7 May 2009.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The statements recorded from Mas Swan</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       After they were brought to the CNB B3 Office at Woodlands Checkpoint, Sergeant Azhar Bin Abdul Aziz (“Sgt Azhar”) recorded a contemporaneous statement (“P31”)<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_5" id="Ftn_5_1"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span> from Mas Swan between 1.43 am and 1.55 am. A total of four questions were posed in Malay to Mas Swan who also gave his answers in Malay. Sgt Azhar recorded the entire statement in English:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">Q1.</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">What is this?</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">A1.</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">I don’t know</span></p>

<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">A4.</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">To meet my girlfriend’s aunty to collect marriage gifts.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1">After recording the statement, Sgt Azhar interpreted it back to Mas Swan in Malay and he duly signed it.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     At 3.21 am, a police report was lodged at
                    Woodlands Checkpoint Police Station and the three bundles found in JHA 7781 were
                    seized. Both Mas Swan and Roshamima were sent to the CNB headquarters at the
                    Police Cantonment Complex (“PCC”), where Assistant Superintendent
                    of Police Chan Gin Choong (“ASP Gary Chan”) recorded a cautioned
                        statement<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_6" id="Ftn_6_1"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span> from Mas Swan (“P32”) under

                    (“CPC”) with the assistance of a Malay interpreter, Ms Sofia
                    Bte Sufri (“Ms Sofia”). ASP Gary Chan, who had earlier been
                    appointed the investigating officer at around 12.30 am,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_7" id="Ftn_7_1"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span> spoke in English and
                    recorded the following confession in P32 from Mas Swan between 8.02 am and 8.34
                    am of 7 May 2009 in his office (room B0310B):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I admit guilty to the charge. This is my first time bringing drugs into
                        Singapore.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">During the trial, Mas Swan challenged the admissibility of P32 which,
                    accordingly, became the subject of a <em>voir dire</em>. I
                    will be addressing the admissibility of P32 in a later section of my judgment
                    (see <a href="#p1_21">[21]</a>–<a href="#p1_31">[31]</a> below).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     Another six long statements were recorded from

<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The <em>voir dire</em></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     As mentioned at <a href="#p1_10">[10]</a> above, Mas Swan challenged the admissibility of P32 and
                    P35. The challenge against P35 was subsequently withdrawn, and rightly so, given
                    that Mas Swan’s position <em>vis-à-vis</em> P35 was
                    that some words therein were not mentioned by him. In <em>Seeraj
                        Ajodha and others v The State</em> [1982] AC 204 (an appeal to the
                    Judicial Committee of the Privy Council from the decision of the Court of Appeal
                    of Trinidad and Tobago) at 222, Lord Bridge of Harwich stated that if the
                    Prosecution relied upon certain oral statements and the Defence’s case was
                    simply that the interview never took place or that the incriminating answers
                    were never given by him, no issue as to voluntariness and hence no question of
                    admissibility arose. What was left for the trial judge to determine was a
                    question of fact, <em>ie</em>, whether those words were
                    stated by the accused or not. Accordingly, a <em>voir
                        dire</em> was not necessary in relation to P35 and was, as such,
                    conducted only in respect of the admissibility of P32.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The law on the admissibility of confessions</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     Section 24 of the Evidence Act (Cap 97, 1997
                    Rev Ed) ( “EA”) governs the admissibility of a confession made by
                    an accused person:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>Confession caused by inducement, threat or promise when
                            irrelevant in criminal proceeding</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>24</b>. A confession made by an accused person
                        is irrelevant in a criminal proceeding if the making of the confession
                        appears to the court to have been caused by any inducement, threat or
                        promise having reference to the charge against the accused person,
                        proceeding from a person in authority and sufficient in the opinion of the
                        court to give the accused person grounds which would appear to him
                        reasonable for supposing that by making it he would gain any advantage or
                        avoid any evil of a temporal nature in reference to the proceeding against
                        him.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     It must be noted that s 24 of the EA was
                    recently repealed by the Criminal Procedure Code 2010 (No 15 of 2010)
                    (“CPC 2010”).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_18" id="Ftn_18_1"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a></span> However, as P32 was
                    recorded on 7 May 2009, before the CPC 2010 came into effect on
                    2 January 2011, the admissibility of P32 remained to be determined
                    under s 24 of the EA.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The parties’ respective cases on the admissibility of
                P32</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     Mas Swan’s case on the inadmissibility
                    of P32 was simple and straightforward. He claimed that after the nature of the
                    Charge and the prescribed death penalty were interpreted to him by
                    Ms Sofia, the interpreter, she added the following words (in Malay)
                        “<em>Kalau mengaku nanti hukuman
                    rendahkan</em>” which translates to “If you admit, later the
                    sentence will be reduced”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_19" id="Ftn_19_1"><sup>[note: 19]</sup></a></span> (the “alleged
                    inducement”). Mas Swan claimed that, as a direct result of what
                    Ms Sofia had told him, he admitted to the Charge against him because he was
                    fearful for his life.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_20" id="Ftn_20_1"><sup>[note: 20]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     The Prosecution’s case was that P32 was
                    made voluntarily by Mas Swan and that the alleged inducement was simply a
                    desperate attempt to deny its admissibility.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The circumstances surrounding the recording of P32</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     Only three persons, Mas Swan, ASP Gary Chan
                    and Ms Sofia, were present in ASP Gary Chan’s office during the
                    recording of P32, and all three testified before me during the <em>voir dire</em>: ASP Gary Chan and Ms Sofia for the
                    Prosecution and Mas Swan for himself.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     During his cross-examination of ASP Gary Chan
                    and Ms Sofia, Mr Kanagavijayan advanced two positions in the
                        alternative:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_21" id="Ftn_21_1"><sup>[note: 21]</sup></a></span> first, that the alleged inducement had
                    come from ASP Gary Chan and Ms Sofia had merely interpreted the alleged
                    inducement to Mas Swan; and second, that Ms Sofia had, <em>of her own volition</em>, made the alleged inducement to Mas
                    Swan.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     Ms Sofia testified that she had not been
                    briefed about the case prior to the recording of P32 and that she had not
                    conversed with ASP Gary Chan during the few minutes when she was with him in his
                    office before Mas Swan was escorted there.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_22" id="Ftn_22_1"><sup>[note: 22]</sup></a></span> ASP Gary Chan’s
                    evidence was that he had not issued any threat, inducement or promise to Mas
                    Swan during the recording of P32. He also refuted the suggestion by
                    Mr Kanagavijayan that he had asked Ms Sofia to relay the alleged
                    inducement to Mas Swan. Similarly, Ms Sofia testified that ASP Gary Chan
                    did not instruct her to offer the alleged inducement to Mas Swan and that she
                    did not make the alleged inducement of her own accord. She also gave evidence
                    that she had used the words “<em>diamorphine atau
                        heroin</em>”, which translates to “diamorphine or
                    heroin”, when she explained the Charge to Mas Swan.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_23" id="Ftn_23_1"><sup>[note: 23]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     Although it was put or suggested to both ASP
                    Gary Chan and Ms Sofia that the alleged inducement came from ASP Gary Chan
                        <em>or</em> Ms Sofia, when it came to Mas
                    Swan’s turn to testify, he was adamant that the alleged inducement was
                    made by Ms Sofia and not ASP Gary Chan.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_24" id="Ftn_24_1"><sup>[note: 24]</sup></a></span> According to Mas Swan (who
                    claimed that he could understand a bit of what ASP Gary Chan had said in
                        English),<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_25" id="Ftn_25_1"><sup>[note: 25]</sup></a></span> ASP Gary Chan did not say anything
                    immediately before Ms Sofia made the alleged inducement.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_26" id="Ftn_26_1"><sup>[note: 26]</sup></a></span> Mas Swan
                    also testified that Ms Sofia did not say the words “or
                    heroin” when she explained the Charge to him.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_27" id="Ftn_27_1"><sup>[note: 27]</sup></a></span>
                    Accordingly, the only issue that arose for determination in the <em>voir dire</em> was whether Ms Sofia had made the alleged
                    inducement and had done so of her own accord.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Conclusion on the admissibility of P32</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     I accepted Ms Sofia’s evidence that
                    she did not make the alleged inducement to Mas Swan for the following
                    reasons:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_29-p2_a"></a>(a)     First, there was no conceivable
                        reason for Ms Sofia, who was merely acting as an interpreter, to offer
                        any inducement to Mas Swan of her own volition. I rejected
                        Mr Kanagavijayan’s suggestion that Ms Sofia had made the
                        alleged inducement in order to make her task easier by getting Mas Swan to
                        admit to the Charge.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_28" id="Ftn_28_1"><sup>[note: 28]</sup></a></span> In my judgment, there was simply no
                        factual or logical basis for Ms Sofia, who was an interpreter of
                        considerable experience (a total of 14 years when P32 was
                            recorded),<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_29" id="Ftn_29_1"><sup>[note: 29]</sup></a></span> to believe that her task would be
                        made easier once Mas Swan admitted to the Charge. In fact, what happened was
                        that after P32 was recorded, she was subsequently involved in the recording
                        of six other statements from Mas Swan. Clearly, her task was not made any
                        easier by Mas Swan’s “confession” in
                    P32.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_29-p2_b"></a>(b)     Second, Mas
                        Swan’s conduct was entirely inconsistent with his own case. Although
                        Mas Swan claimed that he became fearful after being told of the death
                        penalty, incredulously, he admitted that he did not ask for further details
                        regarding the reduction of his sentence or seek independent assurance from
                        ASP Gary Chan, whom Mas Swan knew full well was the investigator in charge
                        of the interview.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_30" id="Ftn_30_1"><sup>[note: 30]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     In the result, I found that P32 was
                    voluntarily made by Mas Swan without inducement and admitted it as evidence in
                    the main trial. Accordingly, all the statements recorded from Mas Swan were
                    admitted as evidence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     I remarked at the conclusion of the <em>voir dire</em> that Mas Swan’s challenge against the
                    admissibility of P32 was wholly unnecessary.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_31" id="Ftn_31_1"><sup>[note: 31]</sup></a></span> Notably, the
                    Prosecution’s put to Mas Swan during the <em>voir
                        dire</em> was that there could not have been any inducement as there
                    was no mention of “diamorphine”, which was the subject matter of
                    the charge, in P32. Further, the Prosecution readily accepted that Mas Swan did
                    not admit to knowing that the bundles contained “diamorphine” in
                    any of his statements.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_32" id="Ftn_32_1"><sup>[note: 32]</sup></a></span> In
                    other words, there was nothing in P32 which was materially different from what
                    had already been disclosed in Mas Swan’s other statements which he did not
                    challenge.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The Prosecution’s case</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The statutory provisions</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     The following provisions of the MDA were
                    relied upon by the Prosecution:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>Import and export of controlled drugs</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>7</b>. Except as authorised by this Act, it
                        shall be an offence for a person to import into or export from Singapore a

<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(<em>a</em>) anything containing a controlled

<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(<em>b</em>) the keys of anything containing a

<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(<em>c</em>) the keys of any place or premises or

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(2) Any person who is proved or presumed to have had a controlled drug in
                        his possession shall, until the contrary is proved, be presumed to have

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(3) The presumptions provided for in this section shall not be rebutted by
                        proof that the accused never had physical possession of the controlled

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(4) Where one of 2 or more persons with the knowledge and consent of the
                        rest has any controlled drug in his possession, it shall be deemed to be in
                        the possession of each and all of them.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The <b>actus reus</b> of the offence under
                s 7 MDA</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     The word “import” in s 7 of
                    the MDA has the meaning found in s 2(1) of the Interpretation Act (Cap 1,
                    2002 Rev Ed) (see <em>Ko Mun Cheung and another v Public
                        Prosecutor</em> [1992] 1 SLR(R) 887 (“<em>Ko Mun Cheung</em>”) at [20]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">“import”, with its grammatical variations and cognate
                        expressions, means to bring or cause to be brought into Singapore by land,
                        sea or air;</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     There is obviously some overlap between
                    “possession” and “importation”. Subject to proof of
                    possession (which was admitted in the case of Mas Swan but denied by Roshamima),
                    an act of importation would be made out since neither Mas Swan nor Roshamima had
                    the requisite authorisation under s 7 of the MDA to do so. The remaining
                    issue therefore goes towards the <em>mens rea</em> of the
                    two accused persons.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The <b>mens rea</b> of the offence under
                s 7 MDA</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     There is no doubt that the importation of
                    drugs is not a strict liability offence and that proof of <em>mens rea</em> is required (see <em>Ng Kwok Chun and
                        another v Public Prosecutor</em> [1992] 3 SLR(R) 256
                        (“<em>Ng Kwok Chun</em>”) at [37]). Similarly, the Court of Appeal in
                        <em>Abdul Ra’uf bin Abdul Rahman v Public
                        Prosecutor</em> [1999] 3 SLR(R) 533 (“<em>Abdul Ra’uf</em>”) at [26] cited the cases of <em>Ko
                        Mun Cheung</em>, <em>Ng Kwok Chun</em> and
                        <em>Tse Po Chung Nathan and another v Public
                        Prosecutor</em> [1993] 1 SLR(R) 308 in support of the
                    proposition that since importation of controlled drugs is not a strict liability
                    offence, it is incumbent on the Prosecution to show that the appellant knew or
                    intended to bring diamorphine into Singapore.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     The appellant in <em>Abdul
                        Ra’uf</em> was charged under s 7 of the MDA for importing
                    into Singapore without authorization four packets containing not less than
                    21.45g of diamorphine. He was apprehended at the Woodlands Checkpoint. When he
                    was questioned by one Ssgt Lai, the appellant said that “the
                    thing” in his car was “behind the boot” and that there were
                    “four packets” (see <em>Abdul
                        Ra’uf</em> at [3]). The
                    Court of Appeal in <em>Abdul Ra’uf</em> held that
                    whether the appellant knew that the drugs were in the boot of his car was
                    essentially a question of fact and having reviewed the evidence, it agreed with
                    the trial judge that the appellant had failed to rebut the Prosecution’s
                        <em>prima facie</em> case against him. The trial judge
                    in <em>Public Prosecutor v Abdul Ra’uf bin Abdul
                        Rahman</em> [1999] SGHC 187 at [10] held at the close of the Prosecution’s case
                    that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">10. I was satisfied from the Prosecution evidence which was not inherently
                        incredible that the Accused was in possession of the 4 packets found in
                        the boot of motorcar WCT 5564 when he drove into Singapore from Johore
                        Bahru. Further that as a result of the various incriminating admissions he
                        made as set out earlier to police and CNB officers including the statement
                        made under s 122(6) of the CPC, all indicated that he knew the contents
                        of the 4 packets as being diamorphine. Further, the <em>presumptions under the MDA also operated to show that he had possession
                            of the 4 packets and knew of the contents of the packets by virtue of
                            s 18 (1) and (2) and also by virtue of s 21 thereof as he was
                            in control of the car containing the 4 packets</em>. He was
                        therefore <em>prima facie</em> aware of and had
                        knowledge of the diamorphine being in the 4 packets.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">What is worth noting is that the Court of Appeal in <em>Abdul Ra’uf</em> made no comment on the operation of the twin
                    presumptions, <em>ie</em>, <em>ss </em>18(2) and 21 of the MDA, relied on by the Prosecution at
                    the trial below.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     It appears that, for an offence under s 7
                    of the MDA, the Prosecution can seek to prove <em>mens
                        rea</em> on the part of the accused persons in two ways:</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(a)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">by formally proving that the accused persons
                            intended to import the controlled drugs which form the subject matter of
                            the charge, which would in turn require proof of knowledge on the part
                            of the accused persons of the controlled drugs they were importing;
                            or</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(b)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">by relying on the presumptions available under
                            the MDA.</div>
<p class="Judg-1">In a factual scenario such as the present case where Mas Swan and
                    Roshamima were apprehended with the bundles of controlled drugs being found in
                    JHA 7781, which in turn means that the bundles of controlled drugs were in their
                    physical <em>possession</em>, the Prosecution may rely on
                    the presumption under s 18(2) of the MDA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     It should be highlighted that the relationship
                    between “import” (under s 7 of the MDA and s 2(1) of the
                    Interpretation Act) and “possession” (under s 18(2) of the
                    MDA) has not been expressly dealt with by the courts. In most cases involving
                    s 7 of the MDA, the Prosecution has customarily relied on the s 18(2)
                    presumption in order to establish <em>mens rea</em> on the
                    accused person’s part as in such cases, the accused persons who were
                    charged with importation were, at the time of their respective arrests, in
                    possession (actual or presumed) of the controlled drugs. For instance, where the
                    accused persons were apprehended with the controlled drugs being contained in a
                    sling bag carried by them (see <em>Iwuchukwu Amara Tochi and
                        another v Public Prosecutor</em> [2006] 2 SLR(R) 503
                        (“<em>Iwuchukwu Amara Tochi</em>”)), with
                    the controlled drugs stitched to the vest that they were wearing (see <em>Public Prosecutor v Ko Mun Cheong and another</em> [1990]
                    1 SLR(R) 226) or where the controlled drugs were found in the well for
                    the spare tyre in the boot of the car driven by the accused (see <em>Yeoh Aik Wei v Public Prosecutor</em>
                    [2003] SGCA 4).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Legal possession of controlled drugs</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     Mas Swan admitted that he was aware of the
                    three bundles of controlled drugs concealed in the door panel of JHA 7781.
                    Roshamima, however, claimed complete ignorance of the existence or presence of
                    the bundles in the door panel of the said vehicle. Therefore, the issue of legal
                    possession of the bundles and their contents arises for determination in the
                    case of Roshamima but not in the case of Mas Swan.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Whether the requisite knowledge pertains to the fact that the bundles
                contained controlled drugs or diamorphine</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     To establish that Mas Swan had the knowledge
                    that the bundles contained diamorphine, the Prosecution relied on the doctrine
                    of wilful blindness in <em>Tan Kiam Peng v Public
                        Prosecutor</em> [2008] 1 SLR(R) 1 (“<em>Tan Kiam Peng</em>”) as well as the presumption under
                    s 18(2) of the MDA (see <a href="#p1_37">[37]</a>
                    above).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     In discussing s 18(2) of the MDA, the
                    Court of Appeal in <em>Tan Kiam Peng</em> (at [78]–[81]) suggested two possible interpretations of that
                    section’s reference to “knowledge”:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">78    Returning to the threshold interpretive issue that
                            arises from a reading of s 18(2) of the [MDA] itself, there are, in
                            our view, at least <em>two</em> possible
                            interpretations open to the court.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b><em>Two possible interpretations</em></b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<em>(a) Introduction</em>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">79    As already mentioned, there are <em>two</em> possible interpretations.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">80    The <em>first</em> possible
                            interpretation is that the reference to knowledge in s 18(2) of the
                            [MDA] is to knowledge that the drug concerned is a <em>controlled drug</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">81    The <em>second</em> is the
                            interpretation contended for by the appellant in the present proceedings
                            and referred to at the outset of the present part of this judgment: That
                            the reference to knowledge in s 18(2) of the [MDA] is to knowledge
                            that the drug concerned is <em>not only</em> a
                            controlled drug <em>but also</em> the specific drug
                            which it turns out the accused was in possession of. It should be noted
                            that, in the court below, this particular interpretation was assumed to
                            be the correct one, and the Judge certainly proceeded to render his
                            decision on this basis (see GD, especially at [36]). With respect,
                            however, the situation (as we shall see) is not as clear-cut as the
                            Judge assumed it to be.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis in original]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Without conclusively deciding the issue, the Court of Appeal at
                        [93] expressed a preference for the
                    second or “narrow” interpretation, <em>ie</em>, that s 18(2) presumes that the accused knows the nature
                    of the specific drug in his possession, which effectively means that the
                        <em>mens rea</em> requirement for the offence of drug
                    importation under s 7 of the MDA is <em>knowledge of the
                        precise or specific drug concerned</em> and not mere knowledge that
                    the drug concerned was a controlled drug (the latter state of mind being the
                    first or “broad” interpretation) (<em>Tan Kiam
                        Peng</em> at [94]–[95]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">94    Indeed, it is important to note that had we
                            accepted the first interpretation as being the conclusive one to adopt,
                            that would, in the nature of things, have concluded the present appeal.
                            It will be recalled that the appellant knew that he was in possession of
                            a controlled drug, although he had argued that he did not know that it
                            was the <em>precise</em> or <em>specific</em> controlled drug which he was <em>in fact</em> carrying, <em>viz</em>,
                            heroin. Hence, since the first interpretation entails that the reference
                            to knowledge in s 18(2) of the [MDA] is to knowledge that the drug
                            concerned is a <em>controlled drug</em> only, and
                            the appellant in the present proceedings had <em>actual
                                knowledge</em> that he was in possession of a <em>controlled drug</em>, his appeal would necessarily
                            have failed if the first interpretation was adopted.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">95    However, given the specific language of
                            s 18(2) of the [MDA], the need (given the extreme penalties
                            prescribed by the [MDA]) to resolve any ambiguities in interpretation
                            (if they exist) in favour of the accused, as well as the fact that no
                            case has (to the best of our knowledge) adopted the first
                            interpretation, it would appear, in our view, that (whilst not
                            expressing a conclusive view in the absence of detailed argument) the
                            second interpretation appears to be the more persuasive one and (as
                            pointed out at [93] above) will in fact be adopted in the present
                            appeal. It is, nevertheless, important to note that it would be
                            necessary to consider the further question as to whether, on the second
                            interpretation, the appellant in the present proceedings had knowledge
                            that what he was in possession of was <em>heroin</em>. This raises, in turn, a further issue, which
                            would apply <em>equally</em> to the <em>first</em> interpretation - what is <em>the nature of the knowledge required</em> under
                            s 18(2). We turn now to consider this particular issue. However,
                            before proceeding to do so, it should be noted that if it is actually
                            proven, on the facts of this particular case, that the appellant had
                                <em>actual</em> knowledge that the drugs he was
                            carrying were <em>not only</em> controlled drugs
                            within the meaning of the [MDA] <em>but also</em>
                            that they contained <em>heroin</em>, then the
                            presumption under s 18(2) of the [MDA] <em>need not
                                even be invoked in the first instance</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis in original]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     I had occasion to consider this issue in
                        <em>Public Prosecutor v Lim Boon Hiong and another</em>
                    [2010] 4 SLR(R) 696 (“<em>Lim Boon
                        Hiong</em>”) at [62],
                    where I adopted the view (without deciding the point) that, since (i) the
                    Prosecution had submitted that it was content to conduct its case on the basis
                    of the “narrow” interpretation; (ii) there had been a lack of
                    detailed argument on the point; and (iii) any ambiguity in the MDA should be
                    construed in favour of the accused, the “narrow” interpretation
                    ought to be applied. I should also add that in <em>Lim Boon
                        Hiong</em> (at [63]–[75]), I
                    suggested, in <em>obiter</em> remarks, that it may not have
                    made a great deal of difference which interpretation I adopted because, based on
                    the language used in some of the passages of the Court of Appeal’s
                    judgment in <em>Tan Kiam Peng</em>, there was a <em>possibility</em> that the “broad”
                    interpretation would collapse into the “narrow” interpretation if
                    some of the reasoning in <em>Tan Kiam Peng</em> was taken
                    to its extremes. Lest my observations in <em>Lim Boon
                        Hiong</em> be misunderstood, I should say at once that I was not
                    implying that that was how I thought <em>Tan Kiam Peng</em>
                    ought to be interpreted. Indeed, given the tenor of <em>Tan Kiam
                        Peng</em>, the Court of Appeal evidently intended for there to be a
                    clear distinction between the “broad” and “narrow”
                    interpretations, and for the latter to be preferred out of fairness to the
                    accused.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     As it did in <em>Lim Boon
                        Hiong</em>, in the present case, the Prosecution made it clear that it
                    was content to give any benefit of the doubt to both Mas Swan and Roshamima and
                    was bringing its case against both accused persons based on the
                    “narrow” interpretation.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_33" id="Ftn_33_1"><sup>[note: 33]</sup></a></span>In
                    other words, the Prosecution accepted that it had to satisfy this Court that Mas
                    Swan and Roshamima had knowledge of the nature of the specific drug which they
                    had brought into Singapore, <em>ie</em>,
                    diamorphine.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     For the statutory presumption under
                    s 18(2) of the MDA to arise and be operative, the Prosecution accepted that
                    it must first prove two points:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_34" id="Ftn_34_1"><sup>[note: 34]</sup></a></span></p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(a)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">that Mas Swan and Roshamima knew that the bundles
                            were concealed in the door panel of JHA 7781; and</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(b)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">both Mas Swan and Roshamima knew that the bundles
                            contained controlled drugs.</div>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Whether the accused persons knew that the bundles contained
                diamorphine</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     In the case of Mas Swan, the presumption arose
                    because Mas Swan conceded that he knew that the bundles, which he believed to
                    contain “ecstasy” pills, were concealed within the car door panel.
                    In other words, there was effectively an admission on his part that he had in
                    his possession the bundles containing controlled drugs. Section 18(2) of the MDA
                    was therefore triggered and operated in such a fashion that Mas Swan was
                    presumed to have known the nature of the drug, <em>ie</em>,
                    that it was diamorphine. It was therefore incumbent on Mas Swan to rebut the
                    presumption by proving, on a balance of probabilities, that he was not aware of
                    the specific nature of the drug, <em>ie</em>,
                    diamorphine.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     In the case against Roshamima, however, the
                    position was quite different. As she had maintained that she had no knowledge of
                    the existence of the bundles containing the controlled drugs, the presumption
                    under s 18(2) of the MDA would only become operative against her if the
                    Prosecution was able to first prove and persuade me that she was in fact aware
                    of the existence of the concealed bundles containing controlled drugs in JHA
                    7781.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The interplay between the presumption of knowledge under s 18(2)
                of the MDA and the doctrine of wilful blindness </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     Wilful blindness is relevant in two
                    respects:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_47-p2_a"></a>(a)     The Prosecution can seek to prove
                        actual knowledge <em>via</em> the doctrine of wilful
                        blindness if it is not relying on the statutory presumption under
                        s 18(2) of the MDA.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_47-p2_b"></a>(b)     Further or in the alternative, should the Prosecution
                        rely on the statutory presumption, it may invoke the doctrine of wilful
                        blindness to demonstrate that the accused has failed to rebut the
                        presumption under s 18(2) of the MDA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     In the present case, the Prosecution sought to
                    rely on wilful blindness on both fronts in the alternative. During oral closing
                    submissions, in the context of s 18(2) of the MDA, the Prosecution
                    submitted that, on the authority of <em>Tan Kiam Peng</em>,
                    an accused person has to rebut the presumption at two cumulative levels: first,
                    that he or she did not have actual knowledge <em>simpliciter</em> of the nature of the controlled drugs in his or her
                    possession;and then second, that he or she was not wilfully blind as to the
                    nature of the controlled drugs in his or her possession.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_35" id="Ftn_35_1"><sup>[note: 35]</sup></a></span> The Prosecution accepted that
                    Mas Swan’s long statements and oral evidence in court did not <em>ipso facto</em> prove that he knew the bundles contained
                    diamorphine. <span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_36" id="Ftn_36_1"><sup>[note: 36]</sup></a></span> This much is clear from
                    paragraph 94 of the Prosecution’s submissions:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Accordingly, Mas Swan’s long statements and oral evidence in Court,
                        do not <em>ipso facto</em> prove that he knew that the
                        bundles contained diamorphine. In these circumstances, the Prosecution does
                        not rely on actual knowledge <em>simpliciter</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Therefore, the Prosecution submitted that, in order for Mas Swan to
                    successfully rebut the presumption under s 18(2) of the MDA, <em>the legal burden was on him</em> to show the court that he
                    was <em>not wilfully blind</em> that the three bundles he
                    was delivering into Singapore contained diamorphine.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_37" id="Ftn_37_1"><sup>[note: 37]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     I accept that this is the case; nonetheless,
                    the Prosecution may still have an <em>evidential</em>
                    burden to discharge. After all, if the accused is able to prove that he or she
                    does not have actual knowledge of the specific nature of the drugs and no issue
                    of wilful blindness is raised by the Prosecution, the presumption under
                    s 18(2) of the MDA would have been rebutted, as was observed in dicta in
                        <em>Tan Kiam Peng</em> (at [140]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">140    In so far as the doctrine of wilful blindness is
                            concerned, the evidence required to be adduced by the accused to rebut
                            the presumption of knowledge of the nature of the controlled drug under
                            s 18(2) of the [MDA] is by no means a mere formality, even though
                            the standard required is the civil standard (of proof on a balance of
                            probabilities). Such an approach is not only just and fair but is also
                            consistent with the underlying policy of the [MDA] itself. <em>However, we have also demonstrated that in situations where
                                the accused truly does not know the nature of the controlled drug in
                                his or her possession, it is clear that the accused will be able to
                                rebut the presumption of knowledge of the nature of the controlled
                                drug under s 18(2) on a balance of probabilities</em>.
                            This will be the situation where, for example, the controlled drugs in
                            question were slipped into a package the accused was carrying without
                            his or her knowledge (see also above at [35] and [132]), or where the
                            accused is otherwise devoid of actual knowledge and finds himself or
                            herself in a situation in which the facts and circumstances do not give
                            rise to that level of suspicion that would entail further investigation
                            lest a finding of wilful blindness results. All this, again, is
                            consistent with the underlying policy of the [MDA].</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     Typically, the issue of wilful blindness is
                    introduced into the equation by the Prosecution. Having invoked the doctrine of
                    wilful blindness, it seems to me that it is only right and eminently fair that
                    the <em>evidential</em> burden should be on the Prosecution
                    to raise sufficient evidence of wilful blindness on the part of the accused to
                    ensure that the accused is unable to rebut the presumption on a balance of
                    probabilities. If that can be established, it must follow that the presumption
                    would remain unrebutted. However, if the Prosecution concedes that the accused
                    did not have actual knowledge and fails on its case of wilful blindness or fails
                    to challenge his evidence as regards his belief, it must follow that the
                    presumption is rebutted.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     Just to be clear, I am not at all suggesting
                    that the presumption can be rebutted simply by the accused claiming that he was
                    ignorant of the precise nature of the controlled drugs. Instead, I am referring
                    to a specific situation where it has been established either by way of the
                    evidence or the Prosecution’s case that the accused in fact truly did not
                    know the specific nature of the drugs because he truly believed that it
                    contained drugs of a different nature than that stated in the charge. Further, I
                    should add, for the avoidance of any doubt, that if the Prosecution seeks to
                    prove actual knowledge <em>via</em> the doctrine of wilful
                    blindness <em>without</em> relying on the presumption under
                    s 18(2) of the MDA, the Prosecution must prove it beyond any reasonable
                    doubt.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The test for suspicion in the doctrine of wilful blindness </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     As already mentioned in <a href="#p1_47">[47]</a> above, to demonstrate that the accused has
                    failed to rebut the presumption under s 18(2) of the MDA, the Prosecution
                    can seek to establish that the accused was wilfully blind as to the specific
                    nature of the controlled drug in his possession. It is common ground that
                    suspicion based on firm grounds and targeted on specific facts is a central
                    feature of the doctrine of wilful blindness (<em>Tan Kiam
                        Peng</em> at [125]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">125    The second central principle is that suspicion is
                            legally sufficient to ground a finding of wilful blindness provided the
                            relevant factual matrix warrants such a finding and the accused
                            deliberately decides to turn a blind eye. However, that suspicion must,
                            as Lord Scott perceptively points out in <em>Manifest
                                Shipping</em> (see at [113] above), “be firmly grounded
                            and targeted on specific facts”. Mere “untargeted or
                            speculative suspicion” is insufficient (see also Hor ([75]
                                <em>supra</em>) at 73). A decision in this
                            last-mentioned instance not to make further inquiries is, as the learned
                            law lord correctly points out, tantamount to negligence, perhaps even
                            gross negligence, and is as such insufficient to constitute a basis for
                            a finding of wilful blindness. As Lord Scott aptly put it (see at [113]
                            above), “[s]uspicion is a word that can be used to describe a
                            state-of-mind that may, at one extreme, be no more than a vague feeling
                            of unease and, at the other extreme, reflect a firm belief in the
                            existence of the relevant facts”. It is important to note that
                            the (unacceptable) negligence which the Judge referred to in the court
                            below relates to the <em>level</em> of <em>suspicion</em> required before a decision not to make
                            further inquiries will be considered to constitute wilful blindness. It
                            is equally - if not more - important to emphasise that the Judge was
                            therefore not stating that suspicion <em>per
                                se</em> would not be sufficient to ground a finding of wilful
                            blindness. On the contrary, <em>suspicion is a central as
                                well as integral part of the entire doctrine of wilful
                                blindness</em>. However, the caveat is that a low level of
                            suspicion premised on a factual matrix that would not lead a person to
                            make further inquiries would be insufficient to ground a finding of
                            wilful blindness where the person concerned did not in fact make further
                            inquiries. What is of vital significance, in our view, is the substance
                            of the matter which (in turn) depends heavily upon the <em>precise facts</em> before the court. It is equally
                            important to note that in order for wilful blindness to be established,
                            the appropriate level of suspicion (as just discussed) is a necessary,
                            but not sufficient, condition, inasmuch as that level of suspicion
                                <em>must then lead to a refusal to investigate
                                further</em>, thus resulting in “blind eye
                            knowledge” (see also the second quotation from the article by
                            Wasik &amp; Thompson at [127] below).</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis in original]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     However, it was the Prosecution’s
                    submission that wilful blindness is made out if the accused person <em>ought</em> to have been suspicious that the bundles contained
                    the specific drug which he was found to be in possession of. In support of this
                    proposition, the Prosecution relied on a passage in <em>Tan Kiam
                        Peng</em> (at [126]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">126    That having been said, the requirement of
                            suspicion is nevertheless a vital (and, indeed, threshold) one. So, for
                            example, if the accused makes merely token inquiries because he suspects
                            that making more substantive inquiries might lead him to the truth which
                            he does not want to know, that is wilful blindness. <em>If the factual matrix was such that the accused</em><b><em>ought to have been suspicious</em></b><em>, the court must then consider the accused's reasons for
                                not making further inquiries</em>. We will come to this point
                            below but it suffices to state at this juncture that a court would be
                            well justified in thinking that the reason why an accused refused to
                            make further inquiries may be because he or she was virtually certain
                            that if further inquiries were made, his or her suspicions would be
                            confirmed. In such a situation, the level of suspicion is, in fact,
                            quite the opposite of the very first scenario referred to (in the
                            preceding paragraph), and is one where a person in the accused's shoes
                            ought to make further inquiries and the failure to do so would therefore
                            constitute wilful blindness ...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">When asked whether this in effect meant that the test for suspicion
                    under the doctrine of wilful blindness was an objective one, Deputy Public
                    Prosecutor Ms Sripathy-Shanaz submitted that the test was partially
                    objective and partially subjective.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_38" id="Ftn_38_1"><sup>[note: 38]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     I am unable to agree with the
                    Prosecution’s submission that the Court of Appeal in <em>Tan Kiam Peng</em> had intended the test for suspicion to be anything
                    other than a subjective one. Certainly, in my judgment, the sentence that the
                    Prosecution cited from <em>Tan Kiam Peng</em> above does
                    not bear that out. What the Court of Appeal in <em>Tan Kiam
                        Peng</em> was saying was that if the objective facts show that a
                    reasonable person would have been suspicious, this would lead to the
                    Court’s examination into the reasons given by the accused for not making
                    inquiries and then drawing the appropriate inferences in determining whether the
                    accused was <em>in fact</em> suspicious. This is supported
                    by the Court of Appeal’s explanation that a finding of wilful blindness
                    could arise if an accused “was virtually certain that, if further
                    inquires were made, <em>his or her suspicions</em> would be
                    confirmed” [emphasis added] (see <a href="#p1_53">[53]</a>
                    above).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     Wilful blindness may be the legal equivalent
                    of actual knowledge, but it is not the same as actual knowledge (see <em>Public Prosecutor v Koo Pui Fong</em> [1996]
                    1 SLR(R) 734 at [15]). Actual
                    knowledge is the subjective mental state where one is certain of the existence
                    of a set of facts. Short of a confession from the accused, the Prosecution would
                    have to rely on objective or circumstantial evidence to <em>infer</em> such a subjective mental element. One of these objective
                    means is by relying on the doctrine of wilful blindness, which is an evidential
                    tool towards establishing actual knowledge.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     It is instructive to quote, at this juncture,
                    the Court of Appeal’s pronouncement in <em>Iwuchukwu Amara
                        Tochi</em> at [6]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">6    ... It would thus create a wrong assumption that
                            there was some sort of positive legal duty, meaning that the first
                            appellant was bound in law to inspect and determine what he was
                            carrying, and that consequentially, if he did not do so, he would be
                            found liable <em>on account of that failure or
                                omission</em>. The [MDA] does not prescribe any such duty. All
                            that the [MDA] does (under s 18), is to provide the presumptions of
                            possession and knowledge, and thus the duty of rebutting the
                            presumptions lay with the accused. There could be various reasons why a
                            court might not believe the accused person, or find that he had not
                            rebutted the presumptions. The fact that he made no attempt to check
                            what he was carrying could be one such reason. Whether the court would
                            believe a denial of knowledge of the articles in the accused person's
                            possession (made with or without explanation or reasons) would depend on
                            the circumstances of the individual case.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis in original]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     In other words, wilful blindness is not a
                    legal fiction. Instead it is purely a fact-finding inquiry for the trial judge
                    to decide whether, on the evidence before him, the Prosecution has proven that
                    the accused was <em>in fact</em> suspicious that the
                    contents contained the drugs for which he is being charged and of which he was
                    wilfully blind. To import the objective test, <em>ie</em>,
                    constructive knowledge, into a question of criminal liability when the offence
                    is punishable by death is, in my view, to impose a heavier burden on the accused
                    person than the law permits. Indeed, the Court of Appeal in <em>Tan Kiam Peng</em> went some distance to draw a distinction between
                    actual knowledge (which encompasses the doctrine of wilful blindness) and
                    constructive knowledge, and took the view that the latter does not fall within
                    the ambit of s 18(2) of the MDA (see <em>Tan Kiam
                        Peng</em> at [133]–[135]). It is perhaps apposite to cite the
                    observation by Devlin J in <em>Roper v Taylor's Central Garages
                        (Exeter), Limited</em> [1951] 2 TLR 284 at 289, which was cited with
                    approval in <em>Tan Kiam Peng</em> at [116]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The case of shutting one's eyes is actual knowledge in the eyes of the
                        law; the case of merely neglecting to make inquiries is not knowledge at all
                        - it comes within the legal conception of constructive knowledge, a
                        conception which, generally speaking, has no place in the criminal
                        law.</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a>58     Mas Swan elected to give evidence in court.
                    Essentially, Mas Swan admitted that he knew the three bundles found in
                    JHA 7781 on 6 May 2009 contained controlled drugs and that he was
                    delivering them on behalf of a Malay Singaporean man whom he knew as
                    “Mickey” (real name Shahiran Bin Osman).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_39" id="Ftn_39_1"><sup>[note: 39]</sup></a></span> According to Mas Swan, Mickey
                    was a friend of “Murie”, who was in turn a friend of
                        Roshamima.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_40" id="Ftn_40_1"><sup>[note: 40]</sup></a></span> Mas
                    Swan also admitted to making a total of four successful drug deliveries for
                    Mickey before being arrested.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_41" id="Ftn_41_1"><sup>[note: 41]</sup></a></span> He claimed, however,
                    to have believed that the bundles he was delivering contained
                    “ecstasy” pills and not heroin. <span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_42" id="Ftn_42_1"><sup>[note: 42]</sup></a></span> Therefore, it was submitted by
                    Mr Kanagavijayan that the Charge against Mas Swan has not been made
                    out.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Whether Mas Swan has rebutted the statutory presumption that he knew
                that the bundles contained diamorphine</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Mas Swan’s evidence was consistent that he believed the bundles
                contained “ecstasy” pills</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a>59     It was Mas Swan’s consistent evidence
                    throughout his statements and oral testimony in court that he believed the
                    bundles he was delivering for Mickey contained “ecstasy” pills. As
                    early as the recording of his first long statement, P34 (barely two days after
                    he was arrested), Mas Swan admitted that he had knowingly imported
                    “ecstasy” pills or “<em>biji</em>”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_43" id="Ftn_43_1"><sup>[note: 43]</sup></a></span> In <em>all</em> of his subsequent statements (see <a href="#p1_11">[11]</a> above), only “drugs” or
                    “ecstasy”, as opposed to diamorphine or heroin, was mentioned.
                    Even in his cautioned statement, P32, only “drugs” was
                    mentioned.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a>60     According to Mas Swan, whenever there was a
                    delivery for Mickey, Roshamima would inform Mas Swan on the day of the delivery
                    that there would be a “segmen” and give him the location where he
                    was supposed to drive JHA 7781 to. He testified that the word
                    “segmen” referred to the job of bringing “ecstasy”
                    into Singapore by Roshamima, Murie and himself. Mas Swan also claimed that he
                    discovered the bundles they were delivering contained “ecstasy”
                    pills only after one or two visits to Singapore with Roshamima.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_44" id="Ftn_44_1"><sup>[note: 44]</sup></a></span> Mas Swan admitted that he had never seen the
                    contents of the bundles<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_45" id="Ftn_45_1"><sup>[note: 45]</sup></a></span> and believed that the bundles contained
                    “ecstasy” pills because Roshamima had told him so.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_46" id="Ftn_46_1"><sup>[note: 46]</sup></a></span> He
                    confirmed, however, that if he had opened the bundles and saw the
                        “<em>assam</em>”-like substance, he would
                    have known that the contents were not “ecstasy” pills or

<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Objective evidence that Mas Swan believed the bundles contained
                “ecstasy” pills</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_62"></a>62     Having heard all the witnesses, in my
                    judgment, there is sufficient evidence before me to show that Mas Swan had
                    reason to believe and in fact believed that the bundles contained
                    “ecstasy” pills. I now provide my findings based on my assessment
                    of the evidence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_63"></a>63     As Roshamima’s defence was that she did
                    not know there were bundles concealed in JHA 7781, the evidence of Mas Swan
                    and Roshamima conflicted wherever Mas Swan’s evidence implicated
                    Roshamima. However, after reviewing the evidence in its totality, I preferred
                    Mas Swan’s evidence over Roshamima’s for the following
                    reasons:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_63-p2_a"></a>(a)     First, Mas Swan’s evidence in
                        his statements and oral testimony was much more consistent throughout when
                        compared to Roshamima’s evidence. Further, his evidence was also
                        corroborated by most of the objective evidence. Although there were slight
                        shifts in Mas Swan’s evidence, those differences were, in my view,
                        mostly immaterial or could be explained away as lapses in memory due to the
                        passage of time. In comparison, while on the stand, Roshamima contrived all
                        sorts of explanations when confronted with her previous statements and when
                        her testimony at the stand was contradicted by objective evidence such as
                        SMS text messages (see <a href="#p1_117">[117]</a> and
                            <a href="#p1_119">[119]</a> below).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_63-p2_b"></a>(b)     Secondly, Mas Swan’s evidence
                        was self-incriminating whereas Roshamima’s evidence was entirely
                        self-serving. There was, in my view, utterly <em>no
                            reason</em> for Mas Swan to incriminate Roshamima along with
                        himself and significantly none was suggested by Mr Muzammil, counsel
                        for Roshamima. After all, he certainly derived no benefit from implicating
                        Roshamima. In fact, there was probably even more reason for him to exculpate
                        her as they were in a romantic relationship and were about to be engaged to
                        be married when they were arrested.</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_64"></a>64     Although Mas Swan vacillated in his evidence
                    as to how he actually became acquainted with Mickey, the evidence showed that
                    Mas Swan became involved in delivering drugs for Mickey through Roshamima, who
                    was already delivering drugs into Singapore using JHA 7781 and who had
                    suggested to Mas Swan to deliver drugs for Mickey if he wanted to make

                    applied for his very first passport on 20 April 2009 so that he could
                    bring drugs into Singapore;<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_55" id="Ftn_55_1"><sup>[note: 55]</sup></a></span> and he was issued an international
                    passport bearing number “A20132600”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_56" id="Ftn_56_1"><sup>[note: 56]</sup></a></span> on the same day. Mas Swan testified in
                    court that he had applied for his passport at Roshamima’s request so that
                    they could both visit places in Singapore.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_57" id="Ftn_57_1"><sup>[note: 57]</sup></a></span> Roshamima challenged, however, Mas
                    Swan’s allegation that she had persuaded him to apply for a passport to
                    enter Singapore, claiming that he had applied for a passport voluntarily on his
                    own accord.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_58" id="Ftn_58_1"><sup>[note: 58]</sup></a></span> In my judgment, it was immaterial whether
                    it was Mas Swan or Roshamima who had initiated Mas Swan’s passport
                    application. What was more significant, and I so find, was that Mas Swan was
                    introduced to Mickey by Roshamima and that he had applied for a passport so that
                    he could deliver drugs into Singapore for Mickey.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(2)   The <em>modus operandi</em> in
                importing controlled drugs into Singapore</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_66"></a>66     Together with Roshamima, Mas Swan made a total
                    of four successful drug deliveries for Mickey before their arrest:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_59" id="Ftn_59_1"><sup>[note: 59]</sup></a></span> the
                    first two occurred sometime between 21 April 2009 and
                    30 April 2009; the third was on 1 May 2009; and the fourth
                    was on 3 May 2009. Whenever there was a delivery, Roshamima would, on
                    the day of the delivery,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_60" id="Ftn_60_1"><sup>[note: 60]</sup></a></span>
                    inform Mas Swan that there would be a “segmen” and give him the
                    location where Mas Swan was supposed to drive JHA 7781 to. After being
                    instructed by Roshamima, Mas Swan would drive JHA 7781 to the specified
                    location for an exchange of cars with one of Mickey’s men,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_61" id="Ftn_61_1"><sup>[note: 61]</sup></a></span> who would drive
                    JHA 7781 away. Mas Swan and Roshamima would then await a call telling them
                    that JHA 7781 was ready for collection. After collecting JHA 7781,
                    they would proceed to enter Singapore with the drugs concealed in the
                    car.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_67"></a>67     I pause here to note that, during the trial,
                    Mr Muzammil objected to the admissibility of evidence that Roshamima was
                    involved in deliveries for Mickey prior to 6 May 2009, on the ground
                    that it was similar fact evidence. Although I have separately determined at
                        <a href="#p1_126">[126]</a> below that the similar fact
                    evidence was admissible for the purpose of showing that Roshamima’s
                    defence was unbelievable, the evidence that Roshamima was involved in delivering
                    bundles for Mickey some time before she “recruited” Mas Swan was,
                    in my view, also relevant here to show that Mas Swan <em>had
                        reason to believe</em> what she had told him regarding the nature of
                    the drugs they were delivering.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(3)   The events leading up to the arrest of Mas Swan and
                Roshamima</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_68"></a>68     In the afternoon of 6 May 2009, Mas
                    Swan drove a car bearing license plate number JKG 4956<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_62" id="Ftn_62_1"><sup>[note: 62]</sup></a></span> (the “Myvi”) to
                    Hotel Seri Malaysia to meet Murie. From the hotel, they then drove separately in
                    two cars to a shop that sold car-accessories: Mas Swan drove the Myvi while
                    Murie drove JHA 7781.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_63" id="Ftn_63_1"><sup>[note: 63]</sup></a></span> At the
                    shop, Murie told Mas Swan that he and Roshamima<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_64" id="Ftn_64_1"><sup>[note: 64]</sup></a></span> intended
                    to deliver “ecstasy” pills into Singapore that day<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_65" id="Ftn_65_1"><sup>[note: 65]</sup></a></span> and asked
                    Mas Swan whether he (Mas Swan) was joining him, to which Mas Swan confirmed
                    that he was.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_66" id="Ftn_66_1"><sup>[note: 66]</sup></a></span> Roshamima also called Mas Swan sometime in
                    the afternoon to inform him that there would be a “segmen” later
                    that day, a term Mas Swan understood as referring to their task of bringing
                    drugs into Singapore.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_67" id="Ftn_67_1"><sup>[note: 67]</sup></a></span>
                    Murie then asked Mas Swan for some “ice 0.5” or “<em>sejuk</em>”, which Mas Swan knew was a prohibited
                        drug.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_68" id="Ftn_68_1"><sup>[note: 68]</sup></a></span>
                    Mas Swan obligingly went to collect some “ice” from a friend
                    called “Cek Han” while Murie fetched Roshamima from her work
                        place.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_69" id="Ftn_69_1"><sup>[note: 69]</sup></a></span> Roshamima claimed to have fallen asleep in
                    the car because she was tired, having consumed “ice” for the past
                    three days in succession.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_69"></a>69     After obtaining RM300 worth (half a gram) of
                    “ice” from Cek Han,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_70" id="Ftn_70_1"><sup>[note: 70]</sup></a></span> Mas Swan went home to
                    collect his passport so that he could enter Singapore with Murie<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_71" id="Ftn_71_1"><sup>[note: 71]</sup></a></span> and Roshamima.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_72" id="Ftn_72_1"><sup>[note: 72]</sup></a></span> The three of them met at
                    a Shell petrol station at Taman Tasek around 6 pm with Murie and Roshamima
                    arriving in JHA 7781. Subsequently, Mas Swan took over the wheel of
                    JHA 7781 and Murie ended up driving the Myvi.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_73" id="Ftn_73_1"><sup>[note: 73]</sup></a></span> Roshamima
                    remained asleep, in JHA 7781. They then travelled to an Esso petrol station
                    at Taman Tun Aminah<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_74" id="Ftn_74_1"><sup>[note: 74]</sup></a></span> and Mas Swan handed JHA 7781 over to
                    one of Mickey’s men. Mas Swan knew that the exchange of cars at the Esso
                    petrol station was to facilitate the placing of the “ecstasy”
                    pills in JHA 7781.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_75" id="Ftn_75_1"><sup>[note: 75]</sup></a></span> On the witness
                    stand, Roshamima claimed, however, that she did not know the reason for going to
                    the Esso petrol station<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_76" id="Ftn_76_1"><sup>[note: 76]</sup></a></span> and sought to retract the part of her
                    statement P38<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_77" id="Ftn_77_1"><sup>[note: 77]</sup></a></span> where she stated that
                    she had followed Mas Swan to the Esso petrol station to exchange cars with a man
                    who worked for Mickey. In her attempt to explain why she had made the statement
                    in P38 to ASP Gary Chan in the first place, Roshamima alleged that when P38 was
                    recorded, she had simply assumed <em>ex post facto</em>
                    that the bundles found in JHA 7781 on 6 May 2009 must have been
                    placed there by one of Mickey’s men because their packaging was similar to
                    bundles she had previously delivered for Mickey.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_78" id="Ftn_78_1"><sup>[note: 78]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_70"></a>70     I find that there was evidence to show that
                    Mas Swan had agreed, on the afternoon of 6 May 2009, with Murie to
                    deliver drugs into Singapore on the same day and that Mas Swan knew that there
                    would be an exchange of cars at the Esso petrol station so that the drugs could
                    be concealed in JHA 7781. This finding is supported not only by Mas
                    Swan’s evidence implicating himself, but also by an exchange of SMS text
                    messages between Mas Swan and Murie that same evening: first, a message was sent
                    from Mas Swan to Murie at 5.39 pm: “<em>Ko gi amik wawa,
                        aku gi amik brg 05. Kita jumpa kat shell tasik</em>.”, which
                    was initially translated as “You go fetch wawa [which was
                    Roshamima’s nickname], I go and take ‘brg’ 05. We meet at
                    shell lake”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_79" id="Ftn_79_1"><sup>[note: 79]</sup></a></span> It was later clarified that the words
                        “<em>shell tasik</em>” referred to a
                    Shell petrol station at Taman Tasek<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_80" id="Ftn_80_1"><sup>[note: 80]</sup></a></span> and that
                        “<em>brg 05</em>” meant “ice
                        0.5”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_81" id="Ftn_81_1"><sup>[note: 81]</sup></a></span> Tellingly, the reply from Murie to Mas
                    Swan was: “<em>K.cpt taw..kul 6.15 kete nk pas kat die
                        org</em>.”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_82" id="Ftn_82_1"><sup>[note: 82]</sup></a></span>, which translates as “K be
                    fast...at 6.15 <em>need to pass the car to them</em>
                    [emphasis added]”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_83" id="Ftn_83_1"><sup>[note: 83]</sup></a></span> It was clear that Murie was referring to
                    handing over JHA 7781 to Mickey’s men so that the drugs could be
                    concealed in the car.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_71"></a>71     At the Esso petrol station, a man arrived in a
                    Singapore-registered car and drove off in JHA 7781. Murie then drove off in
                    the Singapore-registered car while Mas Swan ended up driving the Myvi with
                    Roshamima alongside him again.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_84" id="Ftn_84_1"><sup>[note: 84]</sup></a></span> Subsequently, the three of
                    them went to a car workshop called “K K Auto” in Taman
                    Seri Pulai and ended up at an eatery in Skudai as they waited for JHA 7781
                    to be re-delivered to them.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_85" id="Ftn_85_1"><sup>[note: 85]</sup></a></span> Mas Swan claimed that, while they were eating
                    there, Murie or Roshamima received a phone call to inform that the
                        “<em>barang</em>” or
                        “items”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_86" id="Ftn_86_1"><sup>[note: 86]</sup></a></span> had been placed in
                    JHA 7781. Mas Swan understood the term “<em>barang</em>” to refer to “ecstasy”
                        pills.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_87" id="Ftn_87_1"><sup>[note: 87]</sup></a></span> Roshamima denied receiving any
                        call.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_88" id="Ftn_88_1"><sup>[note: 88]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_72"></a>72     After the call, Murie drove off in the
                    Singapore-registered car and returned to the eatery in JHA 7781. The three
                    of them then journeyed to Singapore in two cars: Mas Swan and Roshamima were in
                    JHA 7781 with Roshamima driving;<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_89" id="Ftn_89_1"><sup>[note: 89]</sup></a></span> and Murie was alone in
                    the Myvi. There was some dispute whether Mas Swan or Roshamima was the driver
                    when JHA 7781 entered Singapore, but nothing turns on this. Mas Swan claimed
                    that, while on the way to Singapore, Roshamima informed Mas Swan that there were
                    three bundles<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_90" id="Ftn_90_1"><sup>[note: 90]</sup></a></span> of “<em>barang</em>” in the front passenger door.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_91" id="Ftn_91_1"><sup>[note: 91]</sup></a></span> Contrary
                    to Mas Swan’s allegation, Roshamima denied telling him that there were
                    three bundles of “ecstasy” pills in JHA 7781 while they were
                    on their way to Singapore.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_92" id="Ftn_92_1"><sup>[note: 92]</sup></a></span> Before arriving at the
                    Johor Immigration Checkpoint in Malaysia, they made a stop by the side of the

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_73"></a>73     Mas Swan and Roshamima were subsequently
                    detained while attempting to pass through Woodlands Checkpoint. Roshamima
                    testified that while she and Mas Swan were at the ST Office, she saw the Myvi
                    (which Murie was driving) parked in one of the lots beside

                    be every reason for her to speak to Murie and Mickey for either or both of them
                    to come over to the ST Office to assist her to establish her alleged innocence
                    or to alert the police of Murie’s presence so that he could be questioned
                    about the bundles concealed in the car. The flurry of phone calls from Mickey
                    and Murie to Roshamima’s mobile phone immediately after she and Mas Swan
                    were detained at the Woodlands Checkpoint ineluctably showed not only that
                    Roshamima was working for Mickey on that day and that she knew that there were
                    bundles of drugs concealed in JHA 7781, but also that Roshamima was the
                    person of contact and played a larger role in the delivery of drugs for Mickey,
                    which corroborated Mas Swan’s claim that he was merely following Roshamima
                    after she had recently recruited him into the syndicate.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_75"></a>75     It is notable that Mas Swan did not receive
                    any calls from either Murie or Mickey after he and Roshamima were detained and
                    that all calls were made to Roshamima instead. Therefore, I believed Mas
                    Swan’s evidence that Roshamima was fully aware of the fact that they were
                    delivering drugs for Mickey on 6 May 2009 and did in fact tell him, on
                    that same day, that they were delivering “ecstasy” pills into
                    Singapore.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(5)   Mas Swan’s evidence that he had never seen diamorphine
                prior to the arrest</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_76"></a>76     As a result of the search, the three bundles
                    of drugs were retrieved from the front left door panel of JHA 7781 (see
                        <a href="#p1_6">[6]</a> above). Mas Swan recalled that, after
                    one of the bundles was cut open in front of him, he saw a small packet inside
                    which contained a substance having the shape of “<em>assam</em>” or preserved prune.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_98" id="Ftn_98_1"><sup>[note: 98]</sup></a></span> He could not recall seeing
                    the colour of the substance.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_99" id="Ftn_99_1"><sup>[note: 99]</sup></a></span> Mas Swan claimed that he had

                    openly admitted that the shape of the substance shown to him did not have the
                    shape of “ecstasy” pills at all.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_101" id="Ftn_101_1"><sup>[note: 101]</sup></a></span> Mas

<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(6)   The dynamics of personalities between Mas Swan and
                Roshamima</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_77"></a>77     In summary, having assessed the evidence, I
                    find, on a balance of probabilities, that Mas Swan believed Roshamima when she
                    told him that they were delivering “ecstasy” pills on
                    6 May 2009 for the following reasons:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_77-p2_a"></a>(a)     Roshamima started delivering the
                        bundles into Singapore some time before Mas Swan and it was Roshamima who
                        brought Mas Swan into the delivery racket.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_77-p2_b"></a>(b)     As such, Mas Swan was fully aware that Roshamima
                        had knowledge and details of the drug deliveries. During the trial,
                        Roshamima came across as someone with an assertive and dominant personality.
                        In contrast, from my own observation of Mas Swan during his testimony in
                        court, I found him to be mild-mannered and somewhat timid. He came across as
                        someone who was following instructions from Roshamima as regards the
                        deliveries. Mas Swan was not told of the destination for each of the
                        deliveries. He was not involved in the packing of the bundles. He was also
                        not the one who retrieved the bundles from the door panel of JHA 7781 on 6
                        May 2009 or the previous occasions. His role was simply to accompany
                        Roshamima to make the deliveries in Singapore. Even when they were detained
                        at the Woodlands checkpoint, all calls from Murie and Mickey went to
                        Roshamima’s mobile and not Mas Swan’s. This is another clear
                        indication of the limited role and knowledge of Mas Swan.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_77-p2_c"></a>(c)     Consistent with the above assessment,
                        on each occasion when delivery of the bundles was to take place, it was
                        usually Roshamima who would inform Mas Swan of the “segmen”,
                            <em>ie</em>, the delivery of
                        “ecstasy” pills into Singapore.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_77-p2_d"></a>(d)     Further, they were to be engaged and it was
                        Roshamima who recruited Mas Swan to assist in the drug deliveries. Under
                        these circumstances and given the dynamics of their personalities, I can
                        accept that Mas Swan would have no reason to disbelieve what Roshamima had
                        told him, <em>ie</em>, that the bundles contained
                        “ecstasy” pills.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The Prosecution did not challenge Mas Swan’s evidence regarding
                his belief that the bundles contained “ecstasy” pills</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_78"></a>78     During the cross-examination of Mas Swan, the
                    Prosecution did not at any point in time challenge Mas Swan’s statements
                    or oral evidence that he believed the bundles he was delivering contained
                    “ecstasy” pills. This position is consistent with my findings that
                    Mas Swan believed Roshamima when she told him that the bundles contained
                    “ecstasy” pills. The Prosecution evidently shared the same view
                    which might well explain why they did not challenge Mas Swan’s belief.
                    Under the rule in <em>Browne v Dunn</em> (1893) 6
                    R 67, unchallenged testimony may be considered by the court to be
                    undisputed by the opposing party and therefore accepted by the court (<em>Ong Pang Siew v Public Prosecutor</em>
                    [2011] 1 SLR 606 at [81]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_79"></a>79     The recent case of <em>Khor
                        Soon Lee v Public Prosecutor</em> [2011] SGCA 17
                        (“<em>Khor Soon Lee</em>”) involved an
                    appellant who had made previous deliveries of controlled drugs for one
                    “Tony”. The appellant was sometimes told that the bundles
                    contained “5” (Erimin) and “K” (ketamine), but was
                    not told of the contents at other times. The appellant’s evidence at trial
                    was that he had asked Tony in July 2008 (the appellant was arrested at
                    Woodland’s Checkpoint on 9 August 2008) whether heroin (diamorphine)
                    would be involved in the deliveries as he was afraid of the death penalty.
                    Tony’s response was that he had never placed heroin inside the packages
                    that the appellant was told to carry. Notably, the Prosecution did not challenge
                    the appellant’s evidence on Tony’s response (see [6] of <em>Khor Soon
                        Lee</em>). The Court of Appeal remarked at [23] of <em>Khor Soon
                        Lee</em>:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">23    In this regard, the fact that the Appellant had
                            assisted in transporting <em>only</em> Controlled
                            Drugs on a <em>significant number</em> of occasions
                                <em>in the past</em> does weigh in favour of
                            the Appellant. <em>Importantly, as we have noted above,
                                this particular factual aspect of the Appellant’s account was
                                uncontroverted by the Prosecution in the court below as well as on
                                appeal</em>.</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_83"></a>83     It became apparent to me that from the way it
                    conducted its case, the Prosecution was not seeking to challenge Mas
                    Swan’s actual belief, but rather, was attempting to persuade me that the
                    presumption had not been successfully rebutted, by way of the doctrine of wilful
                    blindness which I will separately cover below.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Whether the Prosecution was able to prove via the doctrine of wilful
                blindness that Mas Swan had failed to rebut the presumption</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_84"></a>84     Although the Prosecution relied on the
                    doctrine of wilful blindness in attempting to prove the Charge against Mas Swan
                    and/or to demonstrate that the presumption had not been successfully rebutted by
                    him, it was, however, <em>not</em> the Prosecution’s
                    case that Mas Swan’s suspicions were <em>in fact</em>
                    aroused. The Prosecution submitted that wilful blindness was made out in Mas
                    Swan’s case on the basis that his suspicions that the bundles contained
                    heroin <em>ought</em> to have been aroused, and any
                    reasonable person with his characteristics <em>would
                        not</em> have believed Roshamima’s claims that the bundles
                    contained “ecstasy” pills,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_105" id="Ftn_105_1"><sup>[note: 105]</sup></a></span><em>ie</em>, the test of wilful blindness, as the
                    Prosecution understood it, was a subjective-objective test. During closing
                    submissions, Prosecution submitted that given the manner in which the bundles
                    were concealed behind the door panel of JHA 7781 and the covert nature of the
                    delivery in Singapore, Mas Swan <em>ought</em> to have
                    suspected that the bundles contained diamorphine.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_85"></a>85     The Prosecution also relied on the fact that
                    Mas Swan did not check the contents of the bundles because he <em>did not care</em> what he was delivering for Mickey. The Prosecution
                    highlighted Mas Swan’s statement in P35 that because he needed money, it
                    did not matter to him what type of drugs he was bringing into Singapore.
                    Notably, however, Mas Swan stated in P36: “I do know that bringing in
                    ecstasy into Singapore is illegal but I have to do it because I need the money.
                    Actually it does not matter what Mickey put in my car. I will still do it as
                    long as he pays the reward after that.” Therefore, while it is true that
                    Mas Swan conceded that, ultimately, it did not matter what drugs he was bringing
                    into Singapore, he had consistently maintained the position that he honestly
                    believed the bundles contained “ecstasy” pills.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_86"></a>86     However, none of the above goes to show that
                    Mas Swan was <em>in fact</em> suspicious that the bundles
                    contained diamorphine. The manner in which they were concealed and the covert
                    nature of the intended delivery all point towards the illicit nature of the
                    bundles, which is entirely consistent with Mas Swan’s belief that he was
                    delivering other controlled drugs such as “ecstasy” pills. The
                    fact that Mas Swan had several or even ample opportunities to inspect the
                    bundles likewise does not prove that he was wilfully blind to the true contents
                    of the bundles. In fact, once it is accepted that Mas Swan believed that he was
                    delivering bundles containing “ecstasy” pills (see my finding at
                        <a href="#p1_77">[77]</a> above), then, logically, it must
                    follow that there would be no reason for him to be <em>suspicious</em> that the bundles contained anything but
                    “ecstasy” pills. The considerations raised by the Prosecution
                    would only be relevant in the present case if the test was purely objective or
                    objective-subjective in nature, which, for the reasons already stated at
                        <a href="#p1_54">[54]</a>–<a href="#p1_57">[57]</a> above, was a position I cannot agree with. As the Court of
                    Appeal in <em>Khor Soon Lee</em> emphasized at [24]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">24    … A mere suspicion it could have been, but
                            it was far from being a distinct enough peculiarity (in and of itself)
                            to raise a strong suspicion. <em>At the very least, the
                                suspicion must bear a reasonable connection to the specific drug at
                                issue</em>. In both instances, [the appellant’s] failure
                            to check the contents of the package would, at best, constitute only
                                <em>negligence or
                        recklessness</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis in original]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_87"></a>87     In conclusion, I find that Mas Swan has
                    successfully rebutted the presumption under s 18(2) of the MDA for the
                    following reasons:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_87-p2_a"></a>(a)     Based on my assessment of the
                        evidence before me, I accept that Mas Swan did <em>in
                            fact</em> believe Roshamima that the bundles contained
                        “ecstasy” pills.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_87-p2_b"></a>(b)     The Prosecution has also failed to adduce sufficient
                        evidence that Mas Swan was <em>in fact</em> suspicious
                        that the bundles contained diamorphine. As such the Prosecution fails in its
                        case of wilful blindness against Mas Swan as well.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_87-p2_c"></a>(c)     My finding is entirely consistent with
                        the fact that Mas Swan’s evidence as regards his belief was <em>unchallenged</em> by the Prosecution.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">It is imperative to stress, lest it be misinterpreted, that my finding that the
                    presumption against Mas Swan has been rebutted was not due to Mas Swan’s
                    mere assertion that he believed the bundles contained ecstasy pills. Instead, my
                    decision on this point was based on my own assessment of the available evidence
                    before me that Mas Swan did believe Roshamima that the bundles contained
                    “ecstasy” pills as well as the manner in which the Prosecution
                    conducted its case against Mas Swan.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Roshamima’s defence</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_88"></a>88     Roshamima also elected to enter her defence,
                    which was that she did not know that three bundles had been concealed in the
                    front passenger door panel of JHA 7781 when both she and Mas Swan entered
                    Singapore on 6 May 2009. The essence of her evidence (taking into
                    account her differing versions of the exact person they were supposed to meet in
                    Singapore) was that they had entered Singapore on that day not to deliver drugs
                    but to obtain items for their planned engagement/wedding.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_89"></a>89     As mentioned at <a href="#p1_67">[67]</a> above, Mr Muzammil challenged the admissibility of the
                    parts of Mas Swan’s evidence and Roshamima’s statements that refer
                    to her prior involvement in delivering bundles for Mickey on the ground that
                    they contain similar fact evidence that was highly prejudicial to her
                        defence.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_106" id="Ftn_106_1"><sup>[note: 106]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Whether the charge of importation is made out once the Prosecution
                proves possession of controlled drugs</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_90"></a>90     Roshamima’s defence, as mentioned above,
                    was that she had <em>no knowledge whatsoever</em> that the
                    bundles were concealed or existed in the door panel. If, however, the
                    Prosecution was able to persuade me that Roshamima was aware of the concealed
                    bundles and knew that they contained controlled drugs, the statutory presumption
                    under s 18(2) of the MDA would, accordingly, become operative and it would
                    then be for Roshamima to rebut it, failing which the Charge against her would be
                    made out.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_91"></a>91     In this connection, it is pertinent to
                    highlight that Roshamima did not lead any positive evidence to prove that she
                    was not aware of the true nature of the controlled drugs. This must be so since
                    she chose to defend the Charge at the threshold level that she had no knowledge
                    of the existence of the bundles that were concealed in the door panel of JHA
                    7781 and was accordingly not in <em>legal possession</em>
                    of the controlled drugs. It therefore follows that if the Prosecution was able
                    to prove that Roshamima was aware that bundles containing controlled drugs were
                    concealed in the car door panel, the presumption under s 18(2) of the MDA
                    would operate against her, and because she has not adduced any evidence to rebut
                    that presumption, the Charge against her would, without more, indubitably be
                    made out. This logical sequence and its inevitable outcome were eventually
                    conceded by Mr Muzammil during oral submissions,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_107" id="Ftn_107_1"><sup>[note: 107]</sup></a></span> though I would
                    like to add that I am relying on what I understand to be the legal position, and
                    not on his concession, in making such a finding.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Whether Roshamima knew the bundles were concealed in JHA 7781
                and that they contained controlled drugs</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_92"></a>92     As I preferred Mas Swan’s evidence over
                    Roshamima’s evidence and have already found at <a href="#p1_77">[77]</a> above that Roshamima knew there were bundles containing
                    controlled drugs in JHA 7781 when they both entered Singapore on
                    6 May 2009, it would follow that the Charge against Roshamima has thus
                    been made out. For completeness, I nevertheless consider here the arguments that
                    were raised by Mr Muzammil that have not been expressly dealt with
                    above.</p>

                    her defence was that they had entered Singapore on that day not to deliver drugs

                    somewhere in the Rochor area (see <a href="#p1_13">[13]</a>
                    above). However, in her subsequent long statement P37, Roshamima changed her
                    evidence by stating that they were supposed to meet <em>Murie’s foster brother’s wife</em> because Roshamima
                    intended to <em>order</em> “decorative gifts”
                    from her.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_108" id="Ftn_108_1"><sup>[note: 108]</sup></a></span> During examination-in-chief, she then mentioned,

                    (and not buy) decorative items from two different persons: <em>Murie’s adopted elder sister named “Ann”</em>
                    (who allegedly resides in Woodlands), and one <em>“makcik” whom Roshamima claimed was Murie’s

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_96"></a>96     In an attempt to lend credence to her account,
                    Roshamima also referred to an SMS text message which was addressed to Murie and
                    saved in the “Draft” folder of her phone at 2.28 pm on

                    dates, she finally settled on the account that she first informed Mas Swan on
                    5 May 2009 and subsequently called him again on 6 May 2009 to
                    confirm the visit.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_117" id="Ftn_117_1"><sup>[note: 117]</sup></a></span></p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_98"></a>98     Although Mas Swan initially claimed in his
                    first few statements that the purpose of entering Singapore on
                    6 May 2009 was to meet Roshamima’s aunt to collect
                    “marriage gifts”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_118" id="Ftn_118_1"><sup>[note: 118]</sup></a></span> or “wedding decoration

                    later retracted those parts of his statements and admitted they were
                        untrue.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_120" id="Ftn_120_1"><sup>[note: 120]</sup></a></span> He
                    then stated that while he and Roshamima were in the ST Office, just before
                    JHA 7781 was searched, Roshamima had directed him to say that, if anyone
                    were to ask him about their purpose for entering Singapore, he should say that
                    they were going to visit her aunt to collect wedding gifts.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_121" id="Ftn_121_1"><sup>[note: 121]</sup></a></span>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_99"></a>99     At the trial, Roshamima gave conflicting and
                    different explanations as to who she was supposed to meet during her visit to
                    Singapore. Her evidence underwent several changes and she failed to give any
                    satisfactory explanation for her wavering testimony. Ultimately, I accepted Mas
                    Swan’s evidence that Roshamima had fabricated another purpose for visiting
                    Singapore in order to conceal the true purpose of their visit, <em>ie</em>, to deliver controlled drugs into Singapore. The fact
                    that she attempted to concoct such a story, in my view, reinforces my finding
                    that she in fact knew that the purpose of the visit to Singapore was to deliver
                    the bundles of controlled drugs which were concealed in JHA 7781. In my
                    judgment, even if Roshamima had visited Singapore on 6 May 2009 to collect or
                    buy wedding gifts (which I have found not to be true), it did not exclude the
                    fact that she knew she was delivering controlled drugs into
                Singapore.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Whether parts of Mas Swan’s and Roshamima’s evidence were
                inadmissible against Roshamima by virtue of the similar fact rule</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_100"></a>100    As there was sufficient evidence before me,
                    without referring to the similar fact evidence, to make a finding that Roshamima
                    knew that the bundles retrieved from JHA 7781 on 6 May 2009
                    contained controlled drugs (see <a href="#p1_77">[77]</a> above),
                    it is not strictly necessary for me to consider whether the similar fact
                    evidence was admissible. However, for completeness, I have made a finding on
                    this issue.</p>

                        Prosecutor</em> [1996] 2 SLR(R) 178 (“<em>Tan Meng Jee</em>”), in which Yong Pung How CJ,

                    evidence was generally excluded because (at [41]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">41    ... to allow it in every instance is to risk the

                            without doubt has a prejudicial effect against the accused. However, at
                            times, similar facts can be so probative of guilt that to ignore it via

<p class="Judg-1">After reviewing the Singapore authorities on the matter, the Court
                    of Appeal observed that the decisions could be classified into two categories:
                    first, those in which the admissibility of similar fact evidence was determined
                    by applying a test of balancing the probative value of the similar fact evidence
                    against its prejudicial effect, a test which later found expression in the House
                    of Lords decision in <em>Director of Public Prosecutions v
                        Boardman</em> [1975] AC 421 (“<em>Boardman</em>”), and second, those in which the admissibility
                    of the similar fact evidence was determined according to the categories of
                    relevance under ss 14 and 15 without reference to any probative
                    value/prejudicial effect balancing test (see <em>Tan Meng
                        Jee</em> at [44]–[47]). It
                    then went on to approve the <em>Boardman</em> test and
                    superimposed it onto ss 14 and 15 of the EA (see <em>Tan
                        Meng Jee</em> at [48]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_103"></a>103    The Court of Appeal saw no controversy in
                    adopting the <em>Boardman</em> test because it was of the
                    view that a probative value/prejudicial effect balancing test was already
                    inherent within ss 14 and 15 of the EA (<em>Tan Meng
                        Jee</em> at [49]–[50]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">49    While the plain wording of the Evidence Act does
                            seem to adopt a categorisation approach to similar fact evidence, we
                            think it quite clear, without deciding whether similar facts adduced for
                            other purposes can ever be relevant, that at least where the similar
                            facts are being adduced to prove one of the matters identified in
                            ss 14 and 15, a balancing process must take place. Explanation 1 to
                            s 14 states that the similar fact “must show that the state
                            of mind exists not generally but in reference to the particular matter
                            in question”. Illustration (<em>o</em>), in
                            this respect, is instructive. The fact that a person has the habit of
                            shooting at people with intent to kill is irrelevant where he is being
                            tried for the murder of a specific person. The fact that he has
                            previously tried to shoot the same person is, however, relevant. The
                            illustration gives us some guidance as to how the balance should be
                            struck. Similar fact evidence is always prejudicial. In the instant
                            case, the fact that the appellant had previously trafficked in drugs, if
                            allowed to exercise any influence on the mind of the trier of fact,
                            would undoubtedly prejudice the appellant. It is only when the evidence
                            corresponds materially to the present facts that the interests of
                            justice demand that they be admitted.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">50    We find the same sort of balancing test implicit in
                            the wording of s 15. The section uses the term “<em>similar</em> occurrence”. The balancing
                            approach involves balancing probative weight and prejudicial effect. The
                            more “similar” the evidence, the more probative. If the
                            possibility of prejudice is higher, then the degree of similarity needs
                            to be correspondingly higher before the evidence is admissible. There is
                            no magic in the term “similar”. In reality, what is
                            “similar” enough is only so because its prejudicial effect
                            has been outweighed by the sheer probity of the similar fact
                            evidence.</p>

                        <em>Boardman</em> test was also influenced by two other
                    factors: first, the it accepted that the courts had a general discretion to
                    exclude any kind of evidence (not just similar fact evidence) prejudicial to the
                    accused if it would be <em>unjust</em> to do so
                    (“the fairness exception”), even if the evidence was deemed
                    relevant and admissible under the EA; and second, it took the view that the
                        <em>Boardman</em> test was, in substance, simply
                    another form of the fairness exception (at [51] and [52]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">51    That there has to be
                            a balancing process, therefore, seems to us to be beyond doubt. We are
                            aware, however, of the difficulties inherent in the actual application
                            of this test. Associate Professor Chin Tet Yung in his textbook,
                                <em>Evidence</em>, has this to
                        say:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">The ... approach involving degrees of relevancy can be described as
                            probably one of the most difficult doctrines to understand and apply in
                            the law of evidence.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">52    In response, we make first the observation that the
                            alternative strict categorisation test has never itself been wholly
                            “strict”. As Professor Chin points out, there is a
                            judicial discretion to exclude prejudicial evidence which actually
                            mirrors the <em>Boardman</em> test. In <em>Noor Mohamed v R</em> [1949] AC 182, Lord du Parcq
                            delivering the advice of the Privy Council said that, <em>where it would be unjust to admit prejudicial evidence even though
                                technically admissible, a discretion would lie to the judge to
                                exclude that evidence. We are of the view that the difference
                                between that discretion and the balancing process which we have
                                identified to be inherent in the wording of the Evidence Act is one
                                of degree rather than of substance</em>. As to the actual
                            content of the balancing process, the editors of <em>Cross on Evidence</em> have usefully identified three
                            factors, namely, cogency, strength of inference and relevance. Although
                            non-exhaustive, these factors should provide some guidance to the trial
                            judge. The relevance of such evidence is always a matter of law and an
                            appeal lies to this court should the trial judge have been mistaken in
                            admitting it…</p>

                    on the application of the <em>Boardman</em> test has, for
                    all practical purposes, been superseded by the recent decision of the court of
                    three judges in <em>Law Society of Singapore v Tan Guat Neo
                        Phyllis</em> [2008] 2 SLR(R) 239 (“<em>Phyllis Tan</em>”). Although, under the doctrine of <em>stare decisis</em>, <em>Tan Meng
                        Jee</em>, a Court of Appeal decision, is technically of greater
                    authority than <em>Phyllis Tan</em>, Professor Jeffrey
                    Pinsler SC has commented, persuasively, that the latter must now be regarded as
                    the leading authority for the following reasons (<em>Evidence and
                        the Litigation Process</em> (LexisNexis, 3rd Ed, 2010)

                        Justice’s judgment [in <em>Phyllis</em>] is
                        clearly intended to resolve various difficulties created by previous cases
                        (including decisions of the Court of Appeal) and to clarify the law once and

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_106"></a>106    In <em>Phyllis
                    Tan</em>, Chan Sek Keong CJ, who delivered the judgment, concluded,
                    after a comprehensive review of the authorities, that the fairness exception as
                    expressed in the House of Lords decision <em>R v Sang</em>
                    [1980] AC 402 was inapplicable in Singapore because it was
                    inconsistent with the overarching principle in the EA that “all relevant
                    evidence is admissible unless specifically expressed to be inadmissible”
                    (although Chan CJ did acknowledge that in so far as cases involving entrapment
                    evidence were concerned, an application of the common law fairness exception
                    should result in the same outcome because, by definition, the probative effect
                    of entrapment evidence would always outweigh its prejudicial effect on the
                    accused) (see <em>Phyllis Tan</em> at [126]). Commenting on <em>Phyllis Tan</em>, the Court of Appeal in <em>Lee Chez
                        Kee v Public Prosecutor</em> [2008] 3 SLR(R) 447
                        (“<em>Lee Chez Kee</em>”) further
                    observed that the courts have no residual discretion to exclude evidence deemed
                    legally relevant under the EA (at [106]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">106    ... the court of three judges has recently in
                                <em>Law Society of Singapore v Tan Guat Neo
                                Phyllis</em> [2008] 2 SLR(R) 239 (“<em>Phyllis Tan</em>”) persuasively ruled that
                            apart from the confines of the EA, there is no residual discretion to
                            exclude evidence which is otherwise rendered legally relevant by the
                            EA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_107"></a>107    Based on these observations in <em>Phyllis Tan</em> and <em>Lee Chez
                        Kee</em>, it is clear that the admissibility of similar fact evidence
                    has to be determined according to the categories of relevance under ss 14
                    and 15 and <em>Tan Meng Jee</em> is inconsistent with
                    the EA in so far as it allows for the exclusion of similar fact evidence that is
                    otherwise deemed relevant under those provisions. This does not necessarily
                    mean, however, that all previous cases where the probative value/prejudicial
                    effect balancing test had been applied, <em>eg</em>,
                        <em>Tan Meng Jee</em>, were therefore wrongly decided.
                    As mentioned by the Court of Appeal in <em>Tan Meng
                        Jee</em> at [49]–[50], both
                    the requirement in Explanation 1 to s 14 (see <a href="#p1_101">[101]</a> above) and the term “similar occurrence” in
                    s 15 appear to correspond with the “striking similarity” test
                    extensively referred to in <em>Boardman</em>, which is an
                    application of the probative value/prejudicial effect balancing test: the more
                    “similar” the evidence, the more probative it is (see <em>Tan Meng Jee</em> at [50]; <em>Hin Hup Bus Service (a firm) v Tay
                        Chwee Hiang</em> [2006] 4 SLR(R) 723 at [39]). Accordingly, in my view, decisions that
                    have applied the “striking similarity” test are therefore entirely
                    consistent with ss 14 and 15 of the EA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_108"></a>108    Both ss 14 and 15 of the EA allow for
                    the admission of similar fact evidence to show the accused’s state of
                    mind. According to the editors of <em>Sarkar's Law of
                        Evidence</em> (Wadhwa &amp; Co, 16th Ed, 2007) (“<em>Sarkar</em>”) and <em>Ratanlal &amp;
                        Dhirajlal’s The Law of Evidence</em> (Wadhwa &amp; Co, 22nd Ed,
                    2006) (“<em>Ratanlal</em>”) (at p 313),
                    s 15 is an application of s 14, which embodies the general rule
                    governing the admissibility of similar fact evidence (<em>Sarkar</em> at p 385):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">When studying s 14, it is well to consider the provision in s 15
                        which is an application of the rule in s 14. The two sections should be
                        read together for a grasp of the true principle. S 14 deals with the
                        relevancy of facts showing intention, knowledge, &amp;c, when the existence
                        of any state of mind or body or bodily feeling is in issue. Under s 15
                        when the act in question forms a <em>series</em> of
                        similar occurrences, evidence of similar facts is admissible to prove
                        intention or knowledge of the person and to rebut the defence of accident,
                        mistake, etc. The [Indian] Evidence Act does not go beyond the English law
                        in regard to the admissibility of similar facts to prove states of
                        mind.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_109"></a>109    The general rule in s 14 is, however,
                    subject to the very important qualification in Explanation 1 that the state of
                    mind shown must be a condition of thought and feeling having distinct and
                    immediate reference to the particular matter in question and cannot simply be
                    evidence of general disposition, habit and tendency to do the act in question
                    (see <em>Sarkar</em> at p 384). Being an application
                    of the general rule, s 15 must also be read subject to s 14 so far as
                    evidence of state of mind is concerned (see <em>Sarkar</em>
                    at p 401).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_110"></a>110    In short, s 15 of the EA only applies
                    where:</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(a) </div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">there is a question whether an act was
                            intentional or accidental, or was done with a particular knowledge or
                            intention; and</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(b) </div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">it is sought to prove that the act forms part of
                            a <em>series</em> of similar
                        occurrences.</div>
<p class="Judg-1">The operating principle behind s 15 was explained in <em>Pinsler</em> at para 3.17:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... The point of [s 15] is that if the accused alleges that his act
                        was unintentional or done without particular knowledge, the prosecution may
                        wish to adduce evidence of ‘a series of similar occurrences’ in
                        which the accused was involved and thereby show the improbability of the
                        accused’s explanation. The basis of the principle is <em>that ‘a series of acts with the same characteristics is
                            unlikely to be produced by accident or
                        inadvertence</em>’.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">In fact, the object of s 15 goes further than that of s 14
                        (<em>Sarkar</em> at 405):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The evidence of similar acts may have the object of negativing an innocent
                        intent as in s. 14, but this section goes further. Here, the object is not
                        merely to negative innocent intent, but <em>to prove a
                            pre-existing plan or design and that the act charged is only one of a
                            class or series designed to bring about a certain result with a certain
                            object</em>.</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_111"></a>111    Given that Roshamima’s defence was
                    that she had entered Singapore with the purpose of visiting Murie’s aunt
                    or his adopted brother’s wife or his adopted elder sister and did not know
                    there were bundles hidden in the door panel of JHA 7781, the Prosecution
                    correctly sought to rely on s 15 of the EA to admit evidence of her
                    previous deliveries of bundles for Mickey to show that her entering into
                    Singapore on 6 May 2009 was simply the latest instance of a series of
                    deliveries of bundles for Mickey. The issue then was whether the evidence of the
                    previous deliveries shared sufficient common features or similarities with the
                    events that occurred on 6 May 2009 to render it relevant and
                    admissible under s 15 of the EA; and, after reviewing the evidence, I came

                    she claimed to have done so but subsequently became “too lazy” to
                    press him further after he reassured her that the items were not
                        dangerous.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_134" id="Ftn_134_1"><sup>[note: 134]</sup></a></span> After the delivery, Mickey handed her
                    RM2,000, out of which RM1,000 was for helping Mickey, RM500 was a wedding gift,
                    and RM500 was for repayment of a personal loan.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_135" id="Ftn_135_1"><sup>[note: 135]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_114"></a>114    On the subsequent occasion, possibly around
                    1 May 2009, Mickey had contacted Roshamima for help. Roshamima asked
                    Mickey to tell her what the contents of the bundles were and again allegedly
                    received the same assurance that it was not dangerous and the police authorities
                    would not apprehend them.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_136" id="Ftn_136_1"><sup>[note: 136]</sup></a></span> Although she continued to have

                    agreeing to help Mickey, Roshamima and Mas Swan delivered two bundles to Jalan
                    Kayu in Singapore: one bundle was hidden in the front passenger’s door
                    panel and the other was hidden in the driver’s door panel.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_138" id="Ftn_138_1"><sup>[note: 138]</sup></a></span> She
                    retrieved both bundles from the door panels only after they had arrived at their

                    Roshamima had driven JHA 7781 to a Shell “Kipmart” at Tampoi
                    in order to exchange cars with one of Mickey’s men.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_140" id="Ftn_140_1"><sup>[note: 140]</sup></a></span> She
                    claimed that, after the delivery, Mickey paid Mas Swan a sum of RM1,000 although
                    she received nothing.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_141" id="Ftn_141_1"><sup>[note: 141]</sup></a></span> On both occasions, Roshamima was the one
                    who removed the bundles from the door panels and both of them never saw the
                    contents inside the bundles, although they both handled the bundles.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_142" id="Ftn_142_1"><sup>[note: 142]</sup></a></span> She accepted that she had the opportunity to
                    open the bundles but did not do so because Mickey had told her not to
                    “spoil” them.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_143" id="Ftn_143_1"><sup>[note: 143]</sup></a></span></p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_115"></a>115    She also admitted to twice using
                    JHA 7781 to deliver bundles into Singapore together with Mas Swan, on
                    Mickey’s instructions.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_144" id="Ftn_144_1"><sup>[note: 144]</sup></a></span> Murie occasionally came along in

                    Roshamima claimed that, on a few occasions, Mickey assured her that the bundles
                    did not contain drugs<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_147" id="Ftn_147_1"><sup>[note: 147]</sup></a></span> or
                    anything illegal (one such assurance came immediately after he had instructed
                    Roshamima to relay to Murie the news that a man whom they all knew as
                    “Skin” had been arrested).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_148" id="Ftn_148_1"><sup>[note: 148]</sup></a></span> She also claimed to have asked
                    Murie whether he was delivering drugs or cigarettes into Singapore but Murie
                    denied doing so.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_149" id="Ftn_149_1"><sup>[note: 149]</sup></a></span> It
                    did occur to her, however, that the RM1,000 paid to her for each delivery was a
                    large and suspicious sum of money, although she eventually decided “not
                    to think too much into it”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_150" id="Ftn_150_1"><sup>[note: 150]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_116"></a>116    On the two occasions that she and Mas Swan
                    delivered bundles for Mickey, they would first arrange for JHA 7781 to be
                    handed over to one of Mickey’s men in Johor so that the bundle intended
                    for delivery could be placed in the car. After the bundle was hidden in
                    JHA 7781, the car would be returned to them and they would then drive the
                    car into Singapore. After they had reached their destination in Singapore,
                    Roshamima would, as instructed, remove the bundle that was concealed in the
                    panel of the front passenger seat before passing it to someone who would arrive
                    to collect it from them.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_151" id="Ftn_151_1"><sup>[note: 151]</sup></a></span></p>

<p class="Judg-1">The Prosecution sought to use the above SMS text messages to show
                    that, on 30 April 2009, Roshamima was actively preparing for a
                    “segmen”, <em>ie</em>, delivery of bundles of
                    drugs into Singapore.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_118"></a>118    Although Roshamima made a desperate attempt
                    to explain that the word “segmen” was a code-word for
                    “ice” and did not refer to the job of delivering drugs into
                    Singapore (as claimed by Mas Swan), it was obvious that there was no truth
                    whatsoever in her evidence on this point. Not only did Roshamima’s answers
                    on the witness stand sound contrived, she even contradicted herself at one point
                    as she struggled during cross-examination to explain at different times the
                    meanings of the SMS text messages she had sent on 30 April 2009.
                    First, she claimed that she was asking Murie for “ice”, and,
                    perhaps unwittingly, later claimed that she wanted to return Murie some
                    “ice” before she finished her supply. By way of contrast, Mas
                    Swan’s evidence, which I accepted, was consistent and clearly much more
                    credible when seen in light of the other corroborating evidence. Accordingly, I
                    find that, at all material times, Roshamima knew that she was delivering
                    controlled drugs each time she made a delivery on Mickey’s
                behalf.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_119"></a>119    The traveller’s movement records from
                    ICA also show that on 9 March 2009 Roshamima and Murie had entered

                                            communicate with each other via SMS or via calling each
                                            other, your Honour, Murie and I. So whatever---during
                                            the discussion with Adam, I would narrate---I would
                                            back---feedback to Murie, either by phoning him or SMS
                                            him, your Honour. And then during the
                                            discussion---during the discussion with Adam and Murie
                                            would give me a call and so---so it was a bit of---a bit
                                            of a pandemonium because I was trying to focus on both.
                                            When I was discussing with Adam and suddenly there was
                                            this incoming call from Murie, and so therefore I was
                                            not able to focus on both of them, so I---I

                                            means, your Honour, because I was doing two things at
                                            one time, talking to Adam and also talking to---or

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_121"></a>121    She confirmed, however, that she was indeed
                    in financial difficulty at the time, as mentioned in Murie’s SMS message
                    (see item 5 at <a href="#p1_119">[119]</a> above).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_164" id="Ftn_164_1"><sup>[note: 164]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_122"></a>122    When asked during cross-examination what the
                    word “segmen” in her SMS text message to Murie on
                    30 April 2009 meant (see item 2 at <a href="#p1_117">[117]</a> above), Roshamima explained that the word referred to
                    “ice” and she was actually asking Mickey and Murie for some
                        “ice”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_165" id="Ftn_165_1"><sup>[note: 165]</sup></a></span> She also explained that
                    her subsequent message to Mas Swan (see item 3 at <a href="#p1_117">[117]</a> above) was an instruction to get some money and be ready
                    in case there was “ice” available for them.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_166" id="Ftn_166_1"><sup>[note: 166]</sup></a></span>
                    However, subsequently during another point of cross-examination, she claimed
                    instead that she wanted to <em>return</em> Murie some
                        “ice”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_167" id="Ftn_167_1"><sup>[note: 167]</sup></a></span> As for her
                    message to Mas Swan telling him “May be follow, “sayang”
                    will tell later” (see item 6 at <a href="#p1_117">[117]</a> above), she explained that Murie wanted to go for a
                    karaoke session and she had simply asked Mas Swan whether he wanted to follow
                    Murie as well.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_168" id="Ftn_168_1"><sup>[note: 168]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_123"></a>123    Mas Swan’s evidence that Roshamima was
                    regularly involved in Mickey’s drug syndicate was also corroborated by the
                    ICA travel movement records, which showed that Roshamima had travelled into
                    Singapore a total number of 29 times for very short visits late at night within
                    a period of about 3 months, and also the SMS text messages retrieved from
                    Roshamima’s mobile phone, which showed that she was doing work with Murie
                    which was “highly risky” and involved Murie expressing concern
                    that Roshamima’s “life [was] now [his] responsibility” (see
                        <a href="#p1_119">[119]</a> above).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(4)   Roshamima’s account of the purpose of her previous
                visits to Singapore</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_124"></a>124    Roshamima confirmed that between
                    25 February 2009 and 6 May 2009, she had entered Singapore
                    together with Murie a total of 17 times,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_169" id="Ftn_169_1"><sup>[note: 169]</sup></a></span> and that the purpose for the majority of
                    those visits was to meet Murie’s friends<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_170" id="Ftn_170_1"><sup>[note: 170]</sup></a></span> and to visit
                    night clubs in the Orchard Road and Clarke Quay areas.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_171" id="Ftn_171_1"><sup>[note: 171]</sup></a></span> Based
                    on her recollection, only one or two of those visits were for the purpose of
                    delivering bundles<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_172" id="Ftn_172_1"><sup>[note: 172]</sup></a></span> and on at least one occasion,
                    JHA 7781 was the car used for the delivery.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_173" id="Ftn_173_1"><sup>[note: 173]</sup></a></span> During the trial,
                    Roshamima sought to retract the following portions of her statement in P38 which
                    stated that Murie had paid her RM1,000 each time she followed him into
                        Singapore,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_174" id="Ftn_174_1"><sup>[note: 174]</sup></a></span> claiming that it was suggested to her by ASP
                    Gary Chan and was untrue because she did not receive such money.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_175" id="Ftn_175_1"><sup>[note: 175]</sup></a></span> She did
                    admit, however, that Murie had paid her money in sums of RM300–400 and,
                    occasionally, in Singapore dollars as “tips”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_176" id="Ftn_176_1"><sup>[note: 176]</sup></a></span>
                    whenever she accompanied him to visit night clubs and karaoke bars in Malaysia
                    or Singapore.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_177" id="Ftn_177_1"><sup>[note: 177]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_125"></a>125    Roshamima admitted that on these two
                    occasions, Mickey had spoken to her, and not Mas Swan, about bringing in the
                    bundles. Roshamima said that Mas Swan had always let her do the
                        “talking”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_178" id="Ftn_178_1"><sup>[note: 178]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">My findings on the admissibility of the similar fact
                evidence</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_126"></a>126    In the light of the foregoing, it was clear
                    that, on 6 May 2009, just like on the previous occasions, Roshamima
                    knew that there had been an exchange of cars with one of Mickey’s men
                    prior to their entering Singapore. This much was evident from her long
                        statements.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_179" id="Ftn_179_1"><sup>[note: 179]</sup></a></span> I disbelieved her evidence
                    on the witness stand that that portion of her statement was based on her
                    assumption that the bundles were placed there by one of Mickey’s men, an
                    assumption that was formed only <em>after</em> she was
                    shown the three bundles found in JHA 7781 on 6 May 2009 (see
                        <a href="#p1_69">[69]</a> above). In my view, if she had
                    truly assumed <em>ex post facto</em> that the bundles had
                    been placed in JHA 7781 by one of Mickey’s men, she would have said
                    so in her long statement instead of telling the recording officer that the
                    purpose of bringing JHA 7781 to the Esso petrol station on
                    6 May 2009 was to exchange cars with someone working for
                    Mickey.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_127"></a>127    Roshamima’s explanation on the witness
                    stand was simply too incredible for it to be taken seriously. Further to that,
                    the circumstances surrounding the exchange of cars, such as the involvement of
                    Mas Swan and Murie, the similar wait for JHA 7781 to be returned to them
                    after the exchange of cars, and the direct route into Singapore after taking
                    back possession of JHA 7781, were <em>virtually
                        identical</em> to the previous times Roshamima delivered bundles for
                    Mickey.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_128"></a>128    The highly similar circumstances show that
                    it was very likely that Roshamima was aware that they were delivering bundles of
                    controlled drugs into Singapore on 6 May 2009. For that reason, I find
                    that the evidence in Mas Swan’s and Roshamima’s statements relevant
                    and admissible under s 15 of the EA. Likewise, the “striking”
                    similarity between the similar fact evidence and the events on
                    6 May 2009 gives the evidence an explanatory force that is highly
                    probative of the level of Roshamima’s knowledge on 6 May 2009.
                    Therefore, in my judgment, I find that the evidence was also admissible under
                    the probative effect/prejudicial effect balancing test.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_129"></a>129    In summary, I find that the Prosecution has
                    proved beyond a reasonable doubt that Roshamima knew on 6 May 2009 when she
                    entered Singapore in JHA 7781 with Mas Swan that bundles containing controlled
                    drugs were concealed in the door panel of the car on each of the following
                    bases:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_129-p2_a"></a>(a)     I accepted Mas Swan’s
                        evidence over Roshamima’s that they both knew that the bundles of
                        controlled drugs were concealed in the door panel of JHA
                    7781.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_129-p2_b"></a>(b)     The
                        admission of similar fact evidence of previous deliveries under strikingly
                        similar circumstances and/or under the probative effect/prejudicial effect
                        balancing test that Roshamima knew that bundles of controlled drugs were
                        concealed in the door panel of JHA 7781.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_130"></a>130    As Roshamima did not adduce any evidence
                    that she believed that the bundles contained controlled drugs other than
                    diamorphine, the presumption under s 18(2) of the MDA remains
                    unrebutted.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_131"></a>131    By reason of my findings, after having
                    carefully reviewed and considered all the evidence before me, I make the
                    following orders:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_131-p2_a"></a>(a)     As I am satisfied that Mas Swan has
                        successfully rebutted the presumption under s 18(2) of the MDA, the
                        Prosecution has failed to prove the Charge against Mas Swan beyond a
                        reasonable doubt. Therefore the Charge against Mas Swan has not been made
                        out and I acquit him of the Charge accordingly.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_131-p2_b"></a>(b)     In view of my finding that Mas Swan has
                        successfully rebutted the presumption under s 18(2) of MDA, the Charge
                        as currently framed against Roshamima would have to be amended. Pursuant to
                        my power under s163(1) of the CPC, I altered the Charge against Roshamima as
                        follows:</p>

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">are charged that you, on 6 May 2009, at or about 9.56 p.m. in a
                        Malaysian registered motor car bearing registration number JHA 7781, at
                        Woodlands Checkpoint, Singapore, did import into Singapore a controlled drug
                        specified in Class A of the First Schedule of the [MDA], Chapter 185, to
                        wit, one hundred and twenty-three (123) packets of substances containing not
                        less than 21.48 grams of diamorphine, without any authorization under the
                        said Act or the Regulations made thereunder, and you have thereby committed
                        an offence under section 7 of the [MDA] and punishable under section 33 of
                        the [MDA].</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Pursuant to s 163(2) of the CPC, the Amended Charge was read out and
                        explained to Roshamima. In accordance with s 164(1) of the CPC,
                        Roshamima was called upon to enter her plea. After consulting her counsel,
                        Mr Muzammil, Roshamima maintained her original plea of not guilty and
                        confirmed that she did not wish to call any new witness or recall any
                        witness in relation to the Amended Charge. As there is no material
                        difference between the Amended Charge and the Charge, I am satisfied that
                        the Prosecution has proven the ingredients of the Amended Charge against
                        Roshamima beyond a reasonable doubt. In the premises, I find Roshamima
                        guilty of the Amended Charge and hereby convict her under s 7 of the
                        MDA. The mandatory death sentence prescribed under s 33 read with the
                        Second Schedule of the MDA is pronounced accordingly.</p>
