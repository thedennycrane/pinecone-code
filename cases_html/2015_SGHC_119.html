<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       The plaintiff Chua Thong Jiang Andrew
                    (“Andrew”) was a patient of the first defendant Dr Yue Wai Mun
                    (“Dr Yue”), an orthopaedic surgeon who was employed by the second
                    defendant Singapore General Hospital Pte Ltd (“SGHPL”). Andrew
                    underwent a spine surgery performed by Dr Yue and brings this claim against both
                    defendants (collectively “the Defendants”) for negligence and
                    against SGHPL for breach of contract as well.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Background</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       Andrew was 47 years of age and was generally in
                    good health in April 2007. Two weeks before 20 April 2007, Andrew
                    experienced some back pain. In the morning of 20 April 2007, he again felt
                    pain in his back and decided to see Dr Chua Thiam Eng (“Dr Chua”),
                    a general medical practitioner who was his company doctor. However, Andrew
                    collapsed while on the way to Dr Chua’s clinic. He was assisted back
                    to his office. Dr Chua came to Andrew’s office at about 10am to examine
                    him. He gave Andrew a pain relieving injection and a muscle relaxant. However,
                    about half an hour later, Andrew lost all sensation and power in both his lower
                    limbs. Dr Chua was contacted and informed of Andrew’s condition. Dr Chua
                    recommended that Andrew be brought to a hospital in an ambulance
                    immediately.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Andrew’s admission to SGH</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       At about 12pm, Andrew was brought in an
                    ambulance to Singapore General Hospital (“SGH”), which is operated
                    by SGHPL.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       Andrew was first seen by Dr Teoh Hui Joo
                    (“Dr Teoh”), a medical officer at the SGH Department of Emergency
                    Medicine (“DEM”). She examined Andrew and noted that he had zero
                    motor power in his lower limbs, with diminished sensation below the T11 level of
                    the thorax. She also recorded that Andrew’s anal tone was
                lax.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       Dr Teoh referred Andrew’s case to
                    SGH’s Department of Orthopaedic Surgery. Dr Ng Yung Chuan Sean (“Dr
                    Ng”), a medical officer from that department, came over to the DEM and
                    also examined Andrew. He found that Andrew had zero motor power in his lower
                    limbs, decreased sensation below the T11/T12 level, and that Andrew’s anal
                    tone was lax.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       Laboratory blood tests and X-rays of Andrew were
                    done. Dr Ng contacted Dr Yue, who was the spine consultant on second-line call
                    that day, at 2pm and informed him of Andrew’s condition. Dr Yue assessed
                    the X-ray images taken of Andrew’s thoracic and lumbar spine outline and
                    found them unremarkable. He instructed that an urgent Magnetic Resonance Imaging
                    (“MRI”) scan of Andrew’s thoracic and lumbar spine be done.
                    He also instructed that Andrew be admitted to a High Dependency Unit
                    (“HDU”) ward.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       Andrew’s MRI scan images were available to
                    Dr Yue online at about 5pm, although the formal radiologist report was not
                    issued yet. Dr Yue was of the opinion that Andrew had suffered an acute disc
                    prolapse at the thoracic level, <em>ie</em>, T10/T11 level
                    and that it was predominantly on the left side. A disc prolapse, which was also
                    referred to as a disc herniation at the trial, is often called a “slipped
                    disc” in layman’s language. The disc consists of an outer fibrous
                    ring called an annulus surrounding a soft nucleus. A disc prolapse occurs when
                    part of the nucleus pierces through the annulus into the spinal canal. Then, it
                    may or may not compress the spinal cord. The symptoms that Andrew was exhibiting
                    were caused by a disc prolapse compressing his spinal cord. Andrew’s
                    condition, however, was rare because Andrew’s disc prolapse was at the
                    thoracic spine (<em>ie</em>, higher up around the chest
                    level) rather than the lumbar spine (<em>ie</em>, lower
                    down around the lower back), the latter being more common. A prolapsed disc at
                    the thoracic spine is more challenging for a surgeon than one at the lumbar
                        spine.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       At about 5.30pm, Dr Chua Chi Ming Kelvin
                    (“Dr Kelvin Chua”), a house officer from the SGH Department of
                    Orthopaedic Surgery examined Andrew. He did a scoring of Andrew’s status
                    on the American Spinal Injury Association (“ASIA”) Impairment
                    Scale. He found Andrew to be of ASIA A status. I will say more about this status
                    later.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       After Dr Yue was informed that Andrew had been
                    admitted to an HDU ward, he went to see Andrew. He discussed Andrew’s
                    condition with him and the need for urgent surgery to remove the disc prolapse
                    that was causing the spinal cord compression.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     There is some dispute as to who was present at
                    this time and what Dr Yue said. Andrew and his wife alleged that both of
                    them were present then. Andrew said that from the discussion with Dr Yue, he got
                    the impression that the chances of recovery after surgery were good. On the
                    other hand, Dr Yue said that Andrew’s wife was not present. He said that
                    he informed Andrew that the prognosis after surgery was poor. In any event, it
                    is not disputed that Andrew consented to the surgery although he alleges a lack
                    of informed consent on which I will elaborate later.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The first surgery</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     The operation commenced at about 8.45pm that
                    night. I shall refer to this operation as “the first surgery”. The
                    details of the surgery are helpfully set out in Dr Yue’s opening statement
                    at para 13 and I repeat them below:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">13.    Specifically, [Dr Yue] performed “T10 total
                            decompression laminectomy, T10/11 discectomy, left transforaminal
                            interbody fusion with local bone graft, and instrumentation with
                            Expedium screws”. In so doing, he adopted what is also commonly
                            known as “the postero-lateral approach”. That is to say,
                            he operated from [Andrew’s] back and approached the prolapsed disc
                            laterally at an angle. As the name of the operation suggests, there were
                            essentially four main stages involved in this operation:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">a)    First, screws were inserted into the vertebrae to
                            affix the rods necessary to stabilise the spine. This stage is referred
                            to as “instrumentation with Expedium
                        screws”.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">b)    Second, a part of the T10 vertebra known as the
                            lamina was surgically removed to allow visualisation of the spinal cord
                            within the dural sac, and to allow access to the prolapsed disc
                            material. The left T10/11 facet joint was also removed to allow the
                            prolapsed disc material to be approached posteo-laterally [<em>sic</em>]. This stage is referred to as “T10
                            total decompression laminectomy”.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">c)    Third, the prolapsed disc material at the T10/T11
                            level was removed to the extent possible, so as to relieve the pressure
                            on the spinal cord. In addition, disc material within the disc space was
                            also removed to allow the placement of the bone graft. This stage is
                            referred to as “T10/11 discectomy”.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">d)    Fourth, to prevent the vertebrae from collapsing
                            onto each other and to increase stability, the disc space was filled
                            with bone graft. This stage is referred to as “left
                            transforaminal interbody fusion with local bone
                        graft”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     The postero-lateral approach is also referred
                    to as the transfacetal approach. This means that Dr Yue operated from
                    Andrew’s back and approached the T10/T11 prolapsed disc laterally at an
                    angle through the facet joint.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span> I will refer
                    to the approach as the “posterior approach” for simplicity. The
                    surgery was performed with the aid of magnifying loupes.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     Dr Yue asserted that before he closed up, he
                    did a visual inspection of the spinal cord within the dural sac (which is
                    transparent). He saw that there was a gap between the spinal cord and the dura
                    and that the spinal cord was free. The spinal cord was pulsating in tandem with
                    Andrew’s heartbeat. To him, this demonstrated that there was no more
                    significant constriction of the flow of the cerebral spinal fluid surrounding
                    the spinal cord. He was of the view that Andrew’s spinal cord was
                    adequately decompressed and closed up.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Events subsequent to the first surgery</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     Four days later on 24 April 2007, Dr Yue
                    had a meeting with Andrew’s family, including his wife and
                    siblings.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     Andrew had not regained any significant
                    neurological function after the first surgery. Dr Yue said he explained at the
                    meeting that the outcome was not unexpected given the poor prognosis. If there
                    was any improvement, this might take many months to manifest. Andrew’s
                    position was that Dr Yue sounded optimistic and mentioned that he could do much
                    better than a previous patient who was walking with the aid of
                crutches.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     On the same day, Andrew was transferred to
                    SGH’s Department of Rehabilitation Medicine. The next day, Dr Yue left
                    Singapore for an overseas conference.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     On 7 May 2007, Andrew’s brother,
                    Edwin Chua (“Edwin”), spoke to Dr Chang Wei Chun (“Dr
                    Chang”), a consultant orthopaedic and trauma surgeon with a private
                    practice at Gleneagles Medical Centre. The family was concerned about what they
                    perceived to be a lack of improvement in Andrew’s condition. Dr Chang
                    suggested that a second MRI scan be done.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     On 8 May 2007, Andrew requested SGH to do
                    a second MRI scan. He was advised against it as the MRI post-surgery would not
                    be clear and the use of contrast dye then might harm his kidneys. He was also
                    informed that a second MRI scan could not be scheduled immediately as his was
                    not an emergency case.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     Andrew then requested and was granted home
                    leave on the same day. He went to see Dr Chang who ordered an MRI scan to be
                    done at Gleneagles Hospital (“Gleneagles”). Apparently, an X-ray
                    and CT scan were also done there. Based on the second MRI scan and the report of
                    a radiologist, Dr Michael Lin (“Dr Lin”), Dr Chang was of the view
                    that there was still disc compression on the spinal cord. This was 18 days after
                    the first MRI and the first surgery. He recommended that a second surgery be
                    done. In the meantime, Andrew returned to SGH that day.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     I will refer to:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_20-p2_a"></a>(a)     the first MRI scan done at SGH on
                        20 April 2007 as “the SGH MRI scan”;
                    and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_20-p2_b"></a>(b)     the second MRI
                        scan done at Gleneagles on 8 May 2007 as “the Gleneagles MRI
                        scan”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     The next day, Andrew was discharged from SGH
                    at his own request. He was then admitted to Gleneagles as a patient. He was
                    examined by Dr Chang and Dr Timothy Lee (“Dr Lee”), who is a
                    consultant neurosurgeon. Both of them recommended that a second surgery be done.
                    He was informed that in view of the lapse of time since the onset of paraplegia
                    and the first surgery, his prognosis was extremely poor. Nevertheless, he
                    decided to go ahead with the second surgery.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The second surgery</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     The second surgery was done by Dr Lee as the
                    lead surgeon with the assistance of Dr Chang on 10 May 2007. This was
                    20 days after the first surgery was done. The second surgery was described as
                    “an anterior decompression through a thoracotomy”
                        approach.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span> This means that the surgery was done
                    from the front through the chest.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span> I will refer to this
                    approach as the “anterior approach” for simplicity. After the
                    second surgery, there was no significant neurological improvement. He was
                    discharged from Gleneagles on 25 May 2007.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Subsequent treatment and improvement of Andrew’s
                condition</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     Following his discharge from Gleneagles,
                    Andrew was transferred to Changi General Hospital and later to Ang Mo Kio
                    Community Hospital (“AMK Hospital”) for about another three
                    months.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     After his discharge from AMK Hospital, he went
                    back a few times for further rehabilitation therapy. He stopped such therapy as
                    he considered it too expensive to continue.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     On 3 October 2008, Dr Chang examined
                    Andrew. Andrew was still confined to a wheelchair and could not
                stand.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     About two years after the first surgery, upon
                    the encouragement of Andrew’s physician friend who practiced Traditional
                    Chinese Medicine, Andrew started to go swimming and was more physically active.
                    Andrew then started to see significant improvement and after some time could
                    move robotically, and, if his legs were very stiff, walk with the aid of a
                    walking frame.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_5" id="Ftn_5_1"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     Andrew was examined by Dr Teh Peng Hooi
                    (“Dr Teh”), a consultant orthopaedic surgeon in private practice,
                    on 7 October 2011. Dr Teh noted that Andrew could walk very slowly and with
                    difficulty using a walking frame. His lower limbs were weak with muscle strength
                    generally of grade three motor power. He was just able to lift up his legs by
                    himself off the examination couch. Sensation to touch was present in his legs
                    (from the groin downwards) but it was an impaired sensation.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     Dr Teh examined Andrew a second time on
                    16 January 2012. He noted again that Andrew could walk slowly and with
                    great difficulty using a walking frame. There was slight impairment to touch
                    below the umbilicus downwards to the groin region. Left leg sensation to touch
                    was better than the right leg but both legs’ sensation was impaired. He
                    was able to lift up both legs momentarily, with the left leg for a longer time
                    than the right.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     On 10 September 2013, Andrew went for
                    another MRI scan at Gleneagles.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     In the meantime, Dr Yue did not hear further
                    from Andrew until he received a letter of demand from Andrew’s solicitors
                    dated 29 June 2009. The writ of summons was filed more than three years
                    later on 17 October 2012.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The allegations and issues</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     The statement of claim (“the
                    SOC”) made various allegations of negligence against Dr Yue. The same
                    allegations were made against SGHPL. It was not disputed that if Dr Yue was
                    negligent, SGHPL would be vicariously liable for his negligence. The SOC also
                    made additional allegations of negligence against SGHPL. However, on the first
                    day of trial, Andrew’s counsel informed the court that he was dropping
                    some of the additional allegations of negligence against SGHPL. In so far as
                    these additional allegations were repeated in his allegations of breach of
                    contract against SGHPL, they were also dropped. However, SGHPL pointed out in
                    its closing submissions at paras 56–57 that Andrew had also quietly
                    dropped other allegations without informing the court. These other allegations
                    were not pursued at trial. I agree and I need not dwell on them.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     The remaining allegations against the
                    Defendants were the allegations of negligence pleaded against Dr Yue at para 15
                    of the SOC. I will restate them as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_32-p2_a"></a>(a)     Andrew had not given informed
                        consent for the surgery performed by Dr Yue as Dr Yue had not informed
                        Andrew about the posterior and anterior approaches.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_32-p2_b"></a>(b)     A second MRI scan ought to have been
                        ordered at SGH after the first surgery. This would have revealed a
                        continuing compression of the spinal cord and resulted in a second surgery
                        being undertaken immediately thereafter which would in turn have improved
                        Andrew’s chances of recovery from paraplegia.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_32-p2_c"></a>(c)     The posterior approach adopted by Dr
                        Yue was inappropriate as the disc prolapse was a central
                    one.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_32-p2_d"></a>(d)     Dr Yue failed
                        to completely decompress the prolapsed disc which continued to compress on
                        Andrew’s spinal cord.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>These
                        allegations became the issues to be determined. In addition, there was the
                        fifth issue of causation, that is, whether any negligent conduct had in fact
                        impeded Andrew’s recovery. In my analysis below, I deal with issues
                        (c) and (d) together because they are closely intertwined for reasons that
                        will become apparent.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The law</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     There was no dispute on the applicable legal
                    principles. In Singapore, the leading authority on medical negligence is the
                    Court of Appeal decision in <em>Khoo James and another v
                        Gunapathy d/o Muniandy and another appeal</em> [2002] 1 SLR(R) 1024
                        (“<em>Khoo</em>”). There, the Court of
                    Appeal reiterated that the test is as stated in <em>Bolam v
                        Friern Hospital Management Committee</em> [1957] 1 WLR 582
                        (“<em>Bolam</em>”). As McNair J in
                        <em>Bolam</em> put it at 587:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… [A doctor] is not guilty of negligence if he has acted in
                        accordance with a practice accepted as proper by a responsible body of
                        medical men skilled in that particular act … Putting it the other way
                        round, a [doctor] is not negligent, if he is acting in accordance with such
                        a practice, merely because there is a body of opinion who would take a
                        contrary view. …</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     The Court of Appeal in <em>Khoo</em> also accepted that this test was supplemented by the House
                    of Lords decision in <em>Bolitho v City and Hackney Health
                        Authority</em> [1998] AC 232 (“<em>Bolitho</em>”) in that a court was not bound to find for a
                    defendant doctor simply because a body of experts testified in his favour. An
                    expert view had to satisfy the “threshold test of logic” (see
                        <em>Khoo</em> at [63]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     The Singapore courts have not followed a
                    suggestion, said to be from English courts, that a different approach applies to
                    medical advice as opposed to diagnosis and medical treatment (see <em>D’Conceicao Jeanie Doris (administratrix of the estate of
                        Milakov Steven, deceased) v Tong Ming Chuan</em> [2011] SGHC 193
                        (“<em>D’Conceicao</em>”) and
                        <em>Tong Seok May Joanne v Yau Hok Man Gordon</em>
                    [2013] 2 SLR 18).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     Recently, the United Kingdom Supreme Court did
                    apply a different approach from <em>Bolam</em> and
                        <em>Bolitho</em>, based on patient or personal
                    autonomy, for advice from a medical practitioner (see <em>Montgomery v Lanarkshire Health Board (General Medical Council
                        intervening)</em> [2015] 2 WLR 768).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     It is not necessary for me to consider whether
                    such an approach should apply in Singapore for medical advice because, as I
                    shall elaborate below, the facts here do not give rise to any liability on the
                    part of the Defendants even if such a different approach should
                apply.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The parties and their witnesses</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     Before I elaborate on the parties’
                    respective cases for the issues and my views thereon, I will elaborate first on
                    the parties and their witnesses.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     Andrew was the first witness. His lead counsel
                    was Mr Ramasamy K Chettiar (“Mr Chettiar”) who was assisted by
                    solicitors from Lawrence Chua &amp; Partners (“LCP”). Andrew
                    himself was working as an office manager in LCP at the time he was first brought
                    to SGH because of his paraplegia. He has apparently returned to part-time work
                    with another law firm after his second surgery. Two of Andrew’s brothers,
                    Lawrence Chua (“Lawrence”) and Edwin, are practising with LCP.
                    Indeed, Lawrence was present by Andrew’s side, sitting behind Mr Chettiar,
                    on many days of the trial. Therefore, Andrew had more than ordinary access to
                    legal advice. He would have been familiar with the legal and evidential burden
                    he had to discharge.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     The witnesses for Andrew were:</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     As indicated in the background facts, Dr Chang
                    and Dr Lee were the surgeons who advised Andrew that there was still spinal cord
                    compression after the first surgery and to undergo a second surgery to remove
                    the compression. They performed the second surgery on Andrew. Therefore, both Dr
                    Chang and Dr Lee were not independent expert witnesses. Andrew’s position
                    was that any opinion from either of them was still admissible. The weight to be
                    given to any such opinion was a separate matter.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     The Defendants did not dispute the
                    admissibility of any opinion evidence from either Dr Chang or Dr Lee. However,
                    SGHPL stressed that they were not independent witnesses.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     I add that Dr Chang was known to Edwin even
                    before Andrew had become paraplegic. They had apparently come to know each other
                    in the course of previous civil litigation cases in which Edwin relied on Dr
                    Chang for his expert opinion on personal injuries.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     In the absence of any objection by the
                    Defendants and the absence of the benefit of submissions about the
                    non-admissibility of such evidence, Dr Chang and Dr Lee were allowed to give
                    opinion evidence. Indeed their opinion evidence was inextricably intertwined
                    with their factual evidence and it would have been impractical, if not

<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>Having set out the issues as well as the witnesses for
                        the parties, I will now turn to address the issues
                proper.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Whether Andrew had given informed consent</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     In my view, the pleaded allegation that Andrew
                    had not given informed consent because Dr Yue had not informed Andrew about the
                    anterior approach was without merit.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     First, as SGHPL’s opening statement
                    pointed out at para 18, Andrew’s own medical experts did not suggest that
                    it was standard or accepted practice to discuss alternative surgical approaches
                    with a patient when obtaining consent for surgery.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     Secondly, Andrew had conceded in his closing
                    and reply submissions that he was not taking issue with the surgical approach
                        <em>per se</em>.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_6" id="Ftn_6_1"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span> Accordingly, it was surprising that
                    Andrew’s closing submissions cited the decision of Tay Yong Kwang J
                    in <em>D’Conceicao</em> for the proposition that a
                    patient should be advised on alternative treatment options. In any event,
                    Tay J’s reference to alternative treatment options is different from
                    alternative surgical approaches. Andrew should not have made this allegation
                    about lack of informed consent in the first place. That is probably why he
                    presented his argument about lack of informed consent in a different context
                    which I will come to later.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     Thirdly, it was not disputed that Dr Yue
                    honestly held the view, whether rightly or wrongly, that the posterior approach
                    was the more appropriate one. His reasons were stated in paras 36–39 of
                    his affidavit of evidence-in-chief (“AEIC”). I need not repeat all
                    his reasons except to say that in his view, the posterior approach was
                    appropriate because the prolapsed disc was located more to the left and was
                    assessed to be soft and discrete, and the anterior approach requires more time
                    to prepare for. The latter also involves more risks than the posterior approach.
                    For example, the anterior approach requires the collapsing of one lung. There is
                    also increased risk to the heart and larger blood vessels in terms of bleeding
                    and increased risk of lung infection. If Dr Yue had discussed both the posterior
                    and the anterior approaches with Andrew, it is obvious that he would have
                    recommended the posterior approach since that was the approach he preferred. Dr
                    Yue would not have suggested that the posterior approach might be inadequate to
                    reach the prolapsed disc. There is no evidence that Andrew would have tried to
                    obtain a second opinion or second guess Dr Yue’s choice of surgical
                    approach or that he would have withheld his consent. In my view, there was no
                    reason for Andrew to do so as Dr Yue was certain of the approach he was
                    going to use and its suitability. Furthermore, there was urgency in executing
                    the operation without delay.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     I note that para 12 of Andrew’s opening
                    statement alleged that if Andrew had been informed that the prognosis was poor,
                    he would have sought a second opinion. This submission was on the premise that
                    Andrew had not been informed that the prognosis was poor. This submission was
                    different from the pleaded allegation above that suggested that if Andrew had
                    been informed about the surgical alternatives, he would have obtained a second
                    opinion. Andrew is not entitled to change his case. In any event, it is clear
                    from the evidence that if Andrew had been informed that the prognosis was poor,
                    he would still have elected to undergo surgery without a second opinion. That is
                    precisely what happened when he elected for the second surgery without a third
                    opinion, even though it is common ground that he was told then that the
                    prognosis was extremely poor (see [21]). Furthermore, Andrew admitted that he
                    would have consented to the first surgery even if he had been informed that the
                    prognosis was poor.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_7" id="Ftn_7_1"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     Andrew’s closing submissions then
                    presented the issue of informed consent in a different context. At paras 54(a),
                    59 and 60, Andrew submitted that Dr Yue breached his duty to Andrew when he did
                    not disclose to Andrew that he would not be performing a complete decompression
                    of the prolapsed disc. There was some dispute as to whether Dr Yue’s duty
                    was to perform a “complete” decompression or an
                    “adequate” decompression. As I will elaborate later, I am of the
                    view that Dr Yue’s duty was to achieve “adequate”
                    decompression. For now, it is sufficient for me to say that in any event, this
                    submission was off the mark. It is clear from the evidence that Dr Yue
                    tried to remove as much of the prolapsed disc as was possible such that it was
                    not compressing the cord. Also, as already mentioned, Dr Yue was of the view
                    that the posterior approach was a suitable one for him to do what he needed to
                    do. There was no suggestion, until Andrew’s closing submissions, that Dr
                    Yue had deliberately decided to do less even before he commenced the operation.
                    Indeed, this suggestion ignored the fact that Andrew’s closing and reply
                    submissions did not pursue the allegation that the posterior approach was
                    inappropriate. I find the suggestion that Dr Yue had decided not to do a
                    complete decompression which he should have then informed Andrew about to be
                    made without regard to the facts and other submissions. If Andrew was alleging
                    that Dr Yue was negligent in his execution of the surgery, that was a different
                    point.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Whether Dr Yue should have ordered a second MRI scan to be done
                immediately after the first surgery</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     Andrew alleged that Dr Yue was negligent
                    because he did not order a second MRI scan to be done immediately after the
                    first surgery. I shall refer to this as “the Second MRI Scan
                    Allegation”. The suggestion was that a second MRI scan would have led to
                    the discovery that Andrew’s spinal cord was still compressed by the
                    prolapsed disc whereupon Dr Yue should have immediately done a second surgery to
                    remove the residual disc prolapse. Dr Yue’s failure to order the second
                    MRI scan resulted in the second surgery (done by Dr Chang and Dr Lee) being
                    undertaken too late and Andrew’s prospects of recovery were therefore
                        impeded.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_8" id="Ftn_8_1"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     However, if Andrew fails to establish that the
                    prolapsed disc was still compressing his spinal cord after the first surgery, it
                    follows that even if Dr Yue ought to have ordered a second MRI scan, this
                    omission did not affect Andrew’s prospects of recovery.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     On the other hand, even if Dr Yue was not
                    negligent in not ordering a second MRI scan to be done immediately, this would
                    not exonerate him if indeed the prolapsed disc was still compressing
                    Andrew’s spinal cord and this was attributed to Dr Yue’s negligent
                    conduct in executing the first surgery.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     Therefore, if there is a finding that Andrew
                    has failed to establish that the prolapsed disc was still compressing his spinal
                    cord after the first surgery, it will effectively dispose of the Second MRI Scan
                    Allegation. Nevertheless, I will still deal with this allegation as Andrew made
                    much of it.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     Before I continue, I would say that it is
                    undisputed that Andrew did not ask Dr Yue to do a second MRI scan. However,
                    after Dr Yue left for an overseas engagement, Andrew requested SGH to do a
                    second MRI scan and this was not acceded to (as elaborated above at [18]). I am
                    of the view that it is immaterial whether Dr Yue was in Singapore or not and it
                    is also immaterial whether Andrew made a request to Dr Yue himself to do a
                    second MRI scan. The issue is whether Dr Yue ought to have ordered a second MRI
                    scan irrespective of any request from Andrew. I add that it is not in dispute
                    that Andrew requested the second MRI scan only after Dr Chang gave this advice
                    in response to queries from Edwin as elaborated above.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a>58     On Andrew’s side, the Second MRI Scan
                    Allegation was supported by Dr Chang and Dr Lee. Dr Teh did not give evidence on
                    that allegation.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a>59     In Dr Chang’s AEIC, he gave the
                    following evidence:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">A3:</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">Generally, when the patient’s condition does
                            not improve immediately or soon after surgery, a surgeon would be
                            concerned as to whether something had gone wrong. It is normal and
                            expected of a surgeon to do an MRI scan immediately to rule out any
                            errors that may have occurred in the course of the surgery. MRI is a
                            non-invasive procedure that is generally offered to patients. It gives
                            the surgeon an opportunity to take remedial action as time is of the
                            essence. Erwin M.J. Cornips et al in “Thoracic disc herniation
                            and acute myelopathy: clinical presentation, neuroimaging findings,
                            surgical considerations, and outcome” J Neurosurg Spine
                            14:520-528, 2011, …, found that “[r]emarkable recovery is
                            possible even with profound neurological deficit, a delay of several
                            days, in the elderly, and in the presence of
                            myelomalacia”.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It is only natural for the surgeon to suggest an MRI scan post surgery
                        when Andrew’s condition did not improve at all. It is not the other
                        way around.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a>60     He also asserted at p 6 of his AEIC that
                    Dr Yue should have ordered a second MRI scan to understand why Andrew’s
                    condition did not improve after surgery.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a>61     In oral testimony, Dr Chang did not assert
                    that it was standard practice to order a second MRI scan immediately after
                        surgery.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_9" id="Ftn_9_1"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span>
                    Instead, he asserted that Andrew should have been seen as an individual and
                    since his family was concerned about his lack of improvement, then a second MRI
                    should have been done to check if there was any residual disc prolapse. An MRI
                    scan was a non-invasive procedure. He emphasized that it was no skin off a
                    doctor’s nose to simply order the second MRI scan.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_10" id="Ftn_10_1"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_62"></a>62     Dr Lee’s response in A2 of his AEIC was
                    similar to that of Dr Chang’s on the Second MRI Scan Allegation.
                    Therefore, I need not set out Dr Lee’s response here.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_63"></a>63     In oral testimony, Dr Lee appeared to accept
                    that it was not standard practice to order a second MRI scan immediately after
                    surgery. However, he emphasized that each patient had to be considered
                    individually. If a patient did not improve and the patient was concerned, he
                    would order a second MRI scan. There was no risk in doing a second MRI scan. He
                    wondered “[w]hat’s the big deal” in ordering such a
                        scan.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_11" id="Ftn_11_1"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_64"></a>64     On the other hand, Dr Yue said in para 76 of
                    his AEIC that another MRI scan is not usually done post-surgery unless the
                    result is unexpected. In Andrew’s case, the result of a lack of
                    improvement immediately after surgery was not unexpected for reasons which I
                    will elaborate later. Furthermore, another MRI scan immediately after surgery
                    might not be accurate as it would be difficult to distinguish further spinal
                    cord compression from post-operative changes such as tissue swelling. The
                    presence of pedicle screws would also make it more difficult to interpret the
                    second MRI scan.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_65"></a>65     Dr Wong Hee Kit (“Dr Wong”), an
                    independent expert witness for Dr Yue, supported Dr Yue’s position
                    that a post-operative MRI is not routinely done after spinal surgeries in
                    Singapore. It is done when the result of the surgery is not what the surgeon
                        expects.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_12" id="Ftn_12_1"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_66"></a>66     It seemed to me that both Dr Chang and Dr Lee
                    were taking the view that Dr Yue should have accommodated the concerns of
                    Andrew’s family about his lack of improvement post-surgery by ordering a
                    post-operative MRI scan. That is why Dr Chang remarked more than once that it
                    was no skin off a doctor’s nose to just order the post-operative MRI scan,
                    and Dr Lee remarked “[w]hat’s the big deal”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_67"></a>67     It is worthwhile to remember that it was Dr
                    Chang who suggested that a second MRI scan be done.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_68"></a>68     As mentioned above, the issue is whether Dr
                    Yue was negligent because he did not order a second MRI scan to be done
                    post-surgery. The legal question is not whether it was any skin off his nose to
                    do it or what the big deal was. Such remarks were off the mark and did not
                    reflect well on the credibility of Dr Chang and Dr Lee
                respectively.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_69"></a>69     Furthermore, the point is not whether Dr Chang
                    should have ordered a second MRI scan but whether Dr Yue was negligent for not
                    ordering it. Dr Chang and Dr Lee’s responses appeared to try and explain
                    why Dr Chang ordered it rather than to try and establish that Dr Yue was
                    negligent for not doing so. I add, for completeness, that Dr Yue did order an
                    X-ray to be done after the first surgery to check that he had performed the
                    surgery at the correct level of Andrew’s spine (<em>ie</em>, the T10/T11 level), but not an MRI scan.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_70"></a>70     I am of the view that a general statement such
                    as looking at the patient as an individual did not advance Andrew’s
                    position at all. Dr Yue did not dispute that Andrew had to be considered as an
                    individual. Dr Yue’s point was that there was no reason to order a
                    post-operative MRI scan so soon after the first surgery unless Andrew’s
                    post-operative condition was unexpected.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_71"></a>71     This brings me to the prognosis for Andrew and
                    why Dr Yue did not find Andrew’s lack of improvement after the
                    surgery to be unexpected, which I alluded to at [64] above. Andrew’s
                    prognosis depended on his condition before the first surgery. It was not
                    disputed that he was paraplegic. According to Dr Yue, Andrew’s
                    neurological status was ASIA A. As mentioned above at [8], this grade was
                    determined by Dr Kelvin Chua. He was a member of Dr Yue’s medical team who
                    had examined Andrew to do a formal assessment of Andrew’s ASIA status
                    before the first surgery was carried out. The ASIA A grade meant that Andrew had
                    no motor or sensory function present in the sacral segments S4 to S5. ASIA A is
                    the grade that indicates the greatest degree of neurological impairment and thus
                    indicates the case is the most severe. ASIA E, on the other hand, indicates the
                    least degree of neurological impairment.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_72"></a>72     The ASIA A grade was important to Dr Yue.
                    First, it meant that the prognosis for Andrew was extremely poor even with
                    surgery. Therefore this meant that after the first surgery Dr Yue did not expect
                    any immediate or significant improvement. Secondly, it meant that it was very
                    unlikely that Andrew would ever recover fully.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_73"></a>73     Dr Lee agreed that if Andrew’s condition
                    pre-surgery was ASIA A, then the prognosis for him was poor.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_13" id="Ftn_13_1"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_74"></a>74     Dr Chang initially agreed that the prognosis
                    for Andrew was grave.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_14" id="Ftn_14_1"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span> However, he then changed his evidence and said
                    Andrew had a high chance of recovery after a successful surgery and that Andrew
                    did not have a poor prognosis for recovery.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_15" id="Ftn_15_1"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_75"></a>75     Andrew disagreed that he was an ASIA A case
                    for various reasons. First, he had been examined by Dr Ng (see [5] above). Dr
                    Ng’s notes had an arrow pointing downwards with the words
                    “sensation below T11/12”. Dr Ng said this meant that there was
                    less sensation and not an absence of sensation. Andrew submitted that this
                    therefore suggested that there was no total loss of sensation as an ASIA A grade
                    would suggest.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_76"></a>76     Secondly, Andrew was sent to SGH’s
                    Department of Rehabilitation Medicine after the first surgery. There was a
                    handwritten note from Dr Tay San Sar, the Registrar of that department to Dr Yue
                    and his team written on or about 23 April 2007. In that note, Andrew was
                    graded as ASIA B. This appeared to contrast with an initial ASIA A grading
                    because if Andrew was truly ASIA A pre-surgery, it was not likely that he would
                    improve to ASIA B so quickly even after surgery.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_77"></a>77     One possible reason for the apparent
                    difference was that Andrew was suffering from spinal shock at the time of his
                    examination by Dr Kelvin Chua and/or Dr Ng, which made his symptoms appear worse
                    than they actually were, and after the spinal shock had worn off, his true
                    condition emerged. However, Dr Yue was of the view that spinal shock is not
                    necessarily in play unless there is trauma to the spinal cord like a fracture or
                    a fall from height.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_16" id="Ftn_16_1"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_78"></a>78     There was also another piece of evidence about
                    a subsequent examination of Andrew by Dr Chang on 3 October 2008 (see [25]
                    above). Dr Chang himself assessed Andrew to be ASIA A then.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_79"></a>79     In my view, any suggestion by Dr Chang that
                    Andrew had a high chance of recovery even if his status was ASIA A or that the
                    prognosis was not poor for an ASIA A patient was contradicted by Dr
                    Chang’s own earlier evidence that the prognosis was grave for ASIA A
                    patients (see [74]). Furthermore, as mentioned above at [73], Dr Lee agreed that
                    ASIA A meant a poor prognosis. In my view, as ASIA A is the most serious grade,
                    it must logically mean that the prognosis is the worst.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_80"></a>80     In any event, it is unnecessary for me to
                    elaborate further on the detailed arguments of the parties as to whether Andrew
                    was ASIA A or ASIA B or to conclude whether he was either one or the other. The
                    reason is that even if Andrew was not ASIA A and was ASIA B instead, this did
                    not mean that his prognosis was not poor. Neither Dr Chang nor Dr Lee had
                    suggested this. It is true that the prognosis would not be as poor as an ASIA A
                    grade but it was still not good. More importantly, even if Andrew was ASIA B,
                    this did not mean that an immediate and a marked improvement post-surgery was
                    expected. There was no such suggestion by Dr Chang or Dr Lee.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_81"></a>81     It seems to me that neither Dr Chang nor Dr
                    Lee had paid much attention to Andrew’s pre-operative condition. They did
                    not ask for a medical report on him from SGH and indeed no such request was made
                    by Dr Chang before he suggested that a post-operative MRI scan be done or before
                    Dr Chang and Dr Lee concluded that there was still cord compression based on the
                    Gleneagles MRI scan and Dr Lin’s report. At that time, they also did not
                    ask to look at the SGH MRI scan images taken prior to Andrew’s first
                    surgery.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_82"></a>82     It was not the evidence of Dr Chang or Dr Lee
                    that Andrew’s post-operative condition was unexpected. Their evidence was
                    that since there appeared to be no improvement and Andrew’s family was
                    concerned, a post-operative MRI scan should have been done. For Dr Chang, it was
                    not irresponsible to order the post-operative MRI scan just to see the state of
                    the spinal cord.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_17" id="Ftn_17_1"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a></span> As such a scan was non-invasive, he would order
                    it “at the drop of a hat just to make sure that everything is still
                        fine”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_18" id="Ftn_18_1"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_83"></a>83     There was no medical literature to support the
                    position taken by Dr Chang and Dr Lee that a post-operative MRI scan should
                    be done immediately or soon after surgery in the circumstances.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_84"></a>84     It will be recalled that in Dr Chang’s
                    AEIC (see [59] above), he had cited an article from Erwin M J Cornips <em>et al</em>, <em>Thoracic disc herniation and
                        acute myelopathy: clinical presentation, neuroimaging findings, surgical
                        considerations, and outcome</em> (J Neurosurg Spine, Vol 14,
                    April 2011) at pp 520–528 with the statement that, “Remarkable
                    recovery is possible even with profound neurological deficit, a delay of several
                    days, in the elderly, and in the presence of myelomalacia”. However, the
                    statement was a distraction. It did not support the Second MRI Scan Allegation.
                    Ironically, that same article had another statement (at p 521) that,
                    “Postoperative neuroimaging included … MR imaging to assess
                    accuracy of spinal cord decompression <em>after 3
                        months</em>” [emphasis added]. This statement implied that it
                    was not part of the standard of care of a spine surgeon to order a
                    post-operative MRI scan immediately or soon after the first
                surgery.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_85"></a>85     Indeed, at one stage during his oral
                    testimony, Dr Lee said that a post-operative MRI scan should be done not
                    immediately but, say, some three or six months later.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_19" id="Ftn_19_1"><sup>[note: 19]</sup></a></span> However, he then
                    began to qualify his evidence by saying that he would order a scan immediately
                    if it was clinically needed. By that he meant that he would order such a scan if
                    the patient did not get better or if the patient got worse after surgery. He
                    agreed that if no improvement was expected, there was no need to order such a
                        scan.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_20" id="Ftn_20_1"><sup>[note: 20]</sup></a></span> He
                    then sought to add that he would order the scan if the result was unsatisfactory
                    but he could not explain adequately why the result would be unsatisfactory if no
                    improvement was expected at the material time. To him the result was
                    unsatisfactory so long as there was no improvement, whether or not an
                    improvement was expected.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_21" id="Ftn_21_1"><sup>[note: 21]</sup></a></span> I found Dr Lee’s
                    explanation illogical and unconvincing.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_86"></a>86     However, Andrew suggested that if he was
                    already paraplegic with ASIA A grade at the material time, that condition could
                    not deteriorate further. Hence, it was not logical to say that a second MRI scan
                    would be done if his condition had deteriorated. I do not accept that
                    argument.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_87"></a>87     Andrew’s argument would then mean that a
                    second MRI scan should be done simply because his family was concerned about his
                    slow improvement or as a matter of course. The former would in turn lead to the
                    absurd conclusion that a doctor is negligent if he does not comply with a
                    request from a patient or his family whatever his own opinion may be. The latter
                    is not supported by evidence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_88"></a>88     The most important point against the Second
                    MRI Scan Allegation was that neither Dr Chang nor Dr Lee himself ordered a
                    post-operative MRI scan after the second surgery even though there was still no
                    improvement in Andrew’s condition, although they did say that no
                    improvement was expected because of the lapse of time between the first and the
                    second surgery.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_89"></a>89     Various reasons were given by Dr Chang and Dr
                    Lee for not doing so. I will mention only the reasons given by Dr Lee as they
                    included Dr Chang’s reasons. Dr Lee gave four reasons:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_22" id="Ftn_22_1"><sup>[note: 22]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_89-p2_a"></a>(a)     All approaches to remove the disc
                        prolapse had been done already. By this, he meant that Dr Yue had used the
                        posterior approach and he had used the anterior approach. There was no other
                        approach.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_89-p2_b"></a>(b)     Andrew was Dr Chang’s patient and not his.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_89-p2_c"></a>(c)     Dr Lee had fished out a calcified
                        fragment during the second surgery. He saw the dura glistening. He did not
                        think there was anything else to do.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_89-p2_d"></a>(d)     Cost was also an issue.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_90"></a>90     I will deal with reasons (a) and (c) together.
                    In summary, what Dr Lee was saying was that he saw no reason to order a
                    post-operative MRI scan because in his mind he had already done all he could.
                    However, that was precisely Dr Yue’s position. In his mind he had already
                    achieved the decompression. It was not as though he had any doubt about the
                    adequacy of the posterior approach or what he did. The post-operative X-ray he
                    ordered was only to check that he had operated at the right level of
                    Andrew’s spine.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_91"></a>91     As regards reason (d) on the cost issue, Dr
                    Lee appeared to contradict himself when he said later in re-examination that an
                    MRI scan “does not cost that much”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_23" id="Ftn_23_1"><sup>[note: 23]</sup></a></span> Furthermore, Dr Chang did
                    not mention cost as a reason for not ordering a post-operative MRI scan after
                    the second surgery.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_92"></a>92     Lastly, Dr Lee was tested about reason (b),
                    that is, that Andrew was Dr Chang’s patient and not his. He was asked
                    whether he did suggest to Dr Chang to order a post-operative MRI scan.
                    Surprisingly, Dr Lee said that he probably did.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_24" id="Ftn_24_1"><sup>[note: 24]</sup></a></span> Yet he could not remember Dr
                    Chang’s response, “Because it was a minor
                        thing”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_25" id="Ftn_25_1"><sup>[note: 25]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_93"></a>93     Dr Lee’s evidence was telling. Dr Chang
                    had never suggested that Dr Lee had mentioned that Dr Chang should order a
                    post-operative MRI scan after the second surgery or that they had had a
                    discussion whether to order one or not. In my view, Dr Lee did not make that
                    suggestion to Dr Chang. It did not cross his mind or Dr Chang’s to order
                    that scan. However, when Dr Lee was pressed to explain why no such MRI scan was
                    ordered in the light of his opinion that Dr Yue should have ordered one after
                    the first surgery, he gave an untrue explanation that he did suggest it to Dr
                    Chang.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_94"></a>94     Andrew argued that the omission of Dr Chang
                    and Dr Lee to order a post-operative MRI scan after the second surgery is not an
                    apple for apple comparison to Dr Yue’s omission to order one after the
                    first surgery. When Andrew was at SGH, the spinal cord decompression had to be
                    done within what Dr Chang referred to as “the golden hour”. With
                    so many days delay between the first and the second surgeries, the prognosis
                    would only get worse.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_26" id="Ftn_26_1"><sup>[note: 26]</sup></a></span> In my view, that is not the point
                    and, in any event, it was not a reason given by Dr Lee or Dr Chang for not
                    ordering a post-operative MRI scan. Dr Chang and Dr Lee had suggested that
                    a post-operative MRI scan should have been ordered even if the result of a
                    surgery was not unexpected. Therefore, even though Andrew’s condition
                    after the second surgery was not unexpected, they should have ordered a
                    post-operative MRI scan to be consistent with their own evidence. They did not.
                    Their omission spoke volumes. It contradicted the Second MRI Scan
                    Allegation.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_95"></a>95     I appreciate that if a different surgeon from
                    a different clinic or hospital is asked to give a second opinion, he may want to
                    suggest that another MRI scan be done before giving that opinion. However, it
                    appears from the conduct of Dr Yue and also of Dr Chang and Dr Lee that the
                    surgeon who has done the surgery in question is not required to order a
                    post-operative MRI scan so soon after surgery unless there is some valid reason
                    to do so. The absence of improvement, when improvement is not expected at the
                    material time, is not such a reason. The patient’s family’s concern,
                    without more, is also not a valid reason. There was no standard of care which
                    required Dr Yue to order the post-operative MRI scan in the
                    circumstances.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_96"></a>96     In the circumstances, I am of the view that
                    Andrew has not established the Second MRI Scan Allegation.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Whether the posterior approach was appropriate and whether Dr Yue had
                adequately decompressed the prolapsed disc</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_97"></a>97     The next two issues would have been whether
                    the posterior approach was appropriate and whether Dr Yue had adequately
                    decompressed the prolapsed disc. However, as mentioned above, Andrew had said in
                    his submissions that he was not taking issue with the surgical approach
                        <em>per se</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_98"></a>98     I will still deal with the
                    “issue” about the appropriateness of the posterior approach to
                    some extent as it reflects on the credibility of Andrew’s medical experts,
                    especially Dr Chang, who also gave evidence on the issue about adequate
                    decompression. Moreover, the evidence and the arguments on both these issues
                    overlap.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Terminology</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_99"></a>99     Before I continue, I will elaborate on some
                    words which were used for the trial.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_100"></a>100    The SOC alleged that Dr Yue did not achieve
                    “complete” decompression of the prolapsed disc. The Defendants say
                    he achieved “adequate” decompression.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_101"></a>101    First, no definition was offered by
                    Andrew’s medical experts as to what was meant by “complete”
                    decompression. Secondly, in the first page of the article by Cornips and others
                    which Dr Chang referred to in his AEIC, the expression
                    “adequately” decompressed is used. Thirdly, in Andrew’s
                    reply pleading, he himself alleged in para 4 that Dr Yue had failed to achieve
                    “adequate” decompression. Therefore, it appeared that Andrew was
                    using the terms “complete” and “adequate”
                    decompression interchangeably. However, Andrew appeared to insist in his
                    submissions that there must be “complete” decompression. This
                    description gave the impression that every iota of disc prolapse must be
                    removed. That impression is not supported by medical evidence or logic. For
                    example, if there was still any part of the disc merely protruding into the
                    spinal canal after the first surgery but which was not even touching the spinal
                    cord, it would not be regarded as medically significant. I have used the
                    adjective “adequate” as I think that the word
                    “complete” gives the wrong impression that every iota of disc
                    prolapse must be removed. I will also mention that words like
                    “touch”, “impinge”, “indent” and
                    “compress” were used in the trial either interchangeably or to
                    distinguish between non-compression and compression of the spinal cord depending
                    on who was using the word. This added to the confusion.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_102"></a>102    Andrew argued in para 23 of his reply
                    submissions that the objective of Dr Yue’s surgery was “to relieve
                    all cord compression because any contact can cause significant symptoms to an
                    individual. Cord tolerance varies from one individual to another and there is no
                    objective evidence to show how much of a contact a cord can tolerate before
                    symptoms begin.” He also argued that when his experts referred to
                    “complete” decompression, they meant the absence of any contact
                    with the spinal cord.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_103"></a>103    It seems to me that Andrew has misunderstood
                    the position of the Defendants. First, the Defendants do not say that it is
                    acceptable for residual disc prolapse to be touching the spinal cord. Therefore,
                    they do not accept that there was residual disc prolapse touching the spinal
                    cord after the first surgery. Secondly, it is their alternative position that
                    even if there was residual disc prolapse touching the spinal cord, it is for
                    Andrew to establish that this compressed the spinal cord and that it in fact
                    impeded his recovery. The Defendants are not saying that Dr Yue intended to
                    leave residual disc prolapse touching the spinal cord or that he omitted to
                    ensure that none touched the spinal cord after surgery. Hence, they argued that
                    even if there was residual disc prolapse touching the spinal cord, this did not
                    compress the spinal cord and was not significant for various reasons. It was in
                    that context that a distinction was being drawn by the Defendants between
                    touching and compressing the spinal cord and the question of significance was
                    raised.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_104"></a>104    As for the use of MRI scans and CT scans, it
                    is useful to note that MRI scans may show the spinal cord and soft tissue like
                    the disc and CT scans show calcified or bony material.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_27" id="Ftn_27_1"><sup>[note: 27]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_105"></a>105    I continue with the two
                issues.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The location of the prolapsed disc that caused the spinal cord
                compression</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_106"></a>106    First, the location of the prolapsed disc,
                        <em>eg</em>, whether the location was left, central or
                    right, was important to the two issues. I add that I am here referring to the
                    prolapsed disc which caused Andrew’s paraplegia and not to just any disc
                    herniation. The importance of this qualification is self-evident and will also
                    become clearer later.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_107"></a>107    There was much dispute and confusion over
                    the location of the prolapsed disc that had caused or was perceived to have
                    caused Andrew’s paraplegia:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_107-p2_a"></a>(a)     Dr Yue said that the relevant
                        prolapsed disc was predominantly on the left side.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_28" id="Ftn_28_1"><sup>[note: 28]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_107-p2_b"></a>(b)     Dr Mohan’s MRI report dated
                        20 April 2007 concluded that, “There is an acute central disc
                        protrusion at the T10/11 level causing severe canal stenosis with cord
                        compression.”</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_107-p2_c"></a>(c)     Dr Lin’s radiological report dated 8 May 2007 stated (at
                        p 2) that, “There is a central and right paracentral disc
                        protrusion of T10/T11 disc noted with moderate spinal canal
                        stenosis.”</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_107-p2_d"></a>(d)     Dr Chang’s first report dated 18 May 2007 (eight days
                        after the second surgery) referred to the SGH report by Dr Mohan which
                        stated that there was an acute central disc protrusion. He also referred to
                        the Gleneagles report by Dr Lin which showed “a central and right
                        paracentral disc protrusion still impinging on the thoracic
                        cord.”</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_107-p2_e"></a>(e)     Dr Chang’s second report dated 4 November 2008 again referred to
                        the SGH and Gleneagles reports. He reiterated that the latter showed
                        “a central and right paracentral disc protrusion” although
                        this time he said the disc was “still compressing”, and not
                        just “impinging”, on the spinal cord.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_107-p2_f"></a>(f)     Dr Chang’s third report dated
                        23 February 2011 (at p 4) followed his second report. However, the
                        third report contained pictures of some MRI and CT scans. Fig 3 at p 4
                        of this third report referred to an image from the SGH MRI scan with the
                        following words, “T1-weighted image, showing a mainly left-sided disc
                        protrusion, occupying~70% of the crosssectional area of the spinal
                        canal”.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_107-p2_g"></a>(g)     Dr Lee’s report dated 11 September 2008 said that the Gleneagles
                        MRI scan showed “a central and right paracentral disc protrusion with
                        compression of the spinal cord.”</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_107-p2_h"></a>(h)     Dr Teh’s report dated 26 January
                        2012 proceeded on the premise that Dr Yue was addressing a central disc
                        protrusion in the first surgery.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_107-p2_i"></a>(i)     Para 6 of the SOC referred to the SGH report by Dr Mohan
                        about an “acute central disc protrusion”. Para 8 of the SOC
                        referred to the Gleneagles report by Dr Lin about a “central and
                        right paracentral T10-11 disc protrusion with moderate spinal canal
                        stenosis.” Then para 15(a) of the SOC alleged, as one of the
                        particulars of negligence, that Dr Yue knew or ought to have known that
                        Andrew had a “central disc prolapse”.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_107-p2_j"></a>(j)     Dr Chang’s AEIC sworn on
                        30 July 2013 relied on the SGH report by Dr Mohan and said that the
                        cord compression was at the centre and not just to the
                    left.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_107-p2_k"></a>(k)     Likewise, Dr
                        Lee’s AEIC sworn on 13 August 2013 also relied on the SGH report
                        and alleged that it was a “central disc
                    prolapse”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_108"></a>108    Dr Yue had formed the opinion that the
                    relevant disc prolapse was predominantly left-sided by looking at the SGH MRI
                    scan as the formal report by Dr Mohan had apparently not been issued yet. Dr
                    Yue’s opinion appeared to be inconsistent with Dr Mohan’s report
                    about a central disc protrusion. The apparent inconsistency was addressed by Dr
                    Mohan when he gave his oral testimony, which I shall elaborate on
                later.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_109"></a>109    As for Andrew’s case, it is important
                    to bear in mind that when Dr Chang and Dr Lee concluded that there was
                    still spinal cord compression after the first surgery, they did so without the
                    benefit of the SGH MRI scan or Dr Mohan’s report. They were looking
                    at the Gleneagles MRI and CT scans and also apparently placed much reliance on
                    the Gleneagles report by Dr Lin.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_110"></a>110    It appears that by the time Dr Chang issued
                    his first report dated 18 May 2007, he had received the SGH report (and
                    perhaps the SGH MRI scan images as well) because his first report referred to
                    the description used by Dr Mohan, <em>ie</em>, an
                    acute central disc protrusion. Even then, Dr Chang appeared to place more
                    reliance on the Gleneagles report since he said in all three of his reports that
                    the Gleneagles MRI scan showed a central and right paracentral disc protrusion
                    “still” impinging or compressing on the spinal cord. As mentioned
                    above, Dr Lee’s report dated 11 September 2008 said that the
                    Gleneagles MRI scan showed a central and right paracentral disc protrusion with
                    compression of the spinal cord.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_111"></a>111    The SOC relied on Dr Yue’s knowledge
                    of a central disc prolapse as part of the particulars of negligence. Dr
                    Chang’s and Dr Lee’s AEICs focused similarly on a central disc
                    prolapse.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_112"></a>112    The question therefore was where the
                    relevant disc prolapse was before the first surgery. Was it predominantly left
                    or central or both central and right paracentral?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_113"></a>113    All counsel and Andrew’s medical
                    experts had used the word “central” to refer to the mid-line of
                    the spinal cord. The words “right paracentral” were used to refer
                    to an area right of the mid-line. They had assumed that when Dr Mohan referred
                    to “central” in the SGH report, he was referring to the mid-line
                    as well. Hence, the SOC and the AEICs of Dr Chang and Dr Lee, and of Dr Teh as
                    well, stressed that the relevant disc prolapse was central and not predominantly
                    to the left. In relation to two of Andrew’s medical experts, <em>ie</em>, Dr Chang and Dr Teh, this difference had a material
                    bearing on the issue of whether the posterior approach was an appropriate
                    one.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_114"></a>114    When Dr Mohan eventually gave evidence, he
                    explained that radiologists use anatomical structures to classify the location
                    of a disc prolapse.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_29" id="Ftn_29_1"><sup>[note: 29]</sup></a></span> From a radiologist’s point of view,
                    the word “central” did not just refer to the mid-line. It was a
                    reference to a zone which included part of the disc on either side of the
                        mid-line.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_30" id="Ftn_30_1"><sup>[note: 30]</sup></a></span> Dr Mohan’s explanation was not
                    challenged by Andrew. Therefore, Dr Mohan’s use of the word
                    “central” was not necessarily inconsistent with
                    Dr Yue’s opinion that the relevant disc prolapse was predominantly
                    left because, by that description, Dr Yue meant more to the left of the mid-line
                    rather than at the mid-line. In any event, Dr Mohan accepted in his oral
                    testimony that it was more left than mid-line.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_31" id="Ftn_31_1"><sup>[note: 31]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_115"></a>115    Unfortunately, the evidence of
                    Andrew’s medical experts on the location of the relevant disc prolapse was
                    confusing and unreliable. For example, para 4 of Dr Chang’s third report
                    had referred to and relied on the Gleneagles report about a central and right
                    paracentral disc prolapse “still” impinging or compressing on the
                    spinal cord. This gave the impression that the relevant disc prolapse was
                    originally right and paracentral right. Yet, Fig 3 of his third report (which
                    was also at p 4) referred to an SGH MRI scan image and described the disc
                    protrusion as mainly left-sided (see [107(f)] above).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_116"></a>116    There was no explanation in the third report
                    as to whether the original disc protrusion was mainly left sided or central and
                    right paracentral or whether the latter was a new prolapse which did not exist
                    at the time when the SGH MRI scan was done or an old one which was not
                    relevant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_117"></a>117    To add to the confusion, the last paragraph
                    of p 1 of Dr Chang’s third report said that the SGH MRI scan,
                    “showed <b>acute
                            T<sub>10</sub>-T<sub>11</sub> central disc
                        prolapse causing cord compression</b>” with a reference to
                    Figures 1, 2 and 3 in the report [emphasis in original]. However, as mentioned
                    above, the words below Fig 3 described the disc protrusion as mainly
                    left-sided. The description of a central disc protrusion was repeated in the
                    first paragraph under “Opinion” in p 9 of Dr Chang’s
                    third report which said that Andrew had experienced sudden onset of paraplegia
                    due to “acute large central disc protrusion”. The seventh
                    paragraph of that section, also at p 9, said that if an anterior approach
                    was used there would have been less chance of incomplete decompression leaving
                    behind significant central and right paracentral disc protrusion and graft
                    extrusion. Therefore, Dr Chang had used various descriptions without realising
                    that they were not the same:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_117-p2_a"></a>(a)     central and right
                        paracentral;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_117-p2_b"></a>(b)     mainly left-sided; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_117-p2_c"></a>(c)     central.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_118"></a>118    It appears to me that Dr Chang had conflated
                    all the descriptions because he was relying on different sources of
                    information:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_118-p2_a"></a>(a)     the central and right paracentral
                        description was the description used in the Gleneagles report. Perhaps that
                        was also Dr Chang’s perception of the Gleneagles MRI scan. By then the
                        left disc prolapse had been removed by Dr Yue;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_118-p2_b"></a>(b)     the description of the prolapse as being
                        left-sided was perhaps from his own subsequent observation of the SGH MRI
                        scan; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_118-p2_c"></a>(c)     the
                        description of the prolapse as being central was probably because he relied
                        on the SGH report by Dr Mohan.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_119"></a>119    The situation did not improve when Dr Chang
                    gave his oral testimony. Initially, he said that the relevant disc prolapse
                    before the first surgery was at the left. He then said it was at the centre and
                    left, and then he said it was predominantly in the centre.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_32" id="Ftn_32_1"><sup>[note: 32]</sup></a></span> Then he agreed
                    with a suggestion that it was predominantly left-sided.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_33" id="Ftn_33_1"><sup>[note: 33]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_120"></a>120    Dr Chang’s opinion was that the
                    posterior approach could be used if the disc prolapse was at the left but that
                    approach could not and did not reach the prolapse at the centre, <em>ie</em>, the midline.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_34" id="Ftn_34_1"><sup>[note: 34]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_121"></a>121    As for a right paracentral disc prolapse, Dr
                    Chang said that this might have arisen after the first surgery because the SGH
                    MRI scan did not show any herniation to the right, <em>ie</em>, right of the midline. Therefore, he did not expect Dr Yue to
                    remove something that was not there.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_122"></a>122    Unfortunately for Dr Chang, he was
                    completely off the mark when he said that the SGH MRI scan did not show any
                    prolapse on the right side. Dr Yue and various other experts, including Dr Lee
                    and Dr Teh, were of the view that there was another prolapse between the midline
                    and the right and this could be seen from the SGH MRI scan. Dr Yue did not seek
                    to remove this prolapse because he was of the view that it was darker in colour
                    than the one predominantly on the left. This suggested that the one on the right
                    was a chronic one and was not the cause of Andrew’s sudden
                    paraplegia.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_123"></a>123    As for Dr Lee, he agreed that the relevant
                    disc prolapse was more lateral towards the left but he said that there was a
                    central and a right component as well.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_35" id="Ftn_35_1"><sup>[note: 35]</sup></a></span> Yet, neither his AEIC
                    nor Dr Chang’s AEIC had mentioned a failure or omission by Dr Yue to
                    remove that component.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_124"></a>124    Furthermore, in oral testimony, Dr
                    Lee’s evidence on the right component vacillated. At one time he said
                    there was mild compression on the right side. Then he claimed that he did not
                    say that it was clinically insignificant and in his opinion it was significantly
                    compressing the spinal cord.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_36" id="Ftn_36_1"><sup>[note: 36]</sup></a></span> The next day, he said it
                    was a bulge and not a herniated disc. The difference was that in herniation, the
                    disc “actually come[s] all the way out”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_37" id="Ftn_37_1"><sup>[note: 37]</sup></a></span> The right
                    component was not significantly pressing on the spinal cord. When the court
                    asked him whether he was saying that Dr Yue should have removed the right
                    component, he said he had to think about this first. Eventually, he said he did
                    not think Dr Yue ought to have removed the right component in the first
                    operation and he also agreed that it did not cause any symptoms to Andrew before
                    the first surgery.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_38" id="Ftn_38_1"><sup>[note: 38]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_125"></a>125    Therefore, references to a right component
                    were a red herring. They arose because the Gleneagles report from Dr Lin
                    referred to a central and right paracentral disc protrusion, but Dr Lin did not
                    have the benefit of comparing the SGH MRI scan with the Gleneagles MRI scan.
                    Neither did Dr Chang nor Dr Lee at the material time. They did not even ask for
                    the SGH MRI scan or report to compare with the Gleneagles one before the second
                    surgery was done. To be fair to Dr Lin, his report did not explicitly say that
                    the central and right paracentral disc protrusion was compressing the spinal
                    cord. His report was that there was such a protrusion “noted with
                    moderate spinal canal stenosis”, which means a narrowing of the canal
                    because of the protrusion. Dr Lin explained in oral testimony that he did not
                    think it was for him to say whether the spinal cord was in fact compressed.
                    Apparently, Dr Chang and Dr Lee had taken the words in his report to mean that
                    the central and right paracentral disc protrusion was in fact compressing the
                    spinal cord at the material time although they would have considered the images
                    from the Gleneagles MRI scan too. Furthermore, coming back to the pleadings, it
                    will be remembered that the particulars of negligence in para 15(a) SOC stated
                    that Andrew had a central disc prolapse and not a central and right paracentral
                    disc prolapse. This in itself would already have precluded him from pursuing any
                    allegation about a right protrusion.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The appropriateness of the posterior approach</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_126"></a>126    In Dr Teh’s oral testimony, he said he
                    would decompress all the disc protrusions totally even though the most important
                    protrusion was the central one.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_39" id="Ftn_39_1"><sup>[note: 39]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_127"></a>127    To recapitulate, Dr Chang was of the view
                    that the posterior approach was not appropriate when the protrusion was central.
                    He maintained this view even though he accepted that the disc protrusion was
                    predominantly left.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_128"></a>128    Dr Chang’s evidence was undermined by
                    Dr Lee, who was another of Andrew’s witnesses. It will be recalled that Dr
                    Lee was the lead surgeon in the second surgery. Dr Lee’s categorical view
                    was that both the posterior and the anterior approaches were acceptable. To him,
                    the question was whether Dr Yue had in fact decompressed the cord. In his view,
                    Dr Yue had not done so.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_129"></a>129    However, Andrew pursued the allegation about
                    the wrong approach during the trial. His third medical expert, Dr Teh, was of
                    the view that because the protrusion was central, the posterior approach was
                    unsuitable because it would not allow a surgeon to reach the centre. A surgeon
                    using such an approach would be going in blind.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_130"></a>130    As can be seen, Dr Teh’s opinion was
                    premised on the relevant disc protrusion being central and not predominantly
                    left. He based his opinion on the SGH report by Dr Mohan.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_40" id="Ftn_40_1"><sup>[note: 40]</sup></a></span> At the time when he
                    provided his report dated 26 January 2012, he had not seen the SGH or the
                    Gleneagles MRI scans. He had only:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_130-p2_a"></a>(a)     the SGH report;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_130-p2_b"></a>(b)     the Gleneagles
                    report;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_130-p2_c"></a>(c)     Dr
                        Chang’s first report (dated 18 May 2007);</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_130-p2_d"></a>(d)     a report by Dr Yue dated
                        19 March 2008; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_130-p2_e"></a>(e)     a letter from Rodyk &amp; Davidson to Acies Law
                        Corporation dated 18 December 2009 with annexures (which did not
                        include any MRI scan).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_131"></a>131    As I have mentioned, Dr Mohan later
                    explained that the word “central” in his report did not mean the
                    disc protrusion was at the midline only or predominantly midline. He agreed that
                    from the SGH MRI scan, the disc protrusion was predominantly left.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_132"></a>132    Notwithstanding the MRI evidence, Dr Teh
                    maintained that the main problem was a central disc protrusion. He rationalised
                    his opinion by stressing that too much emphasis was being placed on the MRI
                    evidence. Such evidence had to be correlated with Andrew’s symptoms. He
                    emphasized that Andrew was paralysed in both legs. This pointed to a central
                    disc protrusion.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_41" id="Ftn_41_1"><sup>[note: 41]</sup></a></span> Even though he accepted that the paralysis of
                    both limbs may also have been due to vascular reasons, <em>ie</em>, because the blood to the cord had been cut off and not just
                    due to the mechanical compression of the cord, he maintained that the paraplegia
                    indicated that a central disc protrusion was the main problem.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_133"></a>133    Following from this opinion, he was of the
                    view that the posterior approach was inadequate. He referred to an article by
                    Richard Bransford, M D <em>et al, Early experience treating
                        thoracic disc herniations using a modified transfacet pedicle-sparing
                        decompression and fusion</em> (J Neurosurg Spine, Vol 12,
                    February 2010) at pp 221–231, which said that the anterior approach
                    was the gold standard. He even went on to say that a surgeon who did not use the
                    gold standard would be acting below the standard of care and would be
                        negligent.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_42" id="Ftn_42_1"><sup>[note: 42]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_134"></a>134    However, unfortunately for Dr Teh, that
                    article did not support such a proposition. He agreed that it did not say that a
                    posterior approach would be below the standard of care.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_43" id="Ftn_43_1"><sup>[note: 43]</sup></a></span> The passage which
                    he was citing from said at p 221, “Various posterior surgical
                    approaches have been developed to treat [thoracic disc herniations], but the
                    gold standard remains transthoracic decompression.” In my view, this
                    suggested that while the anterior approach was considered in that article to be
                    the best approach, it did not suggest that a posterior approach was
                    inadequate.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_135"></a>135    Furthermore, there was in fact another
                    article by Bransford and some of the same co-authors as the article which Dr Teh
                    had relied on.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_44" id="Ftn_44_1"><sup>[note: 44]</sup></a></span> That other article was also published in
                    the same year, <em>ie</em>, 2010, but in a different
                    journal. That article compared anterior to posterior approaches in the
                    management of thoracic disc herniations. That article stated that both
                    techniques allowed for adequate decompression and equal improvement
                    neurologically.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_136"></a>136    In response, Dr Teh suggested that that
                    article extended to chronic cases whereas Andrew’s case was an acute disc
                    prolapse. However, Dr Teh had not previously mentioned the acute presentation in
                    Andrew’s case as a factor for saying that the posterior approach was
                    inadequate.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_137"></a>137    Furthermore, Dr Teh faced another
                    difficulty. He had also referred to an article by Paul M Arnold and Mark
                    Bryniarski, <em>Emergency Thoracic Diskectomy for the acute onset
                        of paraplegia: Report of two cases</em> (The Journal of Spinal Cord
                    Medicine, Vol 27, No 5, 2004). However, as it turned out, that article did not
                    support his opinion that paraplegia of both limbs suggested that only the
                    anterior approach would do. Indeed, it appeared to contradict his opinion. I
                    need not elaborate since the appropriateness of the posterior approach is no
                    longer in issue.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_138"></a>138    I will add, however, that Dr Teh appeared
                    surprised when I mentioned Dr Lee’s opinion to him that both approaches
                    were acceptable. He was apparently unaware of Dr Lee’s opinion.
                    Nevertheless, Dr Teh disagreed with Dr Lee’s opinion.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_139"></a>139    In my view, there were two disc protrusions.
                    One predominantly on the left and one with a central and paracentral right
                    component. The latter was chronic and was not the cause of Andrew’s
                    paraplegia. The cause of his paraplegia was the protrusion predominantly on the
                    left. There was no third discrete component being a central component. The
                    so-called central component in respect of the disc protrusion which was
                    predominantly on the left was a small part of that protrusion. It did not mean
                    that the posterior approach was inappropriate. That is why Dr Lee himself did
                    not question that approach. As mentioned above, Andrew eventually caved in and
                    accepted that the posterior approach was appropriate.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The adequacy of the decompression</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_140"></a>140    I come now to the next issue, that is,
                    whether Dr Yue had adequately decompressed the prolapsed disc.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_141"></a>141    Dr Lee had acknowledged that Dr Yue had done
                    a good job in removing the prolapsed disc which was predominantly
                        left.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_45" id="Ftn_45_1"><sup>[note: 45]</sup></a></span> As I have stated above at [139], the central
                    component was a small component of that prolapsed disc. The right and
                    paracentral right disc protrusion was not the cause of Andrew’s
                    paraplegia.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_142"></a>142    However, Andrew argued that after the first
                    surgery, part of the prolapsed disc was still compressing the spinal cord.
                    Andrew relied not only on the evidence of his medical experts but also on the
                    evidence of Dr Hee Hwan Tak (“Dr Hee”), who was an independent
                    expert witness for Dr Yue. Andrew submitted that notwithstanding the sub-optimal
                    quality of the Gleneagles MRI scan, Dr Hee was able to and did give evidence
                    that something was indenting on the spinal cord.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_46" id="Ftn_46_1"><sup>[note: 46]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_143"></a>143    I have considered Dr Hee’s evidence.
                    Initially, he said that there was residual disc indenting on the spinal cord but
                    not significantly compressing the spinal cord.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_47" id="Ftn_47_1"><sup>[note: 47]</sup></a></span> He then said
                    that there “may be” a little bit of residual disc indenting the
                    spinal cord.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_48" id="Ftn_48_1"><sup>[note: 48]</sup></a></span> In his view, it was difficult to tell
                    from the Gleneagles MRI scan because of the post-operative changes due to
                    artefacts, swelling and haematoma. Hence, he said that there “may
                    be” a little bit of disc left behind.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_49" id="Ftn_49_1"><sup>[note: 49]</sup></a></span>
                    Therefore, his evidence was not as unequivocal as Andrew’s reply
                    submission was suggesting. Dr Hee was not certain that there was some residual
                    disc left behind or that it was indenting on the spinal cord. Even if it was,
                    his view was that there was no significant spinal cord
                compression.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_144"></a>144    I should also mention the evidence of Dr
                    Pang Boon Chuan (“Dr Pang”) on this point. Dr Pang was an expert
                    witness for SGHPL. He thought he could see a bit of disc prolapse at the midline
                    but this was tiny or minute.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_50" id="Ftn_50_1"><sup>[note: 50]</sup></a></span> In his view, it was very unlikely or
                    not possible to get everything out.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_51" id="Ftn_51_1"><sup>[note: 51]</sup></a></span> He added that
                    “contact does not automatically, … , implies
                        compression”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_52" id="Ftn_52_1"><sup>[note: 52]</sup></a></span> He clarified that “we need to make a
                    difference between compression and just having something there. It’s not
                    the same thing. I get the feeling that everyone thinks having a bit of disc
                    there is all that is required for compression.”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_53" id="Ftn_53_1"><sup>[note: 53]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_145"></a>145    In his view, there was no significant
                    compression of the spinal cord.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_54" id="Ftn_54_1"><sup>[note: 54]</sup></a></span> There was great reduction in the force
                    transmitted through the disc. This was because any force would be transmitted to
                    the pedicle screws and rods which Dr Yue had inserted (see [11] above).
                    Furthermore, the spinal canal had been enlarged because the bony structures
                    behind the cord had been removed.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_55" id="Ftn_55_1"><sup>[note: 55]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_146"></a>146    In re-examination, Dr Pang added that the
                    residual disc at midline was not touching the spinal cord.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_56" id="Ftn_56_1"><sup>[note: 56]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_147"></a>147    Dr Peh Chin Guan Wilfred (“Dr
                    Peh”), an independent radiologist who was a witness for Dr Yue, was of
                    the view that the central component, which was slightly to the right, was an
                    osteophyte/bony spur with a small disc component. This was a chronic
                        component.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_57" id="Ftn_57_1"><sup>[note: 57]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_148"></a>148    Dr Mohan, the radiologist from SGH, was of
                    the view that there was no residual disc left of midline and there was calcified
                    disc material or an osteophyte/bone spur right of midline based on the CT scan
                    from Gleneagles.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_58" id="Ftn_58_1"><sup>[note: 58]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_149"></a>149    Dr Wong was of the view that the Gleneagles
                    MRI scan did not show any residual disc material.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_59" id="Ftn_59_1"><sup>[note: 59]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_150"></a>150    Going back to Dr Yue himself, he had given
                    evidence that before he closed up during the first surgery, he did a visual
                    inspection. He saw that the spinal cord was free and pulsating in tandem with
                    Andrew’s heartbeat (see [13] above). This suggested that there was no disc
                    touching the cord. Dr Yue was generally a credible witness on what he had done
                    during the surgery and I saw no reason to disbelieve him on this
                point.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_151"></a>151    The Defendants emphasized that Dr Yue had
                    not only removed the disc prolapse compressing the spinal cord from the front,
                    he had also removed the bony structures behind the spinal cord. This meant that
                    the spinal cord would have space to move backwards if there was still residual
                    disc touching it from the front. Therefore, there would not be significant
                    pressure on the spinal cord.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_152"></a>152    Furthermore, as mentioned above, Dr Pang was
                    of the view that with the screws and rods inserted by Dr Yue into the vertebrae
                    (see [11] above), any force coming through the vertebra would be reduced with
                    the consequent reduction of force being transmitted through the
                disc.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_153"></a>153    However, Andrew submitted that there is no
                    objective evidence to establish that any contact with the spinal cord was not
                    significant. Therefore, the significance of that contact could only be
                    correlated with a patient’s symptoms. Andrew’s point was that as his
                    paralysis continued after the first surgery and the Gleneagles MRI scan showed
                    disc material protruding into the spinal canal with the spinal cord still
                    deformed, the logical conclusion was that the cord was still significantly
                        compressed.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_60" id="Ftn_60_1"><sup>[note: 60]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_154"></a>154    The burden of proof is on Andrew to
                    establish that the relevant disc was still touching the spinal cord and, if so,
                    that the contact was significant enough to compress the spinal cord and to
                    impede his recovery. It is not for the Defendants to establish that there was no
                    contact or no compression.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_155"></a>155    Andrew’s submission about the
                    deformity of the spinal cord made a number of assumptions:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_155-p2_a"></a>(a)     that if disc material was
                        protruding into the spinal canal, this meant that it was touching the spinal
                        cord;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_155-p2_b"></a>(b)     as the
                        spinal cord was still deformed, this in itself suggested that there was
                        contact with residual disc material after the first
                    surgery;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_155-p2_c"></a>(c)     the
                        deformation meant that there was compression significant enough to impede
                        his recovery.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_156"></a>156    It is important to remember that if there
                    was disc material protruding into the spinal canal, this did not necessarily
                    mean that it was touching the spinal cord, let alone compressing the
                    cord.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_157"></a>157    It appears to be common ground that the
                    spinal cord appeared squashed, to use layman’s language, when one views
                    the images from the Gleneagles MRI scan, which was taken after the first
                    surgery. This was the deformity which Andrew’s submission was referring
                    to. However, Andrew’s submission on the deformity had overlooked one
                    important fact. The spinal cord was already squashed before the first surgery
                    was done. After the first surgery was done, the shape of the spinal cord had in
                    fact improved. Furthermore, even if the first surgery had achieved adequate
                    decompression, it would take time before the spinal cord regained its shape. The
                    shape of the spinal cord would not just bounce back like a rubber ball as Dr Lee
                        agreed.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_61" id="Ftn_61_1"><sup>[note: 61]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_158"></a>158    As Dr Mohan said, the spinal cord’s
                    return to normal shape will probably take a long time. He had seen many cases
                    where patients make a full recovery but yet the spinal cord remains the same
                    narrow size prior to surgery.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_62" id="Ftn_62_1"><sup>[note: 62]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_159"></a>159    Therefore, the deformation did not
                    necessarily lead to the conclusion that there was residual disc prolapse
                    touching or compressing the spinal cord.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_160"></a>160    The fact that Andrew’s condition had
                    not improved more over the years is equivocal. For example, the fact that his
                    condition has improved, even though not as much as he would like, could also
                    suggest that Dr Yue did achieve adequate decompression.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_161"></a>161    Furthermore, Dr Lee did not say that he in
                    fact noticed any disc touching or compressing the spinal cord when he performed
                    the second surgery. Indeed, it is telling that in his oral evidence, Dr Lee came
                    up with a different explanation for the allegation that there was continued
                    compression of Andrew’s spinal cord after the first surgery.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The allegation of the negligently-inserted bone fragment</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_162"></a>162    Dr Lee said that a bone fragment was the
                    main cause of compression of Andrew’s spinal cord. The fragment was from
                    bone graft which Dr Yue had inserted as explained in the opening statement for
                    Dr Yue (see [11] above). In Dr Lee’s opinion, it was on the left side of
                    the spinal cord.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_63" id="Ftn_63_1"><sup>[note: 63]</sup></a></span> The other causes of compression were a
                    middle or central bulge and a right bulge but the main cause was the fragment
                    from the bone graft.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_64" id="Ftn_64_1"><sup>[note: 64]</sup></a></span> The bulges in the middle or centre and the
                    right one were from the disc and not from the bone graft. Although Dr Lee said
                    that the central and right protrusions were bulges and not prolapses as
                        such,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_65" id="Ftn_65_1"><sup>[note: 65]</sup></a></span> he was not referring to
                    some protrusions other than the central and right paracentral disc protrusions
                    which I have addressed at length already.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_163"></a>163    Dr Lee’s allegation about the fragment
                    from the bone graft compressing the spinal cord met with many
                    difficulties.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_164"></a>164    First, the SOC and the reply do not mention
                    a fragment from the bone graft as compressing the spinal cord. For
                    example:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_164-p2_a"></a>(a)     Paragraph 6 of the SOC referred to
                        an “acute central <em>disc</em> protrusion at
                        the T10/11 level causing severe canal stenosis with spinal cord
                        compression”[emphasis added].</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_164-p2_b"></a>(b)     Paragraph 8 of the SOC stated that the Gleneagles MRI
                        and CT scan showed a central and right paracentral T10/11 disc protrusion
                        with moderate spinal canal stenosis. Although it also stated that bone graft
                        was found, it is important to note that the allegation then was that bone
                        graft was found <em>within</em> the T10/T11 disc and
                        not that bone graft was found within the spinal cord as Dr Lee had orally
                        testified. The bone graft in the disc may be in the vertebral column and is
                        not necessarily protruding into the spinal cord. More importantly, the last
                        sentence of para 8 of the SOC stated unequivocally, “The cause of the
                        paraplegia was due to the disc protrusion still compressing the spinal
                        cord.”</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_164-p2_c"></a>(c)     Paragraph 10 of the SOC stated that “Dr Yue did not completely
                        decompress the prolapsed disc that was impinging on the spinal cord. Hence
                        the Plaintiff remains a paraplegic despite the second surgery done at
                        Gleneagles Hospital.”</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_164-p2_d"></a>(d)     Paragraph 15(a) of the SOC alleged that the transfacetal
                        approach, <em>ie</em>, the posterior approach
                        “will not give Dr Yue the visual and angle that he needs to
                        completely decompress the front aspect of the cord. As a result the disc
                        material was not completely removed and the spinal cord compression remained
                        after surgery.”</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_164-p2_e"></a>(e)     Paragraph 4 of Andrew’s reply stated that Dr Yue
                        had failed to achieve adequate decompression of the prolapsed
                    disc.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_165"></a>165    As can be seen, the allegations in the SOC
                    and the reply pleading did not even allege that fragment from a bone graft was
                    compressing the spinal cord. That is why I have not mentioned it as one of the
                    issues arising from the pleadings. Notwithstanding my reminders to
                    Andrew’s counsel about the state of Andrew’s pleadings, no
                    application was made to amend his pleadings. Accordingly, Andrew is not entitled
                    to assert, through Dr Lee, that a fragment from a bone graft was the main cause
                    of compression before the second surgery.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_166"></a>166    However, for completeness, I will also deal
                    with the evidence about the bone fragment being the main cause of
                    compression.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_167"></a>167    Dr Chang had given three reports as
                    elaborated above.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_168"></a>168    His first report dated 18 May 2007
                    stated that the Gleneagles MRI and CT scans showed a central and right
                    paracentral disc protrusion still impinging on the spinal cord. He did not say
                    that a CT scan also showed bone compressing the spinal cord, which was a
                    suggestion he made only in his oral testimony which I will come to
                later.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_169"></a>169    While it is true that his first report did
                    say that “[t]he T10-T11 disc and previously inserted bone graft were
                    excised”, he did not say that the bone graft was compressing the spinal
                    cord. Instead, the report went on to say, “The prolapsed disc impinging
                    on the cord was removed meticulously under microscope.”</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_170"></a>170    His second report dated 4 November 2008
                    was to the same effect. While he mentioned at p 2 that bone graft was
                    excised, he again did not say that the bone graft was compressing the spinal
                    cord. At p 3, he repeated that Andrew’s spinal cord was still
                    compressed by the T10/T11 disc prolapse, not the bone graft.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_171"></a>171    Dr Chang’s third report dated
                    23 February 2011 did say at p 9 that bone graft was found within the
                    “protruding” T10/T11 disc but that sentence did not say that it
                    was the bone graft that was compressing the spinal cord, which was what Dr Lee
                    was saying.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_172"></a>172    Furthermore, while the penultimate paragraph
                    of p 9 of the third report mentioned that graft extrusion had been left
                    behind, this was in the context of a criticism about the posterior approach
                    which Dr Yue had used. The criticism was that Dr Yue’s approach did not
                    enable him to see the front of the spinal cord to remove the offending disc. I
                    find the reference to Dr Yue’s approach which resulted in his leaving
                    behind graft extrusion confusing. It was not disputed that Dr Yue was able to
                    insert bone graft into the disc within the vertebral column. If he had
                    inadvertently left some bone graft in the spinal canal as well, this was not
                    because of the approach he had used.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_173"></a>173    Dr Chang’s third report also contained
                    images from MRI and CT scans. Figure 5 was an image taken from a Gleneagles CT
                    scan done before the second surgery. The description below the image said,
                    “Note residual prolapsed disc and calcified material at T10-T11”.
                    Figure 5 showed a whitish material apparently protruding into the spinal canal.
                    However, it was common ground among the medical experts, including Dr Chang
                    himself, that CT scans will show calcified or bony material and not disc
                    material. The whitish material therefore was not disc material and part of the
                    description was wrong. I mention this because it was yet another illustration of
                    the lack of care by Dr Chang in his reports.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_174"></a>174    In Dr Chang’s AEIC signed on
                    30 July 2013, he provided answers A1 to A6 to various questions. In A2, he
                    mentioned that bone graft was used to fuse T10 to T11. He said, “This
                    bone graft was noted to protrude 30% into the left side of the spinal cord,
                    which also certainly did not help the situation”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_175"></a>175    In A4, Dr Chang said that Dr Lee and he
                    performed the second surgery and they noted “that Dr Yue did not clear
                    all the prolapsed disc material. In addition, there was some bone graft at the
                    compressed site which likely aggravated the cord
                compression.”</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_176"></a>176    His AEIC was therefore saying that after the
                    first surgery, the disc protrusion was still the main cause of spinal cord
                    compression, not the bone graft.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_177"></a>177    Dr Lee’s report dated
                    11 September 2008 said that the Gleneagles MRI scan showed a central and
                    right paracentral disc protrusion with compression of the spinal
                cord.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_178"></a>178    Dr Lee’s AEIC signed on 13 August
                    2013 also provided answers, <em>ie</em>, A1 to A4, to
                    various questions. In A3, he said, “there was significant residual disc
                    compressing the spinal cord. Additionally, there was protrusion of some bone
                    graft at the compressed site.” Yet he did not say that the protruded bone
                    graft was compressing the spinal cord. Indeed in A3, he went on to say that Dr
                    Yue did not achieve the goal of complete decompression because “the disc
                    was still compressing the spinal cord when we performed the
                        2<sup>nd</sup> surgery.”</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_179"></a>179    Significantly, Andrew’s opening
                    statement dated 24 March 2014 still did not mention a bone fragment
                    compressing the spinal cord. Instead, at para 2, the complaint was that Dr Yue
                    did not completely decompress the prolapsed disc. At para 27, a similar
                    allegation was made that a significant amount of disc material was still
                    impinging on the spinal cord.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_180"></a>180    Such was the state of play as at
                    24 March 2014. I come now to the oral testimony of Dr Chang. In
                    examination-in-chief on 28 March 2014, he said that the main reason why
                    Andrew was still paraplegic was the fact that the spinal canal had not been
                    cleared of the disc and there was still compression of the spinal cord
                    aggravated by further calcified bone material.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_66" id="Ftn_66_1"><sup>[note: 66]</sup></a></span> He said bone
                    graft was removed. It was mixed together with the disc.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_67" id="Ftn_67_1"><sup>[note: 67]</sup></a></span> This was different
                    from Dr Lee’s oral testimony when Dr Lee said the bone fragment he removed
                    was segregated. In any event, when the court asked Dr Chang whether he was
                    saying that Dr Yue was negligent in how he had inserted the bone graft into the
                    disc, Dr Chang said he was not saying that.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_68" id="Ftn_68_1"><sup>[note: 68]</sup></a></span> By that he was suggesting
                    that he did not want to comment as to whether Dr Yue had acted below the
                    standard of care. But subsequently, Dr Chang changed his mind and he said that
                    Dr Yue did not exercise the level of care expected of a surgeon of his
                        calibre.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_69" id="Ftn_69_1"><sup>[note: 69]</sup></a></span> Even then, as Dr Chang proceeded to list out Dr
                    Yue’s lapses, he did not identify the careless insertion of bone graft as
                    one of the lapses.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_181"></a>181    I should mention that by the time Dr Chang
                    was giving his oral testimony, Andrew had given discovery of a video recording
                    of the second surgery to the Defendants. This discovery was given late but the
                    authenticity of the video recording was not disputed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_182"></a>182    Dr Lee signed a supplementary AEIC on
                    2 May 2014 with the aid of the video recording. He said he removed a (bone)
                    fragment from within the spinal canal at “approximately 101:41”.
                    This was a reference to the time of the recording. The time he intended to refer
                    to, as clarified in his oral testimony, was 1 hour 42 minutes and 30
                        seconds.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_70" id="Ftn_70_1"><sup>[note: 70]</sup></a></span> His supplementary AEIC still did not explicitly
                    assert that the fragment was compressing the spinal cord even at this
                    point.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_183"></a>183    In his oral testimony, Dr Lee said he had
                    already reached the spinal canal much earlier, at about 29 minutes into the
                    video recording. He was certain of this as the curette he was using was
                    disappearing into some sort of cavity.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_71" id="Ftn_71_1"><sup>[note: 71]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_184"></a>184    However, according to Dr Chang’s
                    evidence, they did not reach the spinal canal until much later, nearer the end
                    of the video recording.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_185"></a>185    In any event, as SGHPL submitted, although
                    Dr Lee spent much time elaborating orally on the video evidence, Andrew’s
                    closing and reply submissions did not even rely on the video evidence. This was
                    telling, especially since, as SGHPL put it, the video evidence was supposed to
                    be the star attraction at the trial. Indeed, although Dr Lee said that the
                    fragment was the main cause of compression (see [162] above), Andrew’s
                    closing submissions at para 43(c) states that the fragment had
                    “contributed” to the compression of the cord. I am of the view
                    that Andrew has downplayed the significance of the fragment, contrary to Dr
                    Lee’s oral testimony, because Andrew is aware that the fragment is not
                    pleaded as a cause of compression, a point on which I had raised with his
                    counsel.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_186"></a>186    Furthermore, if the fragment was removed
                    from within the spinal canal and it was the main cause or one of the causes for
                    the compression of the spinal cord, it was strange that the operating notes for
                    the second surgery did not mention this fact.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_72" id="Ftn_72_1"><sup>[note: 72]</sup></a></span> Indeed, Dr Lee even
                    went so far as to say that he remembered that there was excitement when he
                    remarked during the second surgery that there was a bone fragment. Yet he could
                    not adequately explain the omission in the operating notes to mention this fact.
                    All he could say was that Dr Chang wrote the notes and must have forgotten about
                    this fact.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_73" id="Ftn_73_1"><sup>[note: 73]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_187"></a>187    However, as already mentioned above, Dr
                    Lee’s own report dated 11 September 2008 also failed to mention the
                    bone fragment as being a cause, let alone the main cause, of
                compression.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_188"></a>188    The medical experts for the Defendants could
                    not tell from the video recording whether Dr Lee had removed a bone fragment
                    and, if so, whether this was from within the spinal canal itself or from within
                    that part of the disc that was not protruding into the spinal canal when Dr Lee
                    was making his way to what he believed to be a disc prolapse in the spinal canal
                    but before reaching it. One of their difficulties was that Dr Lee did not remove
                    a rib head at the T11 level which would have marked out the boundary of the
                    spinal canal.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_74" id="Ftn_74_1"><sup>[note: 74]</sup></a></span> That would have aided them to tell whether he
                    had reached the spinal canal at the time which he said he did.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_189"></a>189    It is clear to me that if indeed the bone
                    fragment was the main cause or a cause of the compression, this would not have
                    escaped the attention of Dr Chang or Dr Lee. The fact that it was not mentioned
                    in the pleadings or in Dr Chang’s three reports or Dr Lee’s report
                    as the main cause or a cause spoke for itself. The haphazard manner in which
                    such a suggestion was being made did not aid Andrew’s case.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_190"></a>190    For completeness, I would mention that Dr
                    Pang did explain that Dr Yue would have packed mashed-up chips of bone graft
                    into a cavity in the disc itself and it would be inevitable if a little bit had
                    slipped into the spinal canal. He said, “It’s just like pouring
                    sands and a few grains, leaving a trail behind. It doesn’t really mean
                        anything”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_75" id="Ftn_75_1"><sup>[note: 75]</sup></a></span> However, this is different from what Dr
                    Lee was suggesting. Dr Lee was suggesting that Dr Yue had negligently left
                    behind a piece of bone fragment in the spinal canal.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_191"></a>191    Accordingly, I conclude that Andrew has not
                    established that there was residual disc prolapse touching the cord or that it
                    was compressing the cord. He has also not established that a bone fragment
                    inserted by Dr Yue compressed the spinal cord even if it were open to him to
                    pursue this allegation.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Whether there was causation between the negligence, if any, and the
                loss</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_192"></a>192    In the circumstances, it is not necessary to
                    consider whether continued spinal cord compression in fact impeded
                    Andrew’s recovery.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Other findings and observations</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Dr Yue’s explanation on the prognosis</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_193"></a>193    I now come back to one point which I have
                    not yet elaborated upon.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_194"></a>194    As mentioned above, Dr Yue said that when he
                    met Andrew first at the HDU ward on 20 April 2007, he did explain that
                    Andrew’s prognosis was poor. When he met Andrew’s family on
                    24 April 2007, he said that he informed them that the outcome after surgery
                    was not unexpected given the poor prognosis.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_195"></a>195    Dr Yue’s closing submissions relied on
                    some notes made on 7 May 2007 by one Dr Arthur Ng, who was apparently a
                    medical officer at the Department of Rehabilitative Medicine. Dr Arthur
                    Ng’s notes recorded that Dr Yue had informed Dr Arthur Ng that Dr Yue
                    had spoken to the patient (Andrew) even before surgery regarding the “not
                    so good prognosis”. However, Dr Arthur Ng was not called to give evidence
                    about his notes, which would be hearsay evidence in any event. Furthermore, Dr
                    Arthur Ng’s conversation with Dr Yue was on 7 May 2007, which is many
                    days after the 20 April 2007 discussion between Dr Yue and Andrew and the
                    24 April 2007 family meeting.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_196"></a>196    On the other hand, Edwin had made
                    contemporaneous notes of the 24 April 2007 meeting which he then summarised
                    in an email, also dated 24 April 2007, which he sent to various persons
                    including some of his siblings. The contemporaneous notes were not available at
                    trial but his email was produced.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_76" id="Ftn_76_1"><sup>[note: 76]</sup></a></span> There was no mention in
                    that email that Dr Yue had mentioned that Andrew’s prognosis was poor,
                    although that email did contain the following information from Dr Yue:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The nerves in the spinal cord will repair itself, very slowly (maybe 1mm
                        per day), and we can only hope that sensation to the limbs will slowly
                        return, until it reaches the toes.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[Dr Yue] has one patient who is still in crutches after sustaining injury
                        to the T10. [Dr Yue] cannot say that this is to be expected as there are
                        just too few cases involving injury to the T10.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Andrew could do much better than the patient [Dr Yue] mentioned.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_197"></a>197    I am of the view that if Dr Yue had
                    explicitly stated that Andrew’s prognosis was poor, Edwin would have
                    stated this in his notes and then in his email. As it was not mentioned in the
                    email, Dr Yue’s recollection appeared inaccurate as I place more weight on
                    Edwin’s email than on Dr Yue’s memory.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_198"></a>198    As for the earlier discussion on
                    20 April 2007 with Andrew (whether in the absence or presence of
                    Andrew’s wife), the burden is also on Dr Yue to establish that he did
                    specifically inform Andrew that his prognosis was poor. As can be seen from the
                    evidence about the family meeting, Dr Yue’s memory on this point regarding
                    the 20 April 2007 meeting might also not be accurate.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_199"></a>199    Therefore, I find that Dr Yue has failed to
                    establish that he did mention Andrew’s poor prognosis on 20 or
                    24 April 2007 to Andrew or to his family respectively.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_200"></a>200    In any event, it is obvious that the
                    omission made no difference to Andrew’s consent to surgery as elaborated
                    above at [51].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_201"></a>201    The point about Dr Yue’s omission to
                    inform Andrew or his family about the poor prognosis has no direct bearing on
                    the issues before me. I have elaborated on it because it may be that Dr Yue was
                    overly encouraging in his discussions. As mentioned above at [196], he had
                    disclosed that another patient of his had improved to being in crutches after
                    sustaining injury at the T10 level. While he had cautioned that he could not say
                    that this was to be expected for Andrew, he did also say that Andrew could do
                    much better than that patient. Yet, in cross-examination, Dr Yue pointed out
                    that that other patient’s pre-surgery status was not ASIA A.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_77" id="Ftn_77_1"><sup>[note: 77]</sup></a></span>
                    Therefore, to say that Andrew could do better than that patient may have given
                    the family higher hope, although this did not mean that they should have
                    expected immediate and significant improvement in the few days or weeks after
                    the first surgery.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_202"></a>202    I add that Andrew’s argument that Dr
                    Yue had said that he was expected to do much better than that patient is not
                        accurate.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_78" id="Ftn_78_1"><sup>[note: 78]</sup></a></span> According to Edwin’s email,
                    Dr Yue said that Andrew “could” do much better and this was a
                    reference to the eventual future after the first surgery and not the immediate
                    future since Dr Yue had also cautioned that any recovery would be very
                    slow.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_203"></a>203    There is a fine distinction between being
                    overly encouraging and presenting the right picture without being discouraging.
                    While it may be natural for some medical practitioners to offer more hope rather
                    than less hope or none, it is useful for them to bear in mind the importance of
                    getting the balance right, difficult though it may be.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_204"></a>204    Andrew appears convinced that his condition
                    would have improved if not for the negligence of Dr Yue. Ironically, the
                    converse may be true. It may well be that if it were not for Dr Yue’s
                    surgery, Andrew would not even have improved to his present condition. Andrew
                    appears to have attributed that improvement to the second surgery (and his
                    exercises). However, it may be due to the first surgery instead. After all, Dr
                    Chang himself doubted that the second surgery would help much, if at all, given
                    the lapse of time between the first surgery (if it were poorly executed) and the
                    second surgery. If the first surgery was indeed competently executed, then
                    Andrew would owe a debt of gratitude to Dr Yue instead. I add that it is
                    undisputed that although initially there was no available bed at the HDU on the
                    day in question, Dr Yue personally intervened to ask for a bed to be made
                    available for Andrew. Dr Yue also ensured that the first surgery was performed
                    promptly.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Summary of findings</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_205"></a>205    Ultimately the burden is on Andrew to
                    establish his case and not on the Defendants to establish theirs. I now
                    summarise my findings. It seems to me that Andrew and his medical experts had
                    failed to appreciate that there was an important difference between the SGH MRI
                    scan and the Gleneagles MRI scan.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_206"></a>206    The SGH MRI scan showed two disc
                    protrusions. One which was predominantly left sided and one which was central
                    and paracentral right.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_207"></a>207    The Gleneagles MRI scan only showed the
                    latter because the former had been removed by Dr Yue. When Dr Chang and Dr Lee
                    looked at the images from the Gleneagles MRI scan and considered Dr Lin’s
                    report, they did not have the benefit of comparing them with the images from the
                    SGH MRI scan.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_208"></a>208    After the images from the SGH MRI scan and
                    the SGH MRI report by Dr Mohan were made available to Andrew, his medical
                    experts appeared to have placed more reliance on Dr Mohan’s report than in
                    considering the SGH MRI scan images. As Dr Mohan’s report referred to an
                    acute central disc protrusion, this appeared to fit in with Dr Lin’s
                    report although Dr Mohan’s report did not refer to a paracentral right
                    disc protrusion.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_209"></a>209    Furthermore, at some point in time, Andrew
                    would have received Dr Yue’s own report dated 19 March 2008, which
                    referred to the disc protrusion which originally compressed the cord as being
                    predominantly left. It appears that this report may have been dismissed by
                    Andrew’s medical experts as being self-serving. Had this report been
                    considered more carefully with a further consideration of the SGH MRI scan
                    images, his medical experts ought to have realised that actually there were two
                    different disc protrusions, one of which was chronic as elaborated
                above.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_210"></a>210    It also appears that although various expert
                    reports were obtained by the Defendants which supported Dr Yue’s opinion
                    that the disc protrusion which caused the compression before the first surgery
                    was predominantly left-sided, Andrew’s medical experts decided to stick to
                    their initial opinion.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_211"></a>211    It was only during cross-examination that
                    they came to accept reluctantly that there was a predominantly left disc
                    protrusion which was the cause of Andrew’s paraplegia before the first
                    surgery.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_212"></a>212    Even then, a suggestion was still being
                    pursued for Andrew that there was a central and a paracentral right disc
                    protrusion which continued to compress the cord but the suggestion about a
                    paracentral right disc protrusion was eventually given up.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_213"></a>213    The main argument then was that there was a
                    central disc protrusion which had caused and continued to cause cord
                    compression. However, this argument shifted to a bone fragment being the main
                    cause when Dr Lee gave his evidence. The bone fragment argument then shifted
                    back to the central disc protrusion being the main cause, with the bone fragment
                    being only a contributory cause.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_214"></a>214    The many shifts in Andrew’s case have
                    damaged his claim beyond repair.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_215"></a>215    I find that Andrew has failed to discharge
                    his burden of proof and I dismiss his claim against the Defendants. I will hear
                    the parties on costs.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Observations on the conduct of litigation </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_216"></a>216    I wish to make the following
                    observations:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_216-p2_a"></a>(a)     As mentioned above, Andrew had
                        withdrawn some allegations of negligence by the first day of trial. There
                        was no factual evidence to support these allegations. Andrew’s counsel
                        intimated that the allegations were made based on advice from a medical
                        expert but it is for counsel to check whether there is any evidence to
                        support the advice. Bare advice is insufficient. It appears that these
                        allegations were included in the belief that it is easier to withdraw
                        allegations later rather than to apply for leave to make additional
                        allegations later. While that may be true, the responsible approach is to
                        make an allegation only if there is some evidentiary basis to do
                    so.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_216-p2_b"></a>(b)     This
                        litigation has highlighted the importance of adequately preparing
                        one’s case. The many shifts in Andrew’s case did not reflect
                        well on him and especially his professional advisers.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_216-p2_c"></a>(c)     Litigation can be costly and is often
                        stressful, if not traumatic, for both the plaintiff and the defendant.
                        Professionals should take more care to discharge their duties responsibly.
                        Experts should take more care to ensure that they participate in the
                        litigation not just to do a favour for one party or to earn a fee but
                        because they genuinely believe in the opinions they express. The opinions
                        must be supported by adequate time being spent to consider the allegations
                        of each side and if necessary, to investigate further and to do research.
                        They should put themselves in the shoes of the other side and give due
                        regard to the opinions of experts from the opposing side. They must be
                        willing to change their initial opinion if there is a valid reason to do so.
                        One must not confuse intransigence with genuine conviction. Furthermore, a
                        litigant should not blindly accept the opinion of his expert if he is in a
                        position to assess the merit of that opinion.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_216-p2_d"></a>(d)     Dr Lee was one of Andrew’s medical
                        experts and the lead surgeon in the second surgery. Since his AEIC had
                        accepted that both the posterior and anterior approaches were acceptable for
                        Andrew’s condition, it was surprising that Andrew still persisted in
                        the trial with his allegation that the posterior approach was not suitable,
                        apparently without clarifying the point with Dr Lee. As already mentioned,
                        eventually Andrew conceded the point at the submissions
                    stage.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_216-p2_e"></a>(e)     When Andrew
                        filed his claim, the claim was made against both Dr Yue and SGHPL. As SGHPL
                        did not deny that it was vicariously liable for any negligence of Dr Yue and
                        there were additional allegations against SGHPL, it would have sufficed for
                        Andrew to continue with his claim against SGHPL only. Yet he continued his
                        claim against both Defendants even after he had stopped pursuing the
                        additional allegations against SGHPL. I do not know why he continued with
                        his claim against both Dr Yue and SGHPL, when a claim against either one
                        should have sufficed. I add that Dr Yue is covered by insurance and this is
                        known to Andrew. As it is, the costs have been increased by the
                        participation of both Defendants as parties. In addition, Andrew had to face
                        two sets of counsel and medical experts instead of one.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_217"></a>217    I record my appreciation for the assistance
                    rendered by Dr Yu Chun Sing who is Senior Consultant, Department of Orthopaedic
                    Surgery, at Tan Tock Seng Hospital. He was an assessor appointed by the court
                    and gave as much of his time as he could.</p>
