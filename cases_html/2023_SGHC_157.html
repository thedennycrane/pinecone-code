About a minute later, the driver exited the van and walked towards the dustbin at the Bus Stop (the “Dustbin”). He loitered around the Dustbin for a minute or so before returning to the van. At about 2.18am, the driver of the van was seen carrying a plastic bag from the van to the Bus Stop and placing the plastic bag in the Dustbin before returning to the van empty handed. The van drove off about two minutes later.

Central Narcotics Bureau (“CNB”) officers followed the Honda Civic to Blk 635C. After the CNB officers drove past the location where the Honda Civic was parked, Yeo drove off in the Honda Civic. In the process, Yeo first threw one bundle out of the passenger’s side window of the Honda Civic and then threw the other out of the driver’s side window of the Honda Civic. At about 3.15am, Yeo was arrested under the TPE flyover near to Tebing Lane.

</div> He was surprised to see two bundles instead of one when he opened the Plastic Bag. He initially thought one of the bundles could have been meant for him while the other bundle was delivered wrongly. He therefore threw the bigger bundle out of his car window. On thinking further, he realised that both bundles were not his and decided to throw the other bundle away as well. (At this point, it will be useful to note that Yeo had referred to the blue-taped bundles as “packets” in his submissions. For consistency and to avoid confusion, I will continue to refer to them as “bundles” in these grounds. One of the blue-taped bundles contained two clear plastic packets of drugs while the other blue-taped bundle contained one clear plastic packet of drugs. In these grounds, I will reserve the term “packets” for referring to these three clear plastic bags.)</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">15 Yeo did not dispute being in possession of the Drugs.

</div> Instead, Yeo submitted that, since the Plastic Bag (containing the Drugs) came into Yeo’s possession as a result of wrong delivery, Yeo did not and could not have knowledge of the nature of Plastic Bag’s contents. As for the intention to traffic, Yeo admitted that, when he collected the Plastic Bag from the Dustbin believing that it contained the drugs he ordered from “Danny”, he had intended to sell the drugs. However, Yeo submitted that, due to the wrong delivery, the Drugs which he actually collected from the Dustbin were not the drugs he ordered from “Danny”. He therefore did not have any trafficking intent in relation to the Drugs which were wrongly delivered to him.

(In the interest of brevity, I shall hereafter refer to the time period from the evening of 5 March 2018 to the early morning of 6 March 2018 collectively as “the night in question”.) He submitted that the Prosecution failed to prove beyond reasonable doubt that: (i) the van seen stopping behind the Bus Stop from about 2.12am to 2.18am on 6 March 2018 was the Van; and (ii) it was Nagaiah who placed the Drugs in the Dustbin.

The thing in issue is the container, the key or the document of title. In this sense, this provision deals with secondary possession of the drug in that the accused possesses, controls or has custody of something which has the drug or which relates to the title in, or delivery of, the drug. … Once the Prosecution proves that the thing in issue exists and that the accused has possession, control or custody of the thing in issue, the effect of s 18(1) is to raise a presumption of fact, which is that the accused, by virtue of his possession, control or custody of the thing in issue, is presumed to possess the drugs which are contained in or are related to the thing in issue.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">35 <span class="font-italic">To rebut the presumption in s 18(1), the accused has to prove, on a balance of probabilities, that he did not have the drug in his possession</span>. In this context, the most obvious way in which the presumption can be rebutted is by establishing that the accused did not know that the thing in issue contained that which is shown to be the drug in question. Thus, for instance, the presumption could be rebutted successfully if the accused is able to persuade the court that the drug was slipped into his bag or was placed in his vehicle or his house without his knowledge. …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">36 Where the presumption in s 18(1) of the MDA is invoked by the Prosecution and is then rebutted successfully by the accused, the Prosecution would have failed to prove that the accused was in possession of the drug.

However, <span class="font-italic">if an accused is either (a) proved to have had the controlled drug in his possession; or (b) presumed under s 18(1) of the MDA to have had the controlled drug in his possession and the contrary is not proved, the presumption under s 18(2) that he has knowledge of the nature of the drug would be invoked</span>. This follows because an accused person, who, it has been established, was in possession of the controlled drug should be taken to know the nature of that drug unless he can demonstrate otherwise. <span class="font-italic">To rebut the presumption in s 18(2), the accused must prove, on a balance of probabilities, that he did not have knowledge of the nature of the controlled drug</span> (in effect, that he did not have the <span class="font-italic">mens</span><span class="font-italic"> rea</span> of the offence). In <span class="font-italic">Dinesh Pillai a/l K Raja </span><span class="font-italic">Retnam v PP</span> [2012] 2 SLR 903 (“<span class="font-italic">Dinesh Pillai</span>”), this court observed (at [18]) that the accused can do so by showing that “he did not know or could not reasonably be expected to have known the nature of the controlled drug”.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 Where the Prosecution does not rely on the presumption of possession under s 18(1) of the MDA, then in order to establish the first element of possession of a controlled drug, the Prosecution is required to prove not only that the accused was in possession of the package, but also that the accused knew that it contained something, which may later be established to be the shipment of controlled drugs (see <span class="font-italic">Zainal bin Hamad v Public Prosecutor and another appeal </span>[2018] 2 SLR 1119 (“<span class="font-italic">Zainal</span>”) at [12]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 Where the Prosecution does not rely on the presumption of knowledge under s 18(2) of the MDA, the Prosecution would have to prove that the accused had actual knowledge of the nature of the drug.

In his closing submission, Yeo chose to concede the first element and analyse the wrong delivery defence in relation to the second element. The Prosecution, on the other hand, chose to analyse the wrong delivery defence in relation to the knowledge component of the first element. I appreciated that, in the final analysis, it made no practical difference either way. This was because, if the wrong delivery defence was made out, Yeo must be acquitted of the charge irrespective of whether one chooses to analyse the defence in relation to the first or second element. Conversely, if the wrong delivery defence was rejected, then (for reasons explained in the rest of these grounds) the only rational conclusion is that Yeo had the knowledge which satisfied both the second element of the offence and the knowledge component of the first element. Having said that, as a matter of logic, the Prosecution’s approach was more correct. This was especially since one of Yeo’s assertions was that he opened the Plastic Bag soon after collecting it to inspect its contents and, upon seeing two bundles instead of one, began to suspect that the bundles were not the drugs which he purchased. If this assertion of Yeo’s was accepted by the court, it could have the effect of disproving the knowledge component of the first element.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(2) Consideration of Yeo’s wrong delivery defence </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 I therefore turned to consider Yeo’s wrong delivery defence. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 As noted in <span class="font-italic">Zainal </span>at [16], once the Prosecution had proven that Yeo was in possession of the Plastic Bag containing the Two Bundles and that its contents turned out to be the drugs in question, it would be incumbent on Yeo to discharge his evidential burden by raising a reasonable doubt that this was not the case.

However, that alone was not sufficient to raise a reasonable doubt in Yeo’s favour. Whatever reasons these two persons might have for going to the Bus Stop, I did not agree that they appeared to be interested in the contents of the Dustbin. First, it was clear from the PolCam footage that they did not remove the cover of the Dustbin. Yeo agreed during cross-examination that, in order to see clearly what was inside the Dustbin, one would have to remove the cover.

</div> If the two persons were indeed the intended recipients of the Drugs, it would be most incredible for them to walk away nonchalantly from the Dustbin when they did not see the Drugs in the Dustbin, without at least first removing the cover of the Dustbin to search the Dustbin more thoroughly. Secondly, even though the upper torsos of the two persons were not visible in the PolCam footage during the period they were standing next to the Dustbin, it would appear from what could be seen of their legs during this time that they were standing straight throughout the entire time that they were next to the Dustbin. At no time was either of them bending down as one would expect them to do if they were indeed trying to retrieve something from the Dustbin.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 In the light of the foregoing, I found Yeo’s submission concerning the two persons to be entirely speculative and without merit.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-5 text-left">(B) Whether Yeo could have realised that the Drugs were not his from the fact that there were two bundles instead of one </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 It was Yeo’s evidence that:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) each time he placed an order for methamphetamine, he would always order two consignments of 250g each;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) each 250g consignment would come in a single bundle;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) unusually, he was expecting to collect 350g on this occasion; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) prior to this occasion, he had never received more than 250g per delivery.   </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 In my view, once the foregoing four aspects of Yeo’s evidence were considered together, it was immediately apparent that Yeo’s submission was inherently illogical. Since all previous deliveries were received by Yeo in single bundles of 250g each, and Yeo had never received a delivery of more than 250g before, there was simply no way Yeo could have known whether the 350g he was expecting on this occasion would be packed in one bundle or two. In fact, Yeo himself conceded during cross-examination that he would not have known whether his supplier, “Danny”, would pack 350g of methamphetamine in one bundle or two bundles.

There were only Blocks 617A, 617B, 617C and 617D. These four blocks of flats were separate buildings, not joined together as part of a larger building called “Block 617”. Although “Block 617” did not exist, it was perfectly understandable that Yeo would have found it convenient to use the generic term “Block 617” to refer to all four blocks of flats collectively in his testimony and investigative statements. It would not have been easy to recall which of the four blocks was the Bus Stop located in front of without the aid of photographs or maps. Based on the map found in Annex 2 of Yeo’s case for the defence, which was used as a source of reference at various junctures during the trial, the Oasis LRT Station was located directly in front of Block 617C while the Bus Stop was located directly in front of Block 617D (“Blk 617D”).

The driver did not do so. Instead, “Danny” called Yeo and asked for him to proceed to “Block 617”. However, by the time Yeo arrived, the white van was no longer there. Yeo then called “Danny” to ask why the white van left before Yeo arrived. “Danny” explained that the driver was afraid and would make other deliveries first before circling back.

Given that, by Yeo’s account, there were no fewer than eight phone calls between Yeo and “Danny” throughout the night, the veracity of Yeo’s account should be easy to corroborate by reference to Yeo’s phone records. Unfortunately for Yeo, no such support was forthcoming.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 Yeo was carrying three mobile phones. These were marked as “YLH-HP1”, “F1A” and “F2A”.

</div> In other words, the telcos’ records disclosed <span class="font-italic">no evidence </span>of multiple phone calls to and/or from “Danny” on the night in question. However, given the prevalence of mobile applications, such as Whatsapp Messenger, which allow calls to be made without routing them through the telcos, the telcos’ call records could not be treated as exhaustive. It would be relevant to also examine the call records stored on the phones. Yeo initially told the investigation officer, ASP Neo Zhan Wei (“IO Neo”), on 13 March 2018 that the passcode for both phones was “111111”. When this passcode did not work on the two phones, Yeo told IO Neo on 10 May 2018 that the passcode to both phones was “120495”. This new passcode managed to unlock “F2A”, and the forensic examinations of “F2A” disclosed no records of calls made to or received from “Danny” on the night in question. However, the new passcode still could not unlock “F1A”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 The Prosecution submitted that Yeo had deliberately refused to disclose the passcode for “F1A” and invited me to draw an adverse inference against Yeo.

</div> In my view, if Yeo had genuinely suspected a wrong delivery, the natural thing for him to do would be to call “Danny” for clarification first, rather than opt for the precipitous act of throwing the Drugs out of his car. It was simply illogical for Yeo to have thrown several thousand dollars’ worth of drugs out of his car without first clarifying the situation with “Danny”. In fact, Yeo admitted that he had no difficulty getting in touch with “Danny” when arranging the delivery throughout the night.

</div> This meant that bundle “B1” could only have been thrown out of the car after Yeo had started driving off and not while the car was still parked in front of the rubbish chute. That was inconsistent with Yeo’s account that he had already thrown both bundles out before noticing the CNB vehicles.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 In the light of the foregoing, I found this part of Yeo’s account to be unbelievable. I therefore rejected Yeo’s submission that he threw the Drugs out of his car because he suspected a wrong delivery, and accepted the Prosecution’s submission that Yeo threw the Drugs out of his car in order to dissociate himself from the Drugs because he had realised that the CNB was onto him and he was about to be arrested. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-5 text-left">(E) Yeo’s credibility as a witness</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 My first observation about Yeo’s credibility was grounded in the internal inconsistency of his evidence. He had provided at least three different accounts across his statements and at the trial. The first account was presented in his statement recorded by Staff Sergeant (“SSgt”) Au Yong Hong Mian on 6 March 2018 at 4.50am (the “First Contemporaneous Statement”), where Yeo denied recognising the drug exhibits altogether, <span class="font-italic">viz</span>, “I do not know what the 02 bundles are and I do not know who they belongs [<span class="font-italic">sic</span>] to”.

</div> Yeo claimed that while at Blk 635C, “Kelvin”, his supplier, sold him one set of methamphetamine, which he tore open and discarded near the construction site while running away. However, no drugs were recovered in the vicinity of the construction site. The second account provided by Yeo had him admit to recognising the Drugs which he had picked up from a bin, and subsequently discarded after driving to Blk 635C. In his statement recorded by IO Neo on 20 March 2018 at 2.30pm, Yeo confessed that he knew that “A1A1”, “A1A2” and “B1A” contained methamphetamine.

</div> Yeo also recanted the account in his First Contemporaneous Statement that he had thrown methamphetamine away at the construction site and identified “Danny” as his supplier. The third account was provided in Yeo’s testimony at the trial, where he alleged that both “Danny” and “Kelvin” were his drug suppliers. He also claimed that he did not know the Two Bundles contained methamphetamine. As noted at [49] above, there was no basis for Yeo to infer from the fact that there were two bundles instead of one in the Plastic Bag that the contents of the Two Bundles were not the drugs he ordered. Yeo had previously received only deliveries in single bundles of 250g each. It therefore beggared belief that Yeo would have been able to infer any purported misdelivery with the Two Bundles on this occasion when he had expected 350g of methamphetamine to be delivered. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 As for external inconsistency, one needed to look no further than the inconsistency between the phone records and Yeo’s claim to have had no fewer than eight telephone conversations with Danny on the night in question. In addition, Yeo’s account that he had already thrown out the Two Bundles before he noticed the CNB vehicles was inconsistent with the fact that “B1A” was found some distance away from where Yeo had parked his car at Blk 635C (see [64] above).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 In the light of the foregoing, I found that Yeo was not a credible witness and therefore treated his evidence with caution.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(3) Conclusion on actual possession</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 Having regard to the analysis at [44] to [65] above, I found that Yeo had failed to raise a reasonable doubt in the Prosecution’s case that Yeo intended to possess the Drugs and knew that the Plastic Bag contained the Drugs.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 It bears repeating that not all doubts about the Prosecution’s case are reasonable doubts. As noted in <span class="font-italic">Jagatheesan</span><span class="font-italic"> s/o Krishnasamy v Public Prosecutor </span>[2006] 4 SLR(R) 45 (“<span class="font-italic">Jagatheesan</span>”), at [51], “[o]ne must distinguish between a ‘real and reasonable’ doubt and a ‘merely fanciful’ doubt”. <span class="font-italic">Jagatheesan</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>went on, at [53], to cite with approval the <span class="font-italic">dictum </span>of Wood JA in <span class="font-italic">R v Brydon </span>(1995) 2 BCLR (3d) 243 that a reasonable doubt is “a doubt for which one can give a reason, so long as the reason given is logically connected to the evidence”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">71 Yeo’s wrong delivery defence did not rise above raising merely fanciful doubts.

As I found that the Prosecution had proved actual possession and actual knowledge beyond reasonable doubt, it successfully invoked the presumption of trafficking under s 17(<span class="font-italic">h</span>) of the MDA. Yeo made no attempt to rebut this presumption. Yeo admitted that he went to the Bus Stop to collect what he believed to be the drugs he ordered from Danny, which drugs he intended to sell. In other words, Yeo intended to possess the drugs which he was collecting from the Bus Stop for the purpose of trafficking. Yeo’s only defence was that, due to a wrong delivery, the drugs which he actually collected were not the drugs which he intended to collect. Given my rejection of Yeo’s wrong delivery defence (see [71] above), it followed as a matter of logic that the Drugs were in Yeo’s possession for the purpose of trafficking.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Conclusion on the case against Yeo</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">74 For the reasons given above, I found Yeo guilty and convicted him accordingly.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The case against Nagaiah </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">75 As noted above, Nagaiah was charged for trafficking in the Drugs by delivering the Drugs to Yeo.

There is objective evidence from the PolCam footage showing the driver of a white van placing a plastic bag in the Dustbin and Yeo subsequently collecting a plastic bag from the Dustbin. There is no doubt that the plastic bag collected by Yeo was the plastic bag which the driver of the white van placed in the Dustbin. First, the Dustbin was just emptied by two workers from a rubbish truck roughly one minute before the white van approached the Bus Stop.

</div> This meant that there could have been no other plastic bags in the Dustbin when the driver of the white van placed his plastic bag in the Dustbin. Second, no other persons had approached the Dustbin between the departure of the white van from the Bus Stop and the arrival of Yeo at the Bus Stop. There is therefore no doubt that the plastic bag which the driver of the white van placed in the Dustbin was the Plastic Bag.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">77 The difficulty with the Prosecution’s case was that there was no witness who could positively identify the driver of the white van. The quality of the PolCam footage did not allow the identity of the person or the registration number of the white van to be definitively identified. The CNB officer who witnessed the driver of the white van placing a plastic bag in the Dustbin also did not have a good enough look to either identify that person or note down the white van’s registration number. While Yeo was able to identify Nagaiah as someone who had <span class="font-italic">previously</span> delivered drugs to him, Yeo was not able to identify Nagaiah as the person who delivered the Drugs to him <span class="font-italic">via</span> the Dustbin on this occasion.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">78 In the circumstances, the Prosecution’s case against Nagaiah rested wholly on circumstantial evidence. Circumstantial evidence works “by cumulatively, in geometrical progression, eliminating other possibilities” (<span class="font-italic">DPP v Kilbourne </span>[1973] AC 729, per Lord Simon at p 758, cited with approval in <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v Chee Cheong Hin Constance </span>[2006] 2 SLR(R) 24 (“<span class="font-italic">Constance </span><span class="font-italic">Chee</span>”) at [78]), and has been likened to “a rope consisting of several strands each strengthening the other” (<span class="font-italic">Oh </span><span class="font-italic">Laye Koh v Public Prosecutor </span>[1994] SGCA 102 at [16]). In the final analysis, the question before the court is whether the totality of the circumstantial evidence on which the Prosecution relied “inevitably and inexorably” led to a single conclusion of the accused’s guilt (<span class="font-italic">Ang Sunny v Public Prosecutor </span>[1965-1967] SLR(R) 123 (“<span class="font-italic">Sunny Ang</span>”) at [14]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">79 I also found instructive the following observations of V K Rajah J (as he then was) in <span class="font-italic">Constance</span> <span class="font-italic">Chee </span>(at [85]): </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Grave suspicion is no substitute for proof beyond reasonable doubt. In the same vein, moral certainty cannot replace the requirement for explicit and certain evidence. <span class="font-italic">The various links in the interlocking chain of evidence must establish a complete chain that rules out any reasonable likelihood of an accused’s innocence.</span> Guilt must be the only rational inference and conclusion to be drawn from the complete chain of evidence.

In this regard, the fact which the Prosecution needed to prove was that Nagaiah had handled the Plastic Bag, The Prosecution did not need to prove that Nagaiah had handled the Two Bundles before they were placed in the Plastic Bag. Therefore, the submission that Nagaiah’s DNA was absent from “B1” and the submission that it was unclear whether his DNA was on “A1A” were both beside the point. It was sufficient to focus only on the DNA profile found on the Plastic Bag itself. Nagaiah simply had no explanation for how his DNA got onto the outside surface of the Plastic Bag. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">84 On 3 October 2018, IO Neo asked Nagaiah to explain the presence of his DNA on the Plastic Bag and “A1A”.

(Direct transfer of DNA occurs when a person touches an object and leaves some of his DNA on the object. Secondary transfer occurs when the first object touches a second object in such a way as to transfer over to the second object some of the DNA left by the person on first object.) However, Nagaiah did not explain how the food packet he threw away could have come into contact with the Plastic Bag and with “A1A” for such secondary transfer to occur. At trial, Nagaiah confirmed that he had not thrown any food packet into the Dustbin at the Bus Stop.

Even if Nagaiah’s explanation were accepted, this could only explain how Nagaiah’s DNA was found on the inside of the Plastic Bag (since “A1A” was within the Plastic Bag and this created the opportunity for secondary transfer from “A1A” to the inside surface of the Plastic Bag).

First, Nagaiah attempted to throw doubt on the accuracy of the information extracted by Forensic Specialist Lee Jia Ying Cheryl of the Forensic Response Team of CNB (“Forensic Specialist Lee”) concerning the time and location at which the Photographs were taken. In relation to time, Nagaiah pointed to Forensic Specialist Lee saying at trial that she could not “confirm the date and time taken from the image previously mentioned was accurate”.

</div> When she turned on the phone on 4 December 2019, the date and time shown on the phone was 1 January 2015 at 8.03am. This is a phenomenon arising from the depletion of the battery powering the phone’s internal clock due to the phone having been stored for a long period without being recharged. As a result, the date and time of the phone defaulted back to the phone’s factory setting. Once the date and time of the phone have returned to factory setting, it was no longer possible for Forensic Specialist Lee to determine whether the phone was set by its owner/user to the correct date and time on the night in question. It was in this context that Forensic Specialist Lee said she could not “confirm the date and time taken from the image previously mentioned was accurate”. This was not a statement that the phone was malfunctioning in relation to the keeping of date and time.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">91 As the owner of the phone, Nagaiah was best placed to know whether the phone was set to the correct date and time on the night in question. Tellingly, Nagaiah did not give evidence that the date and time of the phone was set inaccurately at any time. More importantly, the results of Forensic Specialist Lee’s forensic examination of Nagaiah’s phone was shared with the Defence in a CD-ROM marked “FORT/MF/2018/0041” (“the CD-ROM”).

</div> If indeed, the phone had been set to an inaccurate date and time on or around the night in question, it would not have been difficult for Nagaiah to point out how some of the messages were out of sync in terms of timing with actual events. The fact that Nagaiah did not attempt to do so showed that he did not believe that his phone was set to the wrong date and/or time on the night in question. On the contrary, one can easily pick up evidence from the CD-ROM that the phone was set to the correct date and time at the material time. For example, Nagaiah received his first incoming Valentine’s Day greetings by Whatsapp on 14 February 2018 at 12.03am.

Nagaiah did not explain why the Prosecution would have been required to confirm the position of the Dustbin in order to prove its case against Nagaiah. Nevertheless, it would appear, from a detailed reading of paragraphs 41 to 43 of Nagaiah’s closing submissions, that Nagaiah’s argument proceeded along the following lines:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The Bus Stop has concrete flooring.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) There is a grass verge beside the Bus Stop, and there is an electrical box on this grass verge.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) The Photographs show a green dustbin sitting on concrete flooring, very close to the edge of a grass verge.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) IO Neo agreed during cross-examination that, from the PolCam footage, the Dustbin appeared to be next to the electrical box.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">95 Taken as a whole, IO Neo’s answers did not assist Nagaiah in making the argument outlined at [93] above. IO Neo made clear that, from the angle and nature of the PolCam footage, the Dustbin and the electrical box could appear side-by-side on the PolCam footage even if they were actually not. This was a complete answer to Nagaiah’s argument. Since Nagaiah could not say for sure that the Dustbin was on the grass verge and not on the concrete flooring on the night in question, there was no basis for Nagaiah to argue that the dustbin in the Photographs could not have been the Dustbin.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">96 For completeness, I should add that, even if IO Neo had conceded what Nagaiah’s counsel thought he had conceded, I was not bound to accept what IO Neo said on this matter. In the exchange referred to at [94] above, IO Neo was not being asked to give evidence of something he had witnessed or otherwise had personal knowledge of. IO Neo was not present on the scene on the night in question and therefore did not witness, or otherwise have personal knowledge of, the matters depicted in the PolCam footage. Instead, IO Neo was being asked to give his <span class="font-italic">interpretation of</span> <span class="font-italic">or opinion on</span> the PolCam footage. The PolCam footage is real evidence which the court was well capable of examining for itself to discern what it showed and, indeed, the court was duty bound to do so. The court need not be told by a witness what the footage showed. If the PolCam footage showed a white van and IO Neo had said it was a red van, it could not be the case that the court was to accept that it was a red van. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">97 From my own observation of the PolCam footage during the period when the two workers from the rubbish truck were emptying the Dustbin, the Dustbin could be seen swaying in such a way that parts of it would disappear behind the electrical box

</div>. This meant that (a) the Dustbin and the electrical box were not side-by-side, and (b) the Dustbin was further away from the PolCam compared to the electrical box. This made it very likely that the Dustbin was on the concrete flooring and not the grass verge. As a result, it rendered untenable Nagaiah’s argument that the dustbin in the Photographs could not be the Dustbin because the Dustbin was definitely on the grass verge.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">98 Having disposed of Nagaiah’s arguments against the Photographs, I concluded that the evidence of the Photographs, including the metadata showing the time and location at which the Photographs were taken, indisputably placed Nagaiah at the Bus Stop at the very moment the driver of the white van in the PolCam footage was seen loitering around the Dustbin, and conclusively identified Nagaiah as the person who placed the Plastic Bag in the Dustbin.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Evidence that Nagaiah and the Van were in Singapore at the material time</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">99 The immigration records showed that Nagaiah and the Van were in Singapore from 7.21pm on 5 March 2018 to 3.41am on 6 March 2018.

</div> Correspondingly, the PolCam Footage at the timestamp 02:12:46, depicted a white van stopping along the driveway behind the Bus Stop. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">101 Nagaiah submitted that the evidence of the three officers who claimed to have seen the number plate of the Van was not reliable. Inspector Kua could not remember whether the van was travelling towards him or away from him. SI Tay could not remember along which part of Punggol Walk he saw the van nor could he remember which direction the van was travelling in. SSgt Au Yong failed to mention spotting the van in his conditioned statement. I agreed that the factors just mentioned gave rise to justifiable concerns about the accuracy and veracity of these three officers’ evidence. I therefore accepted Nagaiah’s submission to place no weight on the evidence of these three officers concerning them seeing the number plate of the Van in the vicinity of the Bus Stop on the night in question.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Conclusion on the first element (delivery of the Drugs)  </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">102 When the various strands of evidence discussed above were considered cumulatively, they led inevitably and inexorably to the conclusion that Nagaiah was the person who was seen placing the Plastic Bag in the Dustbin at 2.18am on 6 March 2018.

The Prosecution may invoke s 18(2) of the MDA so long as they can either prove that the accused was in possession of the drugs or trigger the presumption in s 18(1) of the MDA to that effect. Often, as is the case in the present proceedings, proof that the act of trafficking had taken place would also prove that the accused was in possession of the drugs and hence trigger the presumption in s 18(2) of the MDA.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">104 As was the case in <span class="font-italic">Ramdhan</span>, the fact that the Prosecution had proven that Nagaiah was delivering the Plastic Bag also constitutes proof that Nagaiah was in possession of the Plastic Bag, thereby triggering the presumption under s 18(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) that Nagaiah was in possession of the Drugs. The onus thus shifted to Nagaiah to rebut the presumption on a balance of probabilities. Given that Nagaiah’s defence consisted entirely of a denial that he was in possession of the Plastic Bag (as opposed, <span class="font-italic">eg</span><span class="font-italic">,</span> to a defence that he was holding the Plastic Bag in the belief that its contents were something other than controlled drugs, or that the Drugs came into his custody inadvertently), Nagaiah was not able to rebut the presumption.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">105 Given that Nagaiah was presumed under s 18(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the MDA to have had the Drugs in his possession and he failed to prove the contrary, the presumption under s 18(2) of the MDA that Nagaiah had knowledge of the nature of the Drugs was triggered. In order to rebut the presumption under s 18(2) of the MDA, Nagaiah had to prove, on a balance of probabilities, that he did not have knowledge of the nature of the Drugs. If Nagaiah denied knowing that the Drugs were methamphetamine, he should have been able to say what he thought or believed he was carrying, for a claim that he simply did not know what he was carrying would not usually be sufficient to rebut the presumption: <span class="font-italic">Adili</span><span class="font-italic"> Chibuike Ejike v Public Prosecutor </span>[2019] 2 SLR 254<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [32]; <span class="font-italic">Zainal</span> at [23]; <span class="font-italic">Obeng</span> at [39]–[40]; <span class="font-italic">Harven</span><span class="font-italic"> a/l Segar v Public Prosecutor</span> [2017] 1 SLR 771 at [2].  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">106 Nagaiah was unable to rebut the presumption under s 18(2) of the MDA for the same reasons he was unable to rebut the presumption under s 18(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the MDA.
