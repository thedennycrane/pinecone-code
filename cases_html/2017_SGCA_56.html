There they met Pram Nair, the appellant. A period of revelry followed. Later that night [V] and the appellant left the club by themselves and headed for the beach. What happened after that was the central dispute in this case. [V] said that by this time, she was intoxicated to the point of being barely conscious, and that the appellant had penetrated her with his finger and also raped her while they were on the beach. The appellant asserted that [V] was not as intoxicated as she claims to have been, and that the sexual activity between them, which included some foreplay, was consensual. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 Following investigations, the Public Prosecutor (“PP”) brought two charges against the appellant: one for rape under s 375(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed), which is punishable under s 375(2), and another for sexual assault by penetration under s 376(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>), punishable under s 376(3). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">3 At the conclusion of the trial in the High Court, the judge (“the Judge”) convicted the appellant of both offences and sentenced him to 12 years’ imprisonment and 6 strokes of the cane for each charge. The Judge reduced the imprisonment terms to 11 years and 19 days for each offence to take into account the time that the appellant had spent in remand before being released on bail. With both sentences ordered to run concurrently, the appellant’s aggregate sentence was 11 years and 19 days’ imprisonment and 12 strokes of the cane. The Judge issued separate grounds of decision in respect of the appellant’s conviction and sentence: <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v Pram Nair </span>[2016] 4 SLR 880 (“Conviction GD”) and <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v Pram Nair</span> [2016] 5 SLR 1169 (“Sentence GD”) respectively. The appellant has appealed against his conviction and sentence. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">4 We heard the appeal on 11 April 2017 and received further submissions on 27 June 2017. Three significant legal issues were the focus of counsel’s arguments: first, how is a court to determine whether a rape victim, who was intoxicated at the material time, had in fact consented to sexual activity; second, whether the fact that a victim is intoxicated is a factor that aggravates an offence of rape or sexual assault by penetration; and third, whether or not the benchmark sentences for the two offences should be equated. We will set out our views on those issues in due course. For now, we turn to sketch out the factual background in greater detail, focusing for the moment on those facts which are undisputed.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Background </span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">[V] goes to the Wavehouse with [S]</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">5 The material events occurred over a short span of about four hours, between 11pm on 5 May 2012 and 2:50am on 6 May 2012.

At about 2am, Kason was walking along the beach looking for a friend’s lost slippers with the aid of the torchlight function on his mobile phone. From a distance of about 35 metres away he saw a man, his bare buttocks facing him, kneeling down and bending over a woman lying on the sand. It is not in dispute that these were the appellant and [V] respectively. Kason assumed it was a couple making out and ignored them. He continued walking up and down the beach searching for his friend’s slippers.

</div> Both statements were recorded by Senior Staff Sergeant Aloysius Tay from the Serious Sexual Crimes Branch of the Criminal Investigation Department. At trial, the appellant sought to challenge the admissibility of those statements on the ground that they had been made involuntarily, but after an ancillary hearing the Judge ruled that they were admissible. The appellant does not challenge this finding in the present appeal.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Decision below</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Conviction</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 For the offence of rape under s 375 of the Penal Code, the PP bore the burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that (a) the appellant had penetrated the vagina of [V] with his penis; and (b) [V] did not consent to the penetration. For the offence of sexual assault by penetration under s 376 of the Penal Code, the PP had to prove that (a) the appellant had sexually penetrated the vagina of [V] with his finger; and (b) [V] did not consent to the penetration. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 The Judge found that the PP had proven beyond a reasonable doubt that, in the early morning of 6 May 2012, the appellant had penetrated [V]’s vagina, once with his penis and once with his finger. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The Judge noted that the medical and forensic evidence was neutral. There was no evidence of ejaculation inside [V]’s vagina. Both the DNA sample taken from [V]’s vagina and the bikini bottom [V] had worn tested negative for semen. There was no fresh tear at [V]’s hymen. (Conviction GD at [69]–[71]). </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) [V]’s evidence on whether the accused had penetrated her vagina with his penis was not unusually convincing. Her evidence alone would not have been sufficient to conclude that there had been penile penetration. It was, however, corroborated by the appellant’s 7 May and 21 May statements in which he had admitted to penetrating [V] with his penis. The Judge therefore concluded that the PP had proved beyond a reasonable doubt that the appellant had penetrated [V]’s vagina with his penis (at [72]–[77]).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) As for whether there had been digital penetration, there was no factual dispute because the appellant admitted in his 7 May statement that he had inserted his finger into [V]’s vagina more than once. He did not retract that statement at trial (at [78]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 Second, on the issue of consent, the Judge found that the PP had proven beyond a reasonable doubt that [V] did not consent to either instance of penetration. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) It was clear to the Judge that the appellant had lied about having fallen asleep and woken up to find [V] drunk and naked (Conviction GD at [137]). The appellant testified that he panicked on seeing the police coming. But he would not have lied nor felt panic on seeing the police if he had indeed engaged in consensual sexual foreplay with [V] (at [138]). </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The evidence in its entirety suggested that, at the beach, [V] was in no condition to and did not actively engage in sexual foreplay (Conviction GD at [140]). </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Given the appellant’s vacillating evidence on the point, the Judge rejected his claim that he had asked [V] whether she wanted to have sex and that she had said ‘Yes’ (Conviction GD at [143]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 The Judge added that even if the appellant had asked [V] whether she wanted to have sex, and even if [V] had said yes, her response would have been vitiated by s 90(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the Penal Code (Conviction GD at [144]). Section 90(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) provides:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Consent given under fear or misconception, by person of unsound mind, etc., and by child</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">90</span>. A consent is not such a consent as is intended by any section of this Code —</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">b</span>)  if the consent is given by a person who, from unsoundness of mind, mental incapacity, <span class="font-italic">intoxication</span>, or the influence of any drug or other substance, is unable to understand the nature and consequence of that to which he gives his consent; or</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 Finally, the Judge rejected the appellant’s reliance on the defence of mistake of fact provided in s 79 of the Penal Code. Section 79 provides:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Act done by a person justified, or by mistake of fact believing himself justified by law</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">79.</span> Nothing is an offence which is done by any person who is justified by law, or who by reason of a mistake of fact and not by reason of a mistake of law in good faith believes himself to be justified by law, in doing it.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 In the Judge’s view, the appellant’s reliance on s 79 was misplaced. It was premised on there having been mutual sexual foreplay between the appellant and [V], but the Judge had already found that there was no such foreplay (Conviction GD at [146]).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Sentence</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 The Judge found, at [30] of the Sentence GD, that the rape of an intoxicated victim should be treated as falling “somewhere between Category 1 and 2” of the four categories set out in <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v NF </span>[2006] 4 SLR(R) 849 (“<span class="font-italic">NF</span>”). According to <span class="font-italic">NF</span>, an offence of rape falls in Category 1 if no aggravating or mitigating circumstances are present; the starting sentence is 10 years’ imprisonment and not less than 6 strokes of the cane (<span class="font-italic">NF </span>at [20], [24]). An offence of rape falls in Category 2 if any of a number of aggravating features are present, such as the offender being in a position of responsibility towards the victim, or the offender exploiting the victim’s physical frailty and/or mental impairment; the starting sentence is 15 years’ imprisonment and 12 strokes of the cane (<span class="font-italic">NF</span> at [20], [39]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 Having found that the rape offence committed by the appellant fell between Category 1 and 2, and taking into account the fact that there were no aggravating or mitigating factors in this case, the Judge concluded that an appropriate sentence for the rape offence would be 12 years’ imprisonment and six strokes of the cane. However, in view of the time the appellant had spent in remand from 13 January to 23 December 2014 before he was released on bail, the Judge reduced the imprisonment term to 11 years and 19 days. At this juncture, we should mention that the <span class="font-italic">NF</span> framework has since been reviewed and revised – we will revert to this point later (from [117] onwards).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 The Judge then found that the sentence for sexual assault by penetration should be the same as that for rape, for two reasons. We set out his holding in full:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">56   Like Tay J in <span class="font-italic">AUB</span> [<span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v AUB </span>[2015] SGHC 166], I am of the view that victims of sexual assault by penetration experience the same emotional scars as rape victims. Furthermore, the act of inserting one’s finger into a vagina is similar to that of inserting one’s penis into a vagina. It certainly is a grave violation of the victim. On the other hand, there are the risks of pregnancy and of contracting sexually transmitted diseases in the case of rape. <span class="font-italic">However, I doubt that such risks should give rise to any marked differentiation between the benchmark sentences for the two offences.</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">57   Moreover, I am of the view that the structure of ss 375 and 376 of the Penal Code suggests that both offences are considered to be of the same severity. Under s 375(1) read with s 375(2) of the Penal Code, rape is punishable with imprisonment for a term which may extend to 20 years and the accused is also liable to fine or to caning. Under s 376(2)(a) of the Penal Code, any accused who sexually penetrates with a part of his body (other than his penis) the vagina of another person without consent is liable to punishment under s 376(3) of the Penal Code with the same punishment as for rape.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">58   Therefore, I conclude that the punishment for the Accused for the offence of sexual assault by penetration should be the same as that for the rape offence.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">Thus, the Judge imposed the same sentence of 12 years’ imprisonment and six strokes of the cane for the digital penetration offence – this was similarly reduced to 11 years and 19 days’ imprisonment and six strokes of the cane after taking into account time spent in remand. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 The Judge ordered both sentences to run concurrently in view of the one-transaction rule (Sentence GD at [60]) – the effect of this rule is that where two or more offences are part of a “single transaction”, in that they are proximate in time and similar in nature or can be considered a single invasion of a legally protected interest, the sentences imposed for these offences should generally be ordered to run concurrently. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Threshold for appellate intervention</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 The role of the appellate court is not to reassess the evidence in the same way that a trial judge would (<span class="font-italic">Haliffie</span><span class="font-italic"> bin Mamat v Public Prosecutor and other appeals </span>[2016] 5 SLR 636 (“<span class="font-italic">Haliffie</span>”) at [31]). As we said in <span class="font-italic">Haliffie</span> at [32], an appellate court is restricted to considering:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) whether the judge’s assessment of witness credibility is plainly wrong or against the weight of evidence;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) whether the judge’s verdict is wrong in law and therefore unreasonable; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) whether the Judge’s decision is inconsistent with the material objective evidence on record, bearing in mind that an appellate court is in as good a position to assess the internal and external consistency of the witnesses’ evidence, and to draw the necessary inferences of fact from the circumstances of the case.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conviction</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 In the present appeal, the appellant does not challenge the Judge’s finding that he had penetrated [V]’s vagina with both his penis and his finger.

</div> The main question of fact in dispute is whether the Judge correctly found that [V] had not consented to the acts of penetration. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 Where sexual offences are concerned, a complainant’s testimony alone can constitute proof beyond reasonable doubt if it is so unusually convincing as to overcome any doubts that might arise from the lack of corroboration (<span class="font-italic">AOF v PP </span>[2012] 3 SLR 34 at [111]; <span class="font-italic">Haliffie</span> at [27]). If the evidence of the complainant is not unusually convincing, it would not be safe to convict the accused person unless there is further corroborative evidence (<span class="font-italic">Haliffie</span> at [30]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 As we understand it, the appellant has three key arguments. The first argument is that, because the Judge found that [V]’s testimony was not unusually convincing, it was necessary for there to have been corroborative evidence of the absence of consent; but there was no corroborative evidence here. The Judge’s finding that [V] did not consent was in fact inconsistent with the material evidence on record.

</div>
</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 We will take these three arguments in turn. Before doing so, we should first say that there is a significant degree of overlap between the first and the second arguments. At the hearing, we asked counsel for the PP, Mr David Khoo, whether the PP’s case was that [V] had no capacity to consent, or whether it was that [V] did not in fact consent. Mr Khoo’s response was as follows: (a) [V] did not in fact consent to the penetration, and (b) in the alternative, [V] was unable to and had no capacity to consent. We will hence deal with the parties’ arguments in that order although we stress that the findings on each argument cannot be seen in isolation from one another. The evidence that goes toward showing whether [V] did in fact consent will also bear on the question of whether [V] had the capacity to consent. Our views on the first argument will necessarily foreshadow our views on the second argument. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 It is possible in future cases to approach the matter in the reverse order. Indeed, it may even be more logical. Where the absence of consent is an element of an offence, and it is shown that the alleged victim was incapable of giving consent, then it would not matter whether she ostensibly did since such a consent would not be valid. That is the effect of s 90(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the Penal Code. If, however, the victim was not intoxicated to such a degree as to negate any ostensible consent she gave, the PP can still make out the offence by proving that, although capable of giving consent (in that the victim was intoxicated but still able to understand the nature and consequence of her acts), the victim did not in fact do so. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 This approach has been adopted in previous cases. For example, in<span class="font-italic"> Ong </span><span class="font-italic">Mingwee</span> <span class="font-italic">v Public Prosecutor </span>[2013] 1 SLR 1217 (“<span class="font-italic">Ong </span><span class="font-italic">Mingwee</span>”), Quentin Loh J’s approach was to determine, first, whether the victim was capable of consenting to sexual intercourse before determining whether she did in fact consent.

</div>
</div>
</div> </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) First, [V] said in oral testimony that she was not interested in talking to the appellant, but this was inconsistent with the extrinsic evidence, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, her behaviour from 11:20am to 1am that night which showed that she and the appellant had drunk together and even acted like a couple.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Second, based on the objective evidence, there could have been foreplay between 1am, when the appellant and [V] left the Wavehouse, and 2:25am, when Kason saw [V] trying to push the appellant away. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Third, the undisputed medical evidence of Dr Ravichandran (taken after the alleged offence) showed that [V] had no fresh vaginal tears.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">[V]’s behaviour towards the appellant</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 The appellant relies on the following evidence which showed that [V] was friendly towards and possibly flirting with him. This evidence was identified in a note which counsel for the appellant, Mr Paul Tan, submitted to us at the hearing of the appeal.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) First, the appellant and [V] were drinking together at the bar counter earlier on the night of 5 May 2012. The two photos taken at 12:15am showed that [V] was still fully conscious and was friendly towards the appellant. The evidence showed that [V] directed [S] to take the photos of her and the appellant. [V] went to the VIP area a few times but came back to the bar counter where the appellant was. Also, [V] allowed the appellant to pour alcohol directly into her mouth. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Second, one Teo Jie Wei, who was working as a part-time waiter at the Wavehouse that night, spotted the appellant and [V] to be “behaving like a couple” when they were about to leave the Wavehouse (See Conviction GD at [115]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 Having carefully scrutinised the evidence, we do not think it goes in any way towards showing that [V] had consented to sexual contact of any sort with the appellant. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 That [V] was sociable and friendly towards the appellant cannot mean that she consented to sexual activity with him. That conclusion would not change even if we assume in the appellant’s favour that [V] had gone beyond being friendly and flirted with him. According to the appellant, [V]’s supposed flirting was in the form of putting her hands on his arm or waist; he also relied on the photos which showed that, at least at those moments the photos were taken, the appellant and [V] were in close physical contact. These do not seem to be particularly suggestive gestures. We struggle to see how it could be suggested that they constituted her consent to any sort of sexual activity. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 Furthermore, and more crucially, the appellant’s argument fails to account for three other pertinent facts. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 First, [V] was also friendly, and in a sense was flirting, with [J], whom she kissed and hugged. This is relevant to Mr Tan’s argument that [V]’s recollection that she was “not interested” in the appellant was undermined by the evidence of her “flirting” with the appellant. This argument simply does not give sufficient regard to the party spirit of the occasion – a partygoer like [V] might just have been there to get to know as many people as possible without wanting to develop a serious interest in any particular person. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 Second, [V] had become more intoxicated after the photographs were taken. The appellant does not dispute this. In his own account, he said that he went up to her to offer to take her home because she was looking “tipsy” and he wanted to “make sure that she was okay” (see [32] above).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">71 Third, just before the appellant took [V] away from the bar counter to the beach, the latter had indicated her desire to go home as she herself realised that she was by then “way too drunk”. She said this in her testimony (see [18] above). Even in the appellant’s version of events, he had offered to take her home, and that was when she supposedly said “please take me away from all the guys”. That statement (assuming she did make it) is not inconsistent with her wanting to go home. The appellant’s testimony does not feature her saying anything about going to the beach. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">72 The question we then ask ourselves is whether, in light of (a) [V]’s general friendly disposition at the party, (b) her worsening inebriation, and (c) her express intention to return home, it was possible that [V] then decided to engage in consensual sexual activity on the beach with the appellant in spite of her being fairly intoxicated. Looking at the situation as a whole, the evidence relating to the earlier interaction between the appellant and [V] at the bar counter appears only remotely relevant to answering that question. More material to this analysis is what happened after [V] left the Wavehouse with the appellant for the beach. And what is critical is her state of intoxication at that time. These are matters which we will come to in the next section. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">73 As for Teo, all he saw was that the appellant had his hand around [V]’s waist. But his evidence is equivocal. In cross-examination, Teo candidly agreed that he could not see exactly what was going on between the appellant and [V], particularly since his vision was obstructed by the crowd around them.

</div> Teo’s evidence was before the Judge, who considered that little weight should be given to Teo’s account because it was lacking in detail (Conviction GD at [120]).

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">75 It is necessary and appropriate to consider the evidence relating to the period of time when the appellant and [V] were on the beach in two parts: (a) what happened from 1am to 2am and (b) what happened from 2am onwards. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">76 It is true that the only evidence on what happened from 1am to 2am came from the appellant and [V]. Kason only appeared on the scene at 2am. [S]’s phone calls could not safely be said to be probative of what happened between 1am and 2am either. During the hearing, we inquired of the parties if the timing of [S]’s phone calls to [V] was in evidence. It is significant that [V] did not answer when [S] called her the first time. It is even more significant that the appellant answered the call the second time around; one would have thought that he could easily have passed the phone over to [V]. But counsel for the PP, Mr David Khoo, informed us during the hearing that there was no time log of [S]’s phone calls because her phone was not put in evidence. Hence, it is not certain that [S] called [V] sometime between 1am and 2am. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">77  Mr Tan suggested that given the one hour they spent together, it was unlikely that the appellant would have been sexually assaulting [V] all that while. Given that the beach was a public area, he argued that if it were true that the appellant had taken advantage of [V], he would have quickly left her after the acts. Therefore, it was more likely than not that they had actually spent time making out. In a similar vein, Mr Tan said that it was “illogical” that the appellant did nothing to [V] for one hour from 1am until 2am, at which point Kason first spotted them. This seemed to be a suggestion that it would not have been in line with human behaviour for the appellant and [V] to have sat or laid on the beach and done nothing.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">78  What is clear is that [V] was already inebriated when she left the Wavehouse with the appellant. The Judge accepted [S]’s evidence that [V] looked really drunk before [S] left to collect [V]’s bag as suggested by the appellant, intending that [V] and the appellant would wait for her to return (at [127] of the Conviction GD). We have not heard any argument from the appellant that [S]’s testimony in this regard was not credible. The Judge found (at [140] of the Conviction GD) that all the evidence pointed to [V] being in no physical condition to engage in foreplay at the beach.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">79 Mr Tan’s submission is premised on [V] being in control of her faculties However, since it is undisputed that [V] left the Wavehouse with the appellant while significantly inebriated, and that [V] was found in a state of near-unconsciousness sometime later, one might also surmise – and we suggested this to Mr Tan during the hearing – that the appellant had done other sexual acts to [V] without her knowing and consenting. This is plausible bearing in mind [V]’s firm testimony that she could not remember anything about what happened after leaving the Wavehouse and only woke up to find herself on the beach in the midst of being penetrated. We are not saying that that is definitely what happened. The point here is that the only available evidence does not show what exactly occurred, and Mr Tan’s suggestion that there must have been consensual foreplay is but a speculation on his part. And once we factor in the level of intoxication of [V], Mr Tan’s speculation becomes less tenable; indeed, it is possible to make other speculations which are less favourable to the appellant. Hence, this submission does not, in our judgment, cast any reasonable doubt on the Judge’s finding that [V] could not and did not consent to any form of foreplay, much less the acts of penetration that followed.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">80 We will now move to consider the evidence relating to the period from 2am to 2:25am. It was at 2am that Kason first noticed the appellant and [V]. It is true that Kason was not alarmed enough to call the police after the first two occasions he saw the appellant and [V]. He assumed they were either making out or having sex consensually. Yet Kason felt it necessary to inform Terence, who then went to look for himself. Kason himself also went to take a third look. They both concluded that there was something distinctly strange about what they had seen. In Terence’s words, a half-naked person would not be lying in a fairly public area like the beach with another person when there were other people around.

</div> Hence, Mr Tan’s reliance on Kason and Terence’s evidence does not really assist him in showing that there was consensual foreplay between the appellant and [V]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">81 Finally, we should add that even the appellant’s own account of consensual foreplay is riddled with improbabilities and inconsistencies. We will take two examples which we had raised with Mr Tan during the hearing of this appeal. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">82 First, the appellant told the court during cross-examination that while they were making out on the beach, [V]<span class="font-italic"> </span>vomited several times, and that even after vomiting she continued kissing the appellant and even “came on” to him.

</div> We said to Mr Tan that we found this difficult to accept as a probable account of what happened. Mr Tan conceded, correctly in our view, that his client’s evidence was quite inculpatory in this respect. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">83 Second, when [V] was found by [S] in a state of undress, the appellant’s first response to [S] was to say that “he found [V] there lying completely naked”.

</div> If he and [V] had really been making out, one would have expected him to say that. Yet he did not. The inference to be drawn is that, as the Judge pointed out at [133] of the Conviction GD, he had a guilty conscience. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">84 Perhaps the appellant said what he did to [S] because he was in a state of panic or was embarrassed to let [S] know that he and [V] had had sex. Yet, even when Inspector Yap asked him, a few hours later, what had happened, he repeated the same story that he had fallen asleep and woken up to find [V] lying naked next to him. There was still no mention of he and [V] having made out. As the Judge noted at [138] of the Conviction GD, he would have had time to think about what happened and could have corrected himself if he had made a false statement inadvertently. He did not. And it is clear that his account of having fallen asleep cannot be true because Kason and Terence spotted him doing something to [V]. Hence he changed his story and said that there had been foreplay with [V]. The Judge found that the appellant had lied about there having been foreplay because he knew he had taken advantage of [V]. We have not found any reason to disagree with the Judge. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Medical evidence indicating lack of vaginal tearing</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">85 The appellant argues that the medical evidence strongly indicates that the penetrations were consensual.

</div> According to the appellant, Dr Ravichandran’s testimony establishes the following premises: First, vaginal tears may be caused by blunt penetration, such as by a finger or penis. Second, if there is penetration, there should be tearing unless there is vaginal lubrication. Third, vaginal lubrication only occurs when a female is aroused, and arousal shows willingness on the part of the female to have sexual intercourse. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">86 It follows, according to the appellant, that had [V] been unconscious during the acts of penetration, or an unwilling participant in any way, there would have been vaginal tearing. That there was no tearing means that there was vaginal lubrication and she was aroused. The lack of fresh tearing also undermines [V]’s testimony that she felt pain when the appellant tried to penetrate her; if there had been pain, there would have been vaginal tearing. The appellant says the Judge failed to address this incontrovertible medical evidence.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">87 The parts of Dr Ravichandran’s testimony that the appellant relies on emerged when he was asked about the statement in his medical report (see [39] above) that he found an “old tear over [her] hymen”.

First, such evidence would be neutral if [V] were not able to consent in the first place. That was indeed the case here. We have already said that she was, at the material time, intoxicated to the point where she was verging on unconsciousness. Indeed, Dr Ravichandran suggested that the absence of a fresh vaginal tear could still be consistent with there having been penile penetration if a victim had not put up any resistance. In fact, if there was no resistance, the chances of there being a vaginal tear (or any injury or bruising to the vagina, for that matter), was low. As Dr Ravichandran explained in re-examination:

As we highlighted during the hearing, it was possible that, since [V] was probably drifting in and out of consciousness, she would not have put up much resistance and there would be nothing to stop the appellant from penetrating her slowly. That could account for the lack of a fresh vaginal tear.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">90 Second, Dr Ravichandran only agreed with the appellant’s counsel, in cross-examination, that if a woman was aroused, it was “possible” that she was a “willing” participant in the sexual intercourse. The fact of arousal is thus not conclusive proof that a woman has given consent to sexual intercourse. The appellant’s case would appear to be that as there was no new tear, it meant that [V] was aroused and therefore she had consciously consented. If that was indeed his case, it was incumbent on him to establish the point in cross-examination. He did not. Further, as noted in the extract at [89] above, it appears that there would likely to be no new tear if there was no conscious physical resistance and [V] was certainly in no state to physically resist in view of her level of intoxication.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">91 The appellant also seizes on Dr Ravichandran’s finding that there were “no obvious evidence of recent external physical trauma or injuries” as indicating that [V] might have consented.

</div> Again, this presupposes that [V] was in a fully conscious, alert state when the appellant tried to penetrate her and might therefore have been expected to resist or put up a struggle.

</div>
</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">93 The question of whether a particular complainant is able or unable to consent is one of fact. Nevertheless, a few reminders of what a trial judge should look out for in making this determination may be worth highlighting. The PP drew our attention to <span class="font-italic">Iryan</span>, where, at [123], Tay J cited the following passage from <span class="font-italic">Ratanlal</span><span class="font-italic"> &amp; Dhirajlal’s Law of Crimes: A Commentary on the Indian Penal Code 1860 vol 2 </span>(CK Thakker &amp; M C Thakker eds) (Bharat Law House, 26th Ed, 2007) (“<span class="font-italic">Ratanlal</span>”):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… Consent on the part of a woman, as a defence to an allegation of rape, requires voluntary participation, not only after the exercise of intelligence, based on the knowledge of the significance and the moral quality of the act, but after having freely exercised a choice between resistance and assent… A woman is said to consent only when she freely agrees to submit herself, while in free and unconstrained possession of her physical and moral power to act in a power she wanted. Consent implies the exercise of free and untrammeled right to forbid or withhold what is being consented to; it is always a voluntary and conscious acceptance of what is proposed to be done by another and concurred in by the former. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">94 <span class="font-italic">Iryan</span> concerned s 376(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the Penal Code but the passage from <span class="font-italic">Ratanlal</span> was dealing with the offence of rape. Thus that passage is entirely applicable to the present case. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">95 <span class="font-italic">Iryan</span> was also a case where consent (to fellatio) was vitiated because of the complainant’s fear of injury. As regards the question of how intoxication affects the ability of a complainant to consent to sexual activity, we find helpful the following observations from <span class="font-italic">Rook &amp; Ward on Sexual Offences Law and Practice </span>(Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 5th Ed, 2016) at para 1.252, which were adapted from directions which the English Court of Appeal considered, in<span class="font-italic"> </span><span class="font-italic">R v Gael Tameu Kamki</span> [2013] EWCA Crim 2335, to have been correctly put to the jury:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(i)  If a person is asleep, or has lost consciousness through drink or drugs, they cannot consent (as there is no freedom and capacity to choose), and that is so even though their body responds to the defendant’s advances.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(ii) A person can still have the capacity to make a choice and have sex even where they have had a considerable amount to drink.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(iii)  Consumption of alcohol or drugs may cause someone to become disinhibited and behave differently from the way they would normally behave. If they are aware of what is happening, but the consumption of alcohol or drugs has caused them to consent to activity which they would ordinarily refuse, then they have consented no matter how much they may later regret it. The fact that a person makes an unwise choice does not mean that [he] lacked the capacity to make it. A drunken consent is still a consent, if a person has the capacity to make the decision whether to agree by choice.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(iv) However, a person may lose the capacity to consent through the consumption of drink or drugs before a complete loss of consciousness arises.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(v) Consideration then has to be given to the degree of consciousness or otherwise to determine the issue of capacity. Clearly a complainant will not have had the capacity to agree by choice where, due to intoxication through drink or drugs, their understanding and knowledge are so limited that they are not in a position to decide whether or not to agree.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(vi) Thus, if a complainant becomes so intoxicated that they no longer have the capacity to agree, there will be no consent. For instance, a person may be in a state where they know they do not want to take part in any sexual activity with someone, but they are incapable of saying so. Alternatively, they may have been affected to such a degree that, whilst having some limited awareness of what is happening, they are incapable of making any decision at all. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(vii)  If it is determined that the complainant may have had the capacity to make a choice, consideration will then have to be given whether she did or may have consented to sexual intercourse. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">96 We would identify the following as the relevant general principles: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Under s 90(<span class="font-italic">b</span>), a person who is unable to understand the nature and consequence of that to which that person has allegedly given his consent has no capacity to consent. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The fact that a complainant has drunk a substantial amount of alcohol, appears disinhibited, or behaves differently than usual, does not indicate lack of capacity to consent. Consent to sexual activity, even when made while intoxicated, is still consent as long as there is a voluntary and conscious acceptance of what is being done. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) A complainant who is unconscious obviously has no capacity to consent. But a complainant may have crossed the line into incapacity well before becoming unconscious, and whether that is the case is evidently a fact-sensitive inquiry. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) Capacity to consent requires the capacity to make decisions or choices. A person, though having limited awareness of what is happening, may have such impaired understanding or knowledge as to lack the ability to make any decisions, much less the particular decision whether to have sexual intercourse or engage in any sexual act. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) In our view, expert evidence – such as that showing the complainant’s blood alcohol level – may assist the court in determining whether the complainant had the capacity to consent. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">97 We turn now to address the appellant’s argument. It may have become apparent, from our discussion in the previous section on absence of consent, that we consider [V] to have been intoxicated to a degree that she was unable to give consent. Our conclusion is based on both (a) expert evidence of her blood alcohol level at the material time and (b) the objective circumstances.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">98 The expert evidence showed that, around the time of the offences, [V]’s blood alcohol level was high. We have mentioned Dr Wee Keng Poh’s calculation of [V]’s blood alcohol level at [42] above. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">99 The appellant places much emphasis on Dr Wee’s concession that the effect of blood alcohol content could vary from person to person. In Dr Wee’s words, “two persons may have the same blood alcohol content…with one walking down the street and another in deep coma”.

However, we cannot disregard the fact that her blood alcohol level was high. There was at least a possibility of “total mental confusion”.

</div>
</div> So it is imperative for us to consider Dr Wee’s assessment in determining whether [V] had the capacity to consent.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">101 We should highlight that in <span class="font-italic">Ong </span><span class="font-italic">Mingwee</span>, a similar calculation of the victim’s blood alcohol level was performed, which Quentin Loh J held to be “speculative and of limited value” (at [21]) because it had failed to take into account the fact that each individual had a unique rate of eliminating alcohol. We would note, however, that in <span class="font-italic">Ong </span><span class="font-italic">Mingwee</span>, the analyst had tried to assess the precise value of the victim’s blood alcohol level at a precise time (see [20]) whereas here Dr Wee has instead provided a range of possible values of the victim’s blood alcohol levels over two hours. Since the physical effects mentioned in his report would be manifested across the entire range of blood alcohol levels, his concession that the rate of elimination of alcohol could differ from person to person does not undermine his conclusion about [V]’s physical state at the time of the incident. Moreover, Dr Wee’s report was unopposed by the defence and not lacking in defensibility and a court should not lightly reject it and instead draw its own inferences: <span class="font-italic">Saeng</span><span class="font-italic">-Un Udom v Public Prosecutor</span> [2001] 2 SLR(R) 1 at [26]. During the hearing, Mr Tan agreed with our observation that the calculation of [V]’s blood alcohol level went unchallenged in the court below and was therefore a significant piece of evidence. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">102 In any event, Loh J’s point in <span class="font-italic">Ong </span><span class="font-italic">Mingwee</span> was simply that the contemporaneous evidence regarding the complainant’s behaviour must also be weighed in order to deduce her capacity to consent (at [22]). We agree entirely. As we have mentioned, expert evidence on a complainant’s blood alcohol level may assist in determining whether the complainant had the capacity to consent, but the question of capacity is ultimately a factual one and the expert evidence must be weighed in the balance together with the evidence of the objective circumstances.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">103 Here, the objective circumstances bear out Dr Wee’s assessment of [V]’s physical state. They show that [V]’s intoxication became more intense throughout the night and ended with her being almost unconscious (not to mention foaming at the mouth). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">104 It is fair to say that [V] was not yet heavily intoxicated when she was with [J]. The evidence of [J] was that she was “talkative, hyper”, would repeat sentences she had already said, but that she did not need support when walking and was able to dance alone.

</div> Lowered inhibition is not in and of itself indicative of a lack of capacity to consent. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">105 However, [V] was heavily intoxicated by the time she met up again with [S] and communicated her wish to go home. Before [V] left the Wavehouse with the appellant, there is evidence that she could not walk and could not stand up unassisted. [S]’s testimony was that [V] “couldn’t talk in full sentences”, had “droopy” eyes, “definitely could not stand by herself”, and was held up by the appellant who placed his hand under her armpit.

First, [V] vomited (while supposedly fellating the appellant), which would suggest a severe degree of intoxication consistent with the physical effects described by Dr Wee in his report (see [42] above). In fact, in cross-examination, the appellant agreed that [V] had vomited “several times” while they were making out.

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> The Judge noted that [S]’s evidence on this point was unchallenged (Conviction GD at [116]). It remains unchallenged before us. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">108 On the whole, the evidence as to [V]’s mental state immediately before, during and immediately after the time she was with the appellant at the beach suggests she was in no capacity to consent to penile or digital penetration. At the time she was found, she did not appear able even to execute basic physical functions such as walking or talking. It is highly likely that she was either unconscious or barely conscious during the period of time that she and the appellant were together on the beach. In our considered view, [V], when found, had at best a limited awareness of her surroundings. She was too intoxicated to understand the nature and consequences of giving consent. She could not have consented to either act of penetration by the appellant.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">109 We therefore reject the appellant’s argument on this front. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Mistake of fact</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">110 It remains for us to deal with the appellant’s argument that, contrary to the Judge’s finding, the defence under s 79 of the Penal Code was made out. The burden was on the appellant to establish this defence on a balance of probabilities (<span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor</span> <span class="font-italic">v Teo Eng Chan</span><span class="font-italic"> and others</span> [1987] SLR(R) 567 (“<span class="font-italic">Teo Eng Chan</span>”) at [26]). His burden was to show that “by reason of a mistake of fact” he “in good faith” believed himself to be justified by law in doing what he did to [V] – in other words, in believing that [V] consented to the two sexual acts forming the basis of the charges against him. Nothing is believed “in good faith” if it is believed “without due care and attention” (s 52 of the Penal Code). In <span class="font-italic">Teo Eng Chan</span>, P Coomaraswamy J held<span class="font-italic"> </span>(at [24]), after having referred to this section, that the position in Singapore was different from that in the UK. The position in the UK at that time was, following the House of Lords’ decision in <span class="font-italic">Director of Public Prosecutions v Morgan </span>[1976] AC 182, that a man could not be found guilty of rape if he honestly believed that a woman had consented, regardless of whether that belief was based on reasonable grounds. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">111 We agree with Coomaraswamy J’s holding. It follows that the inquiry under s 79 is not based purely on the actual belief of the appellant. The appellant has to persuade us that, having exercised due care and attention, he believed that [V] consented to the sexual acts forming the basis of the offences. That has to be determined by having regard to all the circumstances.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">112 The appellant relies on the totality of the following circumstances although it is not immediately apparent how they relate to each other:

</div></div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) [V] was flirting with the appellant;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) There is sufficient objective and medical evidence of a significant period of foreplay between [V] and the appellant, from which one could infer that [V] was a willing and consenting participant to sex; </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) The appellant too had been drinking; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) The appellant was only 23 years old at the time, 3 years older than [V]. All in all, the appellant’s acts should be characterised as misjudgment on a young person’s part, not predatory conduct.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">113 In <span class="font-italic">Ong </span><span class="font-italic">Mingwee</span>, Loh J found (at [78]) that the defence of mistake of fact had been made out. The complainant boarded a taxi with the accused, kissed him on the way to his flat, did not attempt to leave his bedroom, did not protest when they had sexual intercourse and did not attempt to push him off or away, and apparently nodded when asked whether she wanted to have sex. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">114 The facts here are starkly different. As we have said, even if [V] was flirting with the appellant, that does not mean she led him to believe that she would consent to digital or penile penetration. Second, we have also rejected the appellant’s account of there being foreplay. That leaves the points about the appellant’s own intoxication and the small age gap between him and [V]. The appellant appeared to be relying on these two points (together with the two points we have rejected) to suggest that these led him to hold the subjective belief that [V] was consenting to penile and digital penetration. However, it was still necessary for him to show that he had arrived at this belief after having exercised due care and attention. He had not attempted to show he had exercised due care and attention in arriving at his belief. On the contrary, it was clear to us that the appellant had tried to take advantage of [V] due to her intoxicated state. We therefore have no hesitation in rejecting the appellant’s attempt to rely on s 79 of the Penal Code.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Conclusion on the issue of conviction </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">115 In our opinion, the state of [V]’s intoxication; the fact that the appellant took [V] to the beach by asking [S] to go and take [V]’s handbag from the bar counter and did not wait for [S] to return; the fact that the calls made by [S] to [V]’s mobile went unanswered except once when the appellant answered and yet did not pass the phone over to [V], instead telling [S] not to come over to where they were; the untruths which the appellant uttered to [S] (when [S] saw him and [V] together on the beach) and to Inspector Yap a little later that morning, all clearly point to the following conclusion. In taking [V] in her inebriated state to the beach without informing [S] or waiting for her to return, the appellant intended to take advantage of [V]. While the appellant and [V] were on the beach, he penetrated her vagina with his finger and his penis when she was in no capacity to consent to such penetrations. Whatever else happened between them before those acts of penetration, we do not know for sure, but in view of [V]’s serious intoxication, it could not have been consensual foreplay. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">116 In the circumstances, we affirm the Judge’s findings that (a) [V] did not consent to digital or penile penetration by the appellant, (b) [V] was in any event incapable of giving consent because of her intoxication, pursuant to s 90(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the Penal Code, and (c) the appellant has not succeeded in proving the defence of mistake of fact under s 79 of the Penal Code. The appellant’s conviction on both charges therefore stands.

</div> The PP does concede, however, that mildly intoxicated victims may not be physically or mentally impaired and thus not vulnerable.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">126 We agree with the PP for two reasons. First, approaching the matter in the abstract, we see no basis for distinguishing between a victim who is vulnerable because of a permanent characteristic and one who is vulnerable because of a temporary condition – for example, one who is physically frail because of a sprained ankle or mentally impaired because of heavy intoxication. The latter might also become targets because they are less able to fend off the offender’s sexual advances in the moment of the offence. A permanent condition may make a victim more vulnerable because it may afford the offender an opportunity for a more sustained course of sexual assault. This is the case with young victims: consider <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v BNN </span>[2014] SGHC 7, where the offender was the stepfather of the victim and abused her over three years, his abuses growing in intensity and perversion (see <span class="font-italic">Terence Ng</span> at [54(d)]). A victim with only a temporary disability or impairment may be less likely to be subjected to such a course of sexual assault, but it does not mean she is not vulnerable on the single occasion on which she is assaulted. The essential feature of this aggravating factor is that its existence makes it easier for the offender to commit the rape of the victim. The offender who targets an intoxicated victim exploits the same advantage. The intoxicated victim might be physically weak or suffer lapses in consciousness, and thus would be, in the Judge’s words, in “less of a condition to resist any sexual assault” (Sentence GD at [28]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">127 Second, as a matter of case authority, it is well recognised that an intoxicated victim is in a position of vulnerability in relation to a sexual offender, and that this factor in turn aggravates the offence. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">128 The appellant is not correct in saying that there are several local cases that “do not consider intoxication <span class="font-italic">per se</span> as an aggravating factor”.

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> The four cases he has cited in support are equivocal on this point as it was not in fact argued: the appeal in <span class="font-italic">Seow </span><span class="font-italic">Choon Meng v Public Prosecutor </span>[1994] 2 SLR(R) 338 was concerned with the admissibility of statements and did not discuss the applicable sentencing principles; <span class="font-italic">Rizal bin Abdul </span><span class="font-italic">Razak v PP </span>[2000] SGHC 148 was an appeal only against conviction; <span class="font-italic">V </span><span class="font-italic">Murugesan v PP </span>[2006] 1 SLR(R) 388 concerned an appeal against sentence but the main question there concerned the ordering of sentences to run consecutively; and finally, in <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v Muhammad </span><span class="font-italic">Fadly bin Abdull Wahab</span> [2016] SGHC 160 the PP had submitted there that there had been an exploitation of a particularly vulnerable victim (an intoxicated one), but the High Court judge did not address this argument. Thus, none of the cases cited by the appellant considered, much less rejected, the intoxication of the victim as an offence-specific aggravating factor. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">129 As against this, there are two cases which explicitly recognised that a sexual offence was aggravated if it involved an intoxicated victim. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">130 The first case is <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v Ong Jack Hong </span>[2016] 5 SLR 166 where Sundaresh Menon CJ held that the fact that a victim was drunk and vulnerable was “by itself, sufficient to aggravate the offence [of sexual penetration of a minor]” (at [18]). Menon CJ categorically stated that the victim’s intoxication was an aggravating feature of the offence (at [18]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…the Respondent was in control of the situation over the victim, who was in a drunk and vulnerable state and who was carried to the scene and then turned around into the position by the Respondent for him to do what he then proceeded to do. This, to my mind, is a factor that makes the offence graver because the Respondent was effectively in control throughout the entire episode. While I accept Ms Ng’s submission that the victim was neither unconscious nor wholly without control of her faculties, this does not materially advance the Respondent’s case because the fact that she was drunk and vulnerable is, by itself, sufficient to aggravate the offence.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">If it is an aggravating factor to exploit, for one’s sexual gratification, a victim who is “neither unconscious nor wholly without control of her faculties”, it must be more aggravating to exploit a victim who is nearly unconscious and is without control of her faculties – as [V] was. The offender would have greater control over a near-comatose victim. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">131 The second case is <span class="font-italic">Haliffie</span>. This court, in <span class="font-italic">Terence Ng</span>, regarded it as falling within Band 1, and observed that the “offender had taken advantage of the fact that the victim was inebriated (though not unconscious), but there were otherwise no other offence-specific aggravating factors of note” (at [52]). In other words, this court recognised that taking advantage of an inebriated victim is an offence-specific aggravating factor, but because it was the only such factor in <span class="font-italic">Haliffie</span>, the case was not so severe as to fall into Band 2 (which requires two or more offence-specific aggravating factors). Although the court did not say what offence-specific aggravating factor was disclosed in that case, in the circumstances, it was clearly a case of “rape of a vulnerable victim”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">132 However, we do accept that intoxication of the victim may not always be treated as an offence-specific aggravating factor. Whether this must be so depends very much on how intoxicated the victim was. The PP acknowledges, rightly, that there are degrees of intoxication. Thus, there cannot be a rule that an intoxicated victim is always a vulnerable one. Only a victim who is so intoxicated as to lost control over her ability to respond to or resist sexual advances is vulnerable. The greater the loss of control, the greater the vulnerability. Here, as we have found at [108], [V] was severely intoxicated and had no control over even basic motor movements. She was definitely a vulnerable victim and the appellant exploited that to his advantage. Therefore, this offence-specific aggravating factor is present in the instant case.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The appellant did not act out of premeditation</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">133 The PP characterises the appellant’s offence as premeditated because he separated [V] from her friends and took her away from the Wavehouse to the beach when she was in no position to resist his moves.

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> We are unable to agree. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">134 The Court in <span class="font-italic">Terence Ng</span> mentioned, as examples of premeditation, the use of drugs or soporifics to reduce a victim’s resistance, predatory behaviour such as sexual grooming, or the taking of deliberate steps towards the isolation of the victim such as by arranging to meet at a secluded area under false pretences (at [44(c)]). These examples reflect a high degree of deliberation and planning. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">135 Here, by contrast, the appellant had not deliberately offered drugs or soporifics to [V] and had only met her for the first time at the party at the Wavehouse. We agree with the Judge’s assessment (at [35] of the Sentence GD) that the fact that the appellant plied [V] with alcohol had to be seen in the context of the party that they were there for. The appellant had offered drinks to others, and [V] had also accepted drinks from other people. It would not be fair to say that the appellant was targeting [V] specifically with the intention of getting her drunk. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">136 It is true that the appellant might have distracted [S] by asking her to retrieve [V]’s bag so that he could take [V] away without [S] tagging along. But in the circumstances of the present case, as we have mentioned, what happened appears to us to be a case of an offender seizing an opportunity rather than having acted in a calculated manner. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">137 This is all the more so when we compare the appellant’s behaviour with the kind of sexual offences that our courts have characterised as being premeditated. To take but a few recent examples:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) In <span class="font-italic">Ng Jun Xian v Public Prosecutor </span>[2017] 3 SLR 933 (“<span class="font-italic">Ng Jun Xian</span>”), the victim wanted to return to the hostel she was staying at. The offender persuaded her to rest at a hotel and he reassured her that she would be left alone and allowed to sleep. After bringing the victim to the hotel room, he took the opportunity to sexually assault her. See Kee Oon JC (as he then was) observed that there was premeditation because the offender had “sought to set the stage by sending the victim to the hotel despite her initial reluctance and he took the opportunity when it presented itself to commit the sexual assault” (at [42]). </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) In <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v Lee Ah Choy </span>[2016] 4 SLR 1300, the offender observed the victim for a period of time and came to understand her morning routine. He took the victim to a HDB block and even brought along a paper-cutter which he used to threaten her. Hoo Sheau Peng JC observed that this “demonstrated his resolve to see his plan through to completion” and that he did not commit the offence on the spur of the moment (at [51]). </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) In <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v </span><span class="font-italic">Sim Wei Liang Benjamin</span> [2016] SGHC 240, the accused had used the internet with the clear intention of ensnaring his victims and luring them to engage in sexual activities with him (at [30]). This court noted in <span class="font-italic">Terence Ng</span> that the offender had acted in a “predatory manner” (at [55]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">138 These examples show that the kind of premeditation which the law regards as aggravating an offence involves a significant degree of planning and orchestration. The appellant’s acts did not really involve any pre-planning. Before their meeting on that fateful day, they were strangers to each other. It appears to us that the appellant’s moves that night were hatched on the spur of the moment.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Application to the facts</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">139 In our judgment, there is only one offence-specific aggravating factor in this case. In this regard, the appellant is right to draw an analogy between this case and <span class="font-italic">Haliffie</span>. As mentioned earlier, there was only one offence-specific aggravating factor in that case – taking advantage of a vulnerable victim. That said, the appellant’s suggestion that the present case should fall within the lower range of Band 1 is unsustainable in view of the clear direction from this court in <span class="font-italic">Terence Ng</span> that the presence of one aggravating factor places a case within the middle to upper range of Band 1 (at [50]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">140 The sentencing range of Band 1 is 10–13 years’ imprisonment with 6 strokes of the cane. If the sentence is to be at the higher end of the range, the indicative sentence would be 12 or 13 years’ imprisonment and 6 strokes of the cane. Given that range, the Judge’s sentence of 12 years’ imprisonment and 6 strokes of the cane for the rape charge cannot be said to be manifestly excessive. Given the lack of any significant mitigating factors, as the Judge found (see [52] above), there is also no scope for reducing the appellant’s sentence. Thus, applying the <span class="font-italic">Terence Ng</span> framework, we do not see any basis for interfering with the sentence imposed by the Judge for the rape charge. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Sexual assault by penetration</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">141 We now turn to the sentence for the digital penetration charge. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">142 The appellant has not make any submission on the impact of <span class="font-italic">Terence Ng </span>on the sentence for the digital penetration charge. The PP has. The PP argues that the sentencing framework applicable to rape offences should be the same as that for sexual assault by penetration offences;

</div> that foreign jurisdictions such as New South Wales, Australia, and the UK make no distinction between sentencing for both types of offences; and that it is unprofitable to rank different sexual offences according to severity, with rape at the apex of the hierarchy.

</div> Applying that approach, the PP submits that the appropriate starting sentence for the digital penetration charge was 13 years’ imprisonment and 12 strokes of the cane – this was based on its submission that the sentence for the rape charge should fall within the lower half of Band 2 (a submission which we have rejected). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">143 The PP relies on cases from New South Wales which caution against treating rape as objectively more serious than sexual assault by penetration. For example, in <span class="font-italic">R v </span><span class="font-italic">Hibberd </span>[2009] NSWCCA 20, the Court of Criminal Appeal of New South Wales observed (<span class="font-italic">per </span>Tobias JA):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">19 … I consider there to be a danger in adopting, at least in the case of sexual assault upon an adult, a general proposition that an act of digital penetration, without more, is less serious than an act of penile penetration, without more. The problem is that it is never "without more". True it is that penile penetration, contrasted with digital penetration, may carry risks to a female adult victim such as pregnancy or sexually transmitted disease. On the other hand, digital penetration has the potential to cause more physical damage than penile penetration. These are some of the many factors which are required to be taken into account when determining the objective seriousness of the offending act and the point on the scale of seriousness where that act should be placed.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">21 In my respectful view the time has come for this Court to depart from any prima facie assumption, let alone general proposition, that digital sexual intercourse is to be regarded as generally less serious than penile sexual intercourse. If one was to accept such a proposition, then it may well be appropriate to also assert that forced vaginal penetration in some of its more gross forms is likely to be more serious than penile penetration. As the objective seriousness of the offence is wholly dependent on the facts and circumstances of the particular case ... any resort to prima facie assertions that one form of penetration is likely to be or generally will be more serious than another, is to be avoided. It can, in my view, only lead a sentencing judge to erroneously attribute more weight to the general proposition or assumption than the particular facts of the case.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">144 Similar observations about the unprofitability of ranking sexual offences according to their seriousness were made in <span class="font-italic">R v AJP</span> [2004] NSWCCA 434 at [24]–[25]; <span class="font-italic">Doe v Regina</span> [2013] NSWCCA 248 at [54]; and <span class="font-italic">Simpson v R</span> [2014] NSWCCA 232 at [33]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">145 The PP also cites a UK Sentencing Council consultation paper published in 2012.

</div>
</div> The Council noted (at 31) that “the means of penetration, whether it be penile, another body part, or object, may not in every case make a difference to the victim as the violation incurred by the victim is as severe”. Thus, its position was that there was no justification for any difference in sentencing between rape and sexual assault by penetration. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">146 We note that the PP’s submissions here was made before See JC in <span class="font-italic">Ng Jun Xian</span>. The PP relies on the same authorities – cases from New South Wales and the UK Sentencing Council guidelines (see [58]–[61] of <span class="font-italic">Ng Jun Xian</span>). But the PP’s submissions there were pitched slightly differently. As See JC noted, the PP was not seeking to equate the benchmark sentences for rape and sexual assault by penetration; the PP had, after all, asked for a starting point of eight years’ imprisonment and six strokes of the cane for the latter offence when the starting point for rape (until <span class="font-italic">Terence Ng</span>) was 10 years’ imprisonment and six strokes of the cane (at [62]). Rather, the PP was only suggesting that a court should be slow to assume that the offence of sexual penetration is always a less severe offence than that of rape, and to that extent, See JC agreed. See JC then suggested that the appropriate benchmark sentence for the offence of digital penetration was in the region of eight years’ imprisonment and six strokes of the cane (at [67]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">147 The PP now submits that the digital penetration offence here fell within Band 2 of the <span class="font-italic">Terence Ng</span> framework and should have attracted the same starting point of 13 years’ imprisonment and 12 strokes of the cane.

</div>
</div> This goes further than its submission in <span class="font-italic">Ng Jun Xian</span> that the benchmark sentence for sexual assault by penetration ought to be close to, but not identical with, that for rape.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">148 In this case, the Judge also found that the sentences for the rape charge and digital penetration offence ought to be the same. As we observed at [53], he took this view for two reasons. First, victims of sexual assault by penetration experience the same emotional scars as rape victims; the act of inserting a finger into a victim’s vagina is as grave a violation as inserting a penis. Second, the fact that those who are convicted under s 375 of the Penal Code and those convicted under s 376(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) are both liable to be punished to the same extent suggests that both offences should be considered to be of the same severity.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The benchmark sentences for rape and digital penetration should not be equated</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">149 With respect, we are unable to agree with the PP or the Judge. We reach this conclusion for six reasons. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">150 First, at the highest level of abstraction, there is an intelligible difference between penile penetration of the vagina and digital penetration of the vagina. There are at least two reasons for this. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) One, penile penetration carries the risk of unwanted pregnancy and of transmitting sexual diseases. The cases and authorities all recognise this as a relevant consideration even if they regard it as insufficient to justify a differentiation in benchmark sentences (see the Sentence GD at [56]; <span class="font-italic">R v </span><span class="font-italic">Hibberd </span>at [19], and the UK Sentencing Council’s guideline at p 29). It cannot be denied that an unwanted pregnancy and contracting a sexually-transmitted disease would have far-reaching consequences for the victim. The knowledge that she would be at risk of becoming pregnant or contracting a sexually-transmitted disease would itself inflict an extra level of trauma on the victim. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Two, penile penetration is a more intimate act than digital penetration. The abuse of such an act therefore represents a greater degree of intrusion into the sexual autonomy of the victim. Also, an offender derives more gratification from penile penetration than digital penetration. There is therefore a greater degree of exploitation by the offender of the victim. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">151 Second, as a matter of case law, our courts have always said that rape is generally regarded as “the most grave of all the sexual offences” (see <span class="font-italic">Chia Kim Heng Frederick </span>v <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor</span> [1992] 1 SLR(R) 63 at [9]). This court in that case quoted a passage from a Criminal Law Revision Committee which it felt was consonant with its views: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Rape involves a severe degree of emotional and psychological trauma. It may be described as a violation which in effect obliterated the personality of the victim. Its physical consequences equally are severe: the actual physical harm occasioned by the act of intercourse; associated violence or force and in some cases degradation; after the event, quite apart from the woman’s continuing insecurity, the fear of venereal disease or pregnancy. We do not believe this latter fear should be underestimated, because abortion would usually be available. This is not a choice open to all women and it is not a welcome consequence for any. Rape is also particularly unpleasant because it involves such intimate proximity between the offender and victim. We also attach importance to the point that the crime of rape involves abuse of an act which can be a fundamental means of expressing love for another, and to which as a society we attach considerable value.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">152 In <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v BMD</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>[2013] SGHC 235 (“<span class="font-italic">BMD</span>”), the accused was convicted of a number of sexual offences which included rape and sexual assault by penetration. In meting out the sentences for each charge,<span class="font-italic"> </span>Tay J found that the offence for rape deserved the highest sentence because penile vaginal penetration would be “the most heinous” among the categories of offences listed in the charges. This would be followed by fellatio, penile-anal penetration and finally digital-anal penetration (at [73]). There was clearly a distinction made between penile-vaginal penetration and other forms of penetration. On appeal, this court found no basis for disturbing any of the sentences (see <span class="font-italic">BMD v Public Prosecutor </span>[2015] SGCA 70).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">153 Third, we are unable to agree with the Judge that because the maximum punishment for the offence of rape and sexual assault by penetration is the same, the offences are therefore of equal severity. We agree with See JC’s observation at [65] of <span class="font-italic">Ng Jun Xian</span> that s 376(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) criminalises a range of conduct involving penetration without consent, and that the identical statutory punishment range for both that offence and that of rape does not suggest that the punishments for both must always be the same. That would be inconsistent with the point just mentioned that courts have regarded rape as the most grave of sexual offences. Hence, in <span class="font-italic">BMD</span>, Tay J, having observed (at [73]) that “although the maximum punishment provided for [the offences of rape and sexual assault by penetration] is the same”, nonetheless imposed different sentences according to the severity of each offence, with the highest sentence being imposed for the offence of rape. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">154 Fourth, the Judge relied (at [56] of the Sentence GD) on Tay J’s statement in <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v AUB </span>[2015] SGHC 166 that victims of sexual assault by penetration experience the same emotional scars as rape victims, but it is not clear that Tay J went so far as to say that the sentence for rape should be the same as that of sexual assault by penetration. There, the accused was charged with sexual assault by digital penetration under s 376(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>). The victim was his biological daughter. The PP there submitted that the case was “analogous to a Category 2 rape as formulated in <span class="font-italic">PP v NF</span>” (at [9]). Under the <span class="font-italic">NF </span>framework, this would have attracted a starting sentence of 15 years’ imprisonment (see [51] above). Tay J did note that the accused exploited a position of trust (at [11]) – which is an aggravating factor – but he did not appear to use a starting sentence based on Category 2 Rape. Instead Tay J noted that the case precedents showed that imprisonment terms from 9 to 12 years with 12 to 16 strokes of the cane had been imposed (at [13]) and he eventually imposed a sentence of 12 years’ imprisonment and 12 strokes of the cane on the accused. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">155 Fifth – turning now to the position in foreign jurisdictions – we think the cases from New South Wales which the PP relies on are not entirely inconsistent with our views. The courts there were dealing with the appropriate sentences for individual offences. When dealing with these individual offences, the courts stressed that it would be facile to assume that a sexual offence was less serious just because it involved digital rather than penile penetration; they emphasised the need to look at the circumstances in which the offence was committed. That is undoubtedly correct. In some cases, the circumstances in which digital penetration is committed can make the offence even more severe than rape, due to the presence of other aggravating factors. In <span class="font-italic">R v </span><span class="font-italic">Hibberd</span>, for example, the digital penetration, of an eight-month pregnant woman, was accompanied by abusive and degrading language, and even urination on the victim. In <span class="font-italic">Simpson v R</span>, the offender used digital penetration to humiliate the victim, this was shown by his “contemptuous wiping of his fingers on [her] face” which was intended to “degrade and humiliate her” (at [33]). The courts were therefore emphasising that a judge should not immediately mete out a lower sentence just because the offence is digital penetration. Nothing in our law would be inconsistent with that. Although the <span class="font-italic">benchmark</span> sentence should be lower, to reflect the difference in the type of sexual offence involved, it is possible that a significant aggravating factor (such as intense humiliation of the victim) could increase the starting sentence for digital penetration by so much that it would be on par with, or even higher than, a sentence for a rape offence involving no aggravating factors (that is, falling within Band 1 of <span class="font-italic">Terence Ng</span>). If the proposition established by the Australian cases is that the court must ultimately look at all the facts of a case in assessing how serious a particular offence of digital penetration is, we agree entirely.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">156 Sixth, we think the sentencing position set out by the UK Sentencing Council must be understood in context. That position could have been influenced by clear Parliamentary recognition that the offence of sexual assault by penetration of the vagina (by whatever means) was as serious as an offence involving penile penetration. The equivalent offence for sexual assault by penetration is s 2 of the Sexual Offences Act 2003 (c 42) (UK). The Minister moving the Sexual Offences Bill which introduced that section, Lord Falconer of Thoroton, noted that the offence in s 2 covers cases where “a person forcibly inserts his hands or fist into a woman’s vagina”, and that such penetration was “extremely serious offending behaviour that can inflict as much, if not more, pain and physical damage on a victim as penile penetration and is likely to result in similar psychological trauma” (<span class="font-italic">Hansard</span>, HL Vol 646, col 1186 (April 1, 2003). Short of similar Parliamentary intention in our context, we would be slow to upset a fairly well-established line of authority in our jurisprudence which establishes that rape is the gravest of all sexual offences and should generally attract a higher starting sentence. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">157 For these reasons, we hold that there is an intelligible and defensible distinction to be drawn, in terms of offence severity, between rape and digital penetration. The benchmark sentences should not, therefore, be equated.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The same aggravating factors in </span>Terence Ng<span class="font-italic"> should apply to the offence of digital penetration</span><span class="font-italic"> </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">158 Having said that, we do recognise the logic of the PP’s suggestion that the <span class="font-italic">Terence Ng</span> framework should be transposed to the offence of digital penetration. Many of the offence-specific aggravating factors listed in <span class="font-italic">Terence Ng </span>(such as premeditation, abuse of a position of trust, special infliction of trauma) may also be present and pertinent in offences involving digital penetration. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">159 It follows that there should also be three sentencing bands for the offence of sexual penetration of the vagina using a finger, though the range of starting sentence for each band should be lower to reflect the lesser gravity of the offence. The sentencing bands should be as follows: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Band 1: 7 to 10 years’ imprisonment and 4 strokes of the cane; </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Band 2: 10 to 15 years’ imprisonment and 8 strokes of the cane; </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Band 3: 15 to 20 years’ imprisonment and 12 strokes of the cane.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">As for whether these three bands should similarly apply where the penetration of the vagina was done with the use of any other thing other than a finger, we shall leave that issue to be decided on another occasion where a case on point should arise<span style="color: rgba(31,73,125,1)">.</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">160 In formulating these bands, we have been conscious that where the offence of sexual assault by penetration discloses any of the two statutory aggravating factors in s 376(4) of the Penal Code – <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, where there is use of actual or threatened violence (s 376(4)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)) or where the offence is committed against a person under 14 years of age (s 376(4)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>)) – there is a prescribed minimum sentence of 8 years’ imprisonment and 12 strokes of the cane. These cases should fall within Band 2 (or even Band 3 if there are additional aggravating factors). We said the same in <span class="font-italic">Terence Ng</span> in relation to the identical statutory aggravating factors for rape (under s 375(3) of the Penal Code): we considered these statutory aggravating factors to be part of the list of offence-specific aggravating factors to consider in determining which sentencing band a particular offence falls under (at [44(d)] and [44(f)]) and that where any of the statutory aggravating factors are present, the case would almost invariably fall within Band 2 (<span class="font-italic">Terence Ng </span>at [53]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">161 We have also been conscious of the possible relevance of these proposed bands to s 376A of the Penal Code, which criminalises the sexual penetration of a minor under the age of 16, regardless of whether the minor consented. In January this year, this court issued its judgment in <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor</span><span class="font-italic"> v BAB</span> [2017] 1 SLR 292 (“<span class="font-italic">BAB</span>”), which concerned an appeal involving s 376A. In that case, an adult female, who suffered from Gender Dysphoria, was eventually convicted on the following charges involving a young female victim:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) two charges under s 376A(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) punishable under s 376A(3), for penetration of the victim’s vagina with a dildo when the latter was under 14 years old; </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b)  two charges under s 376A(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) punishable under s 376A(2), for penetration of the victim’s vagina with a dildo when the latter was under 16 years old; </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) two charges under s 376A(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) punishable under s 376A(2), for digital penetration of the victim’s vagina when the latter was under 16 years old; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) one charge under s 7(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the Children and Young Persons Act Cap 38, 2001 Rev Ed) (“CYPA”), for kissing the victim on the lips and licking her breasts and nipples when the victim was under 14 years old.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">At [65] of that judgment, this court set out the following sentencing ranges:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">65        With this background, we consider that the appropriate starting points, having regard to the gravity of the offence, the applicable sentencing range and the factor of abuse of trust but not yet considering the elements of proportionality and the mitigating factors that we have just outlined, to be as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(a) For offences punishable under s 376A(2), where there is an element of abuse of trust, we consider that the starting point will be a term of imprisonment of three years and this would apply for each of the offences under this section in this case;</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(b) For the offences punishable under s 376A(3), again where there is an element of abuse of trust, we consider that the starting point will be a term of           imprisonment of between ten and 12 years. On the facts of this case, we think a term of 11 years would in principle be appropriate as a starting point. It must also be remembered that s 376A(3), unlike s 376A(2), provides for caning as well. That is irrelevant here because female offenders cannot be caned under the law. However, the court may impose an additional term of imprisonment of not more than 12                                    months in lieu of caning under s 325(2) of the CPC.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(c) For the offence under s 7(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the CYPA, we think a term of imprisonment of one year would be appropriate.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">162 Sections 376 and 376A of the Penal Code have a lot in common and overlap in scope in some situations. The two main differences are that the latter section deals with sexual penetration offences against minors under 16 years of age, for which the consent of the minor is irrelevant. The court in <span class="font-italic">BAB</span> did not discuss caning, which was an available punishment in s 376A(3), because the accused there was a female.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">163 In the light of what we have set out at [159], the starting point of 3 years’ imprisonment for a s 376A(2) offence in <span class="font-italic">BAB</span> may now look rather lenient when compared to the 7 to 10 years’ imprisonment range in Band 1 for a s 376 offence. However, it must be remembered that s 376A(2) prescribes a maximum sentencing range of 10 years or fine or both (with no caning) whereas s 376(3), the applicable provision in this appeal, provides for a maximum punishment of 20 years’ imprisonment and a liability to fine or to caning. Bearing that in mind, the question of whether the starting point of 3 years’ imprisonment for s 376A(2) cases proposed in <span class="font-italic">BAB</span> should be tweaked, and if so how, will have to be addressed on another occasion.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">164 On the other hand, it is clear that the starting point of between 10 and 12 years’ imprisonment for s 376A(3) offences (involving victims below 14 years in age) may need to be reviewed in the light of what we have said at [159] and [160] above because this sub-section has the same sentencing range as s 376(3), that is, a maximum imprisonment term of 20 years and liability to fine or to caning. In a future case involving digital penetration of the vagina which falls within s 376A(3), the court will have to decide on the appropriate sentence after considering what we have set out at [159] and [160] above. In addition, we must also note one other difference: unlike s 376(4)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>), there is no minimum imprisonment term and no mandatory caning in s 376A(3).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">165 We will now consider where the precedents for offences under s 376 involving digital penetration fit within our sentencing bands. We do this purely for the purpose of illustration. It would be invidious for us to comment on the correctness of the sentences actually meted out in those cases. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">166 In our opinion, the following are examples of Band 2 cases. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) First, <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v GBA (B1) and BAV (B2)</span> [2015] SGDC 168 (“<span class="font-italic">GBA</span>”). The district judge' imposed a sentence of 6 years’ imprisonment and 5 strokes of the cane on the offender (GBA) who faced a sexual assault by penetration charge. On appeal, the sentence for that charge was enhanced to 8 years’ imprisonment and 6 strokes of the cane. There were two offence-specific aggravating factors here. First, the victim was vulnerable because she had passed out from drinking alcohol and was unconscious while the sexual assault took place. Second, the offence was premeditated. The High Court judge did not agree with the district judge’s finding that the accused had acted opportunistically; although there was no pre-arranged plan to ply the victims with drinks, there was still, in his view, “obvious premeditation on their part in committing the offences over a sustained duration”.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Second, <span class="font-italic">Ng Jun Xian</span>. As already mentioned at [137(a)], there was premeditation in this case. An additional offence-specific aggravating factor was that the sexual assault was violent. See JC described it as “serious, violent and prolonged” (at [38]). The victim suffered a number of injuries including “several bruises on her hands, face, arms and legs”, bruises on her cheek and a chipped tooth (see [12] and [14]). See JC imposed a sentence of 8 years and 6 months’ imprisonment and 6 strokes of the cane. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">167 A case which could conceivably fall within Band 3 is <span class="font-italic">PP v </span><span class="font-italic">Azuar bin Ahamad</span> [2014] SGHC 149 (“<span class="font-italic">Azuar</span>”). In <span class="font-italic">Terence Ng</span> we considered this case as falling within Band 3 of the framework for rape offences (at [58(b)]). We would similarly consider this a Band 3 offence for sexual assault by penetration as well. The offender pleaded guilty to three charges of rape and one charge of sexual assault by penetration using the finger. The High Court sentenced him to 12 years and 6 months’ imprisonment and 12 strokes of the cane for each charge. There were easily at least two aggravating factors in that case. First, the assaults were premeditated: the accused spiked the victim’s drink. He drugged them with Dormicum, a stupefying date rape drug which caused the victims to lose consciousness (at [110]). He had also created a false online persona and used lies to get them to meet him at a location of his preference (at [111]). Second, the victims were also vulnerable because they were unconscious when he committed the assaults. Overlaying these two factors was the consideration that the accused was assessed by psychiatrists to pose a risk of serious sexual harm to the public (at [126]). Indeed, he committed 33 distinct offences over 14½ months of which 22 were sexual in nature. There were multiple victims – each of the four proceeded sexual offences charges were against a different victim. His was a particularly egregious case which places it within Band 3. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">168 A somewhat anomalous case is <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v </span><span class="font-italic">Koh Nai Hock </span>[2016] SGDC 48 (“<span class="font-italic">Koh</span><span class="font-italic"> Nai Hock</span>”). The accused held himself out as an alternative medicine practitioner and penetrated the victim’s anus and vagina on the pretext of treating her for infertility. He faced 14 charges under s 376(2) of the Penal Code; 7 were for digital-vaginal penetration and 7 for digital-anal penetration. The district judge meted out sentences of 2 years’ imprisonment for each individual charge (save for one charge involving digital-vaginal penetration where the accused had not worn a glove when he inserted his finger unlike on previous occasions). She ordered the sentences for 3 charges to run consecutively, resulting in a global sentence of 7 years’ imprisonment. The accused’s appeal against sentence was dismissed by the High Court. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">169 We consider <span class="font-italic">Koh</span><span class="font-italic"> Nai Hock</span> a Band 1 case. The only aggravating there was arguably “abuse of position and breach of trust” since the accused had held himself out as a medical practitioner to gain the victim’s trust, which he then violated. The individual sentences of 2 to 3 years would be some distance from our sentencing bands. We do note, however, that the global sentence was 7 years’ imprisonment (no caning was imposed as the accused over 60 years of age). Hence, broadly speaking, this case is still somewhat consistent with the Band 1 sentencing range we have proposed, although we would caution against relying on it as a precedent for individual sentences in future. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">170 It will be observed also that the actual sentences imposed in <span class="font-italic">GBA, Ng Jun Xian</span>, and <span class="font-italic">Azuar</span>, which we have placed in Band 2 and Band 3, are lower than the minimum sentence we have specified for the respective sentencing bands. As we said at [165], it is not for us to say whether the sentences in those cases were too low. It is not appropriate for us to consider the sentences in those cases <span class="font-italic">de </span><span class="font-italic">novo</span>. Those sentences were arrived at after consideration of all sentencing factors, including mitigating factors, whereas we have only sought to identify the offence-specific aggravating features of those cases. Thus, we should not be taken to be saying that the sentences in <span class="font-italic">GBA, Ng Jun Xian</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>and <span class="font-italic">Azuar</span> are no longer of any precedential value. But those sentences now fall outside the sentencing bands we have indicated and should not as a rule be relied upon. Hence, in future, a judge who is minded to give a similar sentence as was given in those cases, thus departing from the sentencing bands, must set out “clear and coherent reasons” for doing so (<span class="font-italic">Terence Ng</span> at [62]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">171 We also reiterate – and clarify – the point we made in <span class="font-italic">Terence Ng</span> at [73(d)]: where the offender faces two or more charges and the court is required to run two or more sentences consecutively, a court may if necessary calibrate the individual sentences downwards to ensure that the aggregate sentence is not excessive. If this is done, the individual sentences may fall outside the prescribed range for each sentencing band, and it is important that the court expressly says that it has adjusted the individual sentences in this way so that those adjusted individual sentences are not relied upon in future cases. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Application to the facts</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">172 Applying these sentencing bands to the present appeal, we find that the appellant’s sentence for the digital penetration charge –12 years’ imprisonment and 6 strokes of the cane – is too high and should be reduced. The indicative starting sentence should also be in the middle to upper range of Band 1 given the presence of the one offence-specific aggravating factor – which is that the appellant exploited the vulnerability of [V], who was intoxicated. That would give an indicative sentence of 8 to 9 years’ imprisonment and 4 strokes of the cane. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">173 In our view, an appropriate sentence would be 8 years and 6 months’ imprisonment and 4 strokes of the cane. After taking into account the period of remand, the sentence would be reduced to 7 years, 6 months and 19 days’ imprisonment and 4 strokes of the cane. As the sentences for the rape offence and the digital penetration offence were ordered to run concurrently, the aggregate sentence would be 11 years and 19 days’ imprisonment and 10 strokes of the cane (rather than 12 strokes of the cane). </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">174 In conclusion, we find no basis to disturb the Judge’s conviction of the appellant for the offence of rape under s 375(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>), punishable under s 375(2), and for the offence of sexual assault by penetration under s 376(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) and punishable under s 376(3). The appeal against conviction is therefore dismissed.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">175 We dismiss the appeal against sentence for the rape charge. We allow the appeal against sentence in respect of the digital penetration charge to the extent explained at [172]–[173]. Like the Judge, we order both sentences of imprisonment to run concurrently. The result, therefore, is that the total imprisonment term remains at 11 years and 19 days and the total number of strokes of caning is reduced from 12 to 10.</div><div class="Judg-Sign text-left">Sundaresh Menon     Chao Hick Tin      Andrew Phang Boon Leong<br/>Chief Justice      Judge of Appeal      Judge of Appeal</div><div class="Judg-Sign text-left">Judith Prakash      Tay Yong Kwang<br/>Judge of Appeal     Judge of Appeal</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Paul Tan, Zhuang WenXiong and Arthi Anbalagan (Rajah &amp; Tann Singapore LLP) for the appellant;<br/>David Khoo, Sharmila Sripathy, Kavita Uthrapathy and Sarah Shi (Attorney-General’s Chambers) for the respondent.</div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>

the offence of rape under s 375 of the Penal Code, the Public Prosecutor (“PP”)
bore the burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that (a) the appellant had
penetrated the vagina of [V] with his penis; and (b) this was without her
consent. The Judge found that the PP had proven both these elements of the
offence beyond a reasonable doubt. </span></p>

</span></span><!--[endif]--><span lang="EN-GB">The appellant made three
arguments on appeal. First, although the appellant did not </span><span lang="EN-US" style="mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">challenge the Judge’s finding that
he had penetrated [V]’s vagina with both his penis and his finger</span><span lang="EN-GB">, he</span><span lang="EN-US" style="mso-ansi-language: EN-US;"> argued
that the Judge’s finding that [V] did not consent was inconsistent with the
material evidence on record.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm; mso-list: l16 level1 lfo16;"><!--[if !supportLists]--><span lang="EN-GB" style="mso-list: Ignore;">12<span style="font: 7pt/normal 'Times New Roman'; font-size-adjust: none; font-stretch: normal;">               
</span></span><!--[endif]--><span lang="EN-US" style="mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">The
Court of Appeal rejected this argument. The evidence relied on by the appellant
did not assist him. The evidence relating to the interaction between the
appellant and [V] at the bar counter was only remotely relevant to determining
whether [V] had decided to engage in consensual sexual activity on the beach
with the appellant in spite of her being fairly intoxicated ([<strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">72</strong>]). The fact that there was no
evidence of what happened between 1am and 2am apart from the appellant’s and
[V]’s account of events did not mean that [V] and the appellant must have been
engaging in consensual foreplay. This was but a speculation which became less
tenable once one factored in [V]’s level of intoxication ([<strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">79</strong>]). The medical evidence showing an absence of a fresh tear on
[V]’s vagina was a neutral factor given that [V] was intoxicated to the point
where she was verging on unconsciousness and could not put up any resistance ([<strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">89</strong>]). </span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm; mso-list: l16 level1 lfo16;"><!--[if !supportLists]--><span lang="EN-GB" style="mso-list: Ignore;">13<span style="font: 7pt/normal 'Times New Roman'; font-size-adjust: none; font-stretch: normal;">               
</span></span><!--[endif]--><span lang="EN-GB">The appellant’s second argument
related to the Judge’s finding that even if the appellant had asked [V] whether
she wanted to have sex, and even if [V] had said yes, her response would have
been vitiated by s 90(<em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">b</em>) of the Penal
Code. Section 90(<em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">b</em>) says that consent
given by a person who, from intoxication, is unable </span><span lang="EN-US" style="mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">to understand the nature and consequence of
that to which he gives his consent, is not valid consent. The appellant argued
the Judge was wrong to have found that [V] was incapable of giving consent due
to her intoxication. </span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm; mso-list: l16 level1 lfo16;"><!--[if !supportLists]--><span lang="EN-GB" style="mso-list: Ignore;">14<span style="font: 7pt/normal 'Times New Roman'; font-size-adjust: none; font-stretch: normal;">               
</span></span><!--[endif]--><span lang="EN-US" style="mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">The
Court rejected this argument. The evidence as to [V]’s mental state immediately
before, during and immediately after the time she was with the appellant at the
beach suggested that she was in no capacity to consent to penile or digital
penetration. She was too intoxicated to understand the nature and consequences
of giving consent. She could not have consented to either act of penetration by
the appellant ([<strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">108</strong>]). </span></p>

</span></span><!--[endif]--><span lang="EN-US" style="mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">The
appellant’s third argument related to the Judge’s rejection of the appellant’s
reliance on the defence of mistake of fact in s 79 of the Penal Code. Section
79 says that nothing is an offence if done by a person who, by reason of a
mistake of fact, in good faith believes himself to be justified by law in doing
it. According to s 52 of the Penal Code, nothing is believed “in good faith” if
it is believed “without due care and attention” [<strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">110</strong>]. </span></p>

</span></span><!--[endif]--><span lang="EN-US" style="mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">The
Court was not persuaded that, even if the appellant believed, mistakenly, that
[V] was consenting to penile and digital penetration, he had arrived at this
belief after having exercised due care and attention ([<strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">114</strong>]). </span></p>

anticipation that the revised framework in <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">Terence

the Judge against the appellant, the Court invited parties to make specific

rape ([<strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">121</strong>]). Rape falls within Band
1 if there are no offence-specific aggravating factors or if they are present
only to a very limited extent; it falls within Band 2 if there are two or more
offence-specific aggravating factors ([<strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">122</strong>]).
The appellant argued that the present case fell within Band 1 because there was
no offence-specific aggravating factor (<strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">[123</strong>]).
The PP argued that the present case fell within Band 2 because there were two
offence-specific aggravating factors, namely the vulnerability of [V] due to
her intoxication and the fact that the appellant had acted with premeditation
([<strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">124</strong>]). </span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm; mso-list: l16 level1 lfo16;"><!--[if !supportLists]--><span lang="EN-GB" style="mso-list: Ignore;">20<span style="font: 7pt/normal 'Times New Roman'; font-size-adjust: none; font-stretch: normal;">               
</span></span><!--[endif]--><span lang="EN-GB">The Court found that there was
only one offence-specific aggravating factor here: the vulnerability of the
victim. </span><span lang="EN-US" style="mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">[V] was
severely intoxicated and had no control over even basic motor movements. She
was a vulnerable victim and the appellant exploited that to his advantage ([<strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">132</strong>]). However, the Court did not think
the appellant’s acts were premeditated; rather, his moves were hatched on the
spur of the moment ([<strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">138</strong>]). Since
the presence of one offence-specific aggravating factor would place a case
within the middle to upper range of Band 1 ([<strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">139]</strong>), the indicative sentence here would be 12 or 13 years’
imprisonment and 6 strokes of the cane. Given that range, the Judge’s sentence
of 12 years’ imprisonment and 6 strokes of the cane for the rape charge was not
manifestly excessive ([<strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">140</strong>]). </span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm; mso-list: l16 level1 lfo16;"><!--[if !supportLists]--><span lang="EN-GB" style="mso-list: Ignore;">21<span style="font: 7pt/normal 'Times New Roman'; font-size-adjust: none; font-stretch: normal;">               
</span></span><!--[endif]--><span lang="EN-GB">As for the offence of sexual
assault by digital penetration, the Court disagreed with the PP’s submission
that the same sentencing bands for rape as set out in <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">Terence Ng</em> should apply. Among other reasons, this was because, in
the Court’s view, there is an intelligible difference between penile
penetration of the vagina and digital penetration of it. First, p</span><span lang="EN-US" style="mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">enile penetration carries the risk
of unwanted pregnancy and of transmitting sexual diseases which would have
far-reaching consequences for the victim. Second, penile penetration is a more
intimate act than digital penetration; the abuse of such an act therefore
represents a greater degree of intrusion into the sexual autonomy of the victim
and a greater degree of exploitation by the offender of the victim ([<strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">150</strong>]). </span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm; mso-list: l16 level1 lfo16;"><!--[if !supportLists]--><span lang="EN-US" style="mso-list: Ignore; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">22<span style="font: 7pt/normal 'Times New Roman'; font-size-adjust: none; font-stretch: normal;">               
</span></span><!--[endif]--><span lang="EN-US" style="mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">Nonetheless,
the Court recognised the logic of the PP’s submission that the <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">Terence Ng</em> framework should be
transposed to the offence of digital penetration, because many of the
offence-specific aggravating factors for rape may also be present and pertinent
in offences involving digital penetration ([<strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">158</strong>]). However, the range of starting sentence for each band should
be lower to reflect the lesser gravity of the offence ([<strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">159</strong>]). The Court therefore held that the sentencing bands should be
as follows: </span></p>

these sentencing bands to the present appeal, the Court found that the
appellant’s sentence for the digital penetration charge was too high and should
be reduced. The indicative starting sentence was also in the middle to upper
range of Band 1 given the presence of the one offence-specific aggravating
factor, which is that the appellant exploited the vulnerability of [V], who was
intoxicated. That gave an indicative sentence of either 8 to 9 years’
imprisonment and 4 strokes of the cane</span></a><span lang="EN-US" style="mso-ansi-language: EN-US;"> ([<strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">172</strong>]).
The Court found that an appropriate sentence would be 8 years and six months’ imprisonment
and 4 strokes of the cane. After taking into account the period of remand, the
sentence was reduced to 7 years six months and 19 days’ imprisonment and 4
strokes of the cane ([<strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">173</strong>]).</span></p>

at 11 years and 19 days and the total number of strokes of caning was reduced
