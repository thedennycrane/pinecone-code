On 25 January 2016, after signing PB1, Sita asked Rosalind to prepare a letter to inform Tan of the share benefits that he would continue to be entitled to after 31 January 2016. As Tan was the first employee to work past retirement age who had been granted share awards under the RSP, Sita asked Rosalind to check with Angeline on the suitable language to address Tan’s Share Awards.

Pertinently, Angeline’s Draft included what was essentially Para 4 of the SB Letter, but without the Clause. Sita attested that this was the first time the phrasing of Para 4 of the SB Letter came about. Sita did not question Angeline on whether the RC had assented to the matters as reflected in Angeline’s Draft. This would have been within her knowledge given that she attended RC meetings and took minutes as the company secretary.

Sita accepted Tan’s word as Tan had been with Venture for many years and in charge of HR.

</div> But the evidence showed otherwise.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 A few days after the Advisor Contract was signed, Wong and Sita signed PB1 to approve Tan’s Share Benefits be “restore[d]”. PB1 stated that Tan’s “reason for leaving” was his retirement. It also stated that his “official last day of employment” was 31 January 2016 and that this was an “event” under rule 7.3 of the ESOS Rules which must, in Tan’s case, be an event either under rule 7.3(b) as Tan “ceases” to be employed by Venture, or under rule 7.3(d) as “any other event approved by the [RC]”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 In approving the restoration of Tan’s Share Benefits (upon Tan becoming Advisor), I find that Wong and Sita had partly relied on their authority under the Resolution (which pertained to share options), which is engaged only where an employee “ceases” to be in Venture’s employ (see [44] above). I disbelieve that Wong did not sign PB1 pursuant to the Resolution, or that he signed it because Tan wanted to know his outstanding share benefits and Sita needed Wong’s approval to release the information to Tan. As Tan was Venture’s President and HR reported to him, he could have checked directly with HR or Sita. Indeed, Wong admitted that it was unnecessary to obtain his approval to release the information to Tan, and that he signed PB1 to approve the Share Benefits to continue to accrue to Tan.

Sita presented a table of these employees, which included Tan whose Share Benefits were mentioned and which were stated to have been “restored” with the “reason for restoration” being Tan’s “retirement”. These were recorded in the minutes of meeting under the heading “Exceptions granted under [Venture’s] share schemes”.

This was similar for two other employees, Edward Kow (“Kow”) and Han Jok Kwang (“Han”), who were also re-hired the day after they retired.

</div> Tan’s change of position in court supports my finding that the SB Letter was not in existence on 20 January 2016. It would have been odd for Sita to hand to Tan an unsigned copy of the SB Letter on 20 January 2016, if that was Venture’s offer (and representation) to Tan regarding the Share Benefits.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Contents of SB Letter</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 Next, the contents of the SB Letter suggest that it could not have been handed to Tan on <span class="font-italic">20 </span>January 2016, as it set out a table showing his entitlement to the Share Benefits accrued “as of <span class="font-italic">25 </span>January 2016”. I accept Sita’s explanation that the letter was created only after 25 January 2016, because on 20 January 2016 no one could have predicted Tan’s accrued share benefits on a future date, and that Tan could in the interim (between 20 and 25 January) exercise part of his entitlement which would have made the table in the SB Letter inaccurate.

This is corroborated by Rosalind who attested that she had extracted the information on Tan’s Share Benefits as she prepared the draft on 25 January 2016.

He readily admitted that he was wrong to have issued the SB Letter with the Clause in the SB Letter; and he explained that he was then a fairly new employee in Venture and he trusted Angeline who had drafted the wording of Para 4 of the SB Letter and the Clause as she was the head of Legal and the company secretary who attended the RC meetings.

</div> I inferred that this was because Tan knew that Wong did not know of the SB Letter as at 20 January 2016 (because it did not then exist and Tan knew that no such copy was handed to him on that date); knew that a draft of the SB Letter came about only after he had signed the Advisor Contract (see [31] above); and knew that the RC had never made the Purported Determination (see further at [80] to [81] below). I find that Tan had attempted to deal with Sita hoping that Sita/CHRO could resolve the matter, knowing that what was stated in the Clause in the SB Letter was never agreed with Wong as a term of his re-employment and he had on his own told Sita to include such a term. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">79 My above finding is reinforced by Tan’s conduct after the 24/5/17 Meeting. Apart from the email from Tan to Koh on 18 July 2017 that showed that Tan had mentioned the SB Letter to Koh and Wong at the 24/5/17 Meeting, Tan was careful not to raise the SB Letter in subsequent correspondence with them. Instead, on 4 August 2017 and in Tan’s 18/8/17 Email, Tan chose to rely on the fact that he was still Venture’s representative in China to appeal to Venture to reconsider its position on his Share Benefits.

</div> Tan’s explanation that he was attempting to take a “conciliatory” approach by not mentioning the SB Letter and wanting to avoid legal proceedings is unconvincing – it is unclear why he could not have reminded Wong and Koh of the SB Letter as part of his conciliatory approach, if the basis of his entitlement to the Share Benefits rests on Para 4 of the SB Letter. By this time, he was already being advised by lawyers.

</div> At the 23/2/16 RC Meeting, the RC had only been updated of the CEO/CHRO’s approval to restore Tan’s accrued Share Benefits when he became Advisor (see<span style="color: rgba(255,0,0,1)"> </span>[58] above). The Resolution was also not engaged when Tan ceased to be in Venture’s employ by reason of his Resignation Notice, and PB1 did not go so far as to approve Tan’s Share Benefits to accrue even after he resigned as Advisor and ceased employment with Venture completely. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">81 I further find that Tan knew that the RC did not make the Purported Determination and he also could not rely on the Resolution for this purpose. Tan had informed Sita that Wong said he could retain his share benefits upon retirement and re-employment (see [12] above). As Sita attested, when he handed to Tan Angeline’s Draft, he informed Tan that his Share Benefits would lapse when he resigned as Advisor. Hence, Tan knew at that time that the RC had not made any determination for Tan to retain his Share Benefits if he ceased to be Advisor and left Venture. Tan thus rejected Angeline’s Draft. As I had found, Tan then unilaterally instructed Sita to include a term in his re-employment contract for his Share Benefits to continue to accrue even after he ceased re-employment as Advisor. In effect, it was Tan who procured from his subordinates (Sita and Angeline) the insertion of a term as reflected in the Clause in the SB Letter, contrary to his agreement with Wong on his re-employment terms. That Tan knew, when he signed the SB Letter, that the RC had not made the Purported Determination, is reinforced by his subsequent conduct of attempting to deal with Sita (rather than with Wong or Koh) to resolve the matter; his reluctance to raise the SB Letter with Wong and Koh when he was told that he could not keep the accrued Share Benefits upon his resignation; and his reluctance to state (until late in the day) that it was Sita who had purportedly handed the SB Letter to him on 20 January 2016.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Miscellaneous issues</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">82 I deal with some miscellaneous issues raised in relation to when the SB Letter was handed to Tan.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">83 Whilst both parties had called digital forensics experts to opine on when the SB Letter could have first been created, I found their evidence unhelpful.

</div> as the Addendum could be read in this manner. The Advisor Contract states that by signing the contract, Tan accepted “the terms and conditions as set out herein and in the Addendum”. Wong had acted on his agreement as he signed PB1 shortly after Tan signed the Advisor Contract; and Sita followed through with an update at the 23/2/16 RC Meeting of the decision to restore Tan’s Share Benefits. Whilst it is arguable that Wong and Sita were not empowered under the Resolution to deal with share<span class="font-italic"> awards</span>, Venture had adopted this position of restoring Tan’s Share Benefits by its conduct (via Wong’s agreement with Tan, by Wong signing PB1, and then an update to the RC which the RC did not dispute). Hence, it was not necessarily the case that the SB Letter must have been given to Tan with the Advisor Contract to supplement his re-employment terms pertaining to the Share Benefits. Even without the SB Letter, Venture has maintained that Tan’s Share Benefits continued to accrue to him when he became Advisor. On the contrary, the Clause in the SB Letter went beyond what Wong had agreed with Tan for his re-employment and was procured by Tan on his own volition without Wong’s knowledge or agreement.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">88 Further, if Tan had received the SB Letter on 20 January 2016 with the RC having made the determinations as in Para 4 of the SB Letter, it would have been unnecessary for Wong and Sita to <span class="font-italic">subsequently </span>and <span class="font-italic">additionally</span> sign PB1 to restore Tan’s Share Benefits on his re-employment.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">89 Kow’s and Han’s cases do not support that Tan must have received the SB Letter together with the Advisor Contract.

</div> I find that Sita had misunderstood the effect of such a document.

Tan cannot rely on the Clause in the SB Letter to claim his Share Benefits when he tendered the Resignation Notice. Rule 7.2 of the ESOS Rules and rule 6.2 of the RSP Rules state that an employee is deemed to have ceased to be employed as of the date of notice of termination tendered by or given to him and any share option or award, to the extent unexercised or unreleased, would immediately lapse.

Tan started work as Advisor before he received the SB Letter and thus no consideration was given for the benefit (as per the Purported Determination and Clause in the SB Letter). In <span class="font-italic">Offshoreworks</span>, the Court of Appeal (at [40]) held:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… what is crucial is the nexus between the act said to be consideration and the promise, and that the later act must be causally linked to the earlier promise. Therefore, the court’s inquiry is whether, at the time of the earlier act, a later promise was contemplated or required. If so, that connects the earlier act to the subsequent promise and establishes that they are part of the same transaction … the courts look to the substance rather than the form of the transaction. Hence, what looks at first blush like past consideration will still pass legal muster if there is, in effect, a single (contemporaneous) transaction (the common understanding of the parties being that consideration would indeed be furnished at the time the promisor made his or her promise to the promisee) …</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">97 There was no such nexus here. There was no contemplation by Venture or Tan of any other promise to Tan, when Tan signed the Advisor Contract and commenced work as Advisor, particularly that his Share Benefits would continue to accrue <span class="font-italic">when he ceased to be Advisor </span><span class="font-italic">or ceased employment with Venture completely</span>. This is clear even from Tan’s evidence of what was agreed with Wong for Tan’s re-employment, and which agreement was finalised before Tan received the Advisor Contract. Indeed, there is no evidence that <span class="font-italic">such a term</span><span class="font-italic"> (as per the Clause in the SB Letter) was a term of Tan’s contract even as President </span>(see [48] above). When Tan signed the Advisor Contract, there was no contemplation of an additional document to be prepared to set out any other contractual term or promise pertaining to Tan’s Share Benefits. Wong stated that all the terms of Tan’s re-employment including the retention of his Share Benefits were encapsulated in the Advisor Contract and Addendum, and which I had accepted. I reiterate my findings at [87] above.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">98 Hence, even if Tan received the SB Letter after he started work as Advisor, it and particularly the Clause in the SB Letter would be unenforceable for lack of consideration. I reiterate that Kow’s and Han’s cases do not assist Tan. Kow’s Letter did not contain any term over and beyond what Venture had agreed to. Han’s Letter was superseded by another letter where Sita informed Han that the representation that his share benefits would continue to accrue on cessation of his re-employment was incorrect, and which Han had accepted.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">99 Likewise, the case of <span class="font-italic">R1 International Pte Ltd v Lonstroff AG</span> [2015] 1 SLR 521 which Tan relies on,

As for the tort of negligent misstatement, the plaintiff must show the existence of a duty of care, and for such a duty of care to arise, it is necessary to show a special relationship between the parties (<span class="font-italic">Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken AB (Publ), Singapore Branch v Asia Pacific Breweries (Singapore) Pte Ltd and another and another suit</span> [2009] 4 SLR(R) 788 at [215]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">102 To reiterate, I found that Wong and the RC did not make the Representation at any time, and Tan knew this. Further, for there to be ostensible authority, there must be a representation by the principal (Venture) to Tan as to Sita’s authority (<span class="font-italic">Tribune Investment Trust Inc v Soosan Trading Co Ltd</span> [2000] 2 SLR(R) 407 at [48]; <span class="font-italic">Armagas Ltd v Mundogas SA </span>[1986] 1 AC 717 at 777). Venture did not authorise Sita to represent to Tan that the Share Benefits would continue to accrue even after cessation of his re-employment as Advisor, nor represent to Tan that Sita had authority to make such representation. I also find that Tan would have known this and would have known that Sita had no such authority to do so. Tan agreed that Sita had no authority of his own to decide or inform Tan of what share benefits Tan was entitled to. Tan agreed that only Wong could determine his terms of re-employment. Tan claimed that he merely assumed that Sita was “probably verbally instructed” by Wong to issue the SB Letter containing the Representation, which I disbelieve.

In a claim for equitable unilateral mistake, constructive knowledge with an element of impropriety (“sharp practice” or “unconscionable conduct”) as opposed to actual knowledge is sufficient.

Sita had issued the SB Letter containing the Purported Determination, when the RC had not made the Purported Determination. This was a sufficiently important or fundamental mistake as to a term dealing with a Purported Determination made on Tan’s Share Benefits. Tan knew of this mistake, because he had instructed Sita to insert a term to enable him to retain his Share Benefits even when he ceased to be Advisor. He had conveyed to Sita and Angeline something different from what was agreed with Wong, and he knew that the CHRO/Sita had no authority of his own to come up with additional terms of his re-employment as Advisor (see <span class="font-italic">Chwee Kin Keong and others v Digilandmall.com Pte Ltd</span> [2005] 1 SLR(R) 502 at [35]).

He instructed Sita to add in a term to the SB Letter to retain his Share Benefits even when he ceased to be Advisor, well-knowing that this was never agreed with Wong. He did not bring to Venture’s attention that the Clause in the SB Letter was a mistake when he knew that what was contained therein was not correct.

He had falsely misrepresented to Venture that he was entitled to exercise the Share Option for 50,000 shares under Grant 8 when he submitted the Option Forms, knowing that his Share Benefits had lapsed on tendering the Resignation Notice. The “Note” in the Option Form clearly stated rule 7.2(b) of the ESOS Rules and that any share option granted would lapse and cannot be exercised if the employee ceased to be employed by Venture with such cessation taking place when he gives notice of resignation. Based on my earlier findings, Tan could not rely on the Clause in the SB Letter, knowing that Venture never made the Representation and that it was he who had procured a term as found in that Clause. Hence, Tan could not have honestly or genuinely believed in the truth of his representation to Venture that he was entitled to exercise the Share Option under Grant 8.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">120 Mr Rajah SC submits that Venture did not issue the 50,000 shares in reliance on Tan’s representations as they did not play a real or substantial part in the mind of Venture’s employees when Venture issued the shares. Instead, Venture issued the shares after checking its own records that Tan was entitled to exercise the option. Rosalind attested that she had checked a spreadsheet pertaining to Tan’s share benefits to see if they existed and were valid before she forwarded the Option Forms to Sita to check and approve the Forms.

Venture’s employees would have relied on the Option Forms that Tan submitted, which Forms contained the “Note” (see [119] above) and a clause stating that the employee agrees to subscribe to the shares subject to the terms of Venture’s offer letter and the ESOS, and which Tan had signed off on.

Likewise, more likely than not, Sita had relied on the Option Forms that Tan submitted, and with knowledge of the Clause in the SB Letter in mind (which Clause was procured by Tan). When Tan submitted the Option Forms for the 50,000 shares, the veracity of the SB Letter was not yet in question because Wong/Koh did not then know of its existence and the RC had yet to meet and determine that Tan’s Share Benefits that had lapsed (by virtue of the Resignation Notice) would not be restored.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">125 Finally, I find that Venture had suffered damage when it released the 50,000 shares to Tan. When an employee exercises a share option, Venture would have to obtain the shares from somewhere and at its cost. As Wong attested, Venture has been deprived of the 50,000 shares that Tan wrongfully took, and if they are returned, Venture would keep them in the treasury which it could use to award to other employees under the RSP.

Hence, the inquiry of the unjust factor of failure of consideration or basis has two parts: first, what was the basis for the transfer in respect of which restitution is sought; and second, whether that basis has failed (<span class="font-italic">Simpson Marine (SEA) Pte Ltd v Jiacipto Jiaravanon</span> [2019] 1 SLR 696 at [48]–[49]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">127 I find that Venture succeeds in its claim for unjust enrichment.

When he tendered the Resignation Notice, the Share Benefits lapsed and Tan could not rely on the Clause in the SB Letter to show otherwise. I find also that there are no applicable defences that Tan can rely on.

Mr Singh SC submits that the loss suffered by Venture for a claim under s 2(1) of the Misrepresentation Act and for breaches of duty of good faith and fidelity are the same as the losses being claimed for breach of contract and fraudulent misrepresentation; and the damages it claims for Tan’s breach of fiduciary duties are essentially the same as those for its claim for unjust enrichment.

Alternatively, he can elect to recover reliance loss, to put him in a position as if the contract had never been entered into in the first place. Both measures of damages are compensatory and based on the victim’s loss. The purpose of damages for tortious misrepresentation is to put the victim into a position in which he would have been if the misrepresentation had not been made.

</div> Venture did not plead nor attest to any such dividends, let alone the quantum of the dividends, that were paid. The payment of dividends by Venture is within Venture’s knowledge. As such I would disregard this submission.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">134 I turn to deal with the valuation date of the shares. The date of the transaction is the <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> date of valuation, as the measure of the loss that is suffered, but this rule can be departed from to give effect to the overriding compensatory rule (see <span class="font-italic">Smith New Court Securities Ltd v </span><span class="font-italic">Citibank N.A.</span> [1997] AC 254 at 284, in relation to a case for fraudulent misrepresentation). I accept that if damages were assessed based on the time when the wrongful act occurred, this may not adequately compensate Venture for the loss it has suffered <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">if </span>Venture had to subsequently acquire substitute shares from the market at the prevailing market rate. In <span class="font-italic">Platt v Platt</span>, the court preferred to value the shares at the transaction date given the evidential difficulties in using a later date and that the shares no longer existed. There is no such difficulty in the present case as Venture is a public-listed company whose share price is transparent. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">135 Here, had Tan not made the representations, Venture would have had the 50,000 shares. The losses (including consequential losses) incurred by Venture would include the price it has to pay to acquire a similar number of shares in the market, <span class="font-italic">provided this is what Venture intends to do</span><span class="font-italic"> or has to do</span>. In such a situation, the prevailing market rate for the shares would be most appropriate to allow Venture to be fully compensated for its loss. But it is unclear that Venture intends or has to acquire replacement shares. Wong did not state that Venture will buy replacement shares, or even that Venture has to replace back into the company the shares transferred to Tan.

</div> It is for Venture to prove what its loss is and the quantum of such loss and I find that it has not shown that the loss is the value of the shares at today’s market rate.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">136 Indeed, Mr Singh SC has now submitted that the court cannot order a transfer of the remaining 15,000 shares from Tan to Venture because this would contravene s 76(1A) of the Companies Act (Cap 50, 2006 Rev Ed) (“the CA”) as that section provides that, except where expressly provided by the CA, a company cannot acquire shares in the company. Mr Singh SC also submits that Venture cannot hold the shares as treasury shares save in the circumstances under ss 76B to 76G of the CA which he submits Venture does not fall within, and hence, any transfer of shares to Venture would render the shares valueless as it cannot use them as treasury shares.

<div class="FootnoteRef text-justify">  Mr Singh SC’s Letter dated 21 October 2021 at [4]–[8].</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> By these submissions where Mr Singh SC is suggesting that a transfer of shares back to Venture would not be possible or feasible, it shows that Venture does not intend to acquire or would not be acquiring shares let alone from the market.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">137 Given the above, I thus accept Mr Rajah SC’s submission that the date of assessing damages of loss to Venture in relation to the shares should be at the market price at which Venture could have sold the shares at the time they were issued to Tan. I see no reason to depart from the transaction date for valuation (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the date when the 50,000 shares were transferred to Tan) in favour of the date on which I make the determination in the Suit. Even if Venture had succeeded on its claim for any breach of duties, this would not change how the damages (or any claim for equitable compensation as prayed for by Venture) would be assessed (see also [128] above). This is also given that I will in any event award Venture the profits that Tan had made from selling 35,000 shares, namely $74,035.30 for its claim in unjust enrichment.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">138 Further, I do not see any impediment to making an order for Tan to return 15,000 shares to Venture. There is no evidence that such an order would render the shares returned to Venture to be valueless. Section 76(8)(<span class="font-italic">h</span>) of the CA provides that nothing in s 76(1A) prohibits the purchase by a company of shares in the company <span class="font-italic">pursuant to a court order</span>. Section 76B(10) further provides that “Nothing in [sections 76B] to 76G shall be construed so as to limit or affect an order of the Court made under any section that requires a company to purchase or acquire its own shares.” Indeed, Wong attested that if Tan were to return the shares, Venture would keep them in the treasury until it is time to give them to other employees as share awards under the RSP. Pertinently, this is what Venture had pleaded and initially asked for, namely the return of the 50,000 shares and where any of them have been sold, that there should be an account of profits or damages on the shares that were sold.

Venture had pleaded for the return of all or any of the shares and Tan had also agreed to do so in relation to any unsold shares.
