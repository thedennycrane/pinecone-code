The fire took place at around 2.00 am on 10 September 2016 along the Pan-Island Expressway in the direction of Tuas. The fire started at or around the rear left tyre of UBTS’ trailer that was carrying the PVD Machine.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 UBTS contended that the fire was not due to negligence on its part. It also relied on excluding and limiting conditions in (a) UBTS’ standard terms and conditions (“the UBTS T&amp;Cs”); and (b) standard terms and conditions of the Singapore Logistics Association (“SLA”) (“the SLA T&amp;Cs”), both of which it argued were incorporated into the contract between the parties (“the subject contract”).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">3 I found that the fire was due to negligence on UBTS’ part (see [8] – [31] below). I also found that neither the UBTS T&amp;Cs nor the SLA T&amp;Cs had been incorporated into the subject contract (see [32]–[66] below). I thus granted judgment in favour of Nambu.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">4 However, of Nambu’s claims totalling $1,226,807.20 on the basis of replacement (alternatively $1,279,537.20 on the basis of repair), I only awarded Nambu $248,240.00, together with interest and costs of $160,000.00 (excluding disbursements to be fixed or taxed, if not agreed). I decided that the PVD Machine could have been repaired for less than its replacement cost, and that this ought to have been done within six months of the accident – accordingly, I only allowed Nambu’s claims for loss of use, and for storage and relocation charges, for that six month period (see [81]–[135] below). I also reduced the amount of repair costs claimed, relying on the opinion of UBTS’ damages expert (see [96]–[109] below).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">5 Nambu has appealed in respect of the quantum of damages and costs awarded to it. UBTS has appealed in respect of my decision that the SLA T&amp;Cs were not incorporated into the subject contract.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">6 These are my grounds of decision. For completeness, I will also address the cause of the fire (and whether UBTS was negligent) and the non-incorporation of the UBTS T&amp;Cs, although those aspects have not been appealed against.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Issues</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">7 The issues at first instance were:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Was the damage to the PVD Machine due to UBTS’ negligence?</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Were the excluding or limiting provisions in the UBTS T&amp;Cs and the SLA T&amp;Cs incorporated into the subject contract?</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) If UBTS were liable, what relief was Nambu entitled to?</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Cause of damage to the PVD Machine</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">8 I addressed the following:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) What caused the fire?</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Was UBTS negligent in the transport of the PVD Machine?</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c)  Was the fire caused or contributed to by any negligence on UBTS’ part?</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Cause of the fire</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">9 The Singapore Civil Defence Force (“SCDF”) Accidental Fire Investigation Report stated that the probable cause of the fire was frictional heat at the rear left tyre of UBTS’ trailer.

The quotation stated that the repairing cost of the PVD Machine was for the sum of South Korean won (“KRW”) 139,260,000,  and that a further KRW 50,000,000 would be chargeable as “travel worker expense” for each PVD machine special mechanic if repairs were to be done in Singapore.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">84 Mr Park explained in his AEIC that when he sent the October 2016 quotation, he had mistakenly reflected the figures in the quotation as Singapore dollars when in fact they were denominated in KRW.

Mr Lum had simply applied a 20% discount based on what he described as the standard industry practice in Singapore of applying such a discount to repaired vehicles and equipment that are two years or older, and the PVD Machine was some six years old.

The court allowed the plaintiffs to recover the cost of replacement, without any allowance to the defendants for any benefit to the plaintiffs from having a new factory in place of the old.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">106 Lord Denning MR said (at 468): “[The plaintiffs] replaced [the factory] in the only possible way, without adding any extras. I think they should be allowed the cost of replacement. True it is that they got new for old; but I do not think the wrongdoer can diminish the claim on that account.” Widgery LJ said that he did not accept “that the plaintiffs must give credit under the heading of ‘betterment’ for the fact that their new factory is modern in design and materials” (<span class="font-italic">Harbutt’s</span> at 473). Cross LJ said that “such benefit as the plaintiffs may get by having a new building and new plant in place of an old building and old plant is something in respect of which the defendants are not, as I see it, entitled to any allowance” (<span class="font-italic">Harbutt’s</span> at 476). He added that the defendants did not call any evidence to make out a case of betterment on the lines of the plaintiffs having rebuilt the factory with a different and more convenient layout and thereby spent more money than they would have spent had they rebuilt it according to the old plan (if that were allowed by the planning authorities in the first place) (<span class="font-italic">Harbutt’s </span>at 476).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">107 Those propositions apply with greater force to the present case, which did not involve the PVD Machine being rebuilt altogether, but only repaired. I did not consider that Nambu needs to give credit for such “betterment” arising from the replacement of old parts of the PVD Machine by new parts, the consequence of which is that Nambu would still have been out of pocket in having the PVD Machine repaired, so that it could be used again.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">108 For repair costs, I thus allowed $197,460 as per the FM quotation, less $22,224 for the replacement of boom cylinders, plus $4,800 for the repair and overhaul of boom cylinders, less $3,457 for the replacement of the center joint set, less $3,086 for the replacement of the air conditioner, less $20,000 for repair management fee, plus $500 for sundries, plus $6,160 for air tickets and resident charge for two Korean repairmen. In total, I allowed $160,153 for repair costs.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">109 It was not uneconomical for Nambu to have repaired the PVD Machine. As such, I allowed Nambu’s alternative claim for repair costs, and did not allow Nambu’s primary claim for replacement of the PVD Machine.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Loss of use, and storage and relocation charges</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">110 Nambu claimed for the loss of use of the PVD Machine from 10 September 2016 to judgment, at $12,280 per month.

</div> it would only have been sensible to proceed with the repair, and save the Dongwoon contract. This is especially since repairing the PVD Machine would have cost less than the amount of lost profits.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">141 Nambu also suggested that it could not proceed to repair the PVD Machine because it is the subject of this suit. This is misconceived. After the initial inspections in September 2016, neither side still required to inspect the PVD Machine in its damaged form, nor was the court asked to do so. UBTS’ experts did inspect the damaged PVD Machine after September 2016,

</div> but that was simply because it was still available for inspection. Nambu cannot justify keeping the damaged PVD Machine lying around “as is”, on the basis that it wanted to give UBTS’ experts the opportunity to inspect it. Moreover, after UBTS’ experts had inspected the damaged PVD Machine (in March 2020), Nambu still did not repair it.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">142 From 3 January 2017 at the latest, Nambu was free to repair the PVD Machine so that it could use it. Instead, Nambu left the PVD Machine in its damaged state, and claimed for loss of profit, and loss of use and storage charges all the way to judgment. In this regard, I did not allow Nambu compensation for loss of profits, and I only allowed a period of six months for loss of use and storage charges (till around the middle of March 2017) (see [131] and [135] above). Nambu acted unreasonably in not repairing the PVD Machine by then, and cannot hold UBTS responsible for any losses flowing from this.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Conversion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">143 I did not find UBTS liable in conversion. UBTS did not act in a manner inconsistent with Nambu’s superior possessory title. When UBTS moved the damaged PVD Machine to UBTS’ yard, instead of to the Tuas worksite, UBTS was reasonably doing what it considered was safe and convenient in the aftermath of the fire. Nambu did not protest or ask that the damaged PVD Machine be relocated to the Tuas worksite (where it could not then be used, and might get in the way).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Detinue</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">144 I also rejected Nambu’s claim in detinue.

If this were regarded as a complex tort or contract case, the figure would then be $153,000 (based on a daily tariff of $17,000 per day, reducing to 80% of that after the first five days).
