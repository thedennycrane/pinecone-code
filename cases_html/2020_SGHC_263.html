It is clear from the passage cited above that although AR Wong was considering the actual valuation of the Six Properties produced by the plaintiff, she was doing so in relation to the issue of <span class="font-italic">whether the plaintiff could assert that he had a valid counterclaim</span>. It was not in relation to the defendants’ failure to disclose relevant information. On that issue, AR Wong only held that it was “apparent on the face of the [First SD] that the [defendants] have not disclosed that they hold certain assets on the [plaintiff’s] behalf”.

</div> AR Wong made no finding in relation to whether, in disclosing their holding of the Six Properties, the defendants should have referred to the Six Properties’ actual value or the value reflected in the Compromise Agreement. Thus, the issue in the present case and the issue addressed in AR Wong’s decision are not identical, and no issue estoppel arises. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">16 Secondly, even if there are identical issues, issue estoppel does not arise because the relevant decision to consider is <span class="font-italic">this court’s </span>decision on the First SD, in which there was no consideration of whether the First SD should be set aside for failing to state the actual valuation of the Six Properties. In this regard, I agree with AR Anand’s decision below. As AR Anand observed, an appeal from an assistant registrar to a judge in chambers is “by way of an actual rehearing of the application and the judge treats the matter afresh as though it came before him the first time” (see <span class="font-italic">Herbs and Spices Trading Post Pte Ltd v Deo Silver (Pte) Ltd </span>[1990] 2 SLR(R) 685 at [12]). Thus, the relevant decision for the purposes of considering whether issue estoppel arises is this court’s decision on the First SD. However, in that decision, there was no consideration, much less any decision, on whether the First SD should be set aside for failing to state the actual valuation of the Six Properties. It would be useful to set out my decision for the dismissal of the defendants’ appeal against AR Wong’s decision in respect of the First SD:

</div> There was no mention of which valuation of the Six Properties should have been reflected on the First SD. Indeed, the plaintiff himself acknowledges that in upholding the setting aside of the First SD on the ground that the Six Properties had not been disclosed, there was “no need” for the court to deal with the value of the Six Properties.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">18 For these reasons, I reject the plaintiff’s submission that issue estoppel arises regarding whether the value of the Six Properties should be their actual value or the value reflected in the Compromise Agreement. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Whether the defendants complied with the Bankruptcy Rules</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">19 I turn now to the next issue of whether the SD should be set aside on the basis of non-compliance with r 94(5) of the Bankruptcy Rules. Rule 98(2)(<span class="font-italic">c)</span> of the Bankruptcy Rules provides that the court shall set aside a statutory demand if it appears that the creditor holds assets of the debtor or security in respect of the debt claimed by the demand and the creditor fails to disclose them as required under r 94(5) of the Bankruptcy Rules. Rule 94(5) states as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(5) If the creditor holds any property of the debtor or any security for the debt, there shall be specified in the demand –</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) the full amount of the debt; and</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) the nature and value of the security or the assets. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">20 The plaintiff makes two submissions in relation to this point. First, that the defendants failed to specify in the SD the value of the Six Properties as they used the value of the Six Properties reflected in the Compromise Agreement rather than their actual value. Secondly, the defendants failed to disclose that they hold the plaintiff’s one-fifth share of the estate of their late parents, as was declared by the Indian court. I shall address each of these submissions in turn. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The value of the Six Properties </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">21 I find that in relation to the value of the Six Properties, the SD was compliant with r 94(5) of the Bankruptcy Rules. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">22 In <span class="font-italic">Ramesh Mohandas </span><span class="font-italic">Nagrani v United Overseas Bank Ltd </span>[2016] 1 SLR 174, Chua Lee Ming JC (as he then was) held at [29] as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Rule 94(6) is clear – the value of the security or property is to be deducted from the full amount of the debt and only the balance can be claimed in the statutory demand. It stands to reason that the expression ‘property of the debtor’ in r 94(5) means property of the debtor that the creditor is entitled to apply towards payment of the debt, since he is required by r 94(6) to deduct the value of the property from the total amount of the debt and is only entitled to claim the balance. … </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">23 In his decision, Chua JC dealt with the <span class="font-italic">property </span>which a creditor must disclose in a statutory demand, reasoning that such property must be property that the creditor is entitled to apply towards payment of the debt. By extension from Chua JC’s reasoning, the <span class="font-italic">value</span> of such property must also be that which the creditor is entitled to deduct from the debt claimed in a statutory demand. However, in the present case, the defendants would <span class="font-italic">not be entitled </span>to apply the <span class="font-italic">actual </span>value of the Six Properties towards the payment of the Judgment Sum. That is because there is a court order requiring the defendants to transfer to the plaintiff the Six Properties (see [5] above). If the defendants sold the Six Properties, they would be in breach of the court order. In other words, they would not be entitled to apply these sums towards the payment of the Judgment Sum.

</div> However, as AR Anand observed, the Indian court’s decision merely declared each party’s entitlement in respect of the estate; it did not deal with the liabilities between the parties <span class="font-italic">inter se</span>.

Even after several years since the High Court's decision (upheld by the Court of Appeal) allowing the plaintiff’s counterclaim for the Six Properties and the sale proceeds of the Seventh Property (see [5] above), the Six Properties still remain with the defendants. This is not due to any fault of the defendants. Instead, it appears that the plaintiff is the one responsible for such delay. The defendants sent the plaintiff several solicitors’ letters between 20 June 2016 and 5 July 2016 offering to transfer to the plaintiff the Six Properties. The defendants also sought legal advice on the transfer of the Six Properties (which are located in India), conveying such legal advice to the plaintiff as well.

</div> AR Chan found that the contents of paragraph 20 and pages 34–41 concerned how the High Court’s decision on the Compromise Agreement could be given effect, rather than discussions between the parties to compromise their position.

If he genuinely intended to enforce his counterclaim in respect of the Six Properties and the sale proceeds of the Seventh Property, he would have done so well before the present proceedings. His inaction and lack of responsiveness to the defendants’ attempts to transfer to him the Six Properties suggest to me that he does not genuinely intend to pursue this counterclaim.

This specific issue was not addressed by AR Wong in her decision regarding the First SD. Furthermore, the relevant decision to consider for the purposes of issue estoppel is this court’s<span class="font-italic"> </span>decision on the First SD.

If they had sold the Six Properties and attempted to apply the sale proceeds of the Six Properties towards the payment of the Judgment Sum, they would have been in contempt of the court order made in relation to the Compromise Agreement. Hence, the defendants’ use of the value of the Six Properties reflected in the Compromise Agreement was reasonable and justified.

This is evident from the plaintiff’s inaction and lack of responsiveness to the defendants’ many attempts to transfer the Six Properties to him. Thus, the Six Properties continue to remain with the defendants even up till today. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) None of the other grounds in r 98(2) of the Bankruptcy Rules for setting aside a statutory demand are applicable in this case.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 For the above reasons, I dismiss the plaintiff’s appeal.
