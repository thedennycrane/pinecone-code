It may be of interest to note that the Act has since been repealed and re-enacted in the form of the Work Injury Compensation Act 2019 (2020 Rev Ed) (the “WICA 2019”) that took effect on 1 September 2020.  The WICA 2019 sought to improve the pre-existing regime in four main ways: to enhance insurance coverage and benefits for injured employees, to better incentivise employers to prevent injuries from happening in the first place, to speed up and improve claims processing, and to give greater assurance to employers that the regime provides balanced safeguards that protect both employers and employees (<span class="font-italic">Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report </span>(3 September 2019) vol 94 (Mr Zaqy Mohamad, Minister of State for Manpower)).  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">5 In this case, it is the predecessor legislation that governs the claim made and it is the provisions of the Act that will be considered.  Section 3(1) of the Act provides that “[i]f in any employment personal injury by accident arising out of and in the course of the employment is caused to an employee, his employer shall be liable to pay compensation in accordance with the provisions of [the Act]”.  I make the observation that s 7(1) of the WICA 2019 adopts similar wording as follows: “[w]here personal injury is caused to an employee by an accident arising out of and in the course of the employee’s employment with an employer, that employer is liable to pay compensation under this Act”.

MOM may then issue a Notice of Assessment (“NOA”) for a sum to be paid by the employer as compensation, if any.  If the employer or the employer’s insurer wishes to dispute the claim, it may lodge a Notice of Objection (“NOO”).  The dispute will be heard before the Commissioner for Labour or an Assistant Commissioner (Work Injury Compensation).  In the present case, MOM had issued an NOA for compensation of $204,000 to be paid to the Respondents.

</div>  On this approach, the AC found that the heart attack had indeed occurred when Mr Tay was in the course of employment.  He took the view that it was unnecessary to pin down exactly when Mr Tay suffered the heart attack because, in his assessment, the evidence showed that from 9.00am till the time of death, Mr Tay was either at the workplace or worrying about work (as evidenced by the Phone Call).

In my view, statutory provisions which restrict appeals from tribunals and other statutory bodies to “questions of law” or “points of law” are a reference to where the adjudicative body has made an error or errors of law.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">23 In <span class="font-italic">Ng Eng Ghee and others v Mamata Kapilev Dave and others (Horizon Partners Pte Ltd, intervener) and another appeal </span>[2009] 3 SLR(R) 109 (“<span class="font-italic">Ng Eng Ghee</span>”), the Court of Appeal considered that an appeal against a decision of a Strata Titles Board formed under the Building Maintenance and Strata Management Act 2004, which only permits appeals on a “point of law”, as being synonymous with permitting appeals only where the Board has made an error of law.  At [90] of <span class="font-italic">Ng Eng Ghee</span>, the Court of Appeal then cited with approval the definition of errors of law set out in <span class="font-italic">Halsbury’s Law of England </span>vol 1(1) (Butterworths, 4th Ed Reissue, 1989) at para 70: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Errors of law include <span class="font-italic">misinterpretation of a statute</span> or any other legal document <span class="font-italic">or a rule of common law; asking oneself and answering the wrong question</span>, taking irrelevant considerations into account or failing to take relevant considerations into account when purporting to apply the law to the facts; admitting inadmissible evidence or <span class="font-italic">rejecting admissible and relevant evidence</span>; exercising a discretion on the basis of incorrect legal principles; <span class="font-italic">giving reasons which disclose faulty legal reasoning</span> or which are inadequate to fulfil an express duty to give reasons, and <span class="font-italic">misdirecting oneself as to the burden of proof</span>.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis in the original]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">These were described as <span class="font-italic">ex facie</span> errors of law that would raise points of law, which may be appealed: <span class="font-italic">Ng Eng Ghee</span> at [91].  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 In addition to such <span class="font-italic">ex facie</span> errors, otherwise known as errors which appear on the face of the record, the Court of Appeal went on to endorse the view that an appeal on a “point of law” would also be allowed if the facts found were such that no person acting judicially and properly instructed as to the relevant law could have come to the determination under appeal: <span class="font-italic">Ng Eng Ghee</span> at [95], agreeing with the view expressed by the House of Lords in <span class="font-italic">Edwards v Bairstow</span> [1956] AC 14 (“<span class="font-italic">Edwards</span>”). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 For completeness, I should also add that the Court of Appeal explained in <span class="font-italic">Ng Eng Ghee </span>(at [99]) that the definition of a “question of law” may be wider or narrower depending on the context and the relevant underlying policy considerations.  In the context of decisions by inferior tribunals, the Court of Appeal expressed approval of a broader approach, which affords the court greater oversight over such tribunals; <span class="font-italic">ex facie</span> errors, and errors of the type as described in <span class="font-italic">Edwards</span>, would entitle a party to appeal (see <span class="font-italic">Ng Eng Ghee </span>at [100]–[101]).  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 Under the Act, there is a further limitation in that the “question of law” being raised on appeal must be a “substantial” one.  This must refer to a question of law that has some practical consequence to the rights and liabilities of the parties, or to the public, and not some misapplication of the law that has no real impact.  In other words, the Applicants and Respondents must show that the AC has erred in law in his decision, and this had affected the finding of liability, or the amount of compensation or costs awarded, in order to succeed in their respective appeals.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 It would be fairly clear that I need only consider the Respondents’ appeal if I am of the view that the Applicants’ appeal should be dismissed.

On the facts, the Applicants contend that there is nothing constituting such “accident” within the meaning of the Act that caused or contributed to the heart attack or death.

In their analysis, it is important to distinguish between the progressively fatal stages suffered by a heart attack patient as follows: angina, heart attack and cardiac arrest.    The Respondents dispute the Applicants’ contention that the onset of the heart attack was at 7.00am of the Date of Incident.  Relying on Dr Singh’s evidence, the Respondents argue that Mr Tay had experienced angina, rather than a heart attack, at 7.00am.  This could have resolved without progressing to a heart attack, but for the stressors experienced by Mr Tay in the course of employment later that morning.  The Respondents contend that, on a balance of probabilities, Mr Tay’s heart attack likely started while he was at work between 9.00am to 10.00am on the Date of Incident.

</div>  On this basis, the Respondents conclude that Mr Tay suffered injury by an accident arising in the course of employment.  The Respondents then rely on the presumption in s 3(6) of the Act and argue that the Applicants have failed to rebut the presumption because Dr Wong accepted that any physical or mental stressors encountered at work could have aggravated the heart attack.  As such, Mr Tay’s underlying conditions cannot be shown to be the sole cause of his death. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The issues  </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 It is clear that Mr Tay had suffered an injury.  The heart attack clearly constitutes such an injury.  While a workplace injury by accident is typically associated with something external, such as falling from a height for instance, “an internal medical condition that caused an unexpected injury” while an employee is carrying out his or her work can also fall within s 3(1) of the Act (see <span class="font-italic">Narayasamy </span>at [24]).  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 The central question in contention in TA 15/2021 is whether, given the circumstances of this case, the heart attack suffered by Mr Tay falls within the scope of s 3(1) of the Act, such that the Applicants are liable to compensate the Respondents.  The key issue to be determined, from the wording of the statutory provision, is whether there was an “injury by accident arising out of and in the course of the employment”.  To be more precise, it must be determined whether, on the facts, there was an “injury by accident”.  This is to be decided based on a proper interpretation of the statutory provision, and its application to the facts of this case.  I am satisfied that this is a substantial question of law since the answer to it will determine whether the Applicants are liable to compensate the Respondents.   </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 Another interconnected issue that arises is whether the AC had erred in determining that there had been an accident that <span class="font-italic">arose in the course of Mr Tay’s employment</span>, such that the presumption in s 3(6) of the Act was triggered and the onus was then on the Applicants to show that Mr Tay’s heart attack was caused only by his underlying medical conditions and not by his employment.  The resolution of this issue depends on whether the AC had disregarded relevant medical evidence and taken into account irrelevant considerations in the evidence before him.  This is another substantial question of law since it will have an impact on the liability of the Applicants.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Analysis</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 To recapitulate, s 3(1) of the Act provides as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">If in any employment personal injury by accident arising out of and in the course of the employment is caused to a workman, his employer shall be liable to pay compensation in accordance with the provisions of this Act. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 The conjunctive requirements, as recognised by the AC, have been set out above (see [15]).  That these are the requirements is borne out by the clear language in s 3(1) and also by the authorities: see <span class="font-italic">eg</span>, <span class="font-italic">Narayasamy </span>at [20].  The crux of the Applicants’ challenge to the Respondents’ claim is that there was no “accident” that caused the injury within the meaning of s 3(1) of the Act.  If the Applicants are correct, the claim would necessarily fail. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 As earlier mentioned (at [30] above), an “injury by accident” under s 3(1) of the Act can include an “internal medical condition that caused an unexpected injury” while an employee was carrying out his or her work (<span class="font-italic">Narayasamy </span>at [24]).  It is therefore possible that an employee who has suffered a heart attack while carrying out his or her work could be considered to have suffered an injury by accident within the meaning of s 3(1) of the Act.  However, case law has established the importance of distinguishing between an injury by accident and an injury caused by ordinary wear and tear brought about by the employee’s work-related efforts; the latter does not fall within the meaning of s 3(1) of the Act.  In this regard, the following passage from <span class="font-italic">Narayasamy </span>(at [38]) is a helpful summary of the position in relation to the need to show an “accident”: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">In my judgment, the passages in <span class="font-italic">Ormond </span>and <span class="font-italic">Hawkins</span> which I have just cited go to establish the important principle that to come within the Act, it must be shown that there was some <span class="font-italic">occurrence which caused the injury in question</span>. Thus, mere wear and tear would not constitute an accident. Further, <span class="font-italic">an occurrence which could constitute an accident but which has not been shown on a balance of probabilities to have caused the injury would also not bring the workman within the protection of the Act</span>. However, the occurrence need not be the sole or even the dominant cause. It will be sufficient to show that the accident was an operating or contributory cause of the injury. It must further be shown that the injury was in some way connected with the employment. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis in original omitted; emphasis added in italics] </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 As can be noted, two key principles have been set out in the above passage.  First, the claimant seeking compensation must show that there was an <span class="font-italic">occurrence </span>in the course of employment that caused the injury in question.  Secondly, it is insufficient to show that such occurrence might have or could possibly have caused the injury; while there is no requirement for the claimant to show with absolute certainty that the occurrence did in fact cause the injury, the existence of a causal link must be shown on a balance of probabilities. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 As an illustration, I will briefly outline the facts of <span class="font-italic">Narayasamy</span>.  In that case, the deceased was employed as a coach driver whose responsibilities included loading of luggage onto and out of his coach.  He passed away after suffering a heart attack, the effects of which were superimposed on one he had suffered previously.  It was acknowledged that the deceased was not in good health to begin with.  The claim by his next of kin nonetheless succeeded because there was evidence that the deceased was engaged in strenuous work just prior to and at the time that he suffered the fatal heart attack.  A finding was made that the deceased’s heart attack was triggered by his work-related exertions shortly before the heart attack.  This finding was supported by witness evidence that the deceased had been carrying ten to 15 bags, each weighing between 15 and 25 kilograms, shortly before the heart attack.  There was also medical evidence that, at the time of the accident, the deceased’s heart condition had deteriorated to such a stage that his work had become too strenuous for him.  The occurrence, therefore, was the strenuous work that the accused had been doing shortly prior to the heart attack.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 I turn to examine two authorities that were cited with approval in <span class="font-italic">Narayasamy</span>.  In <span class="font-italic">Ormond</span><span class="font-italic"> v CD Holmes &amp; Co, Ltd </span>[1937] 2 All ER 795 (“<span class="font-italic">Ormond</span>”), the English Court of Appeal dismissed a claim for compensation under s 1(1) of the Workmen’s Compensation Act 1925, which provision used a similar expression as that used in s 3(1) of the Act.  In <span class="font-italic">Ormond</span>, a blacksmith’s striker suffered a stroke at work.  He had previously suffered a stroke at home.  On the medical evidence, the work that had been done after the first stroke accelerated the second stroke.  However, the court concluded that the injury suffered, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>the second stroke, was outside the scope of the English statute.  This was because although the second stroke had been accelerated by the general “wear and tear” of the work done, it was “impossible to point to any specific event that was responsible” for the second stroke (<span class="font-italic">Ormond</span> at 804).  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 In <span class="font-italic">Hawkins v Powells Tillery Steam Coal Company, Limited</span> [1911] 1 KB 988, an elderly man working in a colliery had been helping to push some empty trucks up an incline.  He was then asked to cut some timber when he complained of pain.  He died of angina pectoris that evening.  The medical evidence showed that the man’s heart was in poor condition; any slight exertion could have brought on a fatal heart attack.  The English Court of Appeal overturned the lower court’s decision to allow the claim for compensation under s 1 of the Workmen’s Compensation Act 1906, which also requires that an “accident” arising out of the employment be shown.  The judge sitting in the lower court concluded that, on the whole of the evidence, the deceased had over-exerted himself at work, and that had brought on the heart attack.  On appeal, the appellate court found that the lower court’s decision was not supported by direct evidence nor legitimate inference; it was not clear from the medical evidence whether the injury had been caused by something the deceased had been doing at work, and that defeated the claim.     </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 A more recent decision is <span class="font-italic">Secretary of State for Work and Pensions v James Scullion </span>[2010] EWCA Civ 310 (“<span class="font-italic">Scullion</span>”).  There, the claimant accountant had to take on additional work as a planning manager and stores manager due to the illness of a colleague and promotion of another.  His increased workload placed great strains on him.  He was found collapsed at work, having suffered a cardiac arrest.  The English Court of Appeal refused to make a declaration that the claimant had suffered an industrial accident under s 29(2) of the Social Security Act 1998.  The provision which had to be satisfied was s 94(1) of the Social Security Contributions and Benefits Act 1992, which used the expression “personal injury caused … by accident”.  This was because “there was no evidence that any external event … such as lifting a very heavy pile of papers, opening a file drawer which had stuck, or even lifting an arm to get heavy papers from a shelf, caused the cardiac arrest” (<span class="font-italic">Scullion </span>at [54]).  Aikens LJ emphasised the “necessary distinction between ‘accident’ and ‘injury’” (<span class="font-italic">Scullion </span>at [44]) and explained that it is erroneous to consider a cardiac arrest to be an injury caused by accident simply because the cardiac arrest was an improbable, sudden and an unlooked-for mishap or untoward event (<span class="font-italic">Scullion </span>at [53]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 Finally, I also considered the decision in <span class="font-italic">Chua Jian Construction and another v Zhao Xiaojuan (deputy for Qian Guo Liang)</span> [2018] SGHC 98 (“<span class="font-italic">Chua Jian</span>”).  In <span class="font-italic">Chua Jian</span>, a construction site worker was found lying motionless on the ground at his work site.  He was taken to the hospital where he was diagnosed with intracerebral haemorrhage (“ICH”), which had caused him to fall into a coma (from which he unfortunately did not awake, even at the time of the decision in <span class="font-italic">Chua Jian</span>).  The High Court dismissed the claim for compensation, which was made pursuant to s 3(1) of the Act.  In <span class="font-italic">Chua Jian</span>, there was no available evidence as to what happened shortly prior to the worker’s collapse.  On the other hand, the medical evidence was that the ICH was caused by hypertension, which the worker had been suffering for many years and left untreated.  In arriving at his decision, Choo Han Teck J considered <span class="font-italic">Narayasamy</span> and found that it was distinguishable.  In explaining why, Choo J stated (at [16]): </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">In the present case there was <span class="font-italic">no evidence that “something in fact transpired in the course of his work which made the injury occur when it did”.</span> That a heart attack could have occurred to the employee while at his workplace is the same as an employee suffering a stroke at home, <span class="font-italic">unless the employee who suffered the heart attack or stroke suffered it at his workplace after</span><span class="font-italic"> something had transpired that made the injury occur when it did</span>. In <span class="font-italic">Narayasamy</span> the answer was yes, he was exerting himself when he collapsed, and that exertion had brought about the heart attack. In the present case, there is only the evidence of the stroke. There was no evidence that it was brought about by an exertion, and no evidence, in fact, of what [the worker] was doing before he collapsed.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added] </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 In my judgment, when the four abovementioned cases are read together with <span class="font-italic">Naray</span><span class="font-italic">asamy</span>, it is clear that an internal medical condition may amount to an “injury by accident” within the meaning of s 3(1) of the Act only where it is shown that there was an occurrence in the course of employment that precipitated the injury being suffered by the worker.  It must be shown that the worker was doing something, relating to his work, which was a cause of his injury.  It is insufficient to say that there was an “accident” simply because it was unexpected that the injury had occurred.  In other words, the fact that the injury was sustained cannot also be the occurrence.  Otherwise, one would be conflating the “injury” with the “accident”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 I turn to examine whether there was such an “injury by accident” within the meaning of s 3(1) of the Act on the facts of the present case.  Counsel for the Respondents proffered, in oral submissions, two possible ways to analyse the transpired events in accordance with the statutory framework.  On the first analysis, the “injury” suffered is the heart attack, and the “accident” is the unexpected occurrence of the heart attack.  I am unable to accept this analysis.  As I have already explained, it would not be in line with the approach as set out in <span class="font-italic">Narayasamy</span> to say that the heart attack constitutes <span class="font-italic">both</span> the injury and accident because, on such an analysis, there is no occurrence that caused the injury.   </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 I therefore find that the AC erred in his reasoning because he adopted this analysis put forward by the Respondents.  To recapitulate, the AC decided that there was an injury by accident because Mr Tay “had an internal medical condition (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>the high cholesterol) that caused him to suffer an unexpected injury (AMI or heart attack) while [Mr Tay] was in the course of his work”.

He cited <span class="font-italic">Narayasamy </span>at [38] (which has been reproduced in full at [35] above) for the proposition that an “accident” would, in the AC’s words, “exclude mere wear and tear but would include <span class="font-italic">an unexpected injury sustained while the employee was carrying out his work</span> <span class="font-italic">even if it was brought about by a pre-existing medical condition</span>” [emphasis added].

</div>  It appears to me that the AC may have focused on the reference in <span class="font-italic">Narayasamy </span>to a pre-existing medical condition without recognising the requirement for there to also have been an occurrence that caused the injury.  Indeed, the facts of <span class="font-italic">Narayasamy </span>illustrated that an employee is not precluded from compensation for his injury simply because his pre-existing medical condition had caused the unexpected injury.  However, the important qualification is this – he or she must show that there was an <span class="font-italic">occurrence</span> in the course of employment that, on a balance of probabilities, in fact caused the injury suffered.  To put things simply, something external must have happened in the course of employment that triggered the heart attack suffered by Mr Tay, even if one accepts that he had pre-existing medical conditions that predisposed him to having a heart attack.  The AC erred in his reasoning by treating the accident and injury as if they are one and the same, when the correct approach would have been to recognise the “necessary distinction” between them as earlier explained (see [40] above).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 In <span class="font-italic">Narayasamy</span>, it was found that “there was no doubt that the [claimant] had showed that there had been an occurrence”, which, as already explained (see [37] above), was the many pieces of luggage he was moving shortly prior to his heart attack.  On the other hand, the Respondents have not shown that there was any such occurrence in the present case.  The evidence before the AC was that Mr Tay was at the workplace for about an hour from 9.00am to 10.00am on the Date of Incident, and that he did not do any work in that time (see [10] above).  I recognise that this account of the events is based solely on Mr Lim’s testimony, and he did concede that he did not pay close attention to Mr Tay at the material time (see [10] above).  However, Mr Lim’s testimony was the only evidence as to what happened during that hour or so that Mr Tay spent at the workplace.  No co-workers or other witnesses were called by the Respondents to give evidence as to what Mr Tay was doing during the hour that he was at the workplace.  There is thus no credible challenge to Mr Lim’s evidence as to what transpired that morning.  Since the Respondents are unable to show that Mr Tay was doing anything in relation to his work while he was at the workplace on the Date of Incident, let alone anything significant that might have triggered his heart attack, they are accordingly unable to show that there was an occurrence in the course of employment that resulted in the “injury by accident” within the meaning of s 3(1) of the Act. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 The Respondents’ alternative analysis of the transpired events is that the “injury” suffered was the cardiac arrest at 12.47pm (see [3] above), and the “accident” is the heart attack.  In this analysis, the Respondents rely on the Phone Call (see [10] above) as the occurrence which triggered the heart attack.  They argue that Mr Tay must have been so concerned about work that he called Mr Lim to tell him about things that had to be done.  That allegedly triggered Mr Tay’s cardiac arrest.  With respect, I find this analysis to be rather confused because it attempts to separate the injury suffered by Mr Tay, which is his heart attack, into different constituents in order to show that the injury he suffered happened during the course of work, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, after 9.00 am.  The question as to whether Mr Tay suffered his injury before he even arrived at work is a point I will come to later (see [53]–[56] below).  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 As to this different analysis of what is the “injury by accident”, I find the Respondents’ submissions before me rather inconsistent with the expert medical evidence that they led in proceedings before the AC.  Dr Singh’s evidence was that the hour or so spent at the workplace led to the heart attack (see [13] above).  He testified that the chest pains experienced by Mr Tay before arriving at work “could have been an angina attack which could have been aborted by resting” but he “chose to go to work and stayed there for another hour and that was the last straw that aggravated the angina that [led] to a heart attack”.

</div>  Thus, according to Dr Singh, it was the work that Mr Tay was doing at the workplace that morning or the Phone Call which led to his injury, which is the heart attack suffered by Mr Tay.  I thus did not accept the Respondents’ alternative analysis that attempts to draw a distinction between the heart attack and the cardiac arrest.  It is entirely artificial, in my view, to treat the cardiac arrest, which is the final stage of the heart attack, as separate from the heart attack.  In my view, the injury is the heart attack that Mr Tay suffered, which eventually led to his death by cardiac arrest.  What the Respondents have not been able to establish is the occurrence that took place on the morning of the Date of the Incident which was causally linked to Mr Tay having a heart attack.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 At this juncture, I pause to note the many deficiencies in Dr Singh’s evidence, which were pointed out by counsel for the Applicants.  In my judgment, many of the criticisms by the Applicants are justifiable.  Dr Singh’s evidence was in many ways speculative and unsupported by the available factual evidence.  For instance, Dr Singh’s Reply Report noted that “[Mr Tay] was a hard worker and was not averse to physically helping his workers in carrying bales of clothing for laundry”.

</div>  In Dr Singh’s First Report, he explained that “any minor physical exertion (such as pulling trolleys, loading laundry baskets or climbing ladders) … could easily have served as the ‘last straw that broke the camel’s back’.

</div>  The factual assumptions relied upon by Dr Singh for his opinion are inconsistent with the evidence by Mr Lim that Mr Tay’s job scope did not include any physical work and that, in fact, he did not do any work at all in the hour that he was at the workplace on the Date of Incident.  There was simply no basis for Dr Singh’s assumptions, at least on the available evidence, given that Mr Lim was the only person from the workplace that gave evidence.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 Dr Singh’s analysis was also conjecture insofar as he commented that “[i]t is likely that something happened” to trigger the heart attack.  It also bears noting that he relied on “[t]wenty colour photographs of [SM Laundry’s] interior” as the basis for concluding that “the facility appears to be a very busy place requiring a considerable amount of physical labour”

</div>  As I had already flagged earlier (see [11] above), counsel for the Respondents did not even put it to Mr Lim that Mr Tay’s work scope or the environment at SM Laundry was stressful.   </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 Given the state of the evidence, I find that the AC erred in relying on Dr Singh’s assessment that the trigger for the heart attack was likely to be the work that Mr Tay was doing at the workplace on the Date of Incident, or because of the Phone Call that he had made to Mr Lim from the Pasir Ris Clinic.  Simply put, the Respondents have not been able to prove that there was anything that happened in the course of Mr Tay’s employment on that morning of the Date of the Incident that was causally linked to him suffering a heart attack.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 In sum, the evidence suggests that the cardiac events that ultimately proved fatal were set into motion at 7.00am on the Date of Incident, or possibly even earlier than that given the evidence of the chest pains experienced by Mr Tay three to four days prior to the Date of Incident (see [3] above).  The Respondents’ arguments are to the effect that, if Mr Tay had not gone to work or had not made the Phone Call, the cardiac events that had been set in motion could have panned out differently and he might have survived.  However, it is insufficient to show that the mere fact of being at the workplace or worry over the Phone Call could have aggravated Mr Tay’s cardiac events.  An “injury by accident” within the meaning of s 3(1) of the Act requires the Respondents to point to an occurrence in the course of employment that, on a balance of probabilities, caused the injury.  The Respondents have failed to discharge their burden of showing this. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 On this ground alone, the Applicants’ appeal should be allowed and the order for compensation made by the AC set aside.  However, as the parties also made submissions on the related point of whether the AC erred in finding that Mr Tay’s heart attack had happened “in the course” of his employment, let me just deal very briefly with that issue as well.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 This second issue arises because the evidence in the proceedings before the AC actually suggests that Mr Tay had already been suffering from a heart attack <span class="font-italic">before</span> he arrived at the workplace on the Date of Incident.  In fact, I have already pointed out that the evidence was that Mr Tay had been suffering from chest pains since 7.00am on the Date of the Incident, which was two hours before he arrived at the workplace.  The clinical notes from the Pasir Ris Clinic, as explained in Dr Lye’s testimony, record that Mr Tay experienced chest pains that started at 7.00am till he visited the Pasir Ris Clinic around 10.54am on the Date of Incident.

However, Dr Wong’s evidence suggests that this explanation is improbable.  He explained that “<span class="font-italic">if you have a chest pain when you … are not doing anything strenuous</span>, it is a heart attack as far as I am concerned until proven otherwise” [emphasis added].

</div>  This is actually consistent with Dr Singh’s explanation of what angina is.  Dr Singh’s First Report states that “[if the patient’s arterial lumen has significant blockage], he or she may have symptoms such as chest pain <span class="font-italic">on exertion</span>, such as going up a flight of stairs. This chest pain is called Angina” [emphasis added].

</div>  Since there is no evidence that Mr Tay was doing anything strenuous, or exerting himself in any way, while at the same time suffering from chest pains, from 7.00am to 9.00am, the inference must be that Mr Tay was already suffering from a heart attack at that time.  In other words, the heart attack started <span class="font-italic">before</span> Mr Tay arrived at the workplace.  I should add that there is also no evidence that Mr Tay was carrying out any work-related activities in the two hours from 7.00am to 9.00am while he was not at his workplace.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 In my judgment, the AC seems to have disregarded all this evidence, both medical and factual, which clearly showed that Mr Tay’s heart attack commenced before he even came to work on 9.00am.  At the same time, the AC also appears to have placed undue weight on the entirely speculative views expressed by Dr Singh in his evidence that Mr Tay carried out physical work at SM Laundry, that the Phone Call must have been the “last straw”, and that the stress from work caused the heart attack.  I have already dealt with the problems with Dr Singh’s evidence earlier (see [48]–[49] above) and do not need to repeat them here.  He was called as an expert witness, but he ventured far beyond his realm of expertise.  Suffice to say, I find that the AC had allowed Dr Singh’s evidence to obscure the critical factual issues that had to be decided.     </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 In view of the foregoing, I find that the Respondents have not shown on a balance of probabilities that the heart attack only started after Mr Tay had arrived at the workplace.  Put another way, the Respondents are not able to establish on the evidence that there was any accident “in the course” of Mr Tay’s employment, even if one is to adopt the Respondents’ case that the heart attack itself was the “accident”.  That being so, it follows that the presumption in s 3(6) of the Act was not triggered.  It also leads to the conclusion that the Respondents have not been able to prove that Mr Tay’s injury was caused by an accident that arose out of his employment, since there is no other relevant evidence to show that Mr Tay’s work was a cause of him suffering a heart attack.     </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">TA 17/2021</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 Given my views in relation to TA 15/2021, and that the AC’s order for compensation should be set aside, it follows as a matter of course that the order of costs made by the AC in favour of the Respondents should also be set aside.  Since the Respondents are not entitled to the compensation claimed, and not entitled to any costs for the proceedings before the AC, there is no basis for TA 17/2021, and it must be dismissed.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 For the reasons set out above, the Applicants’ appeal in TA 15/2021 is allowed, and the AC’s determination is set aside in its entirety.
