This scheme allows an insolvent debtor to stave off bankruptcy by proposing an arrangement, which creditors may agree to accept, in full satisfaction of their claims. Such a debtor may at the same time apply for an interim order which, in effect, stays bankruptcy applications and prevents continuance of other legal process without leave of court. To obtain approval for a voluntary arrangement, a debtor must submit a proposal and appoint a nominee, who will, if the proposal is approved, supervise its implementation. Once approved by a special resolution of a three-fourths majority, such an arrangement binds all creditors who have notice and are able to vote. Dissatisfied creditors may seek curial intervention under s 54 of the Bankruptcy Act.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 These four applications under s 54 of the Bankruptcy Act are those of four disgruntled creditors applying to set aside the approval obtained at a creditors’ meeting for the proposal of Mr Aathar Ah Kong Andrew (“Mr Aathar”) for a voluntary arrangement.

On these calculations, the threshold for approval of the voluntary arrangement procedure would be met in the first calculation at 80.13% approval, but not the second, where there would be 60% approval only.

In <span class="font-italic">Andrew Fender v The Commissioners of Inland Revenue</span> [2003] EWHC 3543 (Ch) (“<span class="font-italic">Fender</span>”), the (English) High Court summarised the guiding principles at [11] as follows:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) A debtor who puts forward a proposed voluntary arrangement must be not only honest, but should take care to put all relevant facts before creditors. An individual voluntary arrangement must be characterised by complete transparency and good faith by the debtor. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The nominee, when discharging any of his functions, has a duty to exercise a professional independent judgment, informed by his qualifications and skills. In assessing the performance of that obligation, account must be taken of the context in which it is to be performed. A nominee is initially heavily reliant upon the debtor. But where doubts reasonably arise as to the reliability or sufficiency of that information, the nominee must satisfy himself that he has received enough information of adequate quality to arrive at a fair provisional view as to whether a claim should be admitted, and a fair view as to the minimum value to be attributed to any unascertained debt. This will not require him personally to verify every figure: he is involved in a process which is designed to be speedy and robust, and is only required to take reasonable steps.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) A material irregularity may occur in relation to the debtor's proposal, or his statement of affairs, or the preparation of the nominee's report to the court, or in relation to the nominee's chairmanship of the creditors' meeting. The court is concerned to look at the whole process. Not every mistake or omission will found the jurisdiction to set aside the result of the meeting. An irregularity is “material” if, objectively assessed, it would be likely to have made a material difference to the way in which the creditors would have considered and assessed the terms of the proposed voluntary arrangement.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) While the chairman of the creditors' meeting would ordinarily be the nominee (and hence someone experienced in insolvency procedure), he cannot be expected to resolve difficult disputes about debts. If the chairman’s decision is challenged, the court must at the resultant hearing decide the merits based on the evidence adduced in the application. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">15 Two points highlighted in <span class="font-italic">Fender</span> are of particular relevance in this case. The first is that the debtor’s full disclosure is fundamental. In <span class="font-italic">Wah Yuen Electrical Engineering Pte Ltd v Singapore Cables Manufacturers Pte Ltd</span> [2003] 3 SLR(R) 629 held at [24], the Court of Appeal, in the context of a scheme of arrangement, the corporate equivalent of a voluntary arrangement in bankruptcy, stated that it is an “independent principle of law that the creditors [of a company] should be put in possession of such information as is necessary to make a meaningful choice”; therefore, it is of “extreme importance that the [debtor] company furnishes full information as is necessary to make a meaningful choice”. . </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">16 The second relates to the importance placed upon the role and conduct of the nominee, who facilitates the meeting and later administers the arrangement. In <span class="font-italic">Re a Debtor (No 140 of 1995)</span> [1996] 2 BCLC 429, Lindsay J elaborated at 434–436 on the duties of the nominee. He held that where the fullness or candour of the debtor's information has come into question, it “cannot be right for the nominee unquestioningly to accept whatever is put in front of him”, and that it is “fundamental to the intended operation of [voluntary arrangements]” that the proposal which creditors vote on has “survived scrutiny” by an “independent professional insolvency practitioner”. In<span class="font-italic"> </span><span class="font-italic">The Royal Bank of Scotland NV (formerly known as ABN Amro Bank NV) and others v TT International Ltd and another appeal</span> [2012] 2 SLR 213 (“<span class="font-italic">TT International</span>”), the Court of Appeal held, again in the context of a scheme of arrangement, that a scheme manager (the equivalent of a nominee) chairing a creditors’ meeting cannot act “capriciously or arbitrarily, and must determine issues objectively” and transparently (at [67] and [73]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">17 These two expectations are crucial to the efficacy of any voluntary arrangement. A debtor, in putting forward a proposal in order to avoid bankruptcy, bears the onus of showing his <span class="font-italic">bona fides</span> with proper disclosure to his creditors. His nominee, charged with facilitating and implementing the arrangement, must discharge his duties in keeping with his role as a professional, independent, expert. In the case at hand, neither of these two expectations were met. In particular, I found multiple material irregularities, as follows: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) material irregularity on the part of the nominee in dealing with the Litigation Claims under Rule 84 of the Bankruptcy Rules (Cap 20, R 1, 2006 Rev Ed) (“Bankruptcy Rules”); </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) the doubtful veracity of the claims of the Indonesian creditors, which gave rise to material irregularity in their inclusion in the arrangement; </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) a material error in admitting another $20m in relation to Golden Cliff in the Creditors’ Meeting Report, where the nominee had previously decided at the meeting on a sum of some $3m; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) Mr Aathar’s failure to disclose his source of funds for the proposal as required by Rule 68 of the Bankruptcy Rules.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">I deal with each of these in turn below. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The Litigation Claims</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">18 The nominee, in his final adjudication, did not assign any value to the Litigation Claims for the purposes of voting, even though he had, during the second creditors’ meeting on 19 October 2017, agreed to allow the plaintiffs in the Litigation Claims to vote on an “objected to” basis. In the creditors’ meeting report prepared by the nominee, the column “Liabilities as per NOC [<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, notice of claim]” stated a figure above $35m for OUELH, while the column “Adjudicated liabilities” stated “Unable to determine”.

It was submitted that Mr Aathar was not indebted to OUELH at the date of the creditors’ meetings, because OUELH’s claim against Mr Aathar had not been determined by a court. Hence, there was no judgment debt to speak of, and the nominee was correct to assign a “nil” value to OUE’s claim.

</div>
</div> Rule 84(3) of the Bankruptcy Rules, in envisaging a chairman who “agrees to put upon the debt an estimated minimum value”, does not require creditors and nominee to agree <span class="font-italic">with each other</span> to a minimum. Rather, it requires <span class="font-italic">the chairman</span> to agree to set an estimated minimum value. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 In <span class="font-italic">Re a debtor</span><span class="font-italic"> (No 222 of 1990), ex parte the Bank of Ireland and others</span> [1992] BCLC 137 (“<span class="font-italic">Re a debtor</span>”), the chairman in question decided that five creditors were not entitled to vote because their claims were for unliquidated amounts. Harman J’s view was that for unliquidated claims, a chairman was not expected to make protracted investigation. If there was any doubt a chairman should simply “mark the debt as ‘Doubted’, <span class="font-italic">and otherwise admit it</span>” (at p147h). OUELH’s contention was essentially that the nominee had proceeded precisely as suggested by Harman J. He had agreed to admit OUELH’s claim in full at the meeting, on an “objected to” basis. It followed, then, that the $35m claim was admitted as such for the purposes of voting. The nominee, on the other hand, appeared to backtrack from his actions at the meeting, in effect indicating a nil value because of his inability to determine the issue. I thus consider both alternatives. If, on the one hand, the nominee had so agreed to set the minimum sum at $35m as suggested by OUELH, his actions later in ignoring this in his report would result in a miscalculation of the final vote, and a material irregularity. If, on the other hand, as suggested by the nominee’s report, he failed to set a minimum value altogether despite allowing OUELH to vote at the meeting, that too, would be a material irregularity in contravention of Rule 84(6) of the Bankruptcy Rules, which pertains to the second issue I now turn to.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 The second issue relates to how an “objected to” vote could be invalidated.

</div> is supported by<span class="font-italic"> </span>the schema and natural reading of Rule 84(4)-(7) of the Bankruptcy Rules. Looking at the construction of these rules, after Rule 84(1)-(3) sets out how votes are to be valued, Rule 84(4) gives the chairman the power to admit or reject in whole or in part any creditor’s claim. Appeal therefrom is first mentioned in Rule 84(5) in the context of the admission or rejection of claims in Rule 84(4). Rule 84(6) follows on to describe the “objected to” basis where a chairman is in doubt, and Rule 84(7) then discusses the role of the court on an appeal from the chairman’s decision. It is clear from this that any decision as to invalidity is that of the court. As made clear by <span class="font-italic">Fender</span> (see above, at [14(b) and (d)]) and <span class="font-italic">Re a debtor</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>(see above, at [25]), the chairman’s role in facilitating the voting process is intended as a pragmatic one, to ascertain if an arrangement may fairly be brokered amongst creditors holding the value of three-quarters of a debtor’s debts, with any disputes arising to be decided by the court as part of its curial oversight. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 Weatherup J, sitting in the High Court of Northern Ireland, held similarly as follows in <span class="font-italic">Official</span><span class="font-italic"> Receiver v Thompson</span> [2002] NICh 10:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">12 … If the chairman is in doubt about the creditor he should allow the creditor to vote and mark the vote as objected to [r 5.20(6) of the Insolvency Rules (Northern Ireland) 1991, which exactly mirrors 84(6) of the Bankruptcy Rules]. <span class="font-italic">If on appeal the creditor’s vote is declared invalid </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">the court</span> may order another meeting if there has been unfair prejudice or a material irregularity… </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis in italics and bold italics added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 It follows, then, that Rule 84 of the Bankruptcy Rules contemplates that any appeal against the chairman’s decision to admit a vote on an “objected to” basis will be heard by a court. And moreover, on these particular facts, it would have been for Mr Aathar to apply to court to object to the Litigation Claims at the minimum sum at which they were set and ask that they be declared invalid. The nominee ought not to have, instead, subsequently unilaterally ignored the votes for which he had previously settled a sum. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 Finally, the nominee also stated in his report that if OUELH’s claims were admitted in full, there would be an overlap with the claims brought by the Crest Entities.

Harman J, in <span class="font-italic">R</span><span class="font-italic">e a debtor</span>, where, it will be recalled, the chairman held that certain creditors were not entitled to vote, also explained at p.147d of his judgment the rationale of so interpreting the Bankruptcy Rules: if creditors were not entitled to vote, they would not then be bound by the decision, and there would arise therefrom a situation where they would then be able to proceed with statutory demands and have bankruptcy petitions presented in respect of a debtor when there was apparently a binding voluntary arrangement in force. Harman J concluded that “the matter can never be in that state at all.

Mr Aathar claimed that he had mistakenly named Mr Fan as his creditor in the earlier proceedings, and had realised this error only after checking the supporting documents in preparation for the present proceedings.

</div> If that is correct, it is difficult to believe that Mr Aathar would have made such an obvious error, which he described in his affidavit rather quaintly as a “simple mistake”. Furthermore, I note that Mr Fan was made a bankrupt in March 2017, after Mr Aathar’s first attempted voluntary arrangement. As a result, any voting rights that Mr Fan may have had in respect of his alleged debts could only be exercised by his private trustees.

The purpose of the statutory mechanism of a three-fourths majority is to ensure that a minority of creditors holding only a quarter of the debt may not railroad an otherwise beneficial scheme. Where, however, the three-fourths has not been correctly calculated, there is a fundamental irregularity.

It states that PT Cahaya had decided to extend a $3 million loan to Mr Aathar, subject to approval of the proposed voluntary arrangement, and an additional condition that Mr Aathar “continue to remain to assist [it] to explore and advise business and operational opportunities in Indonesia in the healthcare and commodity business”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 This letter was suspect for the following reasons.

</div>
</div> It is difficult to see why Mr Aathar did not include this letter or simply identify PT Cahaya when he first filed his proposal, as it would have been easy for him to do so. Having read the AR’s decision in relation to his first voluntary arrangement, he must have been aware of his duty of candour. It therefore appears that for reasons best known to himself, Mr Aathar was determined to be as economical as he could with information, revealing details only when probed. Second, the letter is dated 20 June 2017, two days <span class="font-italic">after</span> the date on which he signed his proposal. This suggests that the letter was prepared only as an afterthought. Third, the letter was signed off by one Herman, who was also allegedly owed $2 million by Mr Aathar.

Where a good arrangement is struck, all involved benefit as debts may be repaid to the satisfaction of a majority of creditors holding three-quarters of the value of the debtor’s liabilities, obviating the longer process and higher costs of bankruptcy administration.
