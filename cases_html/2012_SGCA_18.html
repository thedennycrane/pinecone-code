        V K Rajah JA (delivering the judgment of the
                court):</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       This is an appeal by two persons, Chan Heng Kong
                    (“Chan”) and Sng Chun Heng (“Sng”), who were
                    convicted and sentenced to the mandatory punishment of death in Criminal Case
                    No 3 of 2009 for committing the following offences:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_1-p2_a"></a>(a)     
            <em>vis-à-vis</em> Chan, the offence of drug trafficking under
                            s 5(1)(<em>a</em>) of the Misuse of Drugs Act
                        (Cap 185, 2001 Rev Ed) (“the MDA”);
                    and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_1-p2_b"></a>(b)     
            <em>vis-à-vis</em> Sng, the offence under
                            s 5(1)(<em>a</em>) read with s 5(2) and
                        s 12 of the MDA of abetting his younger brother, Sng Choong Peng
                        (“Choong Peng”), to traffic in drugs by <em>instigating</em> the latter to be in possession of drugs for the
                        purpose of trafficking.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The respective offences which Chan and Sng were
                    convicted of both related to the same events that occurred on 23 January
                    2008, and the drugs involved consisted of not less than 17.70g of
                    diamorphine.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The background facts</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The parties involved in the events of 23 January 2008</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       There were a total of four persons involved in
                    the events that occurred on 23 January 2008, namely, Chan, Sng, Choong Peng
                    and one Ang Cheng Wan (“Ang”). All four are Singaporeans. As
                    mentioned earlier, Choong Peng is Sng’s younger brother.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       Choong Peng was separately charged and convicted
                    in Criminal Case No 1 of 2009 (“CC 1/2009”) for his
                    involvement in the events of 23 January 2008. However, unlike Sng, he was
                    charged with trafficking in only “not less than 14.99 grams of
                        diamorphine”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> [emphasis in original
                    omitted], and was eventually sentenced to 22 years of imprisonment and 15
                    strokes of the cane. Ang, on the other hand, was initially charged with
                    trafficking in 243.90g of granular substance believed to contain diamorphine.
                    This charge was, however, subsequently withdrawn by the Public Prosecutor during
                    the second pre-trial conference on 30 September 2008. Thereafter, a new
                    charge of drug consumption was preferred against Ang in the Subordinate
                    Courts.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The Prosecution’s summary of the events of 23 January
                2008</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       On the morning of 23 January 2008, two
                    teams of Central Narcotics Bureau (“CNB”) officers conducted
                    surveillance at Block 12 Kampong Arang Road
                    (“Block 12”), where Sng and Choong Peng resided, as well as
                    at Woodlands Checkpoint. At the time, the CNB officers were acting on
                    intelligence received that three Chinese men would, later that day, be receiving
                    illegal drugs from a courier from Malaysia travelling in a silver car with a
                    vehicle registration number containing the digits
                “702”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       At about 1.20pm on the same day, Sng and Choong
                    Peng were seen at the void deck of Block 12. At about 1.45pm, Ang appeared
                    and joined Sng at the void deck of Block 12 while Choong Peng headed in the
                    direction of a nearby circular pavilion located between Block 12 and
                    Block 14 Kampong Arang Road (“Block 14”). Shortly
                    thereafter, Chan was seen driving a silver Toyota Corolla bearing vehicle
                    registration number EP 702P (“EP 702P”) into the car
                    park of Block 12. Chan stopped EP 702P next to the pavilion between
                    Block 12 and Block 14 (“the Pavilion”), alighted and
                    placed a red plastic bag near a rubbish bin at the Pavilion. Chan then returned
                    to EP 702P and parked the car near the lift landing of
                    Block 14.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       A short while later, Choong Peng was seen
                    approaching EP 702P. He entered the front passenger door of EP 702P
                    and was observed engaging in a short conversation with Chan in the car. Choong
                    Peng then alighted from EP 702P and moved towards the Pavilion to retrieve
                    the red plastic bag that had been placed there earlier by Chan. After picking up
                    the red plastic bag, Choong Peng joined Sng and Ang at the car park entrance
                    near Block 12. From there, Sng, Ang and Choong Peng together took a taxi to
                    a public housing estate at Chai Chee Avenue. The CNB officers trailed the trio
                    and arrested them when the taxi stopped at Chai Chee Avenue.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       After the arrest of Sng, Ang and Choong Peng,
                    the red plastic bag which Choong Peng had earlier retrieved from the Pavilion
                    was seized and was found to contain a pack of “Mamee Monster”
                    snacks. Inside this “Mamee Monster” snack pack were smaller packs
                    of “Mamee Monster” snacks containing a total of 30 sachets of
                    white granular substance. The white granular substance was analysed by the
                    Health Sciences Authority (“the HSA”) and was found to contain not
                    less than 17.70g of diamorphine.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       Chan was arrested separately in Geylang on the
                    same day after his encounter with Choong Peng at Block 12. After his
                    arrest, EP 702P was searched by the CNB officers. During the search, a
                    black sling bag containing $7,500 worth of cash in Singapore currency was
                    retrieved from the front passenger seat. Four packs of “Mamee
                    Monster” snacks, each containing smaller “Mamee Monster”
                    snack packs with drug items in them, were also found in a white paper bag
                    bearing the label “Estebel 1833” (“the ‘Estebel
                    1833’ bag”) on the rear passenger seat. These drug items were
                    analysed by the HSA and were found to contain not less than 71.57g of
                    diamorphine.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     Subsequent to the arrest of Sng, Choong Peng,
                    Chan and Ang, a search was also conducted at Sng’s bedroom in his
                    residence at unit #04-11 of Block 12 (“the Flat”), in
                    the course of which more drugs were found. These drugs were analysed by the HSA
                    and were found to contain not less than 11.97g of diamorphine.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The charges against Sng and Chan</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     Multiple charges were initially preferred
                    against Sng and Chan.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span> However, all those charges, save
                    for the ones which Sng and Chan were convicted of in the court below
                        (see <a href="#p1_1">[1]</a> above), were eventually
                    stood down when the trial commenced. The charges proceeded with read as

<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Sng’s and Chan’s respective cases at the trial</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     The case put forth by Sng at the trial was as
                    follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_12-p2_a"></a>(a)     Sng claimed that he had ordered 20
                        and <em>not</em> 30 sachets of heroin to be delivered
                        on 23 January 2008;<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_12-p2_b"></a>(b)     Sng revealed that he was a consumer of heroin, and that
                        half of the 20 sachets which he had allegedly ordered were for his own
                        consumption while the other half were for sale;<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_5" id="Ftn_5_1"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_12-p2_c"></a>(c)     Sng alleged that there was a mix-up and contamination of
                        the drug exhibits at the CNB’s premises, which rendered it unsafe for
                        the court to convict him of a capital charge;<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_6" id="Ftn_6_1"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_12-p2_d"></a>(d)     Sng challenged the admissibility of
                        and the weight (if any) to be attached to the statements which he gave to
                        the CNB officers after his arrest; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_12-p2_e"></a>(e)     Sng claimed that he did not instigate Choong Peng to be
                        in possession of the drugs for the purpose of trafficking.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_7" id="Ftn_7_1"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     As for the case advanced by Chan at the trial,
                    it was as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_13-p2_a"></a>(a)     Chan did not dispute that he had
                        possession of the five packs of “Mamee Monster” snacks which
                        he brought from Malaysia to Singapore in EP 702P on 23 January
                        2008 (<em>viz</em>, the pack found in the red plastic
                        bag which Choong Peng retrieved from the Pavilion (see <a href="#p1_8">[8]</a> above) and the four packs found in the
                        “Estebel 1833” bag in EP 702P (see <a href="#p1_9">[9]</a> above)), one of which (<em>viz</em>, the pack mentioned at <a href="#p1_8">[8]</a> above) he placed near a rubbish bin at the Pavilion on

                        knowledge that these “Mamee Monster” snack packs contained
                        illegal drugs. In particular, Chan raised the following points during the
                        trial to establish his lack of <em>mens </em><em>rea</em> for the offence charged:</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_13-p2_a-p3_i"></a>(i)       he thought he was only
                            engaged in an illegal moneylending transaction on 23 January

                            himself that the “Mamee Monster” snack packs did not

                            with his fingers, and had found nothing suspicious about that

                            Chan stated that the checking had been done in respect of “Mamee

                            occasion, and not in respect of the “Mamee Monster” snack
                            packs which he brought from Malaysia to Singapore in EP 702P on

                            visible position on the rear passenger seat of EP 702P when he was
                            passing Woodlands Checkpoint on 23 January 2008;<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_11" id="Ftn_11_1"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span>

<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_13-p2_a-p3_v"></a>(v)       the
                            fact that he did not put up a struggle when he was arrested also
                            suggested that he had no knowledge that the “Mamee
                            Monster” snack packs contained illegal drugs.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_12" id="Ftn_12_1"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_13-p2_b"></a>(b)     Apart from the lack of <em>mens </em><em>rea</em>, Chan also
                        alleged that his statements to the CNB officers were inaccurately
                            recorded.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_13" id="Ftn_13_1"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_13-p2_c"></a>(c)     In addition, like Sng, Chan alleged

                        CNB’s premises, which rendered it unsafe for the court to convict him
                        of a capital charge.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_14" id="Ftn_14_1"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     The above arguments of Chan and Sng were
                    rejected by the trial judge (“the Judge”), who convicted the two
                    men of the respective capital charges brought against them (see <em>Public Prosecutor v Sng Chun Heng and another</em> [2011]
                    3 SLR 437 (“the GD”)). Both Chan and Sng appealed. The
                    appeal was heard on 16 March 2011, at the end of which we reserved
                    judgment. On 7 April 2011, counsel for Sng, Mr Wong Siew Hong
                    (“Mr Wong”), obtained leave to file further written
                    submissions, which submissions were subsequently filed on 20 April 2011.
                    The Prosecution’s reply to Sng’s further written submissions was
                    filed on 3 May 2011. As one of the central arguments made by Mr Wong
                    –
                    <em>viz</em>, that relating to the exercise of the
                    Attorney-General’s prosecutorial discretion (see <a href="#p1_16">[16]</a> below at sub-para (c) as well as
                        <a href="#p1_40">[40]</a> below) – had also been raised
                    in Criminal Motion No 60 of 2011 (“CM 60/2011”), we
                    deferred the determination of this appeal until we had decided the outcome of
                    CM 60/2011 (see <em>Ramalingam </em><em>Ravinthran v Attorney-General</em> [2012] SGCA 2
                        (“<em>Ramalingam </em><em>Ravinthran v AG</em>”) for our decision on that
                    matter).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The issues in the present appeal</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     Having regard to the arguments raised by
                    counsel for Chan, Mr Cheong Aik Chye (“Mr Cheong”), and
                    the Prosecution, the key issues to be determined in this appeal in so far as
                    Chan is concerned are as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_15-p2_a"></a>(a)     whether Chan had the requisite
                            <em>mens </em><em>rea</em> for
                        the offence which he was charged with; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_15-p2_b"></a>(b)     whether there was a mix-up and/or contamination
                        of the drug exhibits at the CNB’s premises such that it would be
                        unsafe for Chan’s conviction to be upheld.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     As for the issues to be determined in respect
                    of Sng, they are as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_16-p2_a"></a>(a)     whether the Judge was correct in
                        holding that the defence of consumption raised by Sng at the trial was
                        irrelevant to the offence which Sng was charged with;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_16-p2_b"></a>(b)     whether the Judge was correct to
                        accept that there was abetment by instigation on Sng’s
                    part;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_16-p2_c"></a>(c)     whether the
                        Prosecution could choose between prosecuting Sng for abetting the
                        trafficking of a quantity of heroin which carried the capital punishment on
                        conviction and prosecuting him for abetting the trafficking of a (smaller)
                        quantity of heroin which did not carry such punishment on conviction;
                        and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_16-p2_d"></a>(d)     whether
                        there was a mix-up and/or contamination of the drug exhibits at the
                        CNB’s premises such that it would be unsafe for Sng’s conviction
                        to be upheld.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     We will deal with the issues in the order
                    stated above, beginning with the issues relating to Chan’s
                    conviction.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Our analysis and decision</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Apropos Chan</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Whether the mens rea for the offence was present</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     As mentioned earlier, Chan denied having
                    knowledge of the true contents of the “Mamee Monster” snack pack
                        (<em>ie</em>, the big “Mamee Monster”
                    snack pack containing the smaller “Mamee Monster” snack packs)
                    which he delivered to Choong Peng at the Pavilion on 23 January 2008. His
                    counsel, Mr Cheong, argued that “[t]he learned trial judge erred by
                    failing to consider or give sufficient weight to the fact and evidence that half
                    the content[s] of the ‘mamee’ packet in question actually contained
                    dried noodles”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_15" id="Ftn_15_1"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     In particular, Mr Cheong pointed out that
                    prior to the delivery on 23 January 2008, Chan had on 19 January 2008
                    been similarly involved in another delivery of some “Mamee
                    Monster” snack packs in exchange for $8,500 in cash. On that earlier
                    occasion, it was claimed, Chan had checked the contents of one of the
                    “Mamee Monster” snack packs by touching and feeling the snack pack
                    with his fingers, and had been satisfied that it contained noodles and
                        seasoning.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_16" id="Ftn_16_1"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span> This,
                    Mr Cheong contended, caused Chan to believe that the “Mamee
                    Monster” snack packs which he subsequently brought from Malaysia to
                    Singapore in EP 702P on 23 January 2008 were what they purported to
                    be. Chan maintained that he honestly believed that he was engaging in money
                    collection, with the “Mamee Monster” snack packs being nothing
                    more than some kind of “‘code’
                        ‘signal’”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_17" id="Ftn_17_1"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a></span> that
                    was required in order for the transaction to be consummated.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     This argument was dealt with quite extensively
                    by the Judge and we see no reason to disturb his decision to reject it. At
                    [75]–[77] of the GD, the Judge explained his reasons for dismissing this
                    argument as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">75    Chan was not a naïve young man stepping out into
                            the working world. He had been in business in the USA and was an
                            experienced 47-year-old adult at the material time. Any person of
                            average intelligence and honesty would have realised immediately that
                            the task given to Chan was not merely one of collecting money. No reason
                            was given to Chan as to why he had to drive to Malaysia, have some cheap
                            common foodstuff placed in his car and to deliver the packets to
                            Singapore. The fact that relatively large amounts of cash were handed
                            over to Chan each time he passed those seemingly worthless and
                            lightweight foodstuff to its intended recipient would have awakened him
                            to the reality that he was delivering illegal goods and very likely
                            drugs, judging by the light weight and the small size of the
                            items.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">76    It was also obvious that Chan was given no
                            instructions on how much money to collect and the person(s) to collect
                            it from. In fact, strangers met him in Malaysia each time in suspicious
                            circumstances. Further, the payment Chan received for merely driving
                            across borders to pass small and light packages was surely totally
                            disproportionate to the efforts and time involved. The manner of
                            delivery on 23 January 2008 was also highly suspicious as a plastic
                            bag containing foodstuff was to be left near a rubbish bin unattended.
                            Further, after Choong Peng handed over the cash, Chan drove his car away
                            without counting the money. He could not have been in such a hurry to
                            meet his friends for lunch, as he claimed. It was more likely that he
                            was anxious to leave the location knowing that he had delivered illegal
                            substances. As he said in one of his statements to the CNB, “I
                            was simply concerned about making the money and not get
                            arrested”.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">77    Clearly, Chan ought to have been highly suspicious
                            about the nature of his work and the things that were placed in his car
                            in Malaysia. However, he did not bother to enquire because the reward
                            was good and he needed the money. His conduct amounted to wilful
                            blindness and he must therefore be taken to have known the nature of the
                            drugs that he was in possession of and which he delivered. Although he
                            did not hand the package physically to Choong Peng, what he did that day
                            at Kampong Arang Road was sufficient delivery in law as possession was
                            transferred and in the manner arranged between the two
                        men.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     Most of the above findings by the Judge were
                    based on Chan’s long statements recorded on 25, 27 and 29 January
                        2008,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_18" id="Ftn_18_1"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a></span> the admissibility of which was
                    not challenged at the trial (only the <em>accuracy</em> of
                    these statements were challenged by Chan at the trial (see <a href="#p1_13">[13]</a> above at sub-para (b) as well as
                        <a href="#p1_23">[23]</a> below)). We should also add that
                    Chan repeatedly admitted to having suspected that the delivery which he was
                    tasked to carry out at the material time involved the smuggling of illegal
                    drugs. In his contemporaneous statement recorded on 23 January
                        2008,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_19" id="Ftn_19_1"><sup>[note: 19]</sup></a></span> Chan replied to the question posed to
                    him as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">Q11:</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">

                        be sentenced to death due to this, I will accept it. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Finally, in his long statements recorded on 25, 27 and 29 January
                    2008, Chan stated:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_21" id="Ftn_21_1"><sup>[note: 21]</sup></a></span></p>

                            ‘Franky’. This was at the Casino ship at Harbour Front.
                            … Franky came up and started a conversation. He asked me whether
                            I wanted a job. I asked him what job it was and he said delivery. I said
                            ok and I passed him my number. I told him to call me when there is a
                            need. He did not tell me what kind of delivery. <em>I
                                suspected that it was smuggling of things</em>. Franky also
                            did not tell me about the payment. He did say the payment would be
                            handsome. …</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">17.    Back at home, on the same day, on the
                            19 January [2008], I counted the stack of notes [this was after
                            Chan made the delivery mentioned at [19] above]. There was $8500
                            altogether. I feel that I had delivered something illegal but I do not
                            know exactly what it was. <em>I thought it may be drugs
                                but I cannot be sure</em>. Tommy [a person who had given
                            instructions to Chan over the phone on 18 and 19 January 2008] had
                            told me over the phone that I do not have to ask too many things and
                            just do the delivery. <em>I did not want to think about
                                it too as I know that it was something

                            EP 702P after Chan’s arrest]. To me, I understand that the
                            ‘big’ means the packets of Mamee noodles and the
                            ‘small’ means the packets of ‘Pagoda’ peanuts. I
                            did check in the white paper bag and I confirm that there were five

                    [2011] 4 SLR 1156 (“<em>Nagaenthran</em>”) clarified the position on wilfulness. In
                        <em>Nagaenthran</em>, we stated (at [23]) <em>vis-à-vis</em>
                    the presumption of knowledge set out in s 18(2) of the Misuse of Drugs Act

                    mentioned at <a href="#p1_21">[21]</a> above were alleged by Chan
                    at the trial to have been inaccurately recorded. In his petition of appeal, Chan
                    similarly alleged that “several sentences were either twisted,

<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The alleged mix-up and/or contamination of the drug
                exhibits</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     We now turn to the issue of whether there was
                    a mix-up and/or contamination of the drug exhibits at the CNB’s premises
                    such that it would be unsafe for this court to uphold Chan’s conviction of
                    the capital charge brought against him. In the closing submissions for Chan at
                    the trial, it was submitted:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_25" id="Ftn_25_1"><sup>[note: 25]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[Chan] testified there was pouring of drug exhibits all together into one
                        container at the weighing room by ASP Senthil Kumaran and some white
                        powdery substance spilling over on the table and onto the floor. It was put
                        to ASP Kumaran that was so by [Chan]. [Chan] also told [ASP] Adam
                        Tan of mixed up at the exhibit photo-taking room and weighing room but was
                        ignored and this happened before [Sng] was brought in. It is humbly
                        submitted as the net weight is 17.70 grams of diamorphine and the death
                        penalty threshold for diamorphine trafficking is 15 grams, the mixed-up
                        as submitted, no matter how slight the chances are of a mixed-up, it cannot
                        be ruled out and therefore it is not safe to find [Chan] culpable as
                        charged.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">It should be noted that Sng likewise complained that there was a
                    mix-up and contamination of the drug exhibits at the CNB’s premises. Like
                    Chan, Sng alluded to the possibility of contamination of the drugs found inside
                    the red plastic bag which Chan delivered to Choong Peng at the Pavilion on
                    23 January 2008. Sng alleged that during the weighing process at the
                    CNB’s premises, “some <em>peh </em><em>hoon</em> dropped onto the floor around the weighing
                        scale”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_26" id="Ftn_26_1"><sup>[note: 26]</sup></a></span> and “[the] <em>peh </em><em>hoon</em> … that dropped was
                    collected and put back onto the weighing scale”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_27" id="Ftn_27_1"><sup>[note: 27]</sup></a></span>
                    Sng also claimed that there was a possibility of a mix-up between the three
                    batches of drugs seized on 23 January 2008 because there was a break in the
                    chain of custody of: (a) the drugs seized from Chan (<em>ie</em>, the drugs found in the “Estebel 1833” bag in
                    EP 702P (see <a href="#p1_9">[9]</a> above));
                    (b) the drugs seized from the taxi which Sng, Ang and Choong Peng took to
                    Chai Chee Avenue (<em>ie</em>, the drugs found in the red
                    plastic bag which Chan delivered to Choong Peng at the Pavilion
                        (see <a href="#p1_8">[8]</a> above)); and (c) the
                    drugs seized from Sng’s bedroom in the Flat (see <a href="#p1_10">[10]</a> above).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     However, it was revealed during Sng’s
                    cross-examination that the alleged spillage was not a spillage which involved
                    the drugs spilling out of the sachets in which they were contained:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_28" id="Ftn_28_1"><sup>[note: 28]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">Q</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">Now, Mr Sng, right, coming to the part about
                            what you witnessed in the measuring room. Now, are you sure what you saw
                            was not a case where the <em>peh </em><em>hoon</em> [<em>ie</em>, heroin]
                            that was still in plastic bag being put on the weighing scale for
                            weighing?</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">A</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">What I saw was the heroin were in the – in
                            – in the bags – in the bags and they poured – and they
                            poured it onto the weighing scale. They were in sachets.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">Q</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">Now so – which means that the drugs were not
                            in direct contact with the weighing scale, it was still in the
                            respective bags. Are you trying to tell us that?</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">A</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">Yes, they were in sach – the heroin were in
                            sachets and some dropped.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">Q</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">Okay. So now you have clarified that the drugs were
                            still in the sachet bags, right, it’s not – not in its
                            powdery form on the weighing scale</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">A</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">No, in sachet.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1">The implication of this evidence is that, assuming the alleged
                    drug spillage did indeed occur, it was not material to the quantity of heroin in
                    the sachets that was later determined to be present by the HSA. We also agree
                    with the Judge’s finding that there was no mix-up between the drug
                    exhibits seized from the different locations on 23 January 2008. As pointed
                    out by the Prosecution in its closing submissions for the trial,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_29" id="Ftn_29_1"><sup>[note: 29]</sup></a></span> the three batches of drug exhibits
                    seized on 23 January 2008 were all different in form and
                        packaging.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_30" id="Ftn_30_1"><sup>[note: 30]</sup></a></span> Further, it is evident from the photographs
                    tendered at the trial<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_31" id="Ftn_31_1"><sup>[note: 31]</sup></a></span> that the drug exhibits
                    were methodically unpacked, photographed and weighed (see the GD at [13]). Lastly, we note that Sng and Chan
                    declined to call Choong Peng and Ang (who were present when the photographs of
                    the drug exhibits were taken) as witnesses to corroborate their allegations even
                    though the Prosecution invited them to do so.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_32" id="Ftn_32_1"><sup>[note: 32]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     In the circumstances, Sng’s and
                    Chan’s allegations regarding the possible contamination and mix-up of the
                    drug exhibits were, in our view, without substance.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Apropos Sng</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The defence of consumption raised by Sng</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     We turn now to the issues pertaining to
                    Sng’s conviction. In respect of the defence of consumption raised by Sng
                    at the trial, the question which we have to decide is whether this defence is
                    relevant to the offence which Sng was charged with. The Judge rejected this
                    defence, holding (at [71] of the GD):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Sng claimed in court that he consumed some five straws of heroin per day.
                        Firstly, the charge against Sng relates to instigation and the trafficking
                        of heroin alleged concerns Choong Peng. There was no doubt that Choong Peng
                        was collecting the heroin on Sng’s behalf and would pass it on to him.
                        That amounted to delivery of, or at least an offer to deliver, the heroin
                        (see the definition of “traffic” in s 2 MDA). <em>Sng’s intention concerning the heroin and his alleged
                            addiction and consumption habit would therefore be irrelevant to the
                            charge. As the Prosecution observed, even if all 30 sachets in question
                            were meant for Sng’s consumption, the charge would have been made
                            out</em>. … [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     We agree with the Judge’s decision on
                    this point. We also agree with the Judge that Sng’s defence of consumption
                    was not factually tenable. The Judge carefully evaluated Sng’s purported
                    heroin consumption pattern against the other evidence to test the veracity of
                    Sng’s assertion (<em>viz</em>, that he consumed some
                    five straws of heroin daily) before concluding that this assertion was not true.
                    The Judge’s reasoning was as follows (see the GD at [71]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… In any event, there was no credible evidence of a discernible
                        consumption pattern. The medical examination of Sng revealed only mild drug
                        withdrawal symptoms. In his statements, he started with a claim of one straw
                        over two days and moved upwards to four to five straws per day or one
                        eight-gram sachet of heroin per day. Sng’s assertion that he set aside
                        ten sachets for his own consumption only crystallised in his statement of
                        19 February 2008, almost a month after his arrest. Initially, he merely
                        said that the 30 sachets were for sale and for consumption without
                        specifying the proportions. In the later statement, he stated that ten
                        sachets out of 30 ordered were for consumption. The evidence changed to ten
                        sachets out of 20 ordered when he gave his testimony in court. I found his
                        self-serving estimate of his consumption pattern hard to believe in view of
                        the constant changes in his evidence. Further, his alleged consumption habit
                        would not be sustainable considering his income. According to him, he had to
                        borrow between $3,500 and $5,000 for each purchase of heroin.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     Before us, counsel for Sng, Mr Wong,
                    sought to modify the argument made at the trial <em>vis-à-vis</em> consumption, claiming that at least 2.71g of the
                    17.70g of heroin found in the red plastic bag delivered by Chan to Choong Peng
                    on 23 January 2008 was intended for Sng’s own
                        consumption:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_33" id="Ftn_33_1"><sup>[note: 33]</sup></a></span></p>

                                report of Dr Choo. Dr Choo had reported that [Sng] is an

                                contain about 0.1g nett of heroin and 2.71g therefore represents

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[underlining in original]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     We are not persuaded by this argument because
                    it relies on the very same estimate of Sng’s drug consumption pattern
                        (<em>ie</em>, consumption at the rate of four to five
                    straws of heroin per day) which the Judge rightly found to be

<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The charge of abetment against Sng</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     We now turn to the issue of whether there was
                    abetment by instigation on Sng’s part on 23 January 2008. In this
                    regard, Mr Wong initially argued that Sng’s statements were taken
                    irregularly and also recorded inaccurately. For example, it was argued that Sng
                    never said the words, “It was me to ask him [<em>ie</em>, Choong Peng] to collect from someone”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_34" id="Ftn_34_1"><sup>[note: 34]</sup></a></span> and
                    “I will ask my brother [<em>ie</em>, Choong Peng]
                    collect for me”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_35" id="Ftn_35_1"><sup>[note: 35]</sup></a></span> as recorded in a
                    statement taken from Sng on 23 January 2008 – words which
                    Mr Wong accepted were material to whether the offence of abetment by
                    instigation was made out.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_36" id="Ftn_36_1"><sup>[note: 36]</sup></a></span> Instead, it was argued, Sng used
                    the words, “He [<em>ie</em>, Choong Peng] went down
                    to collect on his own”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_37" id="Ftn_37_1"><sup>[note: 37]</sup></a></span> and “He [<em>ie</em>, Choong Peng] went down on his

                    these complaints were abandoned in Mr Wong’s further written
                    submissions filed on 20 April 2011, where it was stated:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_39" id="Ftn_39_1"><sup>[note: 39]</sup></a></span></p>

                        [(1985 Rev Ed)], s 12 of the [MDA] does not provide any specific
                        definition of abetment. It merely states that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">Any person who abets the commission of or who attempts to commit or

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     To make good the offence of abetment by
                    instigation, there has to be “active suggestion, support, stimulation or
                    encouragement” of the primary offence (see, <em>eg</em>, <em>Public Prosecutor v Lim Tee
                        Hian</em> [1991] 2 SLR(R) 393 at [51] and <em>Balakrishnan S and another v Public Prosecutor</em>
                    [2005] 4 SLR(R) 249 at [66]). In <em>Public
                        Prosecutor v Ng Ai Tiong</em> [2000] 1 SLR(R) 1, it was
                    stated at [23] (quoting from the
                    Indian case of <em>Baby John v State</em> [1953]
                    Cri LJ 1273 at 1274) that instigation could come in the form of
                    “express solicitation or … hints, insinuations or
                    encouragement”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     In several local cases, the courts have held
                    that the circumstances showed that no form of instigation was made out. For
                    instance, in <em>Jimina </em><em>Jacee d/o
                        C D Athananasius v Public Prosecutor</em> [1999]
                    3 SLR(R) 826 (“<em>Jimina </em><em>Jacee</em>”), the High Court found that the charge
                    against the appellant of abetment by instigation of cheating was not made out
                    because the principal offenders had prior knowledge of the appellant’s
                    elaborate scam to get certain Sri Lankans on board a Sydney-bound aircraft
                    without the requisite entry visas. At [32] of <em>Jimina </em><em>Jacee</em>, Yong Pung How CJ held:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In this instance, it was undisputed that the principal offence of cheating
                        which the appellant had abetted was committed by each principal offender.
                        The question was whether she had abetted the commission of the offence by
                        instigation. Reverting to the particulars of the respective charges, all
                        that was alleged was that the appellant had delivered the air tickets to the
                        principal offender and had collected the boarding pass from him on
                        15 April 1997 at T1 [<em>ie</em>, Chang
                        Airport Terminal 1]. The Prosecution submitted in the court below that
                        these acts were sufficient to constitute active support or encouragement of
                        the commission of the offence of abetment by instigation. In my opinion,
                        these acts would not <em>per se</em> constitute
                        abetment by instigation. Apart from Karnan [one of the principal offenders]
                        who testified that the appellant had told each of the principal offenders
                        that they would get paid after they had given her their boarding passes,
                        none of the other principal offenders gave evidence of such a promise. The
                        only reasonable explanation why they obeyed the appellant’s
                        instructions to check-in was because they already knew about the scam from
                        Karnan before they arrived at T1 and were prepared to carry it out,
                        once they obtained the air tickets from the appellant. In my view, it could
                        not be said that the appellant had actively stimulated or encouraged the
                        principal offenders to commit the offence of cheating by the act of
                        distributing the tickets and collecting the boarding passes from
                        them.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     Similarly, in the case of <em>Whang Sung Lin v Public Prosecutor</em> [2010] 2 SLR 958
                        (“<em>Whang Sung Lin</em>”), where the
                    appellant was charged with abetting by instigation the sale of a kidney, Tay
                    Yong Kwang J held at [37]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The appellant could hardly be said to be “actively suggesting,
                        supporting, stimulating or encouraging” them [<em>ie</em>, Tang, the intended recipient of the kidney, and Wang,
                        who was prepared to source for a willing kidney donor in return for
                        remuneration] to do the transaction, although his wish must be that they
                        would do so and at the price agreed between him and Wang earlier. …
                        [N]either Tang nor Wang needed any goading or encouragement. They only
                        needed to be introduced to each other and everything flowed smoothly and
                        quickly from then on without any input from the appellant. The only goading
                        that the appellant did was to tell Wang to charge more in Tang’s case
                        but that was in the context of “If Tang needed a kidney, (the
                        appellant) asked me to charge a fee”. It was certainly not to urge a
                        reluctant or ambivalent Wang to enter into the transaction. It was at the
                        meeting (at the Ya Kun food outlet at Funan Centre) when the appellant was
                        going to pass Wang's mobile telephone number to Tang that the figure of
                        $300,000 was suggested by the appellant and agreed between him and Wang. If
                        the suggestion to charge $300,000 was an instigation, it is clear that the
                        illegal transaction was not “committed in consequence of the
                        instigation” (see the words in the Explanation to s 109 of the
                        Penal Code [(Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed) (“the Penal Code
                        (2008 Rev Ed)”)] …) as Wang was already going to do the
                        transaction if Tang should call, with or without that suggestion. As
                        mentioned above, the suggestion came about only because Tang was a wealthy
                        man and both Wang and the appellant obviously hoped to make as much money
                        out of his ill health as possible. Clearly, the offence was committed
                        “with the aid” (see again the words in the Explanation to
                        s 109 and also Explanation 2 in s 107 of the Penal Code
                        [(2008 Rev Ed)] …) or help of the appellant in introducing Tang
                        to Wang in return for a fee.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">In both <em>Jimina </em><em>Jacee</em> and <em>Whang Sung Lin</em>, the High
                    Court amended the charges against the respective appellants to that of abetment
                    by <em>aiding</em> and convicted them of the amended
                    charges.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     Returning to the present appeal, at the
                    hearing before us, Mr Wong argued that Sng should not have been charged
                    with the offence of abetment by instigation. We agree with this submission for
                    the following reasons. First, there was no need for Sng to goad or encourage
                    Choong Peng into collecting the heroin that was delivered by Chan on
                    23 January 2008. Based on Sng’s long statement recorded on
                    28 January 2008, Choong Peng had already previously collected heroin for
                    Sng on two to three occasions prior to 23 January 2008:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_40" id="Ftn_40_1"><sup>[note: 40]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In the beginning, I would do the collecting of the peh hoon [<em>ie</em>, heroin]. However, Ah Peng, my younger brother
                            [<em>ie</em>, Choong Peng], has collected the peh
                        hoon for me on two to three occasions. I did tell Ah Peng before that the
                        thing that he is collecting from [<em>sic</em>] me is
                        peh hoon.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">This statement confirms that Choong Peng was already in the habit of
                    collecting heroin for Sng by 23 January 2008, and, as such, would not have
                    needed any goading or encouragement to collect the heroin delivered by Chan on
                    23 January 2008.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     Second, Choong Peng had prior knowledge of the
                    contents of the red plastic bag which he collected from Chan on 23 January
                    2008. Although Sng initially claimed in his cautioned statement recorded on
                    24 January 2008 that Choong Peng “did not know about the
                        heroin”,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_41" id="Ftn_41_1"><sup>[note: 41]</sup></a></span> this was plainly contradicted by
                    Sng’s subsequent long statement recorded on 28 January 2008 where Sng
                        stated:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_42" id="Ftn_42_1"><sup>[note: 42]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… [After Choong Peng collected the red plastic bag from Chan,] I
                        saw [Choong Peng] walking towards me with [the] plastic bag. I knew that he
                        has collected the peh hoon [<em>ie</em>, heroin]. I
                        asked him whether he wants to go to Chai Chee with me. [Choong Peng] said ok
                        as he had nothing to do. … I asked [Choong Peng] whether he has
                        passed the $5500 to the man [<em>ie</em>, Chan]. He
                        said yes. <em>[Choong Peng] and I then talked about this
                            person who delivered the peh </em><em>hoon. We
                            agreed that it was not the ‘brother’ from previous
                            deliveries</em>. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">In any case, the statement of facts which Choong Peng accepted without
                    qualification in CC 1/2009 clearly indicated that Choong Peng was well
                    aware that he was collecting heroin on behalf of Sng on 23 January 2008.
                    Paragraph 7 of that statement of facts reads as follows:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_43" id="Ftn_43_1"><sup>[note: 43]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Investigations reveal that sometime before noon on 23 January 2008,
                        [Choong Peng] was asked by [Sng] to collect <em>peh
                            </em><em>hoon</em> [<em>ie</em>, heroin] on his behalf. [Sng] informed [Choong Peng] that
                        someone will be delivering the drugs to him. [Sng] passed a handphone
                        … to [Choong Peng]. [Sng] told [Choong Peng] that the drug courier
                        will call up on the handphone to arrange for the delivery of the drugs.
                        [Sng] also handed over to [Choong Peng] a stack of $50 notes which amounted
                        to S$5,500 with the instruction to pass the money to the courier for payment
                        of the drugs. [Choong Peng] was to hand over the drugs to [Sng]
                        subsequently.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     On this evidence, it would be difficult for
                    the court to agree that there was abetment by instigation on Sng’s part.
                    Mr Wong argued that based on the evidence, the charge against Sng should be
                    amended to one of drug trafficking in furtherance of a common intention between
                    Sng and Choong Peng to traffic.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_44" id="Ftn_44_1"><sup>[note: 44]</sup></a></span> However, we are of the view
                    that the proven facts show, more appropriately, abetment by aiding on
                    Sng’s part as Sng gave Choong Peng the $5,500 in cash which had to be paid
                    to Chan in order to take delivery of the drugs from Chan on 23 January
                    2008. Accordingly, just as the court did in <em>Jimina
                        </em><em>Jacee</em> and <em>Whang
                        Sung Lin</em> (see <a href="#p1_36">[36]</a>
                    above), we order that the charge against Sng be amended from that of abetment by
                    instigation to that of abetment by aiding, and convict Sng of the amended
                    charge.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The Prosecution’s decision to bring a capital charge against
                Sng but not against Choong Peng</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     Another ground based on which Mr Wong
                    sought to challenge Sng’s conviction was that the Prosecution violated
                    Art 12 of the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore (1985 Rev Ed,
                    1999 Reprint) (“the Constitution”) in charging Sng with a
                    capital offence and Choong Peng with a non-capital offence when the charges
                    arose from the same events that led to both men (among others) being arrested on
                    23 January 2008.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_45" id="Ftn_45_1"><sup>[note: 45]</sup></a></span>
                    This argument was recently rejected by this court in <em>Ramalingam </em><em>Ravinthran v AG</em>, and we
                    do not propose to repeat what this court stated at [70]–[72] of that
                    judgment. As Mr Wong was unable to substantiate his case that the
                    Attorney-General, in his capacity as the Public Prosecutor, had exercised his
                    prosecutorial discretion based on irrelevant considerations, we dismiss this
                    argument.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     Mr Wong also raised a separate argument
                    on which Art 12 of the Constitution has a bearing. This argument concerns
                    the interpretation of the words “that offence” in s 12 of the
                    MDA (reproduced at <a href="#p1_32">[32]</a> above), the
                    full text of which is set out again below for ease of reference:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-Heading1">
<b>Abetments and attempts
                            punishable as offences</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>12</b>.    Any person who abets
                            the commission of or who attempts to commit or does any act preparatory
                            to, or in furtherance of, the commission of any offence under this Act
                            shall be guilty of <em>that offence</em> and shall
                            be liable on conviction to the punishment provided for <em>that </em><em>offence</em>.
                            [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     The expression “that offence”
                    appears twice in s 12 of the MDA. From a textual reading of the section,
                    “that offence” refers to “any offence under this
                    Act”. On this premise, Mr Wong contended that the words “that
                    offence” in s 12 (and by extension, the words “any offence
                    under this Act” as well) referred to the offence which Choong Peng
                    committed. This, on Mr Wong’s reading of s 12 of the MDA, meant
                    that the quantity of diamorphine in respect of which Sng was charged as an
                    abettor in the present case must be the same as the quantity of diamorphine
                    which Choong Peng was convicted of trafficking in CC 1/2009 (<em>ie</em>, “not less than 14.99 grams of
                        diamorphine”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_46" id="Ftn_46_1"><sup>[note: 46]</sup></a></span> [emphasis in original
                    omitted]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     We are unable to agree with this submission.
                    In our view, the words “that offence” in s 12 of the MDA
                    refer to the offence which the Prosecution is able to prove against an accused
                    on the admissible evidence. In the present case, the offence that could have
                    been proved against Choong Peng is that of trafficking in 30 packets of
                    substance containing not less than 17.70g of diamorphine, and, accordingly, he
                    too could have been charged with a capital offence. However, the commission of
                    an offence by an offender does not necessarily result in his being charged for
                    that particular offence. As fully explained by this court in <em>Ramalingam </em><em>Ravinthran v AG</em>, the
                    Attorney-General, as the Public Prosecutor, may exercise his prosecutorial
                    discretion to charge two or more offenders engaged in the same criminal
                    enterprise with different offences punishable with different punishments
                    according to (<em>inter alia</em>) their culpability in the
                    carrying out of that criminal enterprise. He is not required by law to charge
                    all offenders involved in a criminal enterprise with the same offence, be it a
                    capital offence or a non-capital offence, provided that his decision is neither
                    biased nor made as a result of taking into consideration irrelevant matters (see
                        <em>Ramalingam </em><em>Ravinthran v
                        AG</em> at [51]–[53]).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The alleged mix-up and/or contamination of the drug
                exhibits</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     As for the alleged mix-up and/or contamination
                    of the drug exhibits at the CNB’s premises, which Sng (like Chan) also
                    raised as a ground of appeal (see sub-para (d) of <a href="#p1_16">[16]</a> above), we discussed this earlier in respect of
                    Chan’s case and, as stated at <a href="#p1_25">[25]</a>–<a href="#p1_26">[26]</a> above, we
                    are of the view that Sng’s complaint in this regard likewise has no
                    merit.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     For the reasons stated above, we dismiss this
                    appeal where Chan’s conviction is concerned. As regards Sng’s
                    conviction for the offence of abetment by instigation of the trafficking of not
                    less than 17.70g of diamorphine, we amend this charge to that of abetment by
                    aiding of the trafficking of the same quantity of diamorphine and convict him of
                    the amended charge. In the result, this appeal is dismissed in respect of both
                    Chan and Sng.</p>
