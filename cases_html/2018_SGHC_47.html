We agree with the Disciplinary Tribunal that the Respondent’s conduct with regard to both charges constituted “grossly improper conduct” within the meaning of s 83(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the Legal Profession Act (Cap 161, 2009 Rev Ed).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">3 We also note that, in so far as the First Charge is concerned, the Respondent has in fact failed to make full restitution of the sum of $250,000 to the Complainant. Further, the mitigating circumstances he relies on cannot excuse him because they do not impact his decision not to pay or refund the sum that was deposited pursuant to the Escrow Agreement dated 5 November 2014.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">4 Further, the Respondent’s conduct with regard to the Second Charge is, as the Disciplinary Tribunal pointed out, no mere technical breach and in fact constitutes a serious breach of the Legal Profession (Solicitors’ Accounts) Rules (Cap 161, R 8, 1999 Ed) which are in place in order to protect clients’ monies.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">5 In so far as the sentence to be meted out to the Respondent is concerned, we note the following observations by this court in <span class="font-italic">Law Society of Singapore v Ismail bin Atan</span> [2017] 5 SLR 746 at [20]–[22]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">20 In <span class="font-italic">Law Society of Singapore v Ravindra Samuel</span> [1999] 1 SLR(R) 266 (“<span class="font-italic">Ravindra Samuel</span>”), Yong Pung How CJ held (at [15]) that:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The following principles on disciplinary sentencing may be extracted from the above authorities:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-2 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(a)  where a solicitor has acted dishonestly, the court will order that he be struck off the roll of solicitors;</div><div class="Judg-Quote-2 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(b)  if a solicitor is <span class="font-italic">not shown to have acted dishonestly</span>, but is shown to have <span class="font-italic">fallen below the required standards of integrity, probity and trustworthiness</span>, he will nonetheless be struck off the roll of solicitors, as opposed to merely being suspended, if his lapse is such as to indicate that he <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">lacks the qualities of character and trustworthiness which are the necessary attributes of a person entrusted with the responsibilities of a legal practitioner</span>.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added in italics and bold italics]</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">21 It is obvious from this extract that dishonesty is not some sort of a threshold or prerequisite that must be satisfied before a solicitor is liable to be struck off. Thus, the fact that the present case perhaps did not involve dishonesty is, in and of itself, not determinative. In our judgment, the applicable principle is this: even in cases that do not involve dishonesty, where a solicitor conducts himself in a way that falls below the required standards of integrity, probity and trustworthiness, and <span class="font-italic">brings grave dishonour to the profession</span>, he will be liable to be struck off. Indeed, if a solicitor’s conduct is so egregious as to bring such dishonour to the profession, it must invariably follow that such conduct indicates that the solicitor “lacks the qualities of character and trustworthiness which are the necessary attributes of a person entrusted with the responsibilities of a legal practitioner”. Based on what we have earlier noted (see [18] above), this test is amply satisfied in the present case. The respondent had acted disgracefully and reprehensibly, and we have no qualms in concluding that his conduct has brought grave dishonour to the profession.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">22 In the final analysis, the question to be asked is whether the solicitor in question is a fit and proper person to be an advocate and solicitor of the court. In <span class="font-italic">Ravindra Samuel</span>, Yong CJ put it this way (at [13]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">There is therefore a serious responsibility on the court, a duty to itself, to the rest of the profession and to the whole of the community, to be careful not to accredit any person as worthy of public confidence and therefore fit to practise as an advocate and solicitor who cannot satisfactorily establish his right to those credentials. <span class="font-italic">In the end therefore, the question to be determined is </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">whether the solicitor in question is a fit and proper person to be an advocate and solicitor of the court</span><span class="font-italic">, and the orders to be made are to be directed to ensuring that, to the extent that he is not, his practice is restricted</span>. [emphasis added in italics and bold italics]</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis in original]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">6 In the circumstances, we order that the Respondent be struck off the roll of advocates and solicitors. In particular, in relation to the First Charge, we echo this court’s sentiments in <span class="font-italic">Re Lim Kiap Khee </span>[2001] 2 SLR(R) 398 that it is of the utmost importance that a solicitor should abide by his formal undertaking. To deliberately breach such an undertaking, given in a professional capacity, would seriously undermine the integrity of the profession. While there is no evidence that the Respondent gained personally from the breach of the undertaking, he has nevertheless fallen below the required standards of integrity, probity and trustworthiness, and, by his actions, has brought grave dishonour to the profession. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">7 The costs of the present proceedings, fixed at $6,000, are awarded to the Law Society.</div><div class="Judg-Sign text-left">Andrew Phang Boon Leong           Judith Prakash      Steven Chong<br/>Judge of Appeal            Judge of Appeal     Judge of Appeal</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Tan Tee Jim SC and Amanda Lim (Lee &amp; Lee) for the applicant;<br/>The respondent in person.</div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
