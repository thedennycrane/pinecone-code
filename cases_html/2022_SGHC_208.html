From 1 January 2000, SBS paid its bus captains on a monthly basis for the same number of hours of work, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, 48 hours per week. The monthly salary consisted of the basic pay and a “Weekly Allowance”. Section 38(4) of the EA stipulates that an employee who at the employer’s request works for more than eight hours a day or 44 hours a week must be paid overtime (“OT”) for the extra hours at a rate of not less than 1.5 times his hourly basic rate of pay. As the monthly basic pay under a bus captain’s employment contract was based on a 48-hour work week, the basic pay thus comprised the 44-hour work week with the additional four hours (“Additional 4 Hours”) described in the MOU as “built-in overtime” or “BIOT”. The remaining two hours due to the BIOT (Additional 4 Hours multiplied by 1.5) would be paid as the Weekly Allowance. I will refer to the Additional 4 Hours and the remaining two hours collectively as the “6 Paid Hours”. At the material time, the Employment Act (Cap 91, 1996 Rev Ed) (“EA 1996”) applied, but the relevant provisions are <span class="font-italic">in</span> <span class="font-italic">pari materia</span> to the EA. A bus captain would receive the Weekly Allowance so long as he worked one day and did not take any unpaid leave of absence in that work week. The Weekly Allowance was to ensure that employees were not short-changed.

This enhanced the hourly rate of the bus captains and boosted a bus captain’s OT earnings (for working beyond the 48 hours). The contractual working hours remained at 48 hours per week, with the additional two hours due to BIOT to continue to be paid as the Weekly Allowance.

It suffices for the presumption to be triggered that the person called by a party relying on it has a broad understanding of the process behind the production of the electronic record. He need not have detailed technical knowledge of the system used to produce it (<span class="font-italic">Telemedia Pacific Group Ltd v Credit Agricole (Suisse) SA (Yeh Mao-Yuan, third party)</span> [2015] 1 SLR 338 at [255]–[256]; <span class="font-italic">Super Group Ltd v Mysore Nagaraja Kartik</span> [2019] 4 SLR 692 at [96]).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Statutory interpretation</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">14 As the case turns largely on the provisions of the EA, I begin by setting out the principles of statutory interpretation.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">15 Section 9A(1) of the Interpretation Act 1965 (2020 Rev Ed) (“IA”) provides that in interpreting a provision of a written law, an interpretation that promotes the purpose or object underlying the written law is to be preferred. In <span class="font-italic">Attorney-General v Ting Choon Meng and another appeal</span> [2017] 1 SLR 373 (<span class="font-italic">“Ting Choon Meng</span>”), the Court of Appeal (at [59]) explained that the court should begin by ascertaining the possible interpretations of the text, having regard to the provision in question and the context of the text within the written law as a whole. The court should then determine the legislative purpose of the provision in question and of the part of the statute in which it is situated. Finally, the court compares the possible interpretations of the text against the purposes of the statute and adopts the interpretation which promotes these purposes (see also <span class="font-italic">Tan Seng Kee v Attorney-General and other appeals</span> [2022] SGCA 16 (“<span class="font-italic">Tan Seng Kee</span>”) at [171]). There are three main textual sources from which the court can derive the purpose of a legislative provision – the long title of a statute, the words of that provision and other legislative provisions within the statute (<span class="font-italic">Tan Cheng Bock v Attorney-General </span>[2017] 2 SLR 850 (“<span class="font-italic">Tan Cheng Bock</span>”) at [44]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">16 In interpreting a provision of a written law, the court may have regard to extraneous material to: (a) confirm the ordinary meaning deduced from the text of the provision and context of the written law; (b) ascertain the meaning of the provision when it is ambiguous or obscure; or (c) ascertain its meaning where the ordinary meaning is absurd or unreasonable (ss 9A(2) and 9A(3) of the IA). That said, in seeking to draw out the legislative purpose behind a provision, primacy should be accorded to its text and statutory context over any extraneous material. The law enacted by Parliament is the text which Parliament has chosen to give effect to its purposes and objects (<span class="font-italic">Tan Cheng Bock</span> at [43]). The court should also be mindful of the possibility that the specific provision being interpreted may have been enacted by reason of some specific mischief or object that may be distinct from, but not inconsistent with, the general legislative purpose underlying the written law as a whole and separately consider this distinct purpose in appropriate cases (<span class="font-italic">Ting Choon Meng</span> at [59] and [61]). </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Rest days, work on rest days and pay for rest days</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">17 Turning to the substantive issues, I begin with Chua’s claims pertaining to rest days.

As Chua worked on average ten hours a day, he would have worked more than 44 hours on the fifth day every week and should have been given a rest day after the 44th hour. Moreover, if SBS could roster Chua a different rest day every week, (a) the period between each rest day could extend beyond seven days and he would lose out on at least seven rest days a year; (b) he would lose out on compensation for OT work and have to work 56 hours before being entitled to OT pay; and (c) SBS would be entitled to schedule its bus captains 12 consecutive days of work between two rest days.

Hence, the rest day need not fall on a Sunday. Subsection (1) of s 36 read in context of s 36, Part IV of the EA and the Parliamentary Debates consistently point to such an interpretation which is also consistent with and furthers its legislative purpose. I elaborate below.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 A plain reading of the text of s 36(1) makes it clear that a rest day shall be a Sunday “or such other day”. I leave aside for the time being whether the phrase “as may be determined from time to time by the employer” limits the frequency on which an employee’s rest day can be scheduled on “such other day”. Section 36(1) thus permits a rest day to be scheduled on a day other than Sunday. This is supported by s 36(4) which provides that where the <span class="font-italic">rest day </span><span class="font-italic">of an employee is determined by the employer</span>, the employer must prepare a roster before the commencement of the month in which the rest days fall informing the employee of his appointed rest days. This requirement would be unnecessary if the rest day can only be a Sunday (putting aside the exception in s 36(2)) as there would be no need to inform an employee in advance of other days that would be appointed as his rest days. For completeness, Chua agreed that the WCRs were given for a rolling period of four weeks, and Cheng and Foong attested that bus captains are notified of their roster four weeks in advance.

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 It is significant to note that the definition of “week” in s 41 differs from that in s 2(1). A “week” under s 41 and for the purpose of s 36(1) commences at midnight on Sunday, whereas s 2(1) defines a “week” to mean “a continuous period of 7 days”. This distinction is deliberate, as Parliament should not be taken to legislate in vain. As Prof S Jayakumar (then Minister for Labour) explained in the Second Reading of the 1984 Bill, s 41 of the EA which contained the new definition of “week” was to enable rest days to be scheduled up to 12 days apart as opposed to the then six days “so that workers can take turns to have a rest on a weekend which is a fairer arrangement”. This was to overcome the fact that the definition of “week” in s 2 “makes it so inflexible that the weekly rest day of an employee has to be granted on the same day in every week”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 I disagree with Mr Lim that s 36(1) must be read with s 38(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) such that the former provision is constrained by the latter in terms of the maximum number of hours an employee can be required to work in a week (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, 44 hours) and after which he must be given a rest day (see [20] above). Whilst s 38(1) limits an employee’s hours of work in a week, there are exceptions such as in s 38(2) which enables an employer to require an employee to work longer hours in certain situations. In any event, Chua’s interpretation of ss 36(1) and 38(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) does not make sense. Assuming Chua worked on average ten hours a day, he would have exceeded the “44-hour mark” by Friday. By Chua’s argument, he should thus have been given a rest day on Saturday or even after every five continuous days of work, and not merely on a Sunday.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 My holding at [23] above is not inconsistent with the legislative intent of s 36(1) to ensure adequate protection for workmen and employees who fall within Part IV of the EA (as defined in s 35). That such employees continue to enjoy protection is found in the fact that s 36(1) mandates a rest day every week (with exceptions such as in ss 37(1), 38(2) or 40(2A), or where an employee requests to work on a rest day) and that s 38(1) sets upper limits on the number of hours that an employee can be required to work in a day or week (again, with exceptions). Where an employee works on a rest day or hours exceeding the prescribed limit, the EA mandates that he be paid for the additional days or hours. As can be seen, the provisions in Part IV of the EA seek to balance the right of an employer to deploy his employees as necessary (such as the ability to determine the employee’s rest day) against the welfare of the employee.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 I deal briefly with Chua’s arguments that if s 36(1) permitted an employer to schedule its employee a different rest day every week, the period between two rest days could extend beyond seven days, a bus captain would “lose out on at least 7 rest days a year” and compensation for OT, and he could be scheduled to work 12 consecutive days between two rest days. It is unclear how Chua would lose out on at least seven rest days a year, because in any “week” (defined under s 41) he would have to be rostered one rest day (and which Chua agreed he was so rostered). Further, the EA provides compensation to an employee who is required (or agrees) to work more than the maximum number of hours stipulated in the EA or on his rest days. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 Finally, there is no evidence that SBS rostered Chua to work more than 12 days between two rest days. The WCRs showed that Chua’s roster was planned such that his rest day would fall on every eighth day (after working for seven days) and in each cycle of seven weeks Chua would have two continuous rest days, in order to comply with s 36(1) read with s 41.

This point was specifically contemplated by Parliament when it introduced s 41 of the EA 1985 to “enable rest days to be scheduled up to 12 days apart” (see [25] above). Even the guidelines issued by MOM (“<span class="font-weight-bold">MOM guidelines</span>”) which Chua relied on, stated consistent with Parliament’s intent that the “maximum interval allowed between 2 rest days is 12 days”.

</div>
</div> I am unable to accept Chua’s submission as such.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 There is nothing in the plain wording of s 36(1) which suggests that an employer can only “occasionally but not regularly” schedule rest days on a day other than Sunday. In my view, the phrase “from time to time” gives the employer the flexibility to determine the day of the week on which a rest day should fall (<span class="font-italic">eg</span>, Tuesday) and to change that day of rest to another day in the week (<span class="font-italic">eg</span>, Wednesday) on a subsequent occasion. To mitigate uncertainty to the employee where the employer makes such determinations, s 36(4) thus requires the employer to prepare a monthly roster to inform the employee in advance of the following month’s rest days. This is consistent with Parliament’s intent to allow flexibility in the scheduling of a weekly rest day whilst giving due consideration to the employee’s welfare by requiring reasonable notice (of such scheduling) to be given to him.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 The first iteration of s 36(1) was found in the Employment Act 1968 (“EA 1968”), an Act to consolidate and amend the law relating to employment, and which repealed and re-enacted, with amendments, the Labour Ordinance 1955, the Clerks Employment Ordinance 1957, and the Shop Assistants Employment Ordinance 1957 (see <span class="font-italic">Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report</span> (15 May and 15 July 1968) vol 27). In so doing, the EA 1968 removed the distinctions formerly drawn by the Ordinances between “workmen”, “shop assistants”, “clerks” and “industrial clerks” (see Tan Pheng Theng, “<span class="font-italic">A </span><span class="font-italic">Conspectus of the Labour Laws of Singapore</span>” (1968) 10(2) Malaya Law Review 202 at 211). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 Notably, the above three Ordinances were more restrictive in the manner of scheduling a rest day. Section 41 of the Labour Ordinance 1955 stipulated that “[i]n every week there shall be a rest day which shall be Sunday or such other day <span class="font-italic">as may be agreed </span>by the employer and workman” [emphasis added]. Section 33(1) of the Clerks Employment Ordinance 1957 similarly provided that the rest day may be a Sunday or “such other day <span class="font-italic">as may be agreed </span>by the employer and employee” [emphasis added]. Section 34(1) of the Shop Assistants Employment Ordinance 1957 stipulated that “[e]very shop assistant shall be allowed in each week a rest day of one whole day” but was silent as to whether an employer could from “time to time” determine that rest day. This is to be contrasted with s 36(1) of the EA 1968 which first provided that the rest day shall be a Sunday or such other day “as may be determined from time to time by the employer”. The Ordinances also did not mandate the rest day to fall only on a Sunday, and there was nothing to suggest that this position changed when the EA 1968 was introduced. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 The phrase “from time to time” is used in other provisions of the EA, <span class="font-italic">eg</span>, ss 2(1) (under the definition of “employee” and “employer”), 4, 27(1)(<span class="font-italic">k</span>), 49, 67, 73, 76(5), 89(9)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) and 140, in the context of the discretionary exercise of the power of a person (such as the Minister) to “from time to time” determine certain matters. Chua’s interpretation of the phrase “from time to time”, if adopted, would produce absurd outcomes across the EA. It would mean, for instance, that the Minister could only “occasionally, but not regularly” make rules and orders for the conduct of the duties of officers under s 4 of the EA. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 Next, I consider if the Contract conferred Chua the right to have his rostered rest day as every Sunday or even the same day in every week.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 Mr Lim contended that Chua “would have understood from reading [the Contract] that after working 6 days a week, the 7th day would be rostered as a rest day”. This is because the Contract stated Chua’s “working week” as a “6-day work week” (“First Term”) and further provided the number of working days as “6 days per week, 1 rostered off” (“Second Term”). Mr Singh SC submitted that as the Contract is stated to be “[i]n accordance with statutory rules and regulations”, the Second Term had to be read in conjunction with ss 36(1) and 41 of the EA and hence did not enjoin SBS to provide Chua a rest day every Sunday or even on the same day in each week.

</div> Hence, he could not have understood from reading the Contract that SBS would fix his rest day on Sunday. Additionally, the First and Second Terms did not, whether expressly or by implication, lend to Chua’s interpretation that his rest day would be scheduled on the same day in every week (or that it would be on the seventh day after working for six days). On the contrary, the phrase “1 rostered off” in the Second Term implied that SBS could schedule Chua’s rest day on any day in the week. As for the First Term, it was silent on when Chua’s rest day would be. It should be noted that the Contract was a standard form contract that SBS provided to all potential bus captains. There were no real negotiations between SBS and Chua when Chua was offered the terms of the Contract; rather, SBS’s Letter of Employment to Chua showed the Contract was offered to him on a take it or leave it basis. In court, Chua then stated that he did not care whether his rest day fell on a Sunday or on any particular day of the week, so long as he only had to work six days in a week.

SBS is in the business of providing public transportation services with buses having to run daily for the benefit of the public. It is thus critical for SBS to have sufficient bus captains to assist its operations every day of the year and a bus captain’s employment contract was tailored with this object in mind. Hence, it is clear that the objective intention of the parties, as expressed by the First and Second Terms and informed by the relevant context was for bus captains (including Chua) to work six days a week and enjoy a rest day which SBS would roster amongst the days of the week and which could be a different day every week.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 For these reasons, I find the First and Second Terms did not bear the interpretation Mr Lim advanced. On the contrary, the Contract granted SBS the flexibility to roster Chua’s rest day on any day of the week and which could be a different day from week to week. Thus, SBS did not breach of s 36(1) of the EA or the Contract by reason of rostering Chua a different rest day every week.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Whether Chua was compelled to work on his rest day in breach of s 37(1)</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 At this juncture, I deal with whether SBS contravened s 37(1) by compelling Chua to work on his rest days. Section 37(1) states that, subject to ss 38(2) or 40(2A), an employee must not be compelled to work on a rest day unless he is engaged in work which by reason of its nature requires to be carried on continuously by a succession of shifts. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 Chua claimed that he never requested to work on his rest days and that SBS compelled him to do so (“Compulsion Claim”). Chua claimed that SBS asked him to work on his rest day “all the time” and sanctioned him <span class="font-italic">via</span> disciplinary notices if he refused. He pointed to: (a) two misconduct notices which showed SBS had taken disciplinary action against him for failing to show up for work on 25 December 2019 and 1 January 2020 (“Misconduct Notices”); and (b) a letter from SBS dated 31 January 2020 informing him that he was “charged with being absent from duty without leave or reasonable excuse” on 25 December 2019 as well as on 1, 25 and 26 January 2020 (“31/1/20 Letter”).

Rather, SBS had taken action against Chua for absenting himself on days he was rostered to work.

This was, at best, neutral. Foong attested that SBS did not require its bus captains to do so as this would require them to travel to SBS’s office and unduly inconvenience them, but in any event SBS subsequently developed a feature in its mobile application “iLink” to allow bus captains to remotely volunteer to work on their rest days.

Further, Cheng and Foong had attested (and which I accept) that bus captains work on rest days based on mutual agreement with SBS and that a bus captain can decline to work on his rest day without facing any penalty.

</div> As I have found SBS’s method of rostering Chua’s rest days did not breach the EA, the Contract or even the MOM guidelines, that should be the end of the matter as Chua was not disputing that he was not paid the prescribed rate of pay for work done on rest days. Nevertheless, I consider this matter for completeness. There are two components to this. First, whether SBS properly compensated Chua for working his contractual hours (eight hours per day) on his rest days, and second, whether Chua was properly compensated for working OT on his rest days (a matter which I will return to later).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 In relation to compensation for Chua’s normal working hours on a rest day, he must be paid a sum at the basic rate of pay for one day’s work if he requested to work (s 37(2)), or a sum at the basic rate of pay for two days’ work if the employer (SBS) requested him to work (s 37(3)). For completeness, cl 11(2) of the Collective Agreement also states that if an employee is required to work on a rest day, he must be paid “2 days’ salary at the basic rate of pay” during his normal contractual working hours. “Basic rate of pay” is defined under s 2(1), and calculated in accordance with the third column of the Third Schedule to the EA, pursuant to s 107A(2), as Chua was employed on a monthly rate and required to work the same number of days (six days) every week.

</div> Hence, Chua’s daily basic rate of pay amounted to $78.4615 for 2018 and $81.1538 for January to April 2019. Chua had inaccurately stated this rate to be $78.40 for 2018 and $88.56 for 2019.

But this is immaterial because SBS had, as a matter of policy, compensated all bus captains (including Chua) at the basic rate of pay for two days’ work, regardless of whether SBS requested Chua to work or Chua requested to work.

</div> Additionally, Chua did not show how SBS had failed to pay him the proper amount he was entitled to for working on his normal hours on rest days, or how SBS had wrongly computed the rest day pay. This is also bearing in mind Chua’s pleaded case (see [50] above). On the contrary, SBS had set out the number of rest days on which Chua had worked for each month from January 2018 to April 2019, which was based on a review of the BCALs, and further explained by way of Chua’s payslips as to how the payment for rest days was computed.

However, this must be seen against the fact that Chua had pleaded his claim as asserting SBS’s <span class="font-italic">method of rostering OT</span> being unlawful rather than asserting that he should not have worked more than the stipulated hours in ss 38(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) or (<span class="font-italic">b</span>).  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 I pause to explain how the Time Cards relate to the BCAL. Each day’s Time Card would reflect Chua’s “sign on” and “sign off” time, which according to SBS, was the time a bus captain would start his shift/work and complete his shift (including the LPT) respectively. The “workhour” on a Time Card was calculated from “sign on” to “sign off”, and included all Chua’s hours of work and OT, the Break Times and the time allocated to perform the FPT and LPT.

</div> Hence, the “workhour” referred to Gross Hours. The BCAL for the month also reflected Chua’s Gross Hours and was generated from SBS’s system. A perusal of the February 2019 BCAL showed the Gross Hours for each day corresponded with the February 2019 Time Cards, save for the 17 February 2019 Time Card which stated Chua’s workhour as 8 hours and 56 minutes whereas the BCAL stated a higher figure of 9.76 hours. However, nothing material turned on the discrepancy as the higher figure in the BCAL was used to compute Chua’s February 2019 pay, as Lee had given a detailed explanation on.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 As Chua’s minimum contractual hours of 48 hours a week were Gross Hours, SBS did not breach s 38(1) by including BIOT into the basic pay, as Chua would have worked no more than the 44 EA Hours a week to obtain his basic pay. In other words, BIOT did not pertain to any work Chua performed beyond 44 EA Hours. SBS thus did not incorporate any OT payment into Chua’s basic rate of pay in breach of the EA. I accept Mr Singh SC’s submission that BIOT is not to be equated with payment for OT as the latter term is used in the EA and, where Chua worked OT he was paid for it on a daily basis after 8 <span class="font-italic">Gross Hours</span> per day – which Chua agreed.

</div> Hence, Chua was not entitled to be paid for the four of the 6 Paid Hours (representing BIOT) at 1.5 times his hourly rate of pay and there was also no such term in the Contract. As Chua did not have to perform any actual work above 44 EA Hours to enjoy BIOT, his assertions that BIOT allowed SBS to capitalise on additional OT hours in breach of s 38(5) and prevented Chua the right to refuse to work OT are not made out.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 Thus, that SBS incorporated BIOT into Chua’s contractual work hours did not contravene s 38(1) or cl 10 of the Collective Agreement and was in fact based on the MOU between NTWU and SBS. Additionally, SBS’s computation of the hourly rate for the purposes of computing the Weekly Allowance, using the formula of [(Monthly basic salary x 12) divided by (52 x 48)], did not contravene the EA as the Weekly Allowance was derived from the BIOT which was not OT as Chua’s 48 hours of work per week comprised Gross Hours.

He explained how Chua’s OT was calculated which I find followed the Collective Agreement and which provided a higher rate than the minimum rate in the EA.

He also accepted Lee’s explanation on how his pay for 5 February 2019 was computed. Second, Lee had explained that Chua was also paid the rest day rate for work performed on 5 February 2019 at the rate of two days’ salary. That Chua was paid both the rest day and public holiday rates was supported by his February 2019 payslip which delineated the two payments, and which computations were explained by Lee.

The ten minutes allocated for the FPT also failed to account for the occasions Chua required the assistance of a mechanic (who had to attend to numerous buses at the bus park) to rectify a defect to the bus. Further, after he completed the LPT, he had to perform other tasks such as refuelling, washing and parking the bus.

</div> SBS’s witnesses thus prepared their AEICs to respond to Chua’s claim based on his pleaded case. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">95 In any event, I find the New Claim is not substantiated or made out. Chua did not particularise how much more time he spent to complete the FPT and LPT or when these incidents allegedly occurred. On the other hand, SBS had explained that the time allocated for the FPT and LPT was sufficient to perform the tasks stated in the Duty Card. For instance, Foong explained that various tasks could be done concurrently, such as checking the CCTV cameras and screens which were visual checks that were to be done by merely glancing at them and would not take more than ten seconds. The tasks in the Duty Card could also be performed concurrently with the refuelling of the bus, which refuelling was, in any event, not personally performed by the bus captain who merely had to drive the bus to the petrol pump for a bus attendant to refuel. As for washing the bus, Chua simply had to drive through an automated bus washing system with the washing taking place within one to two minutes, and again Chua could perform other tasks concurrently. Foong further attested that SBS had already factored in the time taken to queue for the refuelling and washing of the bus. Further, Chua’s claim that there would be 200 buses at the bus park was not an accurate depiction of how many buses were there at the same time. Foong explained that the buses that entered the bus park were spread out over some six hours as they were scheduled to operate at different timings and hence there would be only about 40 buses at the bus park at any one time. Finally, Foong and Cheng attested that ten and 15 minutes were sufficient to perform the FPT and LPT respectively.

Thus, when he was scheduled to work the morning shift (which commenced at 5.00am), he took a bus SBS provided and would arrive at the bus depot at around 4.30am. Chua claimed that SBS arranged for its bus captains who took the chartered bus to arrive at its premises early for SBS’s benefit, as the early transport would ensure that they would not be late for work (due to traffic conditions) and to enable these bus captains to cover other captains who might be late for work. After arriving at the bus depot, but before the official start time of his shift, Chua had to inspect the bus he was scheduled to drive. Chua claimed that once he arrived at the bus depot, he could not leave the premises as he would have signed in and was thus under the command and control of SBS. Moreover, on the days he performed a split shift (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, morning and afternoon shifts), he was “engaged to be waiting” and required to remain at SBS’s premises in the time between the shifts.

</div> Regardless of whether such a term should be implied in the Collective Agreement or Contract, the grounds Chua relied on were the same. In this regard, I find that Chua’s claim is not made out. I will deal first with whether the Term should be implied into the Contract.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">102 In determining whether to imply a term into a contract, the court will apply the three-step test set out by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Sembcorp Marine Ltd v PPL Holdings Pte Ltd and another and another appeal </span>[2013] 4 SLR 193 (“<span class="font-italic">Sembcorp Marine</span>”) at [101], as such:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The court will first ascertain whether there is a gap in the contract and, if so, how the gap arises. The court will only consider implying a term in the contract if the court discerns that the gap arose because the parties did not contemplate the gap. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The court will then consider whether it is necessary in the business or commercial sense to imply a term to give the contract efficacy (“Business Efficacy Test”). </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Finally, the court considers the specific term to be implied. This must be a term which the parties, having regard to the need for business efficacy, would have responded, “Oh, of course!” had the proposed term been put to them at the time of the contract. If it is not possible to find such a clear response, then, the gap persists and the consequences of that gap ensue (“Officious Bystander Test”). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">103 In essence, while the Business Efficacy Test helps the court to identify the existence of a lacuna in a contract, the Officious Bystander Test enables it to define the term which can be said to reflect the parties’ presumed intentions vis-à-vis the gap in the contract. In all circumstances, the threshold for implying a term is a high one and a term will only be implied if <span class="font-italic">necessary</span>. The court will not rewrite the contract for the parties based on its own sense of what is fair and just (<span class="font-italic">Sembcorp Marine</span> at [88], [91] and [100]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">104 To begin with, it was unclear from Chua’s own case what precisely was the Term to be implied. In the SOC, Chua claimed that he should be compensated at his basic hourly rate of pay for: (a) the period between 4.00am to 5.00am when he worked the morning shift as he would arrive at the bus depot at about 4.15am; and (b) “the idle time during the afternoon shift which starts at about 2.30pm … to completion of duty at about 1.00am the next day, <span class="font-italic">after which he </span><span class="font-italic">was engaged to be waiting</span>” (“Version 1”).

</div> This was not a claim that Chua should be compensated for idle time, but that SBS should have compensated him for working in excess of the hours of work reflected in his Time Cards. In this regard, I have already made my findings earlier. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">108 The remaining reasons Chua proffered to support that the Term should be implied were unconvincing. First, SBS did not impose a time by which a bus captain had to arrive at the bus terminal, depot or interchange (“Workplace”) to wait before starting his shift. Cheng and Foong attested as such and further stated that Chua merely had to arrive in time to start his shift which is the “sign on” time stated on the Time Card. Chua admitted in court that the Contract did not state that he had to report for work earlier than the start of the stipulated time for his shift.

</div> Hence, Chua was not obliged to arrive early at the Workplace. As such, his assertion that SBS arranged for bus captains who took the chartered bus to arrive early at the Workplace to mitigate the risks of traffic delays and other bus captains arriving late, even if they were true, were irrelevant, and further Chua was not obliged to use SBS’s transport (see [109] below).

Chua agreed that some bus captains made their own way to the Workplace and SBS even permitted those who drove to park within its premises, and that they just had to arrive at the Workplace before the commencement of their shift. As Chua stated, he took SBS’s transport because he could not afford his own transportation.

</div> As such, Chua failed to show that SBS exercised “command and control” over him when he was waiting to start his shift. This distinguished the case of <span class="font-italic">Xuyi Building</span>, where Xuyi’s employees were required to attend the half-hour safety meetings before the start of each work day. On that basis the court found the half-hours involved were working time which the employees should be compensated for. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">111 Hence, an implied term (in the manner claimed by Chua) was unnecessary in the business sense to give the Contract efficacy, nor would the parties (and especially SBS) have responded “Oh, of course!” had the proposed Term been put to them at the time of the contract. This was not a case in which there were negotiations between Chua and SBS on the terms of his employment contract, as SBS had offered Chua a standard contract (see [38] above). It would not have made commercial sense for SBS to pay Chua for idle time. As Mr Singh SC submitted, the Term, if implied, would have been commercially absurd and patently unfair to bus captains who incurred their own costs in taking private transport to work (and who would not be compensated for idle time) whilst those who used the free transport SBS provided would be additionally compensated for idle time between their arrival at the Workplace and commencement of their shift.

</div> Thus, in so far as the terms of the Collective Agreement (where they were intended in their nature and character suitable to take effect as contractual terms) were incorporated into the Contract <span class="font-italic">via</span> the “Other Terms &amp; Conditions” clause, the test in <span class="font-italic">Sembcorp Marine</span> would apply to determine whether a term should be implied into the Agreement. If so, for the same reasons at [104] to [111], I find no scope to imply the Term (or any version of it).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">113 Alternatively, the nature of a collective agreement is such that it would have legal force only upon satisfying additional legislative requirements under the Industrial Relations Act 1960 (2020 Rev Ed) (“IRA”). Under s 26 of the IRA, a collective agreement has legal force (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, it is deemed to be an award and binds parties to the agreement) only to the extent that a court (being an Industrial Arbitration Court) certifies a memorandum of its terms in accordance with s 25 of the IRA. Section 25 of the IRA in turn requires the court to, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, consider whether it is in the public interest that the agreement be certified and whether the memorandum of its terms satisfactorily or adequately sets out the terms of that agreement. The legislative requirements, in particular the requirement for a court to certify a memorandum of its terms, which terms have been negotiated between the parties to the agreement, would suggest that such an agreement cannot be lightly amended or revised. If so, the court would be less likely to imply a term into such an agreement. Hence, and for the reasons at [104] to [111], I find no scope to imply the Term (or any version of it) into the Collective Agreement.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">114 It must be remembered that a collective agreement is generally negotiated across a broad front for a substantial labour force. In the present case, the Collective Agreement did not apply only to SBS’s bus captains but essentially to “all locally engaged Management Support Officers and Service Personnel” and covered a breadth of issues pertaining to salary and compensation. As was observed in <span class="font-italic">Ali and others v Christian Salvesen Food Services Ltd</span> [1997] 1 All ER 721 at 726, a collective agreement represents “a carefully negotiated compromise between two potentially conflicting objectives” between employers and employees, and thus it is in the nature of such an agreement that it is concise and clear so as to be readily understood by all who are concerned to operate it. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">115 In conclusion, I dismiss Chua’s claims that SBS should have compensated him for idle time and that such a term should be implied into the Contract or Collective Agreement. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Break Times</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">116 I deal next with Break Times. Section 38(1)(i) provides that an employee engaged in work which must be carried on continuously may be required to work for eight consecutive hours “inclusive of a period or periods of not less than 45 minutes in the aggregate during which he shall have the opportunity to have a meal”. Chua pleaded that SBS provided him fewer than 45 minutes of actual Break Times during his eight consecutive hours of work, and that he was “only given break periods of 25 minutes and toilet break period of about 10 minutes, which were mere idealism as they follow from an estimated time of arrival of the bus to the depot and does not factor in traffic and/or parking delays at the bus terminals”. In Chua’s FBP, he clarified that SBS had breached s 38(1)(i): (a) only by reason of its method of scheduling “break periods of 25 minutes and toilet break period of about 10 minutes”, and not that SBS had failed to provide him the scheduled amount of break time based on SBS’s method of scheduling; and (b) by failing to add the break periods into the number of hours which Chua worked for the purpose of computing his pay.

Indeed, in his FBP, Chua clarified that SBS had breached s 38(1)(i) only by reason of its method of scheduling “break periods of 25 minutes and toilet break period of about 10 minutes” and not that SBS had failed to provide him the scheduled amount of Break Times based on SBS’s method of scheduling.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Whether the minimum 45 minutes of break must be continuous </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">120 Next, Mr Lim submitted that the minimum 45 minutes of break (prescribed in s 38(1)(i)) must “ordinarily” be given in a continuous period as this “accords with the normal practice in workplaces where employees are given an hour for their lunch”, and if the 45 minutes were divided into many short breaks, each break would be “insignificant and inadequate” for an employee to properly eat his meal.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">121 In interpreting s 38(1)(i), the court should first have regard to the ordinary meaning of the words of the provision and with regard to the context of that provision within the written law as a whole. The text of s 38(1)(i) is clear. An employer who requires an employee to work for eight consecutive hours must provide the employee with either a single break of not less than 45 minutes or multiple breaks that add up to no less than 45 minutes. The phrase “inclusive of a period <span class="font-italic">or periods</span> of not less than 45 minutes <span class="font-italic">in the aggregate</span>” [emphasis added] allows an employer to split up the 45 minutes into multiple Break Times. To construe s 38(1)(i) as stipulating that an employee’s break time of 45 minutes (minimum) can only be given in one continuous stretch would violate the plain language of, and be contrary to, the express text. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">122 The above interpretation accords with the legislative purpose of s 38(1), which provision was not merely intended to protect an employee (by ensuring that he is given sufficient break(s) where he is working for a number of continuous hours) but also to accord a measure of flexibility to an employer in scheduling the rest or leisure period during those work hours. Hence where an employee is required to work for eight consecutive hours, he must be given no less than 45 minutes of Break Times. At the same time, whilst the employer can split the minimum 45 minutes into a few shorter breaks, this cannot impinge on the employee’s basic entitlement of “the opportunity to have a meal” – a point which I will return to. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">123 Further, Mr Lim has not adduced evidence to support his submission that the minimum 45 minutes of break must be given in a continuous period as this would accord with the normal practice in workplaces where employees are given an hour for lunch. Even accepting that it may be the norm in some industries for employees to be given an hour for lunch, this did not therefore mean that it was the norm in all industries.

</div> First, Chua would often arrive late at the terminal at which he was supposed to enjoy his meal break because of traffic conditions. Second, after arriving at the relevant terminal, he had to allow passengers to disembark the bus, find a parking lot and inspect the bus for cleanliness as well as for items that passengers may have inadvertently left behind. Third, Chua required time to procure and consume his food. Mr Lim suggested that if the bus terminal at which Chua parked his vehicle had a staff canteen, Chua had to spend time queuing for his food. Where it did not, Chua required about ten minutes just to walk to and from the place he purchased his food. Fourth, Chua had to depart the bus terminal (at which he enjoyed his break time) precisely at the time stated in his Time Card. Before doing so, he had to perform various tasks for the next stage of the journey such as switching on the payment system in the bus and checking the tyres to make sure they were in good order.

Cheng also attested that the timings for the bus routes took into account known traffic conditions which SBS monitors. Foong further explained that the timings in a Time Cards for a bus to be driven from one location to another (as stated in the Time Card) were computed based on historical driving records of bus captains on the service or route, and which could vary on different days because of the traffic conditions.

In the latter case, the time taken for bus captains to procure their food is factored into their allocated meal time.

It suffices to add that SBS did in any event include Chua’s Break Times into the number of Chua’s work hours and for which he was paid (see [3], [66]–[67] above), although s 2(1) states that “hours of work” excludes “any intervals allowed for rest and meals”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">131 In the round, Chua’s claim in relation to being given insufficient Break Times or an opportunity to have a meal is not made out. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Overtime of more than 72 hours per month</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">132 Finally, I turn to Chua’s claim that SBS breached s 38(5) by requiring him to work more than 72 OT hours in a month, which SBS denied. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">133 It should be noted that Chua had pleaded and attested the breach of s 38(5) for only January 2018 to April 2019, and he did not give particulars of his claim for the period in 2017 or from May 2019 to February 2020 (when he ceased to work for SBS).

As for September 2018, Chua pleaded that he worked 67 OT hours, whilst the table in his AEIC showed this to be 77 OT hours. The inconsistency in the two figures appears to have been taken from Koh’s calculations in the Calculation Sheet for September 2018 in which the figure is reflected 67 OT hours (as computed by Koh) but which she then tabulated into a separate table (reflecting Chua’s OT hours from January 2018 to April 2019) as 77 hours for that month (“Koh’s Table”).

</div>) and considering the Break Times allocated per work day, the evidence shows that Chua did not work for more than 72 OT hours in any of the 11 Months. In this regard, Foong had also attested that SBS ensured that no bus captain was scheduled to work more than 72 hours of OT a month through a system of internal checks. For instance, any attempt by a staff to change a bus captain’s schedule which has the effect of bringing the rostered total OT hours above 72 hours would cause the SCS to issue a notification to inform the staff as such. Additionally, SBS would generate a monthly “Overtime Report” and review the report to ensure that no bus captain was rostered to work more than 72 OT hours in a month. I accept Foong’s and Lee’s testimony that, based on a review of Chua’s roster, SBS did not in any month roster him to work more than 72 OT hours.
