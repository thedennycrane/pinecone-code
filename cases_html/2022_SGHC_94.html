</div> The fact that Joanne considered the defendant agreeing to a meeting, which is a far less substantial commitment than paying the Loan Amount, to be a “[f]riend’s favour”, suggests that she must have known that it would not be straightforward to get the defendant to agree to pay the Loan Amount. Her father expressed similar sentiments.</div><div class="txt-body text-justify">40 Joanne’s WA correspondence with the plaintiff on 4 May 2020, a few days before the 7 May Dinner, shows the preparation they undertook before the dinner.

Joanne said that she would prepare a letter and ask the defendant to sign it when they met.

They are commercially experienced people, and likely recognised that they would have to offer something valuable to the defendant to get him to agree. In addition, they were careful to prepare a written record of a possible agreement. Second, the plaintiff and Joanne appreciated that the specific terms of any agreement were important.

</div> This is because, in agreeing to provide properties which had a NAV equivalent to the Loan Amount, the defendant effectively agreed to take on liability for the Loan Amount. I do not find this to be so, as the defendant has maintained that this was conveyed as a goodwill offer. He also maintained that he never agreed to take on liability beyond the 9 Properties, regardless of their NAVs.</div><div class="txt-body text-justify">51 This is supported by his amendments to the 5 May Letter. The Insertion indicates clearly that there was no intention on his part for his offer of the 9 Properties to be binding. The Deletion makes clear that he had no intention to take on liability for the full Loan Amount beyond the value of the 9 Properties.</div><div class="txt-body text-justify">52 It is questionable if the defendant, who before signing the Amended 5 May Letter, took care to make a deletion to limit his liability to the 9 Properties and insert the term “MOU” to avoid making a binding agreement, would at the same time enter into the Oral Agreement that was binding and extended his liability beyond the 9 Properties. Such a course of conduct would be inconsistent.</div><div class="txt-body text-justify">53 It is also worth noting that the Amended 5 May Letter did not contain anything about defendant’s side of the bargain. This is despite the fact that the defendant was under no pre-existing legal obligation to provide the 9 Properties to the plaintiff. Specifically, there is no mention of the POA, which is what the plaintiff alleges was the benefit conveyed to the defendant in the Oral Agreement. Given the care that the defendant took with the two amendments to the 5 May Letter, it is striking that he did not record the POA in the same, when the plaintiff asserts that the POA was very important to the defendant, and was what he wanted in exchange for taking on personal liability for the Loan Amount. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(2) Update from Joanne to plaintiff</div><div class="txt-body text-justify">54 The day after the 7 May Dinner, the plaintiff asked Joanne for an update via WA:

There was no mention of the Oral Agreement itself in the WA update. The plaintiff was clearly concerned about the Deletion, yet Joanne did not mention that there was nothing to worry about, because a separate Oral Agreement had been reached whereby the defendant agreed to exactly what he deleted: to take on liability for the full Loan Amount. Instead, she said: “Finally I said I <span class="font-italic">hope the net asset can reach 150</span>. He just crossed it. I already said if it’s not sufficient, how?

</div> However, this is not a satisfactory explanation. Joanne would have known that the plaintiff’s fundamental concern was not the amendments to the 5 May Letter, but what had been agreed at the 7 May Dinner and whether the defendant agreed to take on personal liability for the Loan Amount. Yet when the plaintiff pressed her for a report, Joanne did not mention the POA, even though the plaintiff’s signing the POA was the alleged <span class="font-italic">quid pro quo</span> for the defendant taking on personal liability for the Loan Amount.

The entire thrust of the plaintiff’s case is that the plaintiff’s signing of the POA was his <span class="font-italic">quid pro quo</span> in the Oral Agreement. The plaintiff and Joanne were careful enough to have the 5 May Letter drafted for the defendant to sign at the 7 May Dinner.

That would have been a discussion about the mode of payment or how to pay. The recurrent issue in the defendant’s WA correspondence with Joanne, was how much to pay. In this regard, it is clear from the post-7 May Dinner correspondence, that all the offers made by the defendant were never close to the Loan Amount. Additionally, the language that Joanne used, such as “hope” you can give us, rather than for example, you “promised to”, suggests that there was no Oral Agreement.</div><div class="txt-body text-justify">71 Joanne did not refer to the Oral Agreement or the POA, even when the defendant told her she misunderstood if she thought that he would pay more. On 28 June 2020, Joanne informed the defendant via WA that they would take the 12 properties and asked the defendant “How do you want to settle the balance?” The defendant replied on 29 June 2020: “I think there is misunderstanding. We want to settle the properties at 24 million. Not at the valuation of the banks. Can negotiate to lower price but not at 16 million.” Joanne replied “Hmm can we meet this week? With [the plaintiff].” Joanne would have been aware from this exchange that the defendant did not share the same understanding as her. Yet, she did not remind him of the alleged Oral Agreement.

</div> In any event, the WA correspondence between her and the defendant, as highlighted above, would have made it sufficiently clear to Joanne that the defendant was not making an offer close to the Loan Amount. In fact, the defendant had explicitly told her that there was a “misunderstanding”. This casts doubt on Joanne’s explanation that, in her mind, the defendant had already agreed to pay the Loan Amount. Such a perception was very much at odds with the defendant’s correspondence and behaviour up to that point of time, and certainly unrealistic. </div><div class="txt-body text-justify">75 On 6 July 2020, in their WA exchange, the defendant made a proposal saying: “We are ready to settled with 9 commercial plus 2 other commercial so total of 11 properties…” and “so with that in mind will be settled all 152[bn]”.

She explained that by this, she meant that she needed the defendant’s agreement on which properties to take and not an agreement to pay $15m. However, that is not what the WA message says.

</div> However, the wording of the POA makes clear that the authority of AWLP as agent is only to perform legal actions that are in the interest of the principal. Both the plaintiff and the defendant’s experts agreed that if the principal instructed the lawyer under the POA to vote against the reconciliation, the lawyer as the agent would have to carry out such instructions. The plaintiff’s expert, Mr Haryanto, further testified that there is an “ethical obligation” on the agent-lawyer to always seek the necessary consent or approval from the principal named in the POA.

</div> </div><div class="txt-body text-justify">94 There is no evidence that the plaintiff sought to instruct the lawyers under the POA on how to vote, even though the POA gave him that power. </div><div class="txt-body text-justify">95 The plaintiff was careful enough to have the 5 May Letter prepared and have Joanne get the defendant to sign it at the 7 May Dinner. Even when the plaintiff, Joanne and the defendant met up on 3 July 2020, the plaintiff and Joanne were careful enough to have Joanne write a set of minutes <br/>(“3 July Minutes”) and have parties, including the defendant, sign on it. The extent of their carefulness is seen from their evidence that the plaintiff told Joanne to cancel out the line “[w]e will settle the loan with the above 11 units” from the 3 July Minutes, as he was not sure if the NAV of those properties would match the Loan Amount. </div><div class="txt-body text-justify">96 Thus, the plaintiff was clearly careful and thoughtful in approaching the engagements with the defendant, whether at the 7 May Dinner or the 3 July Meeting. In light of this, it is unlikely that he would not, at the very least, have considered or discussed with Joanne the possibility of using the POA as leverage, when the defendant was clearly failing to deliver his end of the alleged Oral Agreement.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(5) Continued offers after PKPU judgment</div><div class="txt-body text-justify">97 On 20 July 2020, judgment was given in the PKPU proceedings for the Reconciliation Plan, which had secured sufficient votes from creditors. Any vote that would be taken through the POA would have been taken by then. In other words, the substantial benefit to the defendant, as alleged by the plaintiff, would have been taken by then. </div><div class="txt-body text-justify">98 Nevertheless, the defendant continued to discuss with Joanne about their settlement, and even provided a further offer. On 21 July 2020, the defendant offered to provide the plaintiff with a total of ten properties as compared to the initial 9 Properties.

</div> The fact that the defendant continued making offers after the voting in the PKPU proceedings had taken place, and judgment had been issued, calls into question whether the POA was really the benefit that he sought in these discussions, as alleged by the plaintiff.</div><div class="txt-body text-justify">99 The 19 and 20 July 2020 WA exchanges between Joanne and the defendant continue to suggest the lack of an Oral Agreement. When Joanne referred to a balance $2m in relation to a proposal involving 11 properties valued at $13m, the defendant replied “I don’t think we will reach agreement if it is like that”. Joanne did not reply to him saying that they already had an agreement or that that was not their agreement. She again made no reference to the Oral Agreement or the POA. Instead, she sought to persuade him not to give such a large haircut:

</div>
</div></div><div class="txt-body text-justify">108 What the defendant’s WA message shows at the most, is that in making his offer of help as of 23 March 2020, the defendant thought it important that if he settled with the plaintiff and acquired his rights as creditor, the defendant would not be bound as to which way to vote in the PKPU Proceedings. It is very likely that the plaintiff would have supported the restructuring of KSP Indosurya as opposed to its bankruptcy. He testified that KSP Indosurya bears his family name, that their family business is in finance where trust is important, and that the KSP Indosurya crisis was not good for maintaining such trust. </div><div class="txt-body text-justify">109 However, the defendant’s interest in having KSP Indosurya restructured, does not necessarily lead to the inference that he agreed to take on personal liability for the Loan Amount in exchange for the plaintiff signing a POA. He could have acquired the voting right associated with the Loan Amount, simply by taking on personal liability for the Loan Amount, without the POA. Indeed, this WA message from the defendant on 23 March 2020 does not make any reference to a POA. </div><div class="txt-body text-justify">110 The plaintiff also submits that the timing of the POA, which was prepared on 5 May 2020 and signed by the plaintiff on 8 May 2020, suggests that the POA arose out of the 7 May Dinner.

</div> This is speculative. The defendant submits that these facts, at the highest, might only suggest that the POA was discussed at the 7 May Dinner. I agree with the defendant’s submission. These timings do not lead ineluctably to the inference that the Oral Agreement was made at the 7 May Dinner and that the POA was part of it.</div><div class="txt-body text-justify">111 The plaintiff also suggested that the defendant was motivated to have the plaintiff sign the POA, because the defendant wanted to secure a PKPU reconciliation settlement to help him obtain “restorative justice” in criminal proceedings against him in Indonesia.

</div> It is the plaintiff’s case that the KSP Indosurya case involves one of the biggest frauds in Indonesia’s history, involving IDR14.6 trillion and 5,700 customers. An offence of such nature would hardly be a minor crime. </div><div class="txt-body text-justify">115 In any event, there is no doubt that the defendant wanted a reconciliation settlement in KSP Indosurya’s PKPU proceedings. It is his own case that KSP Indosurya bears his family name, and that their family business is in finance, where trust is important. He would clearly prefer for KSP Indosurya to obtain a reconciliation for this reason, leaving aside any restorative justice considerations. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Credibility of the defendant</span></div><div class="txt-body text-justify">116 On the stand, the defendant gave testimony which was against his AEIC.

</div> However, he testified on the stand that the letter was already signed by the plaintiff when he signed it at the 7 May Dinner. This change in the defendant’s evidential position supports the plaintiff’s case, as it confirms this aspect of the plaintiff’s version of events.</div><div class="txt-body text-justify">117 Thus, while the defendant was not always able to remember details, he did not come across as a calculating witness seeking to carefully keep to his pleaded case. Most importantly, I found the defendant’s evidence that he did not make the Oral Agreement, to be consistent with the objective documentary evidence. On the whole, I did not find reason to doubt his credibility as a witness.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Credibility of Hendra Widjaya</span></div><div class="txt-body text-justify">118 Hendra is the lawyer who acted for KSP Indosurya in the PKPU Proceedings. While the plaintiff had earlier thought that it would be a good idea for Hendra to be at the 7 May Dinner so that he could be a witness, he was called as the defendant’s witness in this Suit. </div><div class="txt-body text-justify">119 Some of Hendra’s oral testimony contradicted his AEIC. His evidence negatively affected both the plaintiff’s and the defendant’s cases. For example, by testifying that he did not hear much of the conversation between Joanne and the defendant during the 7 May Dinner, Hendra retracted the parts of his AEIC that said that he witnessed the defendant communicating caveats about the 5 May Letter to the plaintiff.

In this case, the documentary evidence includes the 5 May Letter, the Amended 5 May Letter, the POA, the WA correspondence between the main parties to the Oral Agreement (Joanne, the plaintiff and the defendant) in the lead up to and after the 7 May Dinner, as well as correspondence between their lawyers. The sheer weight of the documentary evidence indicates that there was no Oral Agreement reached between the plaintiff (through Joanne) and defendant. The plaintiff has not established the substratum of evidence for a <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> case. As was held in <span class="font-italic">The </span><span class="font-italic">Posidon</span>, the court’s ability to draw an adverse inference cannot displace a party’s legal burden of proof. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Misrepresentation</span></div><div class="txt-body text-justify">128 The plaintiff submits that if it is found that there was an agreement between the parties on the terms of the Amended 5 May Letter, there was a misrepresentation from the defendant that the NAV of the 9 Properties would be sufficient to meet the Loan Amount.

</div></div><div class="txt-body text-justify">129 The defendant inserted “MOU” into the 5 May Letter. His stated intention was to make the letter a non-binding agreement. Joanne agreed to this insertion on the plaintiff’s behalf. The plaintiff’s position is also that he did not agree to the Deletion and hence he did not agree to accept only the 9 Properties in satisfaction of the Loan Amount. The plaintiff based his claim on the Oral Agreement instead of the Amended 5 May Letter. I find that the evidence indicates an objective intention of the parties that the Amended 5 May Letter was not an agreement.
