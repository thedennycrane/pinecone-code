The Shipbuilding Contracts, however, were never executed; and the sum of US$2m was to be used instead as part of the acquisition price of certain Mexican companies that were owned by the second defendant.

These subsidiaries later became the subject of the plaintiffs’ proposed investment once the rig purchase project fell through. For the sake of clarity, I shall refer to the two subsidiaries as “GOSH” and “SMP”, although I should note that the parties frequently referred to the subsidiaries by their other names.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">5 During the relevant transactions, the defendants were represented by Captain Gerald Seow (“Capt Seow”) and Mr Jose Luis Montalvo, whom the parties referred to as “Pepe”. Only Capt Seow, however, was called by the defendants as a factual witness during the trial. Like the plaintiffs, the defendants also called an expert in Mexican law, Mr Francisco Gonzalez de Cossio (“Mr Gonzalez”).

GOSH owned six vessels that it chartered to one Oceanogafia S.A. de C.V. (“OSA”) which were then sub-chartered to the national oil company of Mexico, “PEMEX”. The second defendant funded the purchase of the vessels and took security over them.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">8 In May 2013, the second defendant and OSA experienced tensions in their working relationship due to OSA’s failure to make certain payments. Sometime in May 2013, Grupo Pegaso was invited by a Mexican governmental agency to attend a meeting. Grupo Pegaso was represented at the meeting by Mr Orvañanos and the chairman of Grupo Pegaso, Mr Alejandro Burillo Azcarraga (“Mr Burillo”).

</div> It was not disputed that there was no direct reply to this email, in the sense that Mr Orvañanos did not send back the draft Shipbuilding Contracts with any appended comments or edits, although his evidence was that he had given feedback to both Pepe orally and to Capt Seow by way of subsequent emails in November 2013, in which he addressed certain issues relating to the terms upon which the Shipbuilding Contracts would be entered into (see [17]–[18] below).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">13 On 10 September 2013, the actual specifications of the rigs to be built were sent to Mr Orvañanos, which is to be contrasted with the basic specifications that had previously been sent by Mr Tang (see [9] above). Upon receipt of the specifications, Mr Orvañanos asked Capt Seow for additional time to review the specifications, because although the Rig Purchase Agreement envisaged that the first plaintiff would review the said specifications and revert to the first defendant by 13 September 2013, the actual specifications were sent to Mr Orvañanos far too close to the deadline. Capt Seow acceded to this request, extending the deadline for the review of the specifications of the rigs to 24 September 2013.

Thus, on 26 September 2013, Capt Seow agreed to extend the deadline for the execution of the Shipbuilding Contracts from 16 October 2013 to 30 October 2013.

</div> and thus representatives from CP Latina visited the shipyard where the rigs were being constructed on 24 September 2013 in order to ascertain whether it was willing to fund the purchase of the rigs. The construction of the rigs, however, was not satisfactory to CP Latina for a variety of reasons. In order to assuage its concerns, CP Latina requested a formal inspection and the commissioning of a report by a marine surveying company known as Noble Denton. It appears that CP Latina’s need for a formal report also contributed to the extension of the deadline for the execution of the Shipbuilding Contracts.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">16 Noble Denton issued its report on 17 October 2013. The findings in the report were not entirely favourable to the first defendant, highlighting in particular that the construction of the rigs might not be completed on time and that the rigs as constructed might not be to PEMEX’s specifications.

</div> According to the email, Pepe informed Mr Orvañanos during the discussion that the defendants had an “interesting offer by a third party to buy the two platforms [<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the rigs]” and that the rigs could, at any time, be sold to this third party. In response to this, Mr Orvañanos stated that the first plaintiff was willing to finalise the Shipbuilding Contracts if the first defendant was willing to address the concerns that it had regarding the construction of the rigs up to that point, which were presumably the same concerns that had been revealed by the Noble Denton report. In particular, Mr Orvañanos was said to have proposed the following conditions:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) that there would be a discount of US$5m on the purchase price of each rig, for a total discount of US$10m;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) that the issues in the Noble Denton report relating to the quality of the rigs and the time of delivery would need to be addressed; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) that any penalties that PEMEX would impose on the first plaintiff for any late delivery would be borne by the first defendant.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">18 On 13 November 2013, Mr Orvañanos wrote directly to Capt Seow by email, proposing the same conditions that Pepe had already informed Capt Seow about in the email of 7 November 2013. Mr Orvañanos sought Capt Seow’s comments on the proposal and confirmed that the first plaintiff had “immense interest and responsibility towards this project”.

As will be elaborated on below, I found that Capt Seow never replied to this email. The defendants took the position that any silence on his part was indicative of a rejection of the proposal, especially because the terms proposed were, in Capt Seow’s words, “ridiculous”. In contrast, the plaintiffs’ position was that Capt Seow’s silence meant that he had failed to take the appropriate steps towards the execution of the Shipbuilding Contracts. The plaintiffs also relied on the discussion on 7 November 2013 and the email of 13 November 2013 as constituting the “feedback” that Mr Orvañanos gave to Capt Seow and/or Pepe in relation to the draft Shipbuilding Contracts sent on 3 September 2013 (see [12] above).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">20 Turning back to the negotiation of the Shipbuilding Contracts between the parties, on 27 December 2013, Mr Orvañanos emailed Capt Seow, suggesting that they meet to find a way to move forward with the negotiations. Capt Seow replied on 30 December 2013, stating that his schedule had not been finalised and that if Mr Orvañanos planned to travel to Singapore to meet, it would be best done “before 20th Jan, or after 1st week of March”.

While the parties dispute what precisely was said during this meeting, it was clear that after this meeting, both Mr Orvañanos and Capt Seow were aware that the Shipbuilding Contracts would no longer be executed and that both parties would move on from this project. In particular, Mr Orvañanos took the position that during the meeting, Capt Seow had assured him that the US$2m deposit could be put into another investment, this time with the second defendant, either by the plaintiffs investing in its subsidiaries directly or in a vessel that was owned by the second defendant through its subsidiaries.

This can be seen from an email that was sent by Mr Granada Ramirez Diego Julian (“Mr Ramirez”) of the plaintiffs to Mr Phang later that day, referencing the conversation between the two, albeit in passing:

The plaintiffs contended that this email, coupled with the oral conversation of 9 July 2014, showed that there was a legally binding agreement between the parties to return the sum of US$2m, although I should note that the plaintiffs’ case was that despite the wording of this email, the successful sale of the rigs was not a condition precedent to the return of the deposit. In contrast, the defendants took the position that this email showed that any indication that they would refund the sum of US$2m was purely a gesture of goodwill and did not create any legally binding obligations.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 Mr Orvañanos replied on the same day, thanking Capt Seow for his proposal and stating that the parties would “structure the refund as [Capt Seow] propose[d]”.

The parties continued to discuss the details of the plaintiffs’ investment in the Mexican companies owned by the second defendant, this time relating to the purchase of a 35% interest in GOSH. On 27 August 2014, Mr Orvañanos had separate telephone conversations with both Pepe and Capt Seow in relation to the investment. The details of what Mr Orvañanos had discussed with Capt Seow were recorded in the following email that was later sent by Capt Seow to Mr Orvañanos:

It was revealing that when asked why he had not sought to query Capt Seow about his 7 September 2013 email (see [62]), Mr Orvañanos said that this was because the first plaintiff’s “strategy” was to “see for [themselves]” and to seek “personal” confirmation from Pemex that it had “indeed, received and accepted” the detailed specifications.

</div> That the first plaintiff had this “strategy” plainly indicated that it could not have genuinely believed that Pemex had received and accepted the detailed technical specifications for the rigs before the signing of the Rig Purchase Agreement. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 Indeed, far from relying on any representation by the 1st defendant of Pemex’s supposed approbation of the detailed technical specifications for the rigs, the contemporaneous email evidence showed that the 1st plaintiff was aware it was responsible for seeking Pemex’s approval of these technical specifications. Thus, for example, as the defendants pointed out, in an email to Capt Seow on 10 October 2013, Mr Orvañanos himself had spoken of the plaintiffs needing “to go to Pemex and show them the specs and the report for their blessing”. Asked what he meant by obtaining Pemex’s “blessing”, Mr Orvañanos stated that this meant getting Pemex to “approve the specifications”. In the same portion of his cross-examination, he also conceded that the 1st plaintiff was responsible for obtaining this “blessing”:

A preliminary issue arose, therefore, as to whether Mexican law or Singapore law should be applied in determining whether such a collateral contract was formed. The plaintiffs submitted that Mexican law should be applied. I did not agree with their submission. In gist, my reasons were as follows.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 Firstly, as the defendants pointed out, the cases replied on by the plaintiffs in making the above submission (chiefly, <span class="font-italic">Las Vegas Hilton</span><span class="font-italic"> Corp (trading as Las Vegas Hilton) v Khoo Teng Hock Sunny </span>[1996] 2 SLR(R) 549 (“<span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Las Vegas Hilton</span><span class="font-underline">”)</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>and <span class="font-italic">Pacific Recreation</span><span class="font-italic"> Pte Ltd v S Y Technology Inc and another appeal </span>[2008] 2 SLR(R) 491 (“<span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Pacific Recreation</span>”)) were cases where the issue of whether a contract had been formed was not itself in contention – unlike the present case. In <span class="font-italic">Las Vegas Hilton</span>, there was no dispute as to the existence of an agreement between the parties, which was for the plaintiff to grant the defendant a USD 1 million credit facility. Instead, in the suit brought by the plaintiff in the Singapore High Court to recover balance sums repayable by the defendant, the dispute was over the place where the contract to grant credit facilities was made, the proper law of the contract, and whether the contract was enforceable in Singapore law. This was because whereas the plaintiff contended that the contract was made in Las Vegas and governed by Nevada law, the defendant contended that the contract was made in Singapore, that the proper law was Singapore law, and that the contract should accordingly be held to be void because it was a contract to game, and such contracts offended public policy in Singapore. In respect of the question of the proper law of the contract for credit facilities, Chao J (as he then was) held that the court had to first consider whether the parties had “in terms in their agreement expressed what law they intend to govern”; failing which “the court has to impute an intention, or to determine for the parties what is the proper law which, as just and reasonable persons, they ought or would have intended” (see at [41] of <span class="font-italic">Las Vegas Hilton</span>). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">71 In <span class="font-italic">Pacific Recreation</span>, the dispute between the parties was over whether the Deed of Indemnity executed in the respondent’s favour by the appellant PRPL, another company PAPL, and their founder Mr Lee, was governed by Chinese law or by Singapore law. The appellant, PAPL and Mr Lee, argued that the Deed was governed by Chinese law, and that it was invalid because it had been entered into pursuant to an earlier contract which was void under Chinese law. The respondent argued that the Deed was governed by Singapore law. What all parties were agreed on, however, was that the Deed existed. For this reason, it made sense for the court considering the governing law of the Deed to apply the three-stage test propounded in cases such as <span class="font-italic">Overseas Union Insurance Ltd v </span><span class="font-italic">Turegum Insurance Co</span> [2001] 2 SLR(R) 285. In the first stage of this test, the court examined the contract itself to determine whether it stated expressly what the governing law should be. In the absence of an express provision, the court considered whether the parties’ intention as to the governing law could be inferred from the circumstances. If this could not be done, the third stage was to determine with which system of law the contract had “its most close and real connection” – and that system would “be taken, objectively, as the governing or proper law of the contract” (see at [38] of <span class="font-italic">Pacific Recreation</span>).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">72 Having regard to the formulation of the three-stage test, it would not make sense to apply the test in a case where one party denies altogether the existence of any agreement. In such a case, it would be illogical to apply the first stage of the test and to look at what the express provisions of the contract say – since one party disputes that there is any contract to look at. Nor would it make sense to apply the second stage of the test and to ask whether the parties’ intention as to the governing law of the contract can be inferred from the circumstances. Indeed, there is nothing in the judgements in <span class="font-italic">Las Vegas Hilton</span> and <span class="font-italic">Pacific Recreation</span> to suggest that where the very existence of a contract is disputed, the appropriate system of law to apply in addressing that dispute may be discerned by the court leapfrogging the first two stages of the three-stage <span class="font-italic">Pacific Recreation </span>test to apply the third stage.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">73 From the (admittedly insubstantial) case law available, it would appear that judicial views have been divided as to whether the <span class="font-italic">lex</span><span class="font-italic"> fori</span> (see <span class="font-italic">Oceanic Sun Line Special Shipping Co </span><span class="font-italic">Inc v Fay</span> [1988] 79 ALR 9 at 55) or the “putative proper law” test (see <span class="font-italic">The </span><span class="font-italic">Parouth</span> [1982] 2 Lloyd’s Rep 351 at 353) should apply in considering whether a contract has been formed. As I indicated in delivering oral judgement, I favoured the application of the <span class="font-italic">lex</span><span class="font-italic"> fori</span> in a case like the present, where the existence of the entire contract is disputed, since it seemed to me to avoid the circularity of the “putative proper law” test which “assumes that a contract has been formed, and then determines the proper law on that basis in order to determine whether the contract has been formed” (Professor Yeo Tiong Min, S.C, <span class="font-italic">Private International Law: Law Reform in Miscellaneous Matters</span> (unpublished).

</div> In this connection, the evidence before me – including contemporaneous email evidence – simply did not support a finding that the parties had reached the consensus necessary for the formation of a binding contract, whether as a result of communications on 9 July 2014 or on 11 July 2014. This being the defendants’ appeal and the decision on this issue of a collateral contract having been in their favour, I do not propose to set out in detail my factual findings in this respect, but will highlight a number of salient matters. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">75 From the outset, Mr Orvañanos has maintained in his AEIC that in a telephone conversation with Capt Seow on 9 July 2014, he “stressed to Capt Seow” that “Grupo Pegaso (including the 2nd Plaintiff) would only be able to carry on with the negotiations with the 2nd Defendant if there was some assurance that the Deposits would be returned”. Mr Orvañanos’s evidence was that in this telephone conversation, Capt Seow “agreed that the Deposits would be returned”,

In response to an email from the plaintiffs’ financial advisor Mr Granada Ramirez Diego Julian to the 2nd defendant’s Mr Jeffrey Phang which stated that the Term Sheet for the 2nd plaintiff’s proposed investment in SMP (POSH) should reflect the US$2 million being credited to the SMP deal, Mr Phang’s email reply expressly set down two “conditions” for the return of the US$2 million: that “Grupo Pegaso becomes a partner in SMP”, and that the return of the monies be made “(u)pon the sale of the jackup rig to a third party, and full payment [being] received from the third party”.

</div> This articulation of the conditions for the return of the monies clearly diverged from Mr Orvañanos’ own assertion in his AEIC of an apparently unconditional refund. Clearly, therefore, assuming Mr Orvañanos had made a proposal on 9 July 2013 for the unconditional return of the plaintiffs’ US$2 million payment, the defendants’ documented response to that proposal changed the terms of that proposal. In the circumstances, I did not find it possible to say that a valid offer and acceptance had arisen out of the 9 July 2013 telephone call and the ensuing correspondence; and I agreed with the defendants that it “was simply not possible for any contract for the unconditional refund of the Rig Deposit to have arisen out of the 9 July Conversation”.

Both Mr Sanchez Medal and Mr Gonzalez Cossio were in agreement that a valid offer arose under Mexican law only if the debtor-offeror had the will to incur liability (that is, to be legally bound); and in this respect, the Singapore position – that a contracting party must intend to create legal relations (see <span class="font-italic">The Law of Contract in Singapore </span>(Andrew Phang Boon Leong gen ed) (Academy Publishing, 2012) at para 0.5.001) – is not in my view substantively different.

</div> Two points need to be made about the plaintiffs’ reliance on <span class="font-italic">Chuan</span><span class="font-italic"> &amp; Co</span>. First, the CA’s judgement in <span class="font-italic">Chuan</span><span class="font-italic"> &amp; Co</span> highlighted the need for the alleged acknowledgement of debt to be “clear” and “plain” (see at [12], [23] and [28]). Thus, for example, Chao Hick Tin JA (who delivered the judgement of the CA) referenced <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span> the decision of the English Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Dungate</span><span class="font-italic"> v</span> <span class="font-italic">Dungate</span> [1965] 3 All ER 818 (see at [23]). In that case, the letter relied on by the plaintiff as constituting an acknowledgement of debt contained the sentence: “Keep a check on totals and amounts I owe you and we will have an account now and then”. This, in Diplock LJ’s view, “made it quite plain that there were amounts owing and outstanding”.  In contrast, in <span class="font-italic">Chuan</span><span class="font-italic"> &amp; Co </span>itself, where the letter from the respondent relied on by the appellant (Chuan) as an acknowledgement of debt simply referred to Chuan’s “allegation” of a debt and asked Chuan for documents “substantiating the alleged debts”, the CA held that it was unable to read the letter as amounting to an acknowledgement of debt (at [28]).  In the same vein, I did not find that the email correspondence relied on by the plaintiffs constituted a sufficiently “clear and unequivocal” acknowledgement of debt.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">79 Secondly, insofar as the plaintiffs appeared to be suggesting that the emails of 27 August and 28 August 2014 should be read in isolation from all other contemporaneous communications, such an approach appeared to me to be unrealistic and contrary to common sense. The emails of 27 August and 28 August 2014 were sandwiched between Mr Jeffrey Phang’s email of 10 July 2014

As noted earlier, Mr Phang’s email of 10 July 2014 expressly stated that the return of the US$2m would be made “with the following conditions”: namely, Grupo Pegaso becoming a partner in SMP, the jack-up rigs being sold to one thirdparty and full payment being received from the third party.

</div> or of one of the other Mexican companies”; and he also informed that the two rigs had been sold and that the stage payments were expected to be received “shortly”. Capt Seow’s emails of 27 August and 28 August 2014 then sought to assure Mr Orvañanos that because the defendants wanted Grupo Pegaso to be “comfortable” deciding for itself the merits of investing in one of the defendants’ Mexican companies and did not wish to “exert pressure” on Grupo Pegaso, the refund of the US$2m would not depend on Grupo Pegaso acquiring shares in one of the Mexican companies – that is, the first of the two “conditions” spoken of by Mr Phang would not apply. It may also be noted that in his email of 11 July 2014, Capt Seow had spoken in terms of the US$2m having been “forfeited” previously and had referred to the proposed “refund” of the sum as “a gesture of goodwill”. In his further email on 29 August 2014, Capt Seow spoke of the US$2m as a “non-refundable deposit”. In all these circumstances, therefore, I did not find it feasible to characterise the 27 August and 28 August 2014 emails as a “clear” and unequivocal acknowledgement by the defendants that they <span class="font-italic">owed the US$2</span><span class="font-italic">m as a debt</span> to the plaintiffs.    </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">80 For the reasons set out above, I found against the plaintiffs in respect of their claim of acknowledgment and/or admission of debt by Capt Seow.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">81 That I found the evidence insufficient to prove any collateral contract for the return of the US$2m or any acknowledgement by the defendants of this sum being owed as a debt to the plaintiffs did not mean that the defendants were in law justified in retaining the US$2m following the non-execution of the Shipbuilding Contracts. On the contrary, I found that the first defendant was not entitled to forfeit this sum under the terms of the Rig Purchase Agreement and that the first plaintiff was accordingly entitled to have the sum returned to it under the terms of the said Agreement when the Shipbuilding Contracts were not eventually entered into; in the alternative, the first plaintiff was entitled to the refund of this US$2m deposit on the basis of total failure of consideration. I will now explain my reasons for these findings. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">On the plaintiffs’ claim for the return of the US$2m under the terms of the Rig Purchase Agreement (the second issue)</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">82 On the above-captioned second issue, parties were <span class="font-italic">ad idem</span> that the first defendant had an express contractual right to forfeit the US$2m – but “only in the event” of the Shipbuilding Contracts “for a reason attributable to [the first plaintiff]”.

I arrived at this understanding based on the following reasons. First, the terms of the Rig Purchase Agreement clearly distinguished between acts attributable to one party and those attributable to both the parties. Thus, for example, in addressing the situations in which parties were unable to agree on changes to the specifications for the rigs, clause 1.2 expressly distinguished between situations where such lack of agreement was due to the first defendant and situations where the lack of agreement was due to both the parties (“<span class="font-italic">If the [first defendant] cannot comply with such changes to the specifications or if the parties cannot agree on such variation to the key terms, then this Agreement will be terminated without penalty and the [first defendant] shall refund to [the first plaintiff] the Vessel Deposit paid under clause 2.2 by 20 September 2013</span>”).  It appeared to me, therefore, that if the parties had intended the provision for forfeiture in clauses 2.2 and 3.2 to be triggered by non-execution of the Shipbuilding Contracts for reasons attributable to both the parties, they would have said so expressly. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">84 In any event, it was not disputed that the Rig Purchase Agreement was prepared by the defendants:

</div> In my view, this was factually incorrect. From the contemporaneous email evidence, it was clear that in early November 2013, Mr Orvañanos conveyed a number of comments to Pepe (the defendants’ local representative in Mexico). As noted earlier, in an internal email to Capt Seow on 7 November 2013,

</div> Pepe updated Capt Seow on a meeting with Mr Orvañanos in which the latter had informed him that the plaintiffs were “interested in go ahead and sign the final contract of purchase” subject to an updated Noble Denton report on delivery time and quality of construction, as well as the inclusion in the penalty clauses in the Shipbuilding Contract of penalties which would “mirror” those included in the plaintiffs’ contract with Pemex for the lease of the jack-up rigs. Pepe added that the plaintiffs also wanted to “(f)ormalize the discount price of $5 million per platform”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">87 Pepe’s meeting with Mr Orvañanos and his update to Capt Seow were followed by an email by Mr Orvañanos to Capt Seow on 13 November 2013 in which he started by thanking the defendants for their “offer of discounting US$ 10MM from the agreed price”.

After all, as the plaintiffs pointed out, Capt Seow too had at various points in his testimony under cross-examination brought up matters on which his AEIC was silent – even admitting at one point that the evidence given in his AEIC was incorrect whereas his oral testimony (on the same issue) represented the truth.

<div class="FootnoteRef text-justify"> NE 24 August 2018, 163:8–163:16; 167:9-167:24; 183:5-183:22. In gist, Capt Seow conceded in cross-examination that the statement in his AEIC (para 37) that Mr Orvañanos had requested the refund of the Rig Deposit “(o)ver the course of the Negotiations” was wrong; and that the truth was that Mr Orvañanos had “never asked for the return” of the Deposit “(b)efore…the middle of 2014”: “I volunteered to [Mr Orvañanos] that we would reimburse the money and never put it in writing”. See also Plaintiffs’ Reply Submissions at paras 5 and 6.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> Since AEICs are usually drafted in the first instance by lawyers and lay witnesses are not always as meticulous as they should be in reviewing their AEICs (nor their memories always as sharp as one might hope at the time of reviewing such AEICs), I do not think it reasonable to accuse a witness of “manufacturing” evidence the moment he gives oral testimony which either does not appear in his AEIC or which diverges from it. The court still has to evaluate the credibility of that oral testimony – an exercise which includes <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span> considering whether the oral testimony is supported by objective documentary evidence. In the present case, Mr Orvañanos’ testimony about having given comments on the proposed Shipbuilding Contracts was substantiated by the contemporaneous email evidence – namely, Pepe’s email to Capt Seow on 7 November 2013 conveying Mr Orvañanos’ proposals, and the email from Mr Orvañanos himself to Capt Seow on 13 November 2013. In the circumstances, there was simply no basis for the defendants’ contention that Mr Orvañanos “manufactured the assertion that the 1st Plaintiff had provided its comments on the draft Shipbuilding Contract over the course of cross-examination”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">90 The defendants also sought to argue that Mr Orvañanos’ comments – as conveyed through Pepe and through Mr Orvañanos’ own email – were “not genuine comments on the draft Shipbuilding Contract” but rather, attempts “to negotiate the agreement between the parties”.

</div> I rejected this argument for the following reasons.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">91 First, the defendants did not manage to explain what sort of comments might amount to “genuine comments”. If all the defendants meant was that the plaintiffs were restricted solely to commenting on the clauses which were already incorporated in the 3 September 2013 drafts and which were highlighted to Mr Orvañanos in cross-examination (<span class="font-italic">i.e.</span>, the clauses dealing with matters such as the flag state and shipping registry jurisdiction of the rigs, the governing law, dispute resolution, force majeure, liquidated damages, etc), this seemed to me an entirely illogical and unrealistic proposition. Given that the first plaintiff was proposing to enter into contracts for which the total purchase price came to nearly US$400m, I did not think either the first plaintiff or the first defendant would have contemplated the former’s comments on these proposed contracts being restricted solely to comments on the draft clauses highlighted by counsel – or that they would have contemplated the first plaintiff being somehow barred from raising issues not already incorporated in the draft contracts. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">92 Indeed, nothing in the email exchange between Capt Seow and Mr Orvañanos on 3 September 2013

</div> suggested that the first plaintiff would be precluded from raising matters not already spelt out in the draft contract. In connection with this, it should be remembered that at the point when the draft Shipbuilding Contract was forwarded to Mr Orvañanos on 3 September 2013, barely a fortnight had elapsed since his first meeting with Capt Seow in August 2013:
                   <sup><button class="btn btn-link superscript-btn" data-target="#fn-707de228-7cbe-46d9-92fb-6a5a5ad804fe" data-toggle="modal" type="button">94</button></sup>

</div>
</div>
</div> obviously, parties would have had little time to hammer out all the terms of the intended deal. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">93 In these circumstances, I did not see why the comments highlighted above from Mr Orvañanos’ 13 November 2013 email should be dismissed as “not [being] genuine comments on the draft Shipbuilding Contract”. In any event, at least one of the comments in Mr Orvañanos’ 13 November 2013 email related to one of the draft contractual clauses brought up by counsel in cross-examination – namely, the liquidated damages clause (Article XI).

</div>
</div> As it then stood in the draft contract on 3 September 2013, this clause provided for the first defendant (“Builder”) to pay liquidated damages at US$20,000 per day “for each and every day that the delivery of the Rig is…delayed more than sixty (60) day beyond” the specified Delivery Date. In his email of 13 November 2013, the second of the proposals put forward by Mr Orvañanos was that the parties should reflect in the final contract “the same penalties that Pemex would vest upon [the plaintiffs] for late delivery, if [the 1sf defendant’s] delivery is late”. The defendants did not explain why this did not amount to a “genuine comment on the draft Shipbuilding Contract”. In my view, it did.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">94 For the reasons set out above, I rejected the defendants’ contention that the non-execution of the Shipbuilding Contract was due to the first plaintiff’s failure to revert with questions or comments on the draft. Going further, I also found that having received Mr Orvañanos’ comments, the defendants did not respond.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">95  I found it telling, first of all, that when cross-examined about Mr Orvañanos’ email of 13 November 2013, Capt Seow said he could not recall responding to Mr Orvañanos.

</div> This seemed an oddly evasive response, given that in the same breath, Capt Seow also vehemently disparaged Mr Orvañanos’ proposals as being “ridiculous” and insisted that it was “totally out of the question” that the first defendant should “face some penalties from Pemex which [it was] not even a party to”. Having regard to his vigorous critique of Mr Orvañanos’ proposals and of the first plaintiff and Mr Orvañanos himself (“<span class="font-italic">Mr </span><span class="font-italic">Orvañanos and Pegaso at that time to my mind was all over the place</span>”), I would have expected Capt Seow to issue to Mr Orvañanos a swift and firm rejection of his proposals. The fact that he claimed instead to be unable to recall responding to Mr Orvañanos, coupled with the absence of any objective evidence of a response, strongly suggested that he had <span class="font-italic">not</span> responded – and was belatedly realising under cross-examination the adverse repercussions of this omission. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">96 I would add that if one were to step back and take a look at the general tenor and content of the communications between the parties in the period following 3 September 2013, the defendants’ submission – that the first plaintiff had failed to take steps to execute the Shipbuilding Contracts – simply could not be borne out. I set out below some of the contemporaneous email communications which in my view showed clearly that in the period after 3 September 2013, the first plaintiff was taking active steps towards the successful conclusion of the deal for the purchase of rigs, and the defendants were well aware of – and responsive to – these efforts.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">97 Thus, for example, on 23 September 2013, Pepe informed Capt Seow via an internal email that:

Whilst both the plaintiffs and the defendants have sought to blame each other for CP Latina’s decision to withdraw from the deal for the rigs, it was clear to me on the evidence available that CP Latina’s withdrawal did not put an end to the deal at that point in time. First, it is not disputed that following the withdrawal of CP Latina, the plaintiffs continued their efforts to find a suitable partner in Mexico. This is alluded to, for example, in Pepe’s email update to Capt Seow on 7 November 2013, in which Pepe informed that “Grupo Pegaso continue with negotiations with Grupo Alfa”;

In his email of 25 October 2013 to Pepe updating the latter on the extension of the contract-signing deadline, Capt Seow stated that he himself would be going to the shipyard the following week “to discuss action plan with SY [presumably the shipyard] to show Baudelio we can deliver” (Baudelio being the senior Pemex executive who had visited the shipyard earlier in 2013).

My reasons were as follows. In the first place, Capt Seow had stated in cross-examination that if he himself were to go and talk to his partner Mr Yanez about the acquisition of his shares, the latter “would be very very insulted”.

Our strategy is to let him talk and wait until we find the proper spot to come in and mention the “possibility” of acquiring his stake in GOSH. I discussed this with Jose Luis [Pepe] last week and we felt that the solution of keeping the accounts payable of USD$18MM, plus keeping one of your vessels, both as payments for their 50% stake in the company might be appealing to him. <span class="font-italic">I just need to know if such solution has been discussed with him or not.</span><span class="font-italic"> As you well advised, we will be very careful.</span> But we are very excited that we could put together a partnership with you in which we could have 6 vessels and 2 jack ups, all with Pemex contracts.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">118 The above email is revealing for two key reasons. First, Mr Orvañanos’ reference to putting together a “partnership” with the defendants in which they “could have 6 vessels <span class="font-italic">and 2 jack ups</span>” showed that as far as the plaintiffs were concerned, their interest in investing in one of the defendants’ Mexican companies was not meant to be a substitute for the intended purchase of the two rigs: the plaintiffs’ intention was apparently to achieve both the conclusion of the deal for the rigs and investment in one of the defendants’ Mexican entities. This was again reflected in Mr Orvañanos’ email of 27 December 2013 to Capt Seow, in which he updated the latter that the plaintiffs had “continued in [their] search for a local operator” and had also been meeting with “diverse officials from all relevant positions all across Pemex” to gain a “clear understanding of Pemex immediate interests”.

</div> – they meet either in January or in March 2014. It is not disputed that they eventually met on 24 January 2014 in Singapore.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">119 Capt Seow’s email reply on 30 December 2013 and the subsequent email correspondence are also revealing for the following reasons. First, it is noteworthy that despite the deadline for the execution of the Shipbuilding Contracts being ostensibly due on 31 December 2013, Capt Seow did not allude to this fact at all, nor did he point out to Mr Orvañanos that the plaintiffs had (according to the defendants’ case at trial) failed to forward any comments on the draft contracts. In fact, despite the defendants contending that “(b)y 31 December 2013, the 1st Plaintiff had not executed the Shipbuilding Contract”, the contemporaneous email evidence showed that post 31 December 2013, the plaintiffs continued to take steps towards the execution of the contracts, and the defendants were not only aware of this but also sought to encourage them. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">120 Thus, for example, prior to the meeting on 24 January 2014, Mr Orvañanos had emailed Capt Seow on 11 January 2014 to report a planned meeting with another potential partner for the operation of the rigs (Perforadora Mexico).
                   <sup><button class="btn btn-link superscript-btn" data-target="#fn-026e2508-369a-437b-a88c-3ddf696d48bc" data-toggle="modal" type="button">123</button></sup>

</div> In the same email, Mr Orvañanos also reported that it appeared that Pemex – which had up till then been immersed in internal reforms – would “soon tender the purchase of a number of rigs as well as number of traditional rig rentals”, and that “(e)verything looks very promising”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">121 It must be remembered that the defendants’ case was that the 31 December 2013 deadline expired without the Shipbuilding Contracts being executed because the 1st plaintiff “was not able to successfully market the Rigs to Pemex”.

</div> If this had indeed been the defendants’ position all along, one would have expected Capt Seow to respond to the above email by pointing out to Mr Orvañanos that the deadline for executing the Shipbuilding Contracts had long passed and that the 1st plaintiff had only themselves to blame if they had not managed to “successfully market the Rigs to Pemex”. Capt Seow did no such thing. Instead, on 16 January 2014, he emailed Mr Orvañanos as follows:

There was simply no reason otherwise for Mr Orvañanos to have made these statements. There was also no evidence of any rebuttal by Capt Seow of these assertions as to previous discussions. Indeed, if Mr Orvañanos had for some reason decided to insert blatant falsehoods about such previous discussions in his email to Capt Seow, it was unbelievable that Capt Seow would simply have chosen to ignore them and to keep quiet – especially when Mr Orvañanos was proposing to speak to the defendants’ Mexican partner about acquiring his shares. To my mind, this piece of evidence indicated that the defendants were aware of the plaintiffs’ interest in acquiring a stake in one of their Mexican entities – and that far from being averse to this interest, they had engaged in at least some discussions with the plaintiffs on how to achieve the acquisition of such a stake. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">124 In this connection, the defendants’ acquiescence in and encouragement of the plaintiffs’ interest was not surprising, given Capt Seow’s admission in cross-examination of the poor state of relations between the defendants and their then Mexican partners. In gist, Capt Seow claimed that “the company” had not harboured any thoughts of exiting its then Mexican partners from GOSH in 2013 even if “some people” might have held that view. However, when asked to clarify, he actually admitted that sometime in 2013, the defendants had been compelled to threaten withdrawal of their financing of the GOSH vessels because of the tardiness of their then Mexican partners in paying them their share of the charter payments from Pemex:

According to Mr Orvañanos, by the time he met Capt Seow on 24 January 2014 (which was some two weeks after his update to Capt Seow on 11 January), he had started having concerns about the viability of getting new contracts for the rigs and was thinking of suggesting that the rig purchase deal be abandoned and the US$2m deposit be returned – but when he broached this possibility with Capt Seow, the latter’s response was as follows:

</div> He claimed that he had told Mr Orvañanos this was because “the extended deadline for the execution of the Shipbuilding Contracts of 31 December 2013 had lapsed”. I did not believe Capt Seow’s claims in this respect, given that he had on 16 January 2014 expressly invited Mr Orvañanos to “visit the rigs” when he was in Singapore so as to “witness the progress”. As noted earlier, Capt Seow also claimed in cross-examination that Mr Orvañanos had “never asked” him about the return of the Rig Deposits during the 24 January 2014 meeting. Again, I did not find Capt Seow’s evidence credible in this respect, given that he conceded his testimony in cross-examination directly contradicted the statement in his AEIC that Mr Orvañanos had requested the refund of the Rig Deposits “(o)ver the course of the Negotiations” for the Plaintiffs’ investment into GOSH and/or the vessel POSH Gannet.

Instead, it was attributable to the parties shifting their focus to the plaintiffs’ proposed investment in one of the defendants’ Mexican companies, which shift in focus led Capt Seow to tell Mr Orvañanos on 24 January 2014 that “the 1st Defendant would be selling the Rigs to another buyer” and to propose that the plaintiffs consider investing into the vessel POSH Gannet instead. This is why I stated in giving oral judgement that the non-execution of the Shipbuilding Contracts was attributable to both parties, if not to the defendants. I would add that contrary to the defendants’ contention, this state of affairs was actually pleaded in the alternative by the plaintiffs in their Statement of Claim: see in this respect [18.2] of the Statement of Claim which asserted that the Shipbuilding Contract “was not entered into because…[the first defendant] intended to sell the Rigs to another purchaser”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">129 For the above reasons, I found that the first defendant was not entitled to forfeit the US$2m under the terms of the Rig Purchase Agreement, and that the plaintiffs were accordingly entitled to have the said sum returned.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">On the issue of total failure of consideration (the third issue)</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">130 I also found the plaintiffs to be entitled to the return of the US$2m based on the alternative ground of total failure of consideration. My reasons were as follows.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">131 In their Statement of Claim, the plaintiffs pleaded in the alternative that the Rig Deposits totalling US$2m “were pre-contractual deposits paid to the First Defendant in their anticipation of the parties entering into the Shipbuilding Contract”; and that these contracts not having ultimately been entered into, “there was a total failure of consideration and of basis and the sum of USD 2,000,000 should be returned to the First Plaintiff”.

In the Defence, the defendants simply pleaded a denial of [14] and [25] of the Statement of Claim. Having regard to the materiality of the characterisation of the US$2m payment, I considered the defendants’ omission a fundamental defect in their pleadings and would have been inclined to reject outright the argument they put forth in their closing submissions on this matter – but for the absence of any objections from the plaintiffs themselves. In fact, the plaintiffs sought to respond in some detail to the defendants’ submissions on the alleged “earnest”.

In that case, the appellant contended that the judge at first instance had erred in failing to find that the deposit of £1m remitted by the respondent was a holding deposit for the two specified yachts and was not refundable if he subsequently declined to purchase either yacht. The CA noted that “(o)rdinarily”, if a deposit were a true pre-contract deposit: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">46 …Part of the basis of payment of a pre-contract deposit is that the contract will subsequently come into existence.

</div> the CA explained that the basis of a transfer must be “objectively determined based on what is communicated between the parties; the parties’ uncommunicated subjective thoughts are irrelevant”(see at [51]). From the CA’s judgement, it is clear that the starting-point of an inquiry into the basis of a transfer must be to examine whether any express agreement or understanding existed between the parties as to such basis; if yes, the terms of that express agreement or understanding; and if no, whether the basis may be objectively implied from the evidence (see [67] of <span class="font-italic">Benzline</span>). In <span class="font-italic">Benzline</span>, the CA examined the evidence first to ascertain whether there was any express agreement between the appellant and the respondent as to the basis for the payment of a sum of $300,000 by the latter to the former: the respondent contended that the money had been paid on the basis that it would be entering into an Exclusive Sub-Dealership Programme with the appellants; the appellant disagreed. The CA held that the weight of the evidence before it militated against there having been any express understanding that entry into the Exclusive Sub-Dealership Programme formed part of the basis of the payment; and that such a basis also could not be objectively implied. Instead, the CA found that on the evidence before it, the implied basis for the payment was not that the parties would enter into the Exclusive Sub-Dealership Programme, but that the appellant would <span class="font-italic">offer</span> the respondent the Exclusive Sub-Dealership Programme on terms which would correspond in material ways to the first draft of an agreement (“the First Draft Agreement”) between the appellant and Lorinser (Lorinser was the company responsible for modifying the cars which formed the subject-matter of the proposed Exclusive Sub-Dealership Programme). At the second stage of the inquiry, the CA found that this basis had not failed because the appellant had been prepared to move forward with the Exclusive Sub-Dealership Programme, whereas it was the respondent who had thrown a spanner in the works by refusing to provide a standby letter of credit – something which was required in the First Draft Agreement. In the circumstances, the respondent was not entitled to the return of the money when the Exclusive Sub-Dealership Programme was eventually not entered into.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">136 In <span class="font-italic">Lee Chee Wei v Tan </span><span class="font-italic">Chor Peow Victor and others</span> [2007] 3 SLR(R) 537 (“<span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Lee Chee Wei</span>”),

</div>
</div> the plaintiff had entered into an agreement to sell his shares in a company (“DMS”) to the fourth defendant. When the agreement fell through, a question arose as to whether the fourth defendant was entitled to the return of a sum of $750,000 which had been paid as an initial deposit under the agreement. The CA found that it was so entitled, after scrutinizing a number of clauses in the agreement. It pointed out that these clauses stipulated that the purchase price of the shares would be paid by multiple instalments and expressly characterised the $750,000 as an “instalment” in contradistinction to a “deposit”, “thereby branding it as an advance payment” which was “<span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> immediately repayable” (see at [88] and [89]). As the English Court of Appeal noted in <span class="font-italic">Howe v Smith</span> (1884) 27 Ch. D. 89 at 98 (an authority referenced by the CA in <span class="font-italic">Lee Chee Wei</span>):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…the question as to the right of the purchaser to the return of the deposit money must, in each case, be a question of the conditions of the contract.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">137  It should be noted that in <span class="font-italic">Lee Chee Wei</span>, the $750,000 payment was a “deposit paid upon or after the conclusion of a contract”, since the agreement for the purchase of the DMS shares was already in existence when the payment was made. In <span class="font-italic">United Artists Singapore Theatres Pte Ltd v Parkway Parade Pte Ltd</span> [2003] 1 SLR(R) 791 (“<span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">United Artists</span>”), the High Court noted that the difference between a pre-contract deposit and a deposit paid on or after the conclusion of a contract (a “contract deposit”) was that a pre-contract deposit was <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> recoverable if the prospective contract in connection with which the payment was made did not come into existence; whereas a contract deposit served the “dual purpose of an earnest to bind the bargain and as part payment of the purchase price”: “…that the expression used in the present contract that the money is paid ‘as a deposit and in part payment of the purchase money’ relates to the two alternatives, and declares that in the event of the purchaser making default the money is to be forfeited and that in the event of the purchaser making default the money is to be forfeited and that in the event of the purchase being completed the sum is to be taken in part payment” (see at [71] to [77]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">138 In <span class="font-italic">United Artists</span>, the plaintiffs negotiated with the defendants between 1994 and 1999 to develop and manage a Cineplex. Over the course of that period, four payments totalling $1,846,900 were made by the plaintiffs to the defendants. In 1999 the plaintiffs decided not to undertake the project. The High Court found that the payments in question were “pre-contract deposits which served as an indication of the plaintiffs’ confidence with funding, genuine interest and seriousness in being the casino operator”: they served as a tangible assurance of genuine intent, and were made in anticipation of the lease that was being negotiated, and without any intention that they would be outright payments if a lease was not concluded; and they were therefore objectively recoverable in the event of failure to reach a final agreement. As the CA later highlighted in <span class="font-italic">Benzline</span> at [59], there were “three significant facts which grounded the decision in <span class="font-italic">United Artists</span>: the multiple references to ‘good faith payment” in the documentary evidence, the defendants’ specific request for tangible assurance of the plaintiffs’ financial ability to complete the deal; and the repeated emphasis that the arrangements were “subject to contract”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">139 Applying the above case law to the present case, I considered whether the express terms of the Rig Purchase Agreement supported the plaintiffs’ characterisation of the US$2m as a pre-contract deposit paid in anticipation of the Shipbuilding Contract being entered into, or whether they supported the defendants’ contention that the payment “served as an earnest for the [1st Plaintiff’s] performance of the Rig Purchase Agreement and was paid as a quid pro quo for the 1st Defendant reserving the Rigs for the 1st Plaintiff”. It was clear to me that the express terms of the Rig Purchase Agreement supported the plaintiffs’ claim and militated against the defendants’. For ease of reference, I reproduce again below the relevant terms in clauses 2.2 and 3.2:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">2. Deposit</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">2.1 [The first plaintiff] shall pay to [the first defendant] a sum of US$1,000,000 for each Vessel (the “Vessel Deposit”) …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">2.2 <span class="font-italic">The Vessel Deposit shall be applied towards the first instalment under the relevant Shipbuilding Contract to be entered into between the [first plaintiff] and the [first defendant] for each Vessel in accordance with the terms herein. In the event that the Shipbuilding Contract is not entered into for a reason attributable to [the first plaintiff], the Vessel Deposit shall be forfeited by [the first plaintiff] and the [first defendant] shall be entitled to retain the Vessel Deposit paid hereunder</span>.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">3. Execution of Shipbuilding Contract</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">3.1 The parties shall endeavour to execute the relevant Shipbuilding Contract for each Vessel by 6 October 2013 and in any event no later than 16 October 2013.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">3.2 <span class="font-italic">In the event that the Shipbuilding Contracts for the Vessels are not executed by the dates mentioned in clause 3.1 above, then this Agreement shall terminate immediately, the Vessel Deposit will be forfeited as provided for in clause 2.2 only in the event that the </span><span class="font-italic">non execution is attributable to GP.</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">140 The italicised portions of the two clauses show that the Rig Purchase Agreement expressly provided for the US$2m to be applied towards the first instalment payment payable under the Shipbuilding Contract. Nothing in the Rig Purchase Agreement stated that the US$2m would be forfeited upon breach of the <span class="font-italic">Rig Purchase</span> <span class="font-italic">Agreement</span> by the first plaintiff – which is what should have been stipulated if indeed the monies “served as an earnest for the [first plaintiff’s] performance of the Rig Purchase Agreement” as the defendants claimed (see in this respect the judicial definition of “earnest money” per the High Court in <span class="font-italic">Triangle Auto Pte Ltd v Zheng Zi Construction Pte Ltd</span> [2000] 3 SLR(R) 594 at [9]). Instead, whilst clauses 2.2 and 3.2 did make provision for forfeiture of the US$2m, this was in the specific context of the Shipbuilding Contracts not being entered into for a reason attributable to the first plaintiff. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">141 There was also no provision at all in the Rig Purchase Agreement for the first defendant to “reserve the rigs” for the first plaintiff for a specified period. In this connection, I did not find it possible to construe clause 3.1 as imposing such an obligation on the first defendant. Clause 3.1 simply provided for the parties to “endeavour to execute the relevant Shipbuilding Contract for each Vessel by 6 October 2013 and in any event no later than 16 October 2013”. Not only did the use of the term “endeavour” place a far less onerous level of responsibility on the first defendant than a clause requiring “best endeavours” or “all reasonable endeavours” or even “reasonable endeavours” would have done (see <span class="font-italic">KS Energy Services Ltd v BR Energy (M) </span><span class="font-italic">Sdn Bhd</span> [2014] 2 SLR 905

</div> at [46] – [47], [62] – [63] for the CA’s definition of the level of responsibility imposed by these different clauses), there was no mention at all in clause 3.1 of the first defendant being obliged to reserve the rigs for a specified period.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">142 It should be added that aside from the terms of the Rig Purchase Agreement, the bank documentation for the actual transfer of the US$2m also made no mention of the monies being intended for the reservation of the rigs for a specified period. Instead, the bank transfer notice stated that the monies were a “deposit on behalf of GP <span class="font-italic">in accordance to agreement to purchase 2 units of Gusto MSC CJ 46 jack-ups</span>” (emphasis added). This may be contrasted with the position in <span class="font-italic">Simpson Marine</span>, where the CA noted that the appellant’s remittance record expressly stated that the funds remitted by the respondent were a “deposit” to reserve the two specified yachts for a specified period (see [68] of <span class="font-italic">Simpson Marine</span>). The terms stated in the remittance record formed one of the “significant” pieces of evidence which the CA relied on to draw the conclusion that the £1m was paid by the respondent as a non-refundable deposit to secure two specified yachts for the stated period.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">143 For the reasons set out in [133] to [142] above, I rejected the defendants’ argument that the US$2m “served as an earnest for the [1st Plaintiff’s] performance of the Rig Purchase Agreement and was paid as a quid pro quo for the 1st Defendants reserving the Rigs for the 1st Plaintiff”. I accepted instead the plaintiffs’ contention that the monies were paid as a pre-contractual deposit – an “anticipatory payment intended only to fulfil the ordinary purpose of a deposit if and when the contemplated agreement should be arrived at” (see <span class="font-italic">United Artists</span> at [82]). This being the case, it was clear that the basis for the payment failed when the Shipbuilding Contracts were not entered into; and that such failure having occurred, the monies ought to be restituted to the plaintiffs.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Summary of decision</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">144 For the reasons given above, I allowed the plaintiffs’ claim and ordered the sum of US$2m to be refunded with interest to run at 5.33% per annum from the date of the writ. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">On the issue of costs</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">145 Insofar as judgement was obtained by the plaintiffs on their claim under the Rig Purchase Agreement and their alternative claim in total failure of consideration, these were causes of action which did not involve the second defendant. The second defendant was the focus of the unsuccessful claim relating to the purported collateral contract, it having been the entity involved in the interactions and negotiations between the parties post 31 December 2013. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">146 In accordance therefore with the general principle that costs should follow the event, I held that insofar as the plaintiffs had successfully obtained judgement against the first defendant for the sum of USS$2m with interest, they should be entitled to their costs from the first defendant of successfully obtaining such judgement. It was common ground between the parties that the plaintiffs had on 8 November 2017 served on the defendants an offer to settle; and that the first defendant having rejected the said offer to settle, the plaintiffs were entitled to their costs against it on a standard basis up to the date of service of the offer (8 November 2017) and on an indemnity basis from that date. It was also common ground between the parties that costs on an indemnity basis should generally be subject to a one-third uplift. It was also not seriously disputed that the bulk of the action in this case (or the “heavy lifting”, as it were) took place after the exchange of parties’ lists of documents in October 2017, and thus after the service of the offer to settle on 8 November 2017 – such that the bulk of the plaintiffs’ costs vis-à-vis the first defendant should be on the indemnity basis.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">147 Insofar as the second defendant had successfully defended the claim against it based on purported collateral contract, I held that it should be entitled to its costs of defending such claim from the plaintiffs. The defendants’ counsel conceded that more time had been spent by counsel on the first defendant’s case, and indicated that he was agreeable to a 70:30 split between the first and the second defendants in terms of the amount of work done and thus the quantum of legal costs incurred.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">148 As the present appeal is brought by the defendants, I will not address the arguments made on whether the plaintiffs were entitled to a <span class="font-italic">Bullock</span> or <span class="font-italic">Sanderson</span> order, since my decision on this issue (that the plaintiffs were not so entitled) was in the defendants’ favour. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">149 In respect of the quantum of costs to be awarded to the plaintiffs on the one hand and the 2nd defendant on the other, counsel’s submissions were unfortunately very far apart. The defendants’ counsel submitted that the 2nd defendant should be awarded $150,000 in costs for successfully defending the claim in purported collateral contract, and that the plaintiffs should get only $40,000 in costs for obtaining judgement because they had failed on at least half of their pleaded causes of action and deserved to have their costs discounted accordingly. The plaintiffs’ counsel submitted that they should be awarded $200,000 in costs, adding <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span> that they proposed the award of costs for a notional sixth day of trial to address the additional work which had been caused by Capt Seow giving new evidence in cross-examination. As for the 2nd defendant’s costs, the plaintiffs’ counsel submitted that it should get only $14,000 costs because the cause of action it had succeeded in defending related to only “two of the six issues pleaded” in the Statement of Claim.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">150 In respect of the quantum of costs to be awarded to the plaintiffs, I did not think the submissions by the defendants’ counsel for a substantial discount on those costs was reasonable. Whilst the plaintiffs did not succeed on their claims in misrepresentation, collateral contract and acknowledgement of debt, their success on the claims under the Rig Purchase Agreement and for total failure of consideration meant that they got substantively the outcome they had always sought from the outset; namely, the return of the US$2m. On the claim in misrepresentation, the defendants’ counsel conceded that he could not in good conscience say that this claim was plainly unsustainable from the outset. As for the claim in acknowledgement of debt, very little of the parties’ time was spent on this issue both in cross-examination and in closing submissions. In the circumstances, I did not think it fit to apply a substantial discount to the plaintiffs’ costs for obtaining judgement against the first defendant. At the same time, having regard to the nature of the legal and evidential issues covered at trial, I did not view the present case as one where it would have been appropriate to award costs substantially in excess of the daily tariff of $17,000 per trial day denoted in the <span class="font-italic">Appendix G</span> costs guidelines. I also did not see any basis for awarding the plaintiffs costs for a notional sixth day of trial. However, in respect of the fifth (and last) day of trial, I treated this as a full day of trial although the hearing that day ended shortly after 2 pm; and I was also prepared to allow a modest uplift in costs in light of the quantity of documentary evidence involved in this case.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">151 Having regard to the above reasons, I fixed the plaintiffs’ costs against the first defendants at $120,000. Disbursements were agreed between the parties at $104,762.91.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">152 In respect of the quantum of costs to be awarded to the second defendant for successfully defending the claim in collateral contract, whilst I agreed with the plaintiffs’ counsel that some discount was warranted in principle in light of the inevitable overlap between work done for the first defendant and work done for the second defendant, I did not agree that the discount should be as steep as that proposed by the plaintiffs. In addition, as noted earlier, the defendants’ counsel had indicated his willingness to accept a 70:30 split between the first and the second defendants in terms of the amount of work done, which apportionment I found to be a reasonable starting-point. Having regard to the nature of the legal and evidential issues involved in the claim in collateral contract and also to the views I expressed earlier on the tariff costs figures in the <span class="font-italic">Appendix G</span> guidelines, I fixed the second defendant’s costs at $65,000.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">153 In respect of the second defendant’s disbursements, the only item in any real dispute was the item relating to the costs of engaging the defendants’ Mexican law expert. The defendants’ counsel submitted that although they had argued in the main that the law governing the issue of formation of a collateral contract was properly Singapore law (as the <span class="font-italic">lex</span><span class="font-italic"> fori</span>), it was nevertheless reasonable for the second defendant to have engaged a Mexican law expert to address in the alternative the application of Mexican law, because this area of law was a very fraught and uncertain one. I did not agree with this submission. In my view, it should have been clear to both parties from the outset that insofar as the issue of formation of the alleged collateral contract was concerned, the three-stage test articulated in <span class="font-italic">Pacific Recreation</span> could not apply, because <span class="font-italic">Pacific Recreation</span> was a case where the existence of the contract per se was never in dispute – unlike the present case. On the basis of the available authorities, that left either the putative proper law test or the <span class="font-italic">lex</span><span class="font-italic"> fori</span>; and for the reasons explained in [73] above, it was clear to me that if it came to deciding the putative proper law of an alleged collateral contract for the return of the rig deposits paid pursuant to the Rig Purchase Agreement, that putative proper law would in all probability be Singapore law. With respect, I considered that this was a fairly plain conclusion, given that parties had indisputably negotiated the Rig Purchase Agreement and contemplated the execution of the draft Shipbuilding Contract with reference to Singapore law as the governing law. For these reasons, I did not find the item of disbursement relating to the defendants’ Mexican law expert to have been reasonably incurred; and I disallowed this item. The plaintiffs too were not awarded the disbursements relating to their Mexican law expert.  The second defendant’s disbursements were fixed at $16,520.34 (the remaining items being undisputed by the plaintiffs).</div><div class="Judg-Sign text-left">Mavis Chionh Sze Chyi  <br/>Judicial Commissioner </div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Samuel Richard Sharpe and Zheng Shengyang, Harry (Selvam LLC) for the plaintiffs;<br/>Chan Tai-Hui, Jason and Oh Jialing, Evangeline (Allen &amp; Gledhill LLP) for the defendants.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-List text-justify"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
