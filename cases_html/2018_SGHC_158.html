She accepted the offer on 22 November 2001. This course was to last a minimum period of one year and a maximum period of three years. It was a requirement that the Plaintiff complete a 40,000-word thesis in order to graduate from the course. Dr Wong was the Plaintiff’s sole supervisor for her thesis. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">9 On 7 January 2002, the Plaintiff’s candidature for the Degree   commenced. The Plaintiff also entered into a formal Research Scholarship Agreement with NUS dated 7 January 2002. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">10 I will now set out in some detail the events which led to the present action as the Plaintiff relied on the series of events to make many allegations against NUS’ officers including conspiracy and malice. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">11 During the period of supervision, Dr Wong obtained a grant of $80,200 for a project to create a digital visualisation of Commercial Square which is today known as Raffles Place (“the Visualisation Project”). The idea was to create a virtual reconstruction of Commercial Square to make abstract architectural concepts, space and form more comprehensive to laymen. The idea had been discussed with Dr Stephen Wittkopf, HOD Heng and Professor Chan Yew Lih. According to Dr Wong, they intended to tap on his knowledge from one of his projects, Visual Collection, which comprised collection of pictures, plans and drawings of Singapore.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">12 Between 8 March 2004 and 18 January 2005, Dr Wong sent emails to the Plaintiff to inform her about his intention to employ her as a research assistant for six to eight months for the Visualisation Project. For example, in an email from him to her dated 5 August 2004, he said, “Your work will be an important basis for the digital visualisation work – it is the content.”

</div> Professor Chan Yew Lih was not named in the Grant Application Form (“Grant Application Form”).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">14 The Plaintiff completed her thesis on 4 February 2005, one day before an extended deadline for submissions on 5 February 2005. As part of NUS’ administrative requirements, the Plaintiff had to complete and sign Form 57/2000A which was a Supervisor’s Report Form. She referred to this form as a Thesis Submission Form. The form was also to be completed and signed by Dr Wong. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">15 On the same day, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, 4 February 2005, the Plaintiff met with Dr Wong to show him her thesis and to ask him to sign the Thesis Submission Form. The conversation at the meeting turned to the Visualisation Project which the Plaintiff said was based on her work. I set out below the Plaintiff’s version of what transpired, unless otherwise stated.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">16 The Plaintiff alleged that she asked Dr Wong how he was going to acknowledge her work in the Visualisation Project but Dr Wong turned hostile and defensive and accused her of not trusting him. Dr Wong said he had the right to use all the primary sources referenced in her thesis. This caused the Plaintiff concern as she was of the view that although the primary source documents were not created by her, she had assembled and compiled the data therein and interpreted the data. As Dr Wong had said to the Plaintiff that he had acknowledged the Plaintiff’s contribution in the Grant Application Form, the Plaintiff asked Dr Wong to show her the portion of that form which contained that acknowledgment. However, Dr Wong declined to do so. To the Plaintiff, Dr Wong was being evasive and this suggested that he had lied to her about acknowledging her contribution in the Grant Application Form.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">17 Dr Wong told the Plaintiff that in view of her distrust of him, he could no longer consider her for the position of a research assistant.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">18 The meeting ended abruptly with Dr Wong leaving his office on a family errand and returning the Thesis Submission Form to the Plaintiff. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">19 When the Plaintiff learned that Dr Wong had not signed the form, she attempted to contact him. According to Dr Wong, he had left abruptly as he remembered he had to pick up his son at a primary school. He had not realised that he had not signed the Supervisor’s Report Form.

</div> Coming back to the Plaintiff’s version, she and Dr Wong met again later at about 4pm and he signed the form and returned it to her. In view of the lateness of the hour, the Plaintiff could not get the signature of the head of department, HOD Heng, or his stand-in, that day on the form. The stand-in was Deputy HOD Bobby Wong. She did so on the following Monday, 7 February 2005 and submitted her thesis and the form on 7 February 2005, two days late. However, an extension of the deadline was granted to her. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">20 According to Registrar Ang, when the Plaintiff submitted her thesis, she orally requested the RO not to send her thesis for examination yet as she wanted to send a complaint about her supervisor.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">21 The Plaintiff believed that Dr Wong’s omission to sign the form earlier on 4 February 2005 was deliberate and retaliatory. She was unhappy with what had transpired between Dr Wong and her on 4 February 2005.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">22 The Plaintiff said that in the four weeks after submitting her thesis on 7 February 2005, she learned that Dr Wong had not submitted the nomination of examiners for her thesis.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">23 The Plaintiff also said that from 17 February 2005, Ms Cheok, an administrative officer of the department, had repeatedly sought a copy of her thesis (or an abstract of her thesis) from her. The Plaintiff took the position that as she had already submitted three copies of the thesis to the RO on 7 February 2005, she was not obliged to hand over another copy to Ms Cheok. However, Ms Cheok continued to press for a copy. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 The Plaintiff said that the incident on 4 February 2005, Dr Wong’s delay in nominating examiners and Ms Cheok’s persistence in asking her for another copy of her thesis led her to conclude that there was a conflict of interest on Dr Wong’s part between his duty as her supervisor and his personal interest in the Visualisation Project. I add that the question of obtaining another copy of the Plaintiff’s thesis was eventually resolved.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 On 3 March 2005, the Plaintiff wrote to HOD Heng to complain about Dr Wong. She requested that Dr Wong be removed as her supervisor and that an independent committee outside the department be set up to select a new supervisor and that the new supervisor was to nominate the examiners for her thesis.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 The Plaintiff said that she asked for an independent committee to select a new supervisor because HOD Heng and Prof Chan Yew Lih were named as collaborators for the Visualisation Project and she wanted to remove all possibilities of bias.         </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 Eventually HOD Heng informed the Plaintiff on 12 March 2005 that he saw no reason to remove Dr Wong as her supervisor.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 The Plaintiff then wrote to Dean Cheong on 21 March 2005. She met with Dean Cheong and Vice-Dean Chew on 29 March 2005. From the Plaintiff’s point of view, Dean Cheong belittled her concerns about Dr Wong at the meeting.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 In the meantime, the Plaintiff sent an email to Ms How of the RO to formally request the RO not to send her thesis for examination as yet.

</div> She agreed with the issues listed by VP Kong but added other key issues. Essentially, she reiterated what she had said in her email of 3 April 2005. In particular, she repeatedly referred to the incident on 4 February 2005 when Dr Wong had said to her that he had the right to use the primary sources from her work. To her, Dr Wong was saying in essence that he was going to plagiarise the contents of her thesis. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 On 11 May 2005, VP Kong sent an email to the Plaintiff.

</div>
</div> I summarise them below: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) She had made a complaint against Dr Wong in her earlier email of 11 April 2005. The complaint was about Dr Wong’s unprofessionalism as a supervisor based on what he said on 4 February 2005 in that he had the right to use the primary sources that she had researched and assembled in her thesis. She alleged that Dr Wong had already used the contents of her thesis for the Visualisation Project. She noted that VP Kong’s email did not mention anything about the issue of Dr Wong’s unprofessionalism and what VP Kong’s stand was on this issue.    </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The Plaintiff did not agree that the role of a supervisor ended with the submission of the thesis. She gave a few examples: </div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(i) the Thesis Submission Form had to be signed by the supervisor and Dr Wong initially omitted to do this on 4 February 2005;     </div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(ii) the supervisor was to submit the names of the examiners promptly but Dr Wong delayed in doing so; and</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(iii) some paperwork had to be re-dated to avoid a fee of $1,042.65 charged by NUS to the Plaintiff and Dr Wong had refused to assist on this.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Although VP Kong had mentioned the process in which the examiners were selected, this was the process in theory. In reality, a supervisor like Dr Wong would nominate the examiners and the Department Head (or Deputy Head) would merely endorse the supervisor’s nomination. The choice of examiners could make or break a thesis. Also, two of the persons comprising the faculty who were charged with the duty of approving the choice of examiners, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, Dean Cheong and Vice-Dean Chew had (in the Plaintiff’s view) demonstrated, based on their conduct during their meeting with her, that they were biased in favour of Dr Wong. As for the Deputy Head (Research), the Plaintiff gave some reasons why she had no confidence in him. She also took the view that he did not know enough about her thesis to be able to form an opinion about the suitability of examiners.  </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) As for VP Kong’s assurance that she would remind the faculty and all relevant individuals to properly acknowledge any substantial reproduction of the Plaintiff’s thesis, the Plaintiff stressed that Dr Wong had “already used [her] work” in his proposal for a grant for the Visualisation Project. She also said that Dr Wong “may have already plagiarised” her thesis in his proposal. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 The Plaintiff ended her email by saying that VP Kong’s proposal was unacceptable because she had no confidence in the thesis examination procedure as long as Dr Wong was involved. She also had reservations about Dean Cheong and Vice-Dean Chew who were biased in his favour. She had made a formal and official complaint about Dr Wong’s unprofessionalism which VP Kong’s last email did not address. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 VP Kong replied on 7 June 2005.

</div> She said that since the Plaintiff had made a formal and official complaint against Dr Wong, NUS would convene an independent panel to investigate the matter. However, the investigation would necessarily result in delay in the examination of her thesis. If VP Kong did not hear from the Plaintiff by the end of 13 June 2005, VP Kong would assume that the Plaintiff understood the delay consequences.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 VP Kong and Registrar Ang met with the Plaintiff on 10 June 2005. According to the Plaintiff, VP Kong asked the Plaintiff to revert by 15 June 2005 on two options, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, either to agree to the proposal mentioned in VP Kong’s email of 11 May 2005 or the investigation mentioned in her email of 7 June 2005 would proceed. The Plaintiff said that she informed VP Kong by email on 13 June 2005 that she would not accept either option.

</div> The COI concluded that:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) there was no evidence that Dr Wong had plagiarised the Plaintiff’s work. Dr Wong’s application for a grant had made sufficient reference to the Plaintiff’s expected contributions (even though the application did not expressly mention the Plaintiff’s name);</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Dr Wong had failed to comply fully with his duties as a supervisor (of the Plaintiff); and </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) the appointments of the two nominated examiners, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, Prof Clancey and Prof Li should be confirmed. VP Kong’s proposed process of examination of the Plaintiff’s thesis was fair and just and should be confirmed.     </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 I note that the Abstract section of the Grant Application Form contained a statement that the Principal Investigator (meaning Dr Wong) was “presently supervising a Masters’ candidate in the historical study of this area; the work is close to a first draft. In Annex A of the Grant Application Form, under Manpower Costs, there was a similar statement, “It is most opportune that one of [Dr Wong’s] supervisees is close to completing her master’s study of the development of this site”. Therefore, even though the Plaintiff’s name was not specifically mentioned in the Grant Application Form, it was clear that Dr Wong was referring to her. As far as that form was concerned, Dr Wong was not trying to claim credit for her work.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 It is also useful to stress here that as the COI had concluded that there was no evidence that Dr Wong had plagiarised the Plaintiff’s work, the COI’s conclusion that Dr Wong had failed to fully comply with his duties as the Plaintiff’s supervisor was based on reasons other than any alleged plagiarism of the Plaintiff’s work. It is not necessary for me to elaborate on those other reasons. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 The COI also recommended that Dr Wong be censured for the manner in which he had supervised the Plaintiff and that appropriate steps be taken to ensure that Dr Wong is fully aware of the role and duties of a supervisor to his student. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 The Plaintiff was not provided with a copy of the COI report at that time.

She did not accept that there was insufficient evidence about Dr Wong’s misconduct as she had previously stressed what Dr Wong had said to her on 4 February 2005. She said that Dr Wong’s minimal and token supervision was not the reason for her complaint but what he had told her on 4 February 2005. She rejected the alternative of having someone else be appointed as a supervisor and the extension of her candidature as she felt she would then be penalised to work another semester because of Dr Wong. She maintained that Dr Wong should be removed as her supervisor and a new supervisor be appointed to help her with the post submission phase and for examiners to be appointed without any influence from Dr Wong. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 VP Kong replied to the Plaintiff on 18 August 2005.

The COI had looked into both issues.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 On the question of insufficient evidence about Dr Wong’s unethical conduct, the COI had concluded that the reference in the application for a research grant to the work of a Master’s candidate was sufficient acknowledgement of her thesis.

Yet, the Plaintiff said that she re-sent the 27 November 2005 email to VP Kong on 31 December 2005, notwithstanding that she must have known by then about the successful outcome of the examination. She said she did so because she had not received any response from VP Kong to her 27 November 2005 email. VP Kong then replied on 31 December 2005 to say that NUS’ position had been explained to the Plaintiff and due process had been observed. VP Kong said she would not be responding further to the Plaintiff. The progress on the examination of the Plaintiff’s thesis had been communicated to the Plaintiff.

In the light of her issues with Dr Wong, she was afraid that if she signed Form RO.85, Dr Wong could gain easy access to and use her thesis for the Visualisation Project without giving her proper acknowledgement.

The Plaintiff did not allege negligence on the part of NUS or on the part of the officers of NUS up to the date of the 4 September 2006 letter from Ms Lau. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">97 By the time the Plaintiff wrote to these two presidents, she was no longer a student of NUS. This raised an issue of law as to whether NUS even owed her a duty of care at that time. This issue was not addressed in the PCS.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">98 Secondly, aside from the question about the existence of a legal duty of care at the material time, the Plaintiff’s allegations of negligence were vague. Her particulars of negligence simply alleged that NUS had failed to give reasonable consideration to her complaints and/or provided an unreasonable response. The PCS did no better. It made a very brief submission (at paras 136–138) about NUS’ breach of duty and focussed on the harm caused to the Plaintiff. It omitted to elaborate on any specific conduct which might constitute negligence and a breach of duty.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">99 NUS had already communicated extensively with the Plaintiff before her candidature was terminated as I set out above. Whether NUS was right or wrong then, the point is that her subsequent appeals to President Shih and President TCC did not raise anything new.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">100 Furthermore, neither President Shih nor President TCC could be expected to personally investigate her complaints. The position which they held allowed them to delegate someone else of sufficient responsibility to respond to her. Indeed the Plaintiff did not suggest that either of them was not entitled to ask Registrar Ang to respond to her. Neither did she suggest that Registrar Ang was too junior to respond.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">101 The DCS set out the work done by Registrar Ang in response to the Plaintiff’s appeals. In any event, as mentioned above, there was no real evidence of negligence.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">102  In the circumstances, the Plaintiff’s cause of action based on negligence fails.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">103 I should mention one other point regarding President TCC which the Plaintiff raised. The Plaintiff said that she learned from the process of discovery, that President TCC was Provost at the time of her communication with VP Kong and that VP Kong had also been communicating with him on the Plaintiff’s complaints. The Plaintiff accused Provost TCC of being personally complicit in any alleged wrongdoing of VP Kong.

</div> which she repeated for her claim for the tort of intimidation without attempting to identify specifically which of the allegations referred to a threat by NUS which she purportedly complied with to her detriment. For example, none of the following allegations of hers could refer to a threat by NUS to her to cause her to do something to her detriment: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) whether Dr Wong did or did not nominate examiners expeditiously;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) a refusal to change her supervisor;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) the appointment of the COI.     </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">113 In the PCS (at paras 133–134), she relied only on the fact that she had submitted a soft copy of her thesis to the RO to argue that she had been compelled to do so and that this was to her clear detriment as she ran the risk of her thesis being made available to Dr Wong. However, this was not the subject of any damage which she was claiming. The losses she claimed arose from her refusal to comply with the outstanding requirements of NUS and the consequent withholding of the Degree from her. It was not her pleaded claim that as a result of the submission of a soft copy of the thesis, Dr Wong had in fact (a) obtained access to it and (b) misused her work in the sense of using her work without proper acknowledgement and (c) damage arose from that misuse. Furthermore, there was no evidence that after she had submitted a soft copy of the thesis, Dr Wong in fact accessed her thesis and misused her work in the sense mentioned above.    </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">114 The Plaintiff’s reliance on the submission of a soft copy of her thesis to support her claim for the tort of intimidation was a last ditch unsuccessful attempt to salvage this cause of action. Therefore, the Plaintiff’s cause of action based on the tort of intimidation fails.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The tort of misfeasance in public office</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">115 In <span class="font-italic">Lines International Holding (S) Pte Ltd v Singapore Tourist</span> <span class="font-italic">Promotion Board and another</span> [1997] 1 SLR(R) 52 at [138], the High Court cited <span class="font-italic">Judicial Remedies in Public Law</span> by Clive Lewis (at Ch 14, pp 59-64) for the proposition that the essence of the tort of misfeasance in public office is an act done by a public officer or public body where: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) the act is done maliciously or with the knowledge that it is <span class="font-italic">ultra vires</span> the power of the public body;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) it is foreseeable that the act would cause damage to the plaintiffs; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) the act actually does cause damage to the plaintiffs.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">116 In <span class="font-italic">Three Rivers District Council and others v Governor and Company</span> <span class="font-italic">of the </span><span class="font-italic">Bank of England</span> (No 3) [2003] 2 AC 1 (“<span class="font-italic">Three Rivers</span>”) various judgments were issued by the House of Lords on this tort. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">117 Not every judge agreed that foreseeability was an appropriate test. For example, Lord Hobhouse of Woodborough said, at p 231, that, “The use of the words foreseen or foreseeable is to be avoided. They are concepts borrowed from the law of negligence. This tort concerns deliberate acts.”   </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">118 Likewise, Lord Millett said, at p 235, that the tort is an intentional tort. He added, “From this two things follow. First, the tort cannot be committed negligently or inadvertently. Secondly, the core concept is abuse of power. … They are all subjective states of mind.” He went on to say, “It is important to bear in mind that excess of power is not the same as abuse of power.”</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">119 At p 237, Lord Millett said, “In conformity with the character of the tort, the failure to act must be deliberate, not negligent or inadvertent or arising from a misunderstanding of the legal position.” Although this statement was made in the context of an omission rather than a positive step, I am of the view that it applies equally to the latter. Hence, a positive act arising from a misunderstanding of the legal position will also not suffice, regardless of the foreseeability of damage arising from the act.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">120 In the discussion that follows, I will use the expression “deliberate” or “deliberately” to mean either limb of the first requirement, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, where the act is done maliciously or with the knowledge that it is <span class="font-italic">ultra vires</span> the power of NUS.     </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Is NUS a public body for the purpose of the tort of misfeasance of a public office?</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">121 NUS’ position was that NUS is not a public body for the purpose of this tort. However, it was prepared to assume that if the court were to conclude otherwise, then the conduct of the above various persons employed by NUS would be conduct of public officers.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">122 The Plaintiff’s position was that NUS is a public body and the various persons in question who were employed by NUS were public officers.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">123 The Plaintiff relied on <span class="font-italic">Clark v University of Lincolnshire and Humberside</span> [2000] WLR 1988 at [29] where the Court of Appeal said that, “A university is a public body.” However, the Court of Appeal also said that this was not in issue on the appeal before it. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">124 Indeed, in that case, the university was contending that it is a statutory body with public functions and hence the plaintiff student ought to have sought judicial review within a three-month period, rather than commence action for breach of contract with a longer limitation period. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">125 The Plaintiff also relied on this court’s decision in <span class="font-italic">Tey</span><span class="font-italic"> Tsun</span> <span class="font-italic">Hang v </span><span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor</span> [2014] 2 SLR 1189 at [208] where this court held that NUS is a public body for the purpose of the Prevention of Corruption Act (Cap 241, 1993 Rev Ed) (“PCA”). However, it is quite clear that that finding was for the purpose of PCA only and it did not mean that NUS is a public body in all respects and circumstances. The present dispute between the Plaintiff and NUS arises from the contract between them as set out above.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">126 In any event, it is not necessary to reach a conclusion as to whether NUS is a public body and its officers are holding public office for the purpose of the present action as the Plaintiff was not able to establish that NUS had acted deliberately as I will elaborate below. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Did NUS act deliberately against the Plaintiff? </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">127 While the Plaintiff made many allegations about the conduct of various persons along the way, the defining moments are when VP Kong’s Decision was made on or about 18 August 2005 (see [61]–[63] above) to send her thesis for examination and this yielded a positive result for the Plaintiff as I set out above.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">128 It is important to bear in mind that at about the time of VP Kong’s Decision, the Plaintiff was still vigorously objecting to the examination of her thesis because she did not agree with the process in the nomination of the examiners. As at 25 August 2005, she had explicitly objected five times to the examination of her thesis (see [65]). She had taken the view that Dr Wong did in fact play a part in the nomination and that since she was objecting to his playing any role in that process for the reasons she gave, the process should not proceed. In the light of the Plaintiff’s objection, VP Kong would have been entitled to let the matter rest there, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, not to send her thesis for examination until the Plaintiff agreed. That would have resulted in an impasse and the likely result would have been that eventually NUS would have terminated the Plaintiff’s candidature in any event in the absence of a resolution of the impasse. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">129 Nevertheless, VP Kong took it upon herself to make VP Kong’s Decision since the COI was of the view that the appointment of the two nominated examiners, Prof Clancey and Prof Li should be confirmed and her proposed process of examination should be confirmed. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">130 Had the result of the examination been negative for the Plaintiff, it would likely have been fodder for her to complain further as she could have used that result to “vindicate” her complaint about the nomination of the examiners.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">131 However, the result was positive for the Plaintiff. It ought to have demonstrated to the Plaintiff that her reasons for concern about the nomination of the examiners was no longer relevant because even if Dr Wong was involved in the nomination of the examiners, the examiners had passed her thesis, subject to some amendments which she was able to comply with.      </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">132 Thus, VP Kong’s Decision and the successful outcome ought to have laid to rest any lingering suspicion that the Plaintiff had about the <span class="font-italic">bona</span> <span class="font-italic">fides</span> of VP Kong. In other words, if VP Kong was trying to cover up Dr Wong’s alleged misconduct or to target the Plaintiff in some way, she could have simply withheld the examination of the thesis as mentioned above. That is not to say that had VP Kong withheld the examination, this would have necessarily meant that she was acting deliberately. However, the fact that she did not withhold the examination did demonstrate, in my view, that she did not act in the deliberate manner as the Plaintiff was suggesting.   </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">133 As intimated above, when the outcome of the examination was positive for the Plaintiff, that should have resolved the question of her obtaining the Degree. However, it did not for reasons already mentioned. The Plaintiff insisted that the past conduct of various officers, including VP Kong, were connected to the subsequent decision of NUS to require the Plaintiff to meet certain requirements which she ultimately refused to comply with. From her point of view, the <span class="font-italic">mala</span> <span class="font-italic">fides</span> in the past conduct continued and was expressed in the imposition of those requirements. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">134 However, it was not suggested by the Plaintiff that Dr Wong or others in the department or the faculty had any input on the imposition of the subsequent requirements. These requirements were mainly the result of decisions taken by VP Kong and/or the RO partly in reliance on the then existing requirements of NUS.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">135  Therefore, it is not necessary for me to address all the Plaintiff’s complaints about steps taken or not taken by NUS before VP Kong’s Decision. I will mention a few of the Plaintiff’s complaints prior to VP Kong’s Decision to illustrate the Plaintiff’s perception of events before VP Kong’s Decision and to show that, in any event, such complaints fell far short of establishing the deliberate conduct necessary for this tort.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">136 The Plaintiff complained that when VP Kong sent an email to her on 11 May 2005 to say that the appointment of examiners was recommended by the head of department to the faculty which then makes the appointment (see [35] above), VP Kong had not been candid. As mentioned in the Plaintiff’s reply dated 2 June 2005, she was of the view that the process described by VP Kong was the process in theory only. In reality, it would be Dr Wong who would nominate the examiners. The head of department, or in the present case, the deputy head, would merely endorse the supervisor’s nomination (see [36(c)] above). The Plaintiff was of the view that this lack of candour was illustrative of <span class="font-italic">mala</span> <span class="font-italic">fides </span>on the part of VP Kong.   </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">137 I agree that the evidence showed that Dr Wong was the one who initially recommended Prof Li and Prof TTY to be the examiners. When Prof TTY was not able to agree to be an examiner, he in turn recommended Prof Clancey who then agreed to be one of the examiners. Prof Li and Prof Clancey were then eventually approved as the examiners by the department and then the faculty. The evidence also appeared to suggest that the deputy head of the department and the faculty did not make any extra effort to scrutinize the reason why Dr Wong had recommended Prof Li in the first place. For example, they did not check if Prof Li was particularly close to Dr Wong even though they were aware of the Plaintiff’s concern about Dr Wong playing a role in the initial recommendation. There was no need to check on his reason for recommending Prof TTY since Prof TTY could not agree to be one of the examiners in any event. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">138 It also appears that although VP Kong did ascertain that Prof Li and Prof Clancey were not involved in the Visualisation Project, she herself did not make any extra effort to scrutinize how they came to be recommended.  Apparently, she left it to the RO to ascertain from the faculty how the process was executed and the RO appeared to have simply accepted the faculty’s explanation without inquiring if any extra effort had been put in as mentioned in the previous paragraph. For example, Ms How’s email to Registrar Ang dated 4 May 2005 simply stated that the department had nominated Prof Li and Prof Clancey and that the Deputy Head of Department had confirmed that the proposed examiners:

</div>
</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">139 That appeared to be the extent of the scrutiny. While it is arguable whether extra effort should have been put in to ascertain why Dr Wong had initially recommended Prof Li, I am of the view that in any event such an omission did not constitute deliberate conduct.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">140 I also agree that it is arguable that VP Kong should have been more candid with the Plaintiff that Dr Wong was the one who made the initial recommendation of examiners. Instead, VP Kong omitted to address this point in her responses. However, I am also of the view that, in any event, this did not constitute deliberate conduct. VP Kong was merely echoing NUS’ formal position that the head of department would make the recommendation and the dean of the faculty would then decide whether to confirm.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">141 I am of the view that VP Kong honestly assumed, as did all the others involved, that Prof Li and Prof Clancey were persons of integrity. They had also honestly assumed that these persons were nominated purely on merit and not because they were friends of Dr Wong who had been informed that he had an issue with the Plaintiff. While the Plaintiff was concerned that Dr Wong was involved in the nomination of examiners, she stopped short of alleging that: (a) Dr Wong had in fact informed the first two persons that he had recommended, of his issues with the Plaintiff, or (b) that Dr Wong had recommended either of these first two persons because he or she was known to be stricter with the work of candidates, or (c) that either of these first two persons was in fact unqualified to examine her thesis.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">142 In the absence of any such suggestion, the Plaintiff’s concern about Dr Wong’s involvement in the process of the nomination of the examiners fell by the wayside. It was not sufficient for her to simply say that she did not trust Dr Wong. The lack of trust must lead to a concrete allegation as to how his involvement in the process of nomination had in fact prejudiced her but no such concrete allegation was made. Indeed, I reiterate that by the time she learned of the successful outcome of the examination of her thesis, her concern about Dr Wong’s involvement in the process should have been laid to rest. Yet she still persisted in her complaint about his involvement. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">143 Secondly, the Plaintiff complained that the process relating to the appointment and deliberation of the COI was not transparent. For example, she complained that she was not informed of the identities of the members of the COI and the terms of reference and that her Preliminary Questions were not answered. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">144 After the Plaintiff commenced action and NUS had provided discovery of documents, the terms of reference of the COI were disclosed to the Plaintiff. I have set them out at [46] above. In PCS at paras 111–115, the Plaintiff submitted that the terms for the COI to look into the allegation of unprofessionalism against Dr Wong and to establish the validity of the allegation were vague and mild. That was why VP Kong was unwilling to provide the terms of reference to the Plaintiff. According to the Plaintiff, these terms were inappropriate and VP Kong had dishonestly misrepresented the true nature of the Plaintiff’s complaints to the COI in order to deliberately conceal the substance of the complaints.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">145 While it is arguable as to whether the Plaintiff, as the complainant, should have been provided with information about the identity of the members of the COI and the terms of reference, the evidence suggested that it was NUS’ practice not to provide information such as the identity of the members of the COI (see [43] above). In any event, there was no evidence that NUS had in the past provided such information to a complainant but withheld such information from the Plaintiff for an ulterior purpose.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">146 It will be remembered that Ms Lau had replied to the Plaintiff on 4 July 2005 to ask her to raise her Preliminary Questions with the COI (see [50]). Furthermore, Prof Pinsler, the Chairman of the COI, had sent emails to the Plaintiff to urge her to attend an interview with the COI. He also informed her that the COI could respond to her questions at the interview (see [52]). However, the Plaintiff’s position was to insist on an answer first before she attended the interview. Hence she did not attend. Had she attended she would have learned of the identities of all the members of the COI. She could have also asked about the terms of reference of the COI.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">147 In the circumstances, NUS’ omission to give her information about the identity of all the members of the COI and the terms of reference or to answer her questions did not constitute deliberate conduct. Neither did the terms of reference in themselves suggest any deliberate conduct of VP Kong to be vague.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">148 The COI was aware of the Plaintiff’s complaint about plagiarism against Dr Wong even though it was the Plaintiff herself who was inconsistent about this complaint. As mentioned at [40] above, in her email dated 17 June 2005 to VP Kong, she said that she had never said that Dr Wong had plagiarised her thesis. Ms Seah’s email reply of 20 June 2005, on behalf of VP Kong, said that there were contradictions and the Plaintiff then queried why there were contradictions. Paragraph 197 of the DCS has listed out various emails of the Plaintiff where she said Dr Wong “had used”, “has used”, “has already used” or “may have already plagiarised” her thesis. It is not necessary for me to list the emails here. It was quite clear that the Plaintiff did contradict herself when she informed VP Kong that she had never said that Dr Wong had plagiarised her thesis. Indeed, at trial, she admitted that her emails were confusing.

</div>
</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">149 Another one of the Plaintiff’s complaints about misconduct prior to VP Kong’s Decision was in relation to the outcome of the COI’s deliberation. As mentioned above at [58], the Plaintiff was not provided with a copy of the COI report dated 20 July 2005. Instead, VP Kong wrote to the Plaintiff on 3 August 2005 to state certain conclusions of the COI. After the commencement of the present action, the COI report was disclosed in discovery by NUS. The Plaintiff learned that VP Kong did not disclose to her one aspect of the COI report which was the COI’s conclusion that Dr Wong had failed to comply fully with his duties as a supervisor.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">150 In the Plaintiff’s view, this omission was another illustration of VP Kong’s partiality towards Dr Wong and her bias against the Plaintiff. She accused VP Kong of being dishonest in VP Kong’s summary of the COI’s conclusions on 3 August 2005.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">151 VP Kong’s explanation at trial was that the focus then was on continuing with the examination of the Plaintiff’s thesis. Indeed at that time, she also did not follow up with Dr Wong on the COI’s conclusion that he had failed to comply with his duties as a supervisor. She disagreed that she was being partial towards Dr Wong or biased against the Plaintiff. She explained that she did not at that time follow up with Dr Wong on his failure to adequately supervise the Plaintiff because she did not want Dr Wong to take action against the Plaintiff. There was an internal email dated 3 August 2005 from VP Kong to Ms Seah asking Ms Seah to remind VP Kong to send a letter of reprimand to Dr Wong at the end of August when “hopefully the dust with Ms Ten will have settled (!)”.

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> It seems that the Plaintiff regarded the letter as a mere slap on Dr Wong’s wrist.    </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">152 The Plaintiff also alleged that Dr Wong was awarded tenure in or around 2006 and was subsequently promoted to Head of Department in or around 2007. It appeared to me that she was insinuating that these developments reinforced her argument that NUS was partial towards Dr Wong. I do not agree. There was insufficient evidence as to the reasons why Dr Wong was granted tenure or appointed Head of Department and it was not appropriate to jump to conclusions.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">153 I come back to VP Kong’s summary of the COI’s conclusions to the Plaintiff. I agree that VP Kong should not have omitted to mention that the COI had also concluded that Dr Wong had failed to comply fully with his duties as a supervisor. Her summary gave an incomplete picture. The omission was not inadvertent but it was not necessarily deliberate in the sense that it was malicious or done with the knowledge that it was <span class="font-italic">ultra vires</span>.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">154 As I have mentioned, VP Kong’s conduct at that time showed that she was trying to persuade the Plaintiff to agree to proceed with the examination of her thesis. Although the Plaintiff did not agree to proceed with the examination, VP Kong went ahead. The thesis was sent for examination and yielded the positive result mentioned above.      </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">155 Even if VP Kong had informed the Plaintiff that the COI had also concluded that Dr Wong had failed to comply fully with his duties as a supervisor, how would this information have assisted the Plaintiff in her quest to get a new supervisor appointed or a new process to appoint examiners? After all, the COI did not say that a new supervisor had to be appointed or that the two persons eventually nominated to be the examiners should be replaced. On the contrary, the COI concluded that the examiners’ appointments should be confirmed and that VP Kong’s proposed process of examination of the Plaintiff’s thesis should be confirmed. At most, the omission by VP Kong had saved some face for Dr Wong. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">156 Likewise, while the disclosure of that information might have provided the Plaintiff with a limited sense of vindication about Dr Wong’s conduct, it would still not have assisted the Plaintiff in her quest for a new supervisor or a new process to appoint examiners. It might even have been a distraction to her. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">157 Importantly, for all the Plaintiff’s complaint about the omission to disclose as being illustrative of VP Kong’s dishonesty, she did not show how the omission to disclose led to the Plaintiff being refused the Degree. The omission had nothing to do with the requirements which she was supposed to meet to obtain the Degree. Neither was the omission an illustration of VP Kong’s prejudice against her.        </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">158 I add that although Dr Wong mentioned in an email dated 11 November 2005 from him to one Wong Mei Yin (to respond to a certain query about his Visualisation Project) that he had been cleared of all charges,

</div> this was because at that time, VP Kong had not yet written to him to inform him about his failure to comply fully with his duties as a supervisor. Accordingly that statement of Dr Wong did not suggest a lack of integrity by Dr Wong. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">159 In the circumstances, I find that VP Kong was <span class="font-italic">bona fide </span>focused on proceeding with the examination of the Plaintiff’s thesis with the view of moving things along. Her omission to inform the Plaintiff that the COI had concluded that Dr Wong had failed to comply with his duties as a supervisor was a mistake but it was not deliberate. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">160 I now move on to the conduct of VP Kong and the RO after the positive outcome of the examination of the Plaintiff’s thesis.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">161 It will be recalled that when the Plaintiff was informed about the outcome of the examination, she was also informed that she was required to make certain changes or amendments to her thesis (see [66] above).  I will refer to this as “the Amendment requirement”. Although the Plaintiff appeared to have complied with this requirement without too much difficulty, she made a big issue about it in her pleadings and in her AEIC. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">162 In her particulars of misfeasance, the Plaintiff stated (at para 9.2.23 of the SOC) that she had subsequently learned that both the examiners had recommended that the Plaintiff “be awarded the Master’s Degree without further examination”. The Plaintiff understood this phrase to mean that there was no need for her to amend her thesis. Yet VP Kong directed the RO to include the amendments as set out in NUS’ letter dated 25 November 2005.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">163 The Plaintiff also elaborated at paras 191–193 of her AEIC in very strong language why she believed that it was VP Kong who “orchestrated” the Amendment requirement and that it was “contemptible that Registrar Ang would collude with [VP Kong]” to ask the examiners to identify areas of her thesis where the examiners could recommend amendments. The Plaintiff also used words like “dishonesty” and “maliciously” to describe their conduct.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">164 Yet after the trial, the PCS did not mention the Amendment requirement as one of the terms imposed by NUS which were “unreasonable, unequitable and prejudicial towards the Plaintiff’s substantive rights”.

</div> When Ms Lau spoke to the examiners about the amendments to be made, it was to clarify the amendments required and not to instigate the examiners to suggest amendments when none were initially required.

She asked if NUS could give her the Degree if she did not agree to this or sign Form RO.85. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">185 On 11 August 2006, VP Kong wrote to the Plaintiff. I set out the material paragraphs of the letter below:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">You had earlier been informed on 18 August 2005 that your thesis will be sent for examination. You have protested this decision, and continue to do so by insisting that matters raised in your email of 27 November 2005 be addressed. Your email of 27 November 2005, however, does not cover any new ground that has not already been addressed by the Committee of Inquiry or me. This has clearly been communicated to you on a number of occasions.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">While you protested the decision against sending your examination for thesis [<span class="font-italic">sic</span>], you have responded by making amendments to the thesis as requested by the examiners. On the other hand, you do not wish to comply with the requirement that an electronic copy of your thesis be uploaded. It is therefore unclear from your protestations, your amendments to your thesis, and your refusal to comply with the uploading requirement, whether you accept or reject the examination process.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">This will be a final opportunity for you to confirm whether you accept the University’s decisions and will therefore (a) comply with the uploading requirement as well as (b) cease your correspondence regarding the contents of your email of 27 November 2005. If you do accept the University’s decisions, then please confirm this in writing via registered post and complete the uploading of your electronic thesis by 31 August. If you do not accept the University’s decisions by this date, your candidature will be deemed to have ceased. While the scholarship monies that had been paid to you will ordinarily be recoverable by the university, NUS is prepared to waive this out of goodwill and without prejudice to any rights that the University may have.           </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">186 As mentioned above at [75], the Plaintiff alleged that this letter imposed two additional requirements for her to comply.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">187 The first was the Acceptance requirement. The Plaintiff contended that this meant that not only was she required to accept the process of examination which had taken place but she was also required to accept the COI’s decision that there was no evidence that Dr Wong had plagiarised her work.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">188 The second was the Cessation of Correspondence requirement.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">189 While VP Kong’s letter of 11 August 2006 also mentioned the uploading requirement but not the submission of Form RO.85 specifically, the latter had already been mentioned in Ms Lau’s letter of 25 November 2005. I add that it was reiterated several times subsequently by Ms Lau. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">190 Thus, after VP Kong’s letter of 11 August 2006, it appeared that the outstanding requirements which the Plaintiff still had to meet were:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) upload the thesis electronically;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) submit Form RO.85;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) the Acceptance requirement; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d)  the Cessation of Correspondence requirement. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">191 As regards the requirement to upload the thesis electronically and to submit Form RO.85, the Plaintiff’s SOC did not say how the imposition of these two requirements constituted deliberate conduct on the part of NUS.     </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">192 In para 9.2.21 of that pleading, she merely referred to the letter dated 25 November 2005 from Ms Lau informing her of the outcome of the examination of her thesis and the need to make amendments. She did not even refer to the uploading requirement or the need to submit Form RO.85. .  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">193 In para 9.2.25, she then said that she queried Ms Lau on or about 27 June 2006 on the need to submit Form RO.85 without explaining how the requirement of Form RO.85 came to be introduced.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">194 More importantly, these bare allegations were made without any suggestion that it was unreasonable of NUS to impose these requirements. On this ground alone, the Plaintiff would not have been entitled to suggest that either or both these requirements were imposed maliciously or with the knowledge that they were <span class="font-italic">ultra vires</span>. However, I will address the merits of these allegations as elaborated by the Plaintiff outside of her pleadings.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">195  As regards the requirement to upload the thesis electronically, the Plaintiff submitted that there was no need for NUS to impose this requirement since NUS could have itself done it as she had sent a soft copy of her thesis to NUS.

</div>
</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">196 However, even if NUS could have itself uploaded the thesis electronically, that was not the point. There was nothing unreasonable in requiring her to do so as she should have been able to do so easily, if she really wanted to. Furthermore it was not only the uploading that was in question but both the uploading and the submission of Form RO.85. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">197 The Plaintiff never said in her emails to Ms Lau that the requirement to upload electronically was in itself unreasonable. Indeed, the Plaintiff had amended her SOC to delete references to “onerous” and “unreasonable” when referring to the imposition of the requirement to upload electronically. The allegation of unreasonableness was made only in PCS. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">198 As for the submission of Form RO.85, the SOC referred to an indemnity clause in the form but not the rest of the terms in the form. Furthermore, the Plaintiff had also amended her SOC to delete references to “onerous” and “unreasonable” for this clause. It was in her AEIC that the Plaintiff said at para 180 that Form RO.85 included an onerous indemnity clause (under cl 6 of Form RO.85). I will refer to this clause as “the Indemnity clause”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">199 At para 195 of her AEIC, the Plaintiff complained about another provision in Form RO.85, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, cl 2, in which she said she was to grant NUS a licence to publish, reproduce, distribute, display and store the thesis. I will refer to cl 2 as “the IP clause”. She went on to say at para 196 of her AEIC that the terms of Form RO.85 were a cause of concern to her since she had an issue with Dr Wong using her intellectual property without proper acknowledgement. Yet, she did not complain about the IP clause in the SOC.          </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">200 Furthermore, even though she referred to the Indemnity clause and the IP clause in her AEIC, her AEIC did not elaborate how they were so unreasonable that the imposition of the submission of Form RO.85 constituted deliberate conduct on the part of NUS. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">201 It was in PCS that she attempted to elaborate. I will first address her submissions on the Indemnity clause and then the IP clause.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">202 The Indemnity clause in Form RO.85 was worded widely. It required candidates to fully indemnify NUS against all claims and costs arising out of any claim by a third party alleging that any exercise of NUS’ rights under the licence (granted under the IP clause) infringes any intellectual property of the third party. As worded, the clause appeared to require candidates to indemnify NUS for its costs incurred in respect of such a claim by a third party even where the claim was unsuccessful.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">203 The Plaintiff argued that it was unreasonable for NUS to impose such a wide indemnity. However, I note that she did not raise any concern over the Indemnity clause to NUS before her candidature was terminated. At that time, the Indemnity clause was not one of her reasons for refusing to submit Form RO.85. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">204 I agree that the Indemnity clause was too wide but it seemed to me that this was due to inadvertent poor drafting. Had the Plaintiff raised the width of the Indemnity clause with NUS, I am confident that the issue would have been sensibly resolved by NUS assuring her that she would not be liable to indemnify NUS for costs incurred in respect of an unsuccessful claim by a third party. For completeness, I add that Form RO.85 was revised by NUS in 2009 and became Form RO.667/09 which is Exhibit P2 in the trial. The revised indemnity provision was limited to any breach of a candidate’s warranties and covenants. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">205 Hence, the inclusion of the Indemnity clause did not suggest deliberate conduct on the part of NUS when it required the Plaintiff to submit Form RO.85.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">206 As regards the IP clause, the Plaintiff submitted that there was no need for such a provision as under the terms applicable to her admission as a candidate, NUS was already entitled to reproduce and publicly distribute copies of her thesis.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">207 But even if this provision was academic in the Plaintiff’s circumstances, that did not make the IP clause an unreasonable requirement to the extent that it illustrated deliberate conduct on the part of NUS. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">208 In the first place, while the Plaintiff did inquire of Ms Lau about how the IP clause came to be introduced, she did not allege then that it was unreasonable for NUS to include it in Form RO.85. As she herself eventually accepted in her closing submissions, NUS already had the right to reproduce her thesis even without that provision. Although Form RO.85 included the IP clause which was a provision about a licence to NUS to publish or distribute her thesis and this licence was actually unnecessary as NUS already owned the copyright to her thesis, this did not constitute unreasonable conduct by NUS. It appears from NUS’ evidence that the IP clause was included in Form RO.85 because there could be instances where NUS did not already own the copyright to a thesis, for example where the candidate had not entered into a scholarship agreement with NUS.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">209 Therefore, the inclusion of the Indemnity clause and the IP clause in Form RO.85 was not the result of deliberate conduct of NUS. Neither was NUS behaving in a deliberate manner when it insisted that the Plaintiff submit Form RO.85.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">210 There was yet another obstacle facing the Plaintiff on the tort of misfeasance in public office. The requirements to upload electronically and the submission of Form RO.85 were generally applicable to graduate students undergoing examination by thesis. In other words, NUS did not impose these requirements on the Plaintiff only. Therefore, neither the uploading requirement nor Form RO.85 suggested any deliberate conduct on the part of NUS.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">211 When the Plaintiff wrote to President Shih on 29 December 2006 to complain that she had been denied the Degree, she said that she did not see why she should be required to sign Form RO.85 in order to graduate. She also said that she did not agree to put her thesis on the internet.

</div> She did not identify any specific clause in Form RO.85 as being the issue nor any other complaint. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">212 From the evidence, I am of the view that the real reason why the Plaintiff refused to upload her thesis and to submit Form RO.85 was that she was afraid that by doing so, she had waived all her rights over her thesis such that if Dr Wong were to somehow access her thesis, he could make use of it with impunity for the Visualisation Project without acknowledging her work. I am of the view that the Plaintiff had conflated the uploading of her thesis and the submission of Form RO.85 with her fear that Dr Wong could make use of her thesis without acknowledging her work.. Even if the intellectual property over her thesis did not belong to NUS and the Plaintiff was effectively granting a licence to NUS to use her thesis by submitting Form RO.85, this did not mean that Dr Wong could make use of her work without acknowledging it. Furthermore, as suggested by NUS’ counsel during the trial, it would have been more difficult for Dr Wong not to acknowledge her work if she had uploaded her thesis and he made use of it.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">213 Since the uploading requirement and the requirement to submit Form RO.85 did not constitute deliberate conduct on the part of NUS, I turn to the other two requirements, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the Acceptance requirement and the Cessation of Correspondence requirement. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">214 As regards the Acceptance requirement, what did VP Kong’s letter of 11 August 2006 mean when she asked the Plaintiff to confirm acceptance of “the University’s decisions”? Was this phrase confined to the COI’s decision that the examination process, as suggested by VP Kong, should proceed or did it include the COI’s decision that there was no evidence of plagiarism by Dr Wong?</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">215 NUS submitted that the phrase referred only to the COI’s decision on the examination process. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">216 I note that there was no mention of the COI’s decision on plagiarism in the second or third paragraph of VP Kong’s letter of 11 August 2006. The second paragraph had only indicated that it was unclear as to whether the Plaintiff was accepting or rejecting the examination process. The third paragraph then used the phrase “the University’s decisions”. However, the plural and not the singular noun was used.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">217 To support its position, NUS submitted that in Ms Lau’s email dated 31 August 2006 to the Plaintiff, the email did specifically qualify “the University’s decisions” by referring only to the examination process. The relevant part of the email read, “respond to Prof Kong’s letter with a confirmation of your acceptance (in writing) of the University’s decisions <span class="font-italic">with regard to the examination process</span> <span class="font-italic">of your thesis</span>” [emphasis added]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">218 NUS also submitted that VP Kong had approved the draft of this email internally before it was sent. However, I point out that there was also other internal evidence that showed that VP Kong took a different stance subsequently. When VP Kong wrote to Provost TCC on 2 September 2006 to explain the situation, she said that she had indicated to the Plaintiff in a most recent correspondence of early August 2006 that the Plaintiff could not protest against the COI’s findings and conclusion on the plagiarism issue and the examination process and yet simultaneously accept the outcome of the examination but not the clearance of Dr Wong’s name.

</div> This suggested that in VP Kong’s own mind, she intended to refer to both these decisions of the COI and not just the decision on the examination process in her 11 August 2006 letter to the Plaintiff when she asked the Plaintiff to confirm that she accepted “the University’s decisions”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">219 Indeed when the draft of the 4 September 2006 letter was sent to VP Kong for her approval, the draft initially mentioned that NUS had not received the Plaintiff’s response to VP Kong’s letter of 11 August 2006 with a confirmation of her acceptance (in writing) of the University’s decisions regarding her complaints “with regard to the examination process of her thesis”. In other words, the draft contained a similar qualification as found in Ms Lau’s email dated 31 August 2006 to the Plaintiff. However, this time, VP Kong deleted the qualification from the draft. Hence, when the letter dated 4 September 2006 was engrossed and sent by Ms Lau to the Plaintiff to inform her that her candidature had ceased with immediate effect, it referred only to “the University’s decisions regarding your complaints”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">220 I add that more than two years later, Registrar Ang was elaborating to President TCC about the Plaintiff’s complaints in her email dated 12 January 2009 to President TCC. In that email, Registrar Ang said that NUS had emphasized to the Plaintiff that, “if she rejects the COI’s ruling that there was no plagiarism on her [<span class="font-italic">sic</span>] part of her supervisor and rejects their conclusion that the selection of examiners was a fair process, then she cannot accept the positive outcome (passing) of her thesis examination to get her degree … but it is important that the COI conclusion is upheld in toto”.

</div>
</div>
</div> Registrar Ang must have reviewed the earlier emails and concluded that NUS had required the Plaintiff to accept the COI’s decisions both on the examination process and plagiarism.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">221 Interestingly, NUS submitted that the internal emails should be disregarded in ascertaining what was conveyed by NUS to the Plaintiff and the phrase “the University’s decisions” should be construed objectively. Yet it was NUS who attempted to bolster its case by referring to VP Kong’s internal conduct in approving the draft of the 31 August 2006 email, as mentioned at [218] above, before Ms Lau sent it. It was because of this attempt that this court has referred to other internal evidence which shows a different picture.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">222 Assuming that the court should not refer to subjective intention, and hence internal emails, to construe the phrase in question, I return to the objective evidence.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">223 If VP Kong’s letter of 11 August 2006 was considered in isolation, I would have agreed that the phrase “the University’s decisions” referred only to the COI’s decision on the examination process. This appears to be reinforced by Ms Lau’s email of 31 August 2006 to the Plaintiff with the qualification, “with regard to the examination process of your thesis”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">224 However, the factual matrix has to be considered. The factual matrix before the letter of 11 August 2006 showed that the Plaintiff was informed about the COI’s decision on both the examination process and the issue of plagiarism. She remained unhappy about both these decisions.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">225 Also, while Ms Lau’s email of 31 August 2006 did add a qualification to the phrase in question, the last email on 31 August 2006 was the Plaintiff’s email to Ms Lau at 9.38pm where she asked if she had to agree with the way VP Kong had handled her complaint against Dr Wong. It will be remembered that the genesis of her complaint was the plagiarism issue. There was no response to her email. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">226 In the circumstances, I am of the view that the phrase “the University’s decisions” in the letter of 11 August 2006 was ambiguous. Applying the <span class="font-italic">contra</span> <span class="font-italic">proferentem</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>rule, I conclude that it was not confined to the COI’s decision on the examination process but also to the COI’s decision on the plagiarism issue. In other words, the Plaintiff was being required to confirm that she accepted both these decisions failing which her candidature would be terminated. I will refer to the former decision of the COI as the first part of the Acceptance requirement and the latter decision of the COI as the second part of the said requirement. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">227 However, I do not think that VP Kong had deliberately used an unclear phrase in her letter. Indeed this was not suggested by the Plaintiff.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">228 As for the imposition of the first part of the Acceptance requirement, I appreciate why VP Kong wanted the Plaintiff to expressly confirm that she accepted the examination process. It appeared that the Plaintiff was still complaining about that process. However, it was not really necessary to require the express confirmation since it was quite clear from the Plaintiff’s conduct that she had accepted the examination process. After all, she had amended and submitted her amended thesis, as required. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">229 More importantly, it was wrong of VP Kong to impose the first part of the Acceptance requirement <span class="font-italic">as a condition for awarding the Degree</span>. Put in another way, if the Plaintiff had complied with the uploading requirement and submitted Form RO.85, it would have been wrong of NUS not to award her the Degree because she failed to expressly say that she accepted the examination process. However, it does not follow that the imposition of the first part of the Acceptance requirement suggested deliberate conduct. I will come back to this point later when dealing with the Cessation of Correspondence requirement. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">230 In the action, the Plaintiff focussed on the second part of the Acceptance requirement, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, to require the Plaintiff to accept the decision of the COI on the plagiarism issue, as constituting deliberate conduct. VP Kong admitted in cross-examination that it would not be correct for her to impose such a condition but she did not accept that she had in fact imposed such a condition on the Plaintiff.

</div>
</div>
</div> As I have mentioned above, she did impose that condition. I also conclude that it was wrong of her to do so.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">231 It was open to the Plaintiff to disagree with the decision of the COI on the plagiarism issue and yet accept the outcome of the examination process. The two were not as inextricably linked as VP Kong had thought at the material time. However, the fact that VP Kong was also wrong in imposing the second part of the Acceptance requirement does not necessarily mean that she did so deliberately to prevent the Plaintiff from getting the Degree. I will address this point later when dealing with the Cessation of Correspondence requirement.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">232 Unfortunately, NUS’ position on the Cessation of Correspondence requirement was not clear. DCS at paras 307 and 409 gave the impression that NUS was taking the position that the Plaintiff had not even been asked to cease her correspondence with NUS at all. At paras 329 and 338 of the same submissions, however, NUS’ position appeared to be that while the Plaintiff was asked to cease her correspondence, it was not a condition which she had to meet in order to obtain the Degree.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">233 The 11 August 2006 letter had asked the Plaintiff to confirm that she accepted the “University’s decisions and will therefore, (a) comply with the uploading requirement as well as (b) cease your correspondence regarding the contents of your email of 27 November 2005”. In my view, the letter did require the Plaintiff to cease her correspondence with NUS about the contents of her 27 November 2005 email. This was clearly stated in the letter. I am also of the view that the letter suggested that this was a condition she had to accept in order to obtain the Degree. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">234 Since the Plaintiff was not obliged to accept the COI’s decision on the plagiarism issue, she was also not obliged to cease correspondence on the issue. Therefore, I am also of the view that VP Kong was also wrong to impose the Cessation of Correspondence requirement that the Plaintiff had to accept in order to obtain the Degree.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">235 The question is whether the Acceptance requirement and the Cessation of Correspondence requirement suggested deliberate conduct on the part of VP Kong. VP Kong’s conduct has to be considered holistically.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">236 It is true that VP Kong said she felt harassed by the Plaintiff’s numerous emails which were at times lengthy. There was also an internal email dated 29 August 2006 from Deputy Registrar Chan Ng Chye to Ms Lau observing that VP Kong was “really jittery over this case”. The Plaintiff relied on these two points as supporting her case that VP Kong disliked her and was guilty of bias towards the Plaintiff. However, these two points were equivocal.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">237 It is understandable why VP Kong felt harassed. The Plaintiff persisted in complaining about Dr Wong and the examination process even though the outcome of the examination was successful. Likewise it is not surprising that VP Kong felt jittery. From her point of view, she had acted reasonably with a good outcome for the Plaintiff but the Plaintiff was still not satisfied. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">238  I come back to the background leading to VP Kong’s letter of 11 August 2006. After the Plaintiff was informed of the successful outcome of the examination of her thesis, the Plaintiff appeared to accept the successful outcome by proceeding to amend her thesis as suggested by the examiners. Yet, on the other hand, the Plaintiff sent her email of 27 November 2005 to VP Kong repeatedly. That email included her protest that her thesis had been sent for examination. It was no wonder that VP Kong thought that the Plaintiff was behaving inconsistently on this aspect as well. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">239 Furthermore, as mentioned above, the Plaintiff did not initially protest about the uploading requirement or the requirement to submit Form RO.85. In fact, when Ms Lau sent an email dated 7 March 2006 to the Plaintiff to ask whether her submission of Form RO.85 and a copy of her finalised thesis as stated in the letter of 25 November 2005 was on the way to the RO already, the Plaintiff replied on 8 March 2006, “They are on their way.”

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">240 It was only after Ms Lau’s email of 6 April 2006 informing the Plaintiff that her amendments had been accepted and then reminding her about Form RO.85 that the Plaintiff began to raise queries about the uploading requirement and the requirement to submit Form RO.85. As mentioned, this resulted in further emails exchanged between Ms Lau and the Plaintiff.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">241 It was in such circumstances that VP Kong eventually sent the 11 August 2006 letter. This resulted in further emails from the Plaintiff and she did not upload her thesis or submit Form RO.85. Before the letter of 4 September 2006 to terminate the Plaintiff’s candidature was sent, VP Kong explained in her email dated 2 September 2006 to Provost TCC (see [218] above) as to why she believed the Plaintiff could not accept only one decision of the COI on the examination process, but not the other to exonerate Dr Wong on plagiarism. Although VP Kong was wrong to think that the two were inextricably linked, I am of the view that this was a belief she genuinely held. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">242 Likewise, I am also of the view that VP Kong genuinely believed that the Plaintiff ought to stop her correspondence, which was inconsistent with her conduct, as a condition for getting the Degree. It did not make sense to VP Kong that the Plaintiff should receive the Degree and continue with her protestations. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">243 In summary, the Plaintiff was making allegations about Dr Wong’s plagiarism. She believed that there was a cover up by NUS and, in particular, VP Kong. She believed that NUS was acting to retaliate against her and that was why NUS was trying to get her to accept the COI’s exoneration of Dr Wong on the plagiarism issue and to cease correspondence, as well as also putting obstacles in her way of getting the Degree. She maintained her beliefs in the action.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">244 However, the Plaintiff overlooked other facts which pointed to the contrary.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">245 First and foremost, as I have stressed, it was VP Kong who sent her thesis for examination and the outcome was successful. As mentioned at [128] above, had VP Kong not sent the thesis for examination, the likely result would have been that the Plaintiff would not have obtained the Degree anyway. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">246 Secondly, as I have mentioned above at [175] and [176], there was internal email to show that VP Kong was relieved when she learned of the successful outcome of the examination. Her relief was most understandable in the circumstances and contradicted any suggestion of ill-will towards the Plaintiff.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">247 Thirdly, when the outcome of the examination was successful, NUS informed the Plaintiff that she could consult Prof Li for advice on the amendments to her thesis. Form RO.85 would be signed by Prof Li instead of Dr Wong. Where a supervisor’s action was needed, she could seek help from Prof Li. (see [66(e)] above). By doing this, NUS had provided an avenue for the Plaintiff not to have to go back to Dr Wong to complete any outstanding requirement.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">248 Fourthly, the Plaintiff was initially required to make the amendments within one month. When she asked for more time to do so, this was readily acceded to by NUS. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">249 Fifthly, after the amendments were accepted, Ms Lau followed up with the Plaintiff by reminding her to submit Form RO.85. Thereafter the Plaintiff raised various queries and objections which I have mentioned and Ms Lau sought to address them. Indeed, Ms Lau continued to engage with the Plaintiff up until the day of the deadline, 31 August 2006, to urge her to fully comply with whatever was still left undone. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">250 After reviewing the various emails between Ms Lau and the Plaintiff after the 11 August 2006 letter, I find that Ms Lau did try her best to address the Plaintiff’s queries and objections although she was not as precise or clear as the Plaintiff had expected. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">251 Sixthly, the initial letter dated 25 November 2005 from Ms Lau to the Plaintiff did not mention the Acceptance requirement or the Cessation of Correspondence requirement. These two requirements were mentioned only about nine months later in the 11 August 2006 letter from VP Kong because the Plaintiff was still reiterating her complaints about Dr Wong and maintaining her objections to the thesis being sent for examination notwithstanding the successful outcome of the examination. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">252 Seen in the light of the totality of the circumstances, there was clearly no malice or knowledge that they were acting <span class="font-italic">ultra vires</span> on the part of VP Kong or other officers of NUS, although errors were made. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">253 Accordingly, the Plaintiff’s claim on the tort of misfeasance in public office fails.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Breach of contract</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">254 It was not disputed that when the Plaintiff entered into an agreement with NUS for her candidature for the Degree (“the Agreement”), she had to meet all the applicable requirements in order to obtain the Degree. The question is what were the applicable requirements?</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">255 Each side relied on different provisions of the Statutes of the National University of Singapore (“the NUS Statutes”). The NUS Statutes were incorporated by reference into the Agreement through the letter of offer to the Plaintiff dated 15 November 2001. The letter had informed her to familiarise herself with the requirements of her candidature as set out in the “Statutes and Regulations” handbook. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">256 The Plaintiff relied on Statute 9(4) of the NUS Statutes which states:

NUS’ case was that the Plaintiff was to meet both academic and administrative requirements as NUS might impose from time to time. The Plaintiff did not agree that she had to meet such requirements as NUS might impose from time to time. Her case was that NUS had breached the Agreement between them by imposing:

The Court of Appeal said at [73]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">We hasten to add that although the contextual approach is most frequently engaged in the context of interpretation, this is not to say that the contextual approach is irrelevant when it comes to other aspects of construction such as implication or rectification. Indeed, it is trite that the court must have regard to the context at the time of contracting when considering the issue of implication. Therefore, to buttress the evidentiary qualifications to the contextual approach to the construction of a contract, the imposition of four requirements of civil procedure are, in our view, timely and essential:</div><div class="txt-body text-justify">(a) first, parties who contend that the factual matrix is relevant to the construction of the contract must plead with specificity each fact of the factual matrix that they wish to rely on in support of their construction of the contract;</div><div class="txt-body text-justify">(b) second, the factual circumstances in which the facts in (a) were known to both or all the relevant parties must also be pleaded with sufficient particularity;</div><div class="txt-body text-justify">(c) third, parties should in their pleadings specify the effect which such facts will have on their contended construction; and</div><div class="txt-body text-justify">(d) fourth, the obligation of parties to disclose evidence would be limited by the extent to which the evidence are relevant to the facts pleaded in (a) and (b).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">271 I add that at [101], the Court of Appeal set out a three-step process to determine the existence of any alleged implied term. It said:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">101 It follows from these points that the implication of terms is to be considered using a three-step process:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(a) The first step is to ascertain how the gap in the contract arises. Implication will be considered only if the court discerns that the gap arose because the parties did not contemplate the gap.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(b) At the second step, the court considers whether it is necessary in the business or commercial sense to imply a term in order to give the contract efficacy.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(c) Finally, the court considers the specific term to be implied. This must be one which the parties, having regard to the need for business efficacy, would have responded “Oh, of course!” had the proposed term been put to them at time of the contract. If it is not possible to find such a clear response, then, the gap persists and the consequences of that gap ensue.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">272 While NUS denied that its pleading was deficient, by relying on some cases which I need not specify, it did not elaborate how its pleading met the requirements specified in <span class="font-italic">Sembcorp</span><span class="font-italic"> Marine</span>. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">273 Nevertheless, it is important to bear in mind that in <span class="font-italic">Sembcorp</span> <span class="font-italic">Marine</span>, the contract in question was negotiated between commercial parties for a commercial purpose at arm’s length. In the case before me, there was no negotiation between the parties of the terms of the contract. Also, while the Plaintiff was supposed to pay fees for her candidature, subject to any scholarship she obtained from NUS, the parties were not quite the kind of commercial parties envisaged in <span class="font-italic">Sembcorp</span><span class="font-italic"> Marine</span>. The purpose of the contract of the parties before me was more educational than commercial. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">274 That said, the views of the Court of Appeal are still applicable although they should be applied in the context of the circumstances before me. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">275 I am of the view that the pleading of NUS on the implied term could and should have elaborated more on the factual matrix giving rise to the implied term. However, that did not mean that NUS’ pleading was so deficient that NUS was precluded from relying on the implied term. Indeed, in <span class="font-italic">Sembcorp</span> <span class="font-italic">Marine</span>, the Court of Appeal did not say that if the pleading lacked the specificity envisaged, this would necessarily preclude the party raising the implied term from relying on it. Instead, it might be a case of the opponent being entitled to request further and better particulars of the pleading.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">276 Here, the Plaintiff did not request such particulars. I agree with NUS that she was not prejudiced by NUS’ pleading. The factual matrix was not in dispute. The Plaintiff was a candidate for the Degree. NUS is a tertiary institution. NUS’ case was that as such an institution, it must be entitled to impose requirements from time to time which candidates have to meet even if the requirement is imposed after the contract is entered into.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">277 Accordingly, I conclude that NUS is not precluded from relying on an implied term on the ground of deficiency of pleading.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">278 I come back to the three-step process mentioned in <span class="font-italic">Sembcorp</span><span class="font-italic"> Marine</span> to determine the existence of an implied term. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">279 First, was there a gap in the contract between the parties? The Plaintiff submitted that there was no gap. This was because the terms of the letter of offer to her dated 15 November 2001 stipulated clearly that she was to do research under Dr Wong and she was to read and pass some coursework with a minimum average grade as prescribed by the school.

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">280 However, in my view, these were some of the academic requirements. They did not address the issue of administrative requirements. For example, the requirements to upload and to submit Form RO.85 were more in the nature of administrative requirements. I have intimated above that Statute 10(8) of the NUS Statutes does not apply to such requirements. In my view, there was a gap as the Agreement and the NUS Statutes did not address the issue as to whether a student also had to meet administrative requirements that may be imposed from time to time by NUS in order to obtain a degree. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">281 How did the gap arise? As mentioned above, this was not a case of the parties negotiating at arm’s length on the terms of the contract. There was no negotiation. The Plaintiff had to accept the terms of the offer from NUS. NUS had omitted to include an express provision which would require a student to meet administrative requirements as may be imposed by NUS from time to time in order to obtain a degree. There was no evidence as to how this omission came about but a reasonable inference would be that it slipped the mind of the person who was assisting NUS to draft the letter of offer or the Statutes and Regulations handbook of NUS. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">282 The next question is not so much whether it is necessary in the business or commercial sense to imply a term in order to give the Agreement efficacy but whether it is necessary in the operation of a tertiary institution to imply the term contended by NUS in order to give the Agreement efficacy. Furthermore, would the parties have responded, “Oh, of course!” had the proposed term be put to them at the time of the contract.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">283 In my view, it is necessary in the operation of a tertiary institution to imply a term that a student would also have to meet administrative requirements as may be imposed by NUS from time to time before a degree is awarded. This is subject to the qualification that the requirements are reasonable from an objective point of view. For example, for the reasons stated, it was not reasonable of NUS to impose the Acceptance requirement and the Cessation of Correspondence requirement as conditions to be met to obtain the Degree.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">284 No one can foresee all the administrative requirements that may be needed at any one given time. Furthermore, such requirements change from time to time. For example, the requirement for electronic submissions is an attempt to embrace advances in technology and advances in technology may not be anticipated at the time of admission. Aside from that, there may be matters not covered yet, which should be covered, like intellectual property rights. While such rights may go beyond merely administrative matters, it seems to me necessary for a tertiary institution to make provision for them from time to time as terms to be complied with to obtain a degree. As mentioned, this would be subject to the requirement of reasonableness since a tertiary institution should not be permitted to unilaterally impose unreasonable requirements. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">285 The denial of any degree to a candidate who has otherwise met the academic requirements is the denial of a substantive right. It is a step not to be taken lightly.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">286 While NUS’ decision not to award the Plaintiff the Degree for non-compliance of the uploading requirement and the requirement to submit Form RO.85 might appear pedantic, this was not a case where a candidate had inadvertently omitted to comply with an unimportant administrative requirement. The uploading of the thesis and the submission of Form RO.85 were integral steps in the process of electronic submission.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">287 Furthermore, Section 1 of Form RO.85 contained various warranties which NUS was legitimately entitled to expect to obtain from candidates. For example, the candidate warrants:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) that the thesis does not contain copyright material of NUS or a third party (see clause 3(a));</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) that the thesis does not infringe any intellectual property right (see clause 3(b)); or</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) that the candidate is in the process of obtaining all necessary copyright clearances (see clause 3(c)).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">288 Under clause 4 of Form RO.85, the candidate warrants that he is in strict compliance with the NUS Guidelines on Research Integrity.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">289 Under clause 6 of Form RO.85, the candidate warrants that nothing in the thesis is obscene, defamatory or libellous or violates any right of privacy or any other right of any person.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">290 If the Plaintiff had been informed at the time of contract that she would also have to meet administrative requirements as NUS may impose from time to time before the Degree was awarded, provided the requirements were reasonable, I am of the view that she would not have objected. More specifically, if the Plaintiff had been asked at the time of contract if she would upload her thesis electronically and to submit Form RO.85, she would have agreed. She might not have agreed to indemnify NUS for legal costs if the allegation of breach against her by a third party proved unsuccessful eventually but that would have gone to the scope of the indemnity rather than the principle of indemnity. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">291 As mentioned above at [79], the uploading requirement and the requirement to submit Form RO.85 had been imposed in 2003 and a circular to that effect had been sent to all graduate students. The Plaintiff must have received it then and did not object to it. Indeed, NUS’ case was that the Plaintiff had used other forms which were introduced after her candidature had commenced. This was not disputed by the Plaintiff.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">292 I conclude that there was an implied term that the Plaintiff was required to comply also with reasonable administrative requirements that NUS may impose from time to time in order to obtain the Degree. In principle, she had to meet the requirement to upload and to submit Form RO.85. However, the Indemnity clause in Form RO.85 was too wide in scope as I have mentioned. It was too wide as it required the Plaintiff to indemnify NUS for costs arising from any claim by a third party against NUS for infringement of a third party intellectual property right by the Plaintiff even if the claim was unsuccessful. To that limited extent, the Plaintiff was entitled to reject the Indemnity clause if that was her real complaint but it was not. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">293 As discussed above (see [212]), the Plaintiff’s true reason for refusing to submit Form RO.85 was her misplaced fear that her work would be used by Dr Wong without proper acknowledgement. Hence, I find that even if the Indemnity clause was properly scoped, the Plaintiff would not have submitted Form RO.85.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">294 Since the Plaintiff refused to comply with the reasonably imposed requirements to upload her thesis and to submit Form RO.85, she was not entitled to be awarded the Degree. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">295 As for the Cessation of Correspondence requirement and the Acceptance requirement, the Plaintiff was not obliged to comply with such requirements as these were not reasonable requirements. However, the wrongful imposition of these requirements did not affect the validity of the other reasonably imposed requirements. Hence, my finding that the Plaintiff was not entitled to be awarded the Degree is not affected.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">296 Importantly, this was a case of a candidate who was wilfully refusing to comply with the requirements to upload her thesis and to submit Form RO.85. Had it been an inadvertent omission, NUS would have given the Plaintiff time to comply. Indeed NUS had tried for more than a year to accommodate the Plaintiff’s concerns although, from the Plaintiff’s perspective, NUS was not addressing her concerns either at all or adequately. As mentioned, she considered the various persons she encountered as being partial to Dr Wong, covering up for him and retaliating against her.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">297 Accordingly, the Plaintiff’s claim under breach of contract fails.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Other developments</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">298 I would like to add the following. After the trial, I gave directions and timelines for:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) the Plaintiff to file and serve her closing submissions by 29 November 2017 (the timeline was later extended by one week to 6 December 2017;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) NUS to file and serve its closing submissions by 20 December 2017 (the timeline was later extended to 27 December 2017); and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) the Plaintiff to file and serve her closing reply submissions by 8 January 2018. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">299 After the first two steps were completed, the Plaintiff sought an extension of time to file and serve her closing reply submissions by 19 January 2018. NUS left it to the court to determine whether this extension of time should be granted to the Plaintiff, but said that if it was granted, it should be the final extension. I acceded to the Plaintiff’s request. However, the Plaintiff subsequently said that she was not able to meet this extended deadline. Therefore, she sought a second extension to 9 February 2018. This time NUS objected. I acceded to the Plaintiff’s request in principle but granted the extension to 26 January 2018 instead. The Plaintiff was informed that this was to be the final extension. Nevertheless, on 25 January 2018, the Plaintiff made a third request for extension of time to 9 February 2018 which NUS again objected to. This time I rejected her request in toto and she was informed that the deadline of 26 January 2018 stood.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">300 From subsequent correspondence, I gather that the Plaintiff’s lawyers were ready to file and serve her closing reply submissions by 26 January 2018. However, the Plaintiff had instructed them not to do so. Apparently, she was of the view that the intended submissions to be filed were not as detailed as she wanted and she preferred not to file any closing reply submissions rather than to file the ones that her lawyers were ready with. Hence, this last set of closing reply submissions from her were not filed. I understand that her lawyers have obtained an order to discharge themselves from acting for her.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Summary</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">301 In the circumstances, I dismiss the Plaintiff’s claim. I will hear the parties on costs.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Observations</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">302 Although I have some sympathy for the Plaintiff, she has only herself to blame. She allowed her view and distrust of Dr Wong to cloud her judgment in her interaction with those she complained to. I agree with the DCS (at para 17) that she viewed the views of others who did not agree with her with irrational suspicion and distrust and perceived them as signs of wrongdoing and/or conspiracy against her. While quick to criticise others, she could not see her own prejudices and how difficult she appeared to others. Her repetitive complaints about the examination process even after the successful outcome of the examination is perhaps one of the best illustrations of her jaundiced perception. Her inability to differentiate between her complaints about Dr Wong and the requirements she had to comply with has led her to the unfortunate situation she finds herself in. Attempts to resolve or mediate the dispute have failed. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">303 Nevertheless, it is still this court’s hope that the parties will somehow reach a compromise which will see the Plaintiff being awarded the Degree finally.     </div><div class="Judg-Sign text-left">Woo Bih Li <br/>Judge</div><div class="txt-body text-left"></div><div class="Judg-Lawyers
