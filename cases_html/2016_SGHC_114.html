It is entirely possible that profitable companies do not declare dividends for a particular year. It is also trite law that a shareholder has no right to the profits of a company (see <span class="font-italic">Walter Woon on Company Law</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>(Tan Cheng Han SC gen ed) (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, Revised 3rd Ed, 2009) at para 12.87). Having entered into these agreements without legal advice, I infer that the parties must have intended that CTBF and their representatives on the CTBF board would take all steps to realize this profit-sharing intention. Thus, I will take parties’ references to sharing of profits as a reference to payment of dividends. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Whether various terms should implied into the 2008 agreement </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">9 For the implication of a term into a contract, the threshold is a high one and the court can only do what is necessary to give effect to business efficacy, or what is so plain and obvious in its necessity that an officious bystander would have no doubt as to the inclusion of the term into the contract. The enquiry is also a highly fact-specific one as the court is only concerned with the presumed intention of the particular contracting parties (see <span class="font-italic">Forefront Medical Technology (Pte) Ltd v Modern-Pak Pte Ltd</span> [2006] 1 SLR(R) 927 in general).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">10 The Plaintiff pleaded that it was an implied term of the 2008 agreement that Plaintiff and Defendant would act as equal parties and have equal say in the operation of CTBF. This was notwithstanding the fact that the shareholding structure of CTBF was 51-49 in the Defendant’s favour after BFEW had divested itself of its shares in 2009. I am not inclined to believe the Plaintiff’s account, because the 51-49 shareholding structure reflects the parties’ arrangement both in terms of dividends and voting rights, and this was an arrangement entered into consciously by the parties. The Plaintiff’s claim flies in the face of general company law principles. The Plaintiff has also failed to show the necessity of implying this term to ensure that CTBF can continue its operations. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">11 The Plaintiff also pleaded that there was an implied term that the Plaintiff would be able to inspect books and accounts of CTBF, including primary documents such as the ledgers, books, vouchers and invoices.

</div> I agree with the Defendant that the Plaintiff has no such right under the CA by default as it is a mere shareholder of CTBF. It is for the company’s management not its shareholders to operate and manage the company. The general right of access to the company’s “accounting and other records” is thus available to directors, as a corollary of their supervisory role over the company (see s 199(3) of the CA). The shareholders will receive the company’s financial statements and balance sheets (see s 203(3) of the CA) but even then it must be noted that these do not include the items that the Plaintiff was seeking to inspect through implication of a term into the 2008 agreement, <span class="font-italic">i.e</span>., primary documents such as the ledgers, books, vouchers and invoices entitle have.  Again, the Plaintiff has also failed to show the necessity of implying this term into the 2008 agreement to achieve the purpose of the 2008 agreement or to ensure that CTBF’s operations run smoothly, especially when Monsur was already the Plaintiff’s representative on the board of directors and had access to these items. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">12 I thus declined to give the Plaintiff an order for future access to books and accounts of CTBF. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Whether the 2008 agreement for dividing the direct testing fees of $345 per worker subsisted in light of the 2011 agreement</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">13 Direct testing was the practice of testing workers at the OTC without the workers having undergone training at BFEW’s training centre.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">22 I note that the arrangement of the Plaintiff agreeing to forgo its dividends from CTBF appears to make no sense legally in the company law context. However, I am aware that parties were dealing with this commercially without the aid of legal advice. I understand the real arrangement to be that CTBF as the joint venture would cease to receive revenue from testing fees under the new 2011 agreement. These fees would be directly paid to the Defendant’s affiliate, CTTC.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">23 The 2011 agreement has two clauses, and the one in dispute which is the subject of the Plaintiff’s claim is the first clause. I will thus consider the arguments made in relation to that. I am of the view that the 2011 agreement is valid in that regard, and the Plaintiff is bound by what Monsur had signed. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 I reject the Plaintiff’s argument on duress. Substantive requirements aside, this defence was not clearly pleaded by the Plaintiff.  MPH Rubin J observed in the High Court decision of <span class="font-italic">Lee Kuan Yew v Chee Soon Juan</span> [2003] 3 SLR(R) 8 that the defence of duress had to be specifically and carefully pleaded. This was certainly not done by the Plaintiff – the material fact of duress was merely alluded to in one line in its Reply. Phillip Pillai J also rejected a suggested defence of economic duress on the basis that it was not pleaded in <span class="font-italic">Lim Chin San Contractors Pte Ltd v Shiok Kim Seng (trading as IKO Precision Toolings)</span> [2011] 1 SLR 433. However, the lack of specific pleading is not the main ground on which I reject the Plaintiff’s argument on duress. On the evidence presented before me, I am not convinced that the Plaintiff had proved the fact of duress. Economic duress has been acknowledged as a separate and distinct vitiating factor that could render a contract voidable (see <span class="font-italic">E C Investment Holding Pte Ltd v Ridout Residence Pte Ltd</span><span class="font-italic"> and another (Orion Oil Ltd and another, interveners</span>)<span class="font-italic"> </span>[2011] 2 SLR 232 at [46]) but it must also be noted that the doctrine will be applied only in exceptional situations (see Andrew Phang Boon Leong, <span class="font-italic">The Law of Contract in Singapore</span> (Academy Publishing, 2012) at para 12.020). It has to be shown that there was illegitimate pressure applied by one party, and that it was a but-for reason for the person entering into the contract (see <span class="font-italic">Sharon Global Solutions Pte Ltd v LG International (Singapore) Pte Ltd</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>[2001] 2 SLR(R) 233 in general). The burden is on the party raising it to show that the duress put him in a position where he was compelled to accede to the demand. The threshold for using duress as a defence to a contract is high, and fact-specific, and I am not convinced that the Plaintiff had met it. All we have is Monsur’s bare claim in his AEIC that he was threatened. While Monsur said he regretted signing the June 2011 Minute, he only sent the first email of apparent protest in 22 September 2011, three full months after he signed it. Even then, this email of 22 September 2011 did not mention anything regarding the June 2011 Minute nor were there allegations of duress; it only beseeched Ng Chee Hwa of the Defendant to follow the 2008 agreement, and there was no mention of anything in June 2011. The only inference that could be drawn from that was that Monsur had regretted signing the June 2011 Minute. In the subsequent email exchanges between the parties, there was also no mention of Monsur being coerced in June 2011. I accept that the emails evidenced some kind of disagreement between them, but that is not sufficient to show duress. Disagreement among business partners is not uncommon. Even if threats were made, it was not evident that they sufficiently overborne his will and alone caused Monsur to make the agreement. Monsur had not made much reference to the potentially adverse effects of not agreeing, other than there would be financial consequences in Bangladesh. It is unclear if the Plaintiff would be able to have their workers registered with other companies than with the Defendant, <span class="font-italic">i.e.</span>, that the Plaintiff had no alternative but to accede to the Defendant’s demand. The evidence is insufficient to conclude either way. In any case, the Plaintiff appeared to have acquiesced and performed the part of the agreement that required the Plaintiff to pay to the Defendant’s CCTC $600 per worker that passed the test, from the invoices addressed to the Plaintiff, with markings showing “39 x $600” and the description being fees for April 2011 Test.

I accept that Monsur may have regretted entering into the 2011 agreement in face of commercial pressures at the time, and subsequently realized that he struck a poor deal for the Plaintiff, but that alone cannot amount to duress.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 Secondly, I am unconvinced by the Plaintiff’s claim that there was no intent to create legal relations when the 2011 agreement was made. The test is an objective one when it comes to ascertaining intent to create legal relations (see <span class="font-italic">Chia Ee Lin Evelyn v Teh Guek Ngor Engelin née Tan and others</span> [2004] 4 SLR(R) 330 at [43])– the court has to evaluate this claim against available evidence since it is impossible to ascertain Monsur’s subjective state of mind except by circumstantial evidence. In relation to agreements made in a commercial context, there is a presumption in law that the requisite intention to create legal relations is present unless there is clear evidence to the contrary (<span class="font-italic">Gay Choon Ing v Loh Sze Ti Terence Peter and another appeal</span> [2009] 2 SLR(R) 332 at [72]). On the facts, I am of the view that the Plaintiff has failed to rebut this presumption. Monsur clearly understood the consequences, however unfavourable, of signing the June 2011 Minute, as evidenced by his attempts to renege on it from September 2011 onwards. His claim that he did not think the June 2011 Minute would be binding on the Plaintiff was only made in an email to the Defendant in June 2012, a full year after the Minute was signed.  Another piece of evidence that goes against the Plaintiff’s claim is Monsur’s email dated 12 October 2011 to Cedric Ng stating that since he would not enjoy profits from CTBF from April 2011, he wished to resign from the company.

</div> This shows that Monsur clearly regarded the 2011 agreement as binding. It is unclear why Monsur did not eventually resign from the company.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 Thirdly, I am not convinced by the Plaintiff’s argument that there was no consideration offered in relation to the 2011 agreement. In June 2011, the 2008 agreement was clearly not as viable as it seemed in 2008; the quota on testing of workers had been imposed by BCA and I infer that the profitability of this arrangement for both parties must have been greatly reduced. I am not convinced by the Defendant’s argument either that the consideration for the 2011 agreement was that the Plaintiff got $100 per worker for the 868 workers tested by the Defendant from April 2011 to May 2012.

</div> In my opinion, consideration is a legal concept that can be somewhat artificial in the context of businessmen negotiating without legal advice. I am of the view that the 2011 agreement is a variation of the 2008 agreement, and it was made with the 2008 terms in mind. The parties clearly benefited from the 2011 agreement, if not there would be no other reason why they continued to work with each other regarding testing quotas till 2014. Consideration had been given in the sense that the Defendant continued with the arrangement under the 2008 agreement instead of terminating the agreement, which was the Defendant’s right. For reasons which I will explain below, the 2008 agreement was not a perpetual one. Also, the Defendant took over the sourcing of direct testing workers to fulfil its allocated quota for testing at the OTC, from the time of the April 2011 Test.

</div> To me, it is evidence to me that parties would periodically vary the agreement as the circumstances change. It is obvious that their industry is subject to frequently changing regulatory conditions in Singapore and also possibly in Bangladesh. I am thus unable to accept the Plaintiff’s alternate argument that the 2008 agreement was a perpetual one since it had no termination clause. I am of the view that it could not have been the intention of the parties, because it makes no sense from a commercial perspective. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 I also find the Plaintiff’s position on the 2008 and 2012 agreement rather contradictory. The Plaintiff claimed that it had been paid half its share of the direct testing fees until May 2012, which leaves the share from June 2012 onwards unpaid.

</div> Given that the 2012 agreement was made with the 2011 one in mind, for the Plaintiff to accept certain terms and benefits of the 2012 agreement, it would also have to presuppose, to an extent, the validity of the 2011 agreement. It thus makes no sense that the Plaintiff is attacking the validity of the 2011 agreement, when it clearly benefited from and accepted the 2012 agreement which is in effect a variation of the 2011 one. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 Thus, I decline to find that the Defendant is in breach of the 2008 agreement. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Plaintiff’s entitlement to dividends from 2012 onwards</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 The Plaintiff’s claim for its share of direct testing fees for 2012 onwards is presumably on the basis of the dividends that it should have received under the 2008 agreement. Insofar as the dividends were issued for 2009 to 2011, they had been paid to the Plaintiff. CTBF had distributed dividends to the Plaintiff by way of cash cheques addressed directly to Monsur in 2009, 2010 and 2012, as proven by the letters addressed to Monsur and the corresponding cheques.

</div> From 2012 onwards, given my finding that the 2011 agreement stands, the Plaintiff no longer has any entitlement to its share of profits from testing fees. In this aspect I also note that the Plaintiff as shareholder continued to receive CTBF’s annual accounts in 2012 and 2013, and Monsur had signed the 2012 and 2013 reports.

I accept that Monsur may have regretted signing the June 2011 Minute, but such is the nature of the bargain that Monsur had struck for the Plaintiff at that juncture, and the Plaintiff is bound. It is not the role of the court to rescue the Plaintiff from poor commercial decisions. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 Thus, I decline to grant the order sought by the Plaintiff that it is entitled to a 50% share of CTBF’s dividends so long as it remains a shareholder.
