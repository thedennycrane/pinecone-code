<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       This is an appeal by LionCity Construction
                    Company Pte Ltd (“the Defendant”) against a decision by an
                    Assistant Registrar to set aside an adjudication determination in favour of the
                    Defendant under the Building and Construction Industry Security of Payment Act
                    (Cap 30B, 2006 Rev Ed) (“SOPA”). JFC Builders Pte Ltd is the
                    plaintiff (“the Plaintiff”). After hearing arguments, I dismissed
                    the appeal.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Background</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       I gratefully adopt the background as set out by

                    Project”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       Pursuant to a Letter of Offer – Structural
                    Works dated 12 May 2010, the Plaintiff engaged the Defendant to supply
                    material, tools and labour to undertake the structural works for the
                    Project.</p>

                    – Architectural Works dated 26 June 2010, the Plaintiff engaged the
                    Defendant to supply material, tools and labour to undertake the architectural
                    works for the Project.</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       The Plaintiff stressed that the
                    Defendant’s Progress Claim No 8 was for exactly the same work claimed
                    under Progress Claim No 7. The amount claimed under Progress Claim No 8 would
                    have been for the same sum as was claimed under Progress Claim No 7 but for the
                    fact that the Plaintiff had made payment of $125,000 after receiving Progress
                    Claim No 7. Therefore, the Defendant had given credit for this $125,000 in its
                    Progress Claim No 8.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       As can be seen from the above chronology, the
                    Plaintiff did not issue a payment response to Progress Claim No 8. Neither did
                    it participate in the adjudication process which arose from the Adjudication
                    Application of the Defendant. The Adjudicator issued his Adjudication
                    Determination (“the AD”) as set out in the chronology. After this,
                    the Defendant applied and obtained leave of court from a District Court to
                    enforce the AD in the same manner as a judgment or order of court. After the
                    District Court made an order to grant the Defendant such leave and that order
                    was served on the Plaintiff, the Plaintiff then filed the present Originating
                    Summons in the High Court (“OS 547/2012”) seeking, firstly, to set
                    aside the AD and, secondly, to set aside the District Court Order granting leave
                    to the Defendant to enforce the AD as mentioned above.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     OS 547/2012 was heard by an Assistant
                    Registrar (“AR”) on 11 and 18 July 2012 who allowed the
                    Plaintiff’s application and ordered, <em>inter
                        alia</em>, that the AD be set aside.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     On 8 August 2012, the AR issued her
                    Grounds of Decision stating, <em>inter alia</em>,
                    that:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_11-p2_a"></a>(a)     the court can review the validity of
                        a payment claim;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_11-p2_b"></a>(b)     there was insufficient basis to support setting aside the AD on the
                        ground alone that Progress Claim No 8 was a repeat claim;
                    and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_11-p2_c"></a>(c)     the AD was set
                        aside on the basis that Progress Claim No 8 had been served out of
                        time.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     The AR declined to hear any argument in
                    respect of the prayer to set aside the District Court Order which granted the
                    Defendant leave to enforce the AD. She made no order on that prayer save that
                    leave was granted to the Plaintiff to bring an application to set aside the
                    District Court Order.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     On 31 July 2012, the Defendant filed the
                    present appeal (Registrar’s Appeal No 316 of 2012) against the AR’s
                    decision.</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     As can be seen from the facts enunciated
                    above, the Plaintiff filed OS 547/2012 in the High Court even though the
                    order granting leave to the Defendant to enforce the AD was made by the District
                    Court.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     Counsel for the Plaintiff explained that in a
                    previous similar case, a District Judge had decided that the District Court has
                    no jurisdiction to set aside an AD because the review or consideration of such a
                    determination is an exercise of supervisory power which the District Court does
                    not have. After an appeal was filed to the High Court against that decision, the
                    High Court agreed with the decision of the District Judge. Accordingly, in the
                    present case, counsel for the Plaintiff filed its application in the High Court
                    to set aside both the AD and the District Court Order granting leave to enforce
                    the AD.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     However, the AR apparently was of the view
                    that since the order granting leave to enforce the AD was made by the District
                    Court, then the District Court was the appropriate court to set aside such an
                    order.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     The Plaintiff’s counsel said it was not
                    clear in the first place whether the District Court has jurisdiction to grant
                    leave to enforce the AD although he was of the view that it does have such a
                    jurisdiction. Section 27(1) of SOPA which stipulates that an AD “may,
                    with leave of the court, be enforced in the same manner as a judgment or an
                    order of the court to the same effect” does not specify from which court
                    the leave should be sought. Accordingly, it does not stipulate that leave to
                    enforce must be sought from the High Court. Secondly, the granting of leave to
                    enforce an AD was not an exercise of supervisory power.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     He also said that O 95 r 2(1) of the
                    Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2006 Rev Ed) (“the Rules”) states
                    that an application for such leave is to be made to the Registrar without
                    qualification and the definition of the “Registrar” refers to the
                    Registrar of the Supreme Court and of the Subordinate Courts (of which the
                    District Court is part).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     As for the prayer to set aside the order
                    granting leave to enforce, it seemed to me that there is no need to apply to set
                    aside the order granting leave to enforce the AD if the AD itself is set aside.
                    The order granting leave to enforce would then cease to be
                effective.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     Nevertheless, it does seem strange that an
                    application for leave to enforce an AD may be made to the District Court but an
                    application to set aside such an AD must be made in the High Court. I am of the
                    view that such a dichotomy will trip many a solicitor as happened in the
                    previous case mentioned by the Plaintiff’s counsel. Indeed, it seemed to
                    me that he was aware of it only because he or his firm acted in the previous
                    case when the client’s application to set aside an AD failed because it
                    was filed in the wrong court.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     I hope that the process can be streamlined,
                    whether by amendment of the Rules or otherwise, so that in future any
                    application for leave to enforce will be made in the High Court.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Issues arising in this appeal</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     The issues to be determined in the appeal
                    were:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_22-p2_i"></a>(i)     whether the court may review the
                        validity of a payment claim;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_22-p2_ii"></a>(ii)     whether it was inequitable for the Plaintiff to
                        challenge the AD or the Plaintiff had waived its right to do so. This was a
                        new issue raised by the Defendant’s counsel, Mr Lam, at the
                        appeal.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_22-p2_iii"></a>(iii)     whether Progress Claim No 8 was an invalid payment claim under SOPA and, if
                        so, its effect;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_22-p2_iv"></a>(iv)     whether Progress Claim No 8 was served out of time; and, if so, its
                        effect;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_22-p2_v"></a>(v)     whether
                        the adjudication application was invalid as a result of the Defendant
                        failing to serve a Notice of Intention to Apply for Adjudication in
                        accordance with the provisions of SOPA. This was a new issue raised by the
                        Plaintiff’s counsel, Mr Chan, at the appeal.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Issue 1- Whether the court may review the validity of a payment
                claim</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     SOPA does not expressly state that a court may
                    set aside an AD but, as Mr Chan submitted, s 27(5) of the SOPA clearly
                    contemplates that a court can do so. Section 27(5) states, “Where
                    any party to an adjudication commences proceedings to set aside the adjudication
                    determination or the judgment obtained pursuant to this section, ...”.
                    The court’s power to set aside an AD is acknowledged by O 95 of the
                    Rules which sets out specific provisions on the manner in which a party may
                    apply to set aside an AD. The Defendant did not dispute the court’s power
                    to set aside an AD.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     SOPA does not elaborate on the matters which a
                    court may consider in deciding whether to set aside an AD.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     After considering differing High Court
                    decisions on the scope of review available under s 27(5) of the SOPA, I
                    concluded that the court may review the validity of a payment
                claim.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     There is no need for me to discuss here the
                    various High Court decisions as the Court of Appeal recently delivered its
                    written judgment in <em>Lee Wee Lick </em><em>Terence</em> (<em>Li Weili Terence</em>)
                    v <em>Chua Say Eng</em> (<em>formerly
                        trading as </em><em>Weng </em><em>Fatt </em><em>Construction Engineering</em>)
                    [2012] SGCA 63 (“<em>Lee Wee Lick</em>”)
                    after I had given my oral decision. I will refer to that judgment as “the
                    CA Judgment”. In the CA Judgment, the Court of Appeal reviewed various
                    High Court authorities and drew a distinction between two situations. The first
                    is whether there is in existence a payment claim. The second is whether a
                    payment claim complies with the requirements of SOPA. The first goes to the
                    validity of the appointment of an adjudicator. The second goes to the validity
                    of an AD. They can lead to the same outcome, <em>ie</em>,
                    the setting aside of an adjudication award, but it would be for entirely
                    different reasons (see [28], [31] and [37] of the CA Judgment).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     The Court of Appeal also reviewed various
                    Australian cases and were of the view that the characterisation in <em>Brodyn Pty Ltd v Davenport</em> [2004] NSWCA 394
                        (“<em>Brodyn</em>”) of a condition, the
                    breach of which would invalidate an adjudication, as “essential”
                    is substantially the same as the characterisation in <em>Chase
                        Oyster </em><em>Bar Pty Limited v Hamo Industries Pty
                        Ltd</em> [2010] NSWCA 190 (“<em>Chase
                        Oyster</em>”) of such a condition as “mandatory”
                    (see [61] of the CA Judgment).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     The question is whether the non-compliance or
                    the breach is of a provision which is so important that it is the legislative
                    purpose that the non-compliance or breach results in invalidity (see [67] of the
                    CA Judgment).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     Accordingly, the court may review the validity
                    of a payment claim subject to the second issue which I now come
                to.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Issue 2 – Whether it was inequitable for the Plaintiff to
                challenge the AD or the Plaintiff had waived its right to do so</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     Mr Lam relied on <em>Brookhollow Pty Ltd v R&amp;R Consultants Pty Ltd</em> [2006] NSWSC 1
                        (“<em>Brookhollow</em>”) for the
                    proposition that a challenge to a payment claim, like a challenge to the service
                    thereof, must be raised in a timeously served payment response. As the Plaintiff
                    did not send a payment response or participate in the adjudication proceedings,
                    he submitted that it was inequitable for the Plaintiff to challenge the validity
                    of Progress Claim No 8. I add that s 15(3)(a) SOPA states:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>15</b>.—(3)  The respondent
                        shall not include in the adjudication response, and the adjudicator shall
                        not consider, any reason for withholding any amount, including but not
                        limited to any cross-claim, counterclaim and set-off,
                        unless —</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(<em>a</em>)    where the
                            adjudication relates to a construction contract, the reason was included
                            in the relevant payment response provided by the respondent to the
                            claimant;</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Therefore, in the context of a construction contract which the
                    parties proceeded under, there is a consequence if a respondent does not serve a
                    payment response.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     
          <em>Brookhollow</em> was
                    a case dealing with the New South Wales Building and Construction Industry
                    Security of Payment Act 1999 (which was amended in 2002 as I shall elaborate
                    below). Section 20(2A) of their legislation is the equivalent of
                    s 15(3)(a) SOPA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     
          <em>Brookhollow</em> is
                    authority for the proposition that a respondent must timeously serve a payment
                    schedule (which is the equivalent of a payment response under SOPA) to state its
                    reasons for contesting a payment claim. If it does not, then it is precluded
                    from raising those reasons to set aside or restrain enforcement of an
                AD.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     Recently, in <em>RN &amp;
                        Associates Pte Ltd v TPX Builders Pte Ltd</em> [2012] SGHC 225,
                    Justice Andrew Ang (“Ang J”) delivered a written judgment whereby
                    he concluded that a respondent who served a payment response but did not raise a
                    certain objection in its payment response was estopped from raising it before
                    the court.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     Ang J was also of the view that the validity
                    of a payment claim is a mixed question of law and fact within an
                    adjudicator’s jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     I should mention that Ang J’s written
                    judgment was also delivered after I had given my oral decision in the present
                    case. My view was that if a payment claim was given in breach of SOPA, that
                    would undermine the jurisdiction of the adjudicator to give the AD. Accordingly,
                    neither s 15(3) SOPA nor estoppel would preclude the Plaintiff from
                    challenging the validity of the payment claim.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     As mentioned above at [26], the CA Judgment
                    has drawn a distinction between two different situations which I need not
                    repeat. As regards the second situation, where, for example, the validity of an
                    AD is in issue because of the validity of a payment claim, the CA Judgment
                    suggests that the Plaintiff would still not have been precluded from challenging
                    the validity of a payment claim notwithstanding the absence of a payment
                    response from the Plaintiff.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     In <em>Lee Wee Lick</em>,
                    the respondent also did not serve a payment response and also did not file an
                    adjudication response although, apparently, it did participate in the
                    adjudication conference. Yet the Court of Appeal did not conclude that the
                    respondent there was precluded from raising reasons to challenge the validity of
                    an AD.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     For completeness, I would mention that in
                    another case which I recently heard, a claimant relied on the last sentence of
                    [65] of the CA Judgment to contend that failure to serve a payment response
                    precluded a respondent from raising any ground to challenge an AD. That sentence
                    states: “... If the respondent’s objection is that there is no
                    valid payment claim, this should be raised as soon as possible in the payment
                    response so as not to delay the adjudication process.”</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     As can be seen, that sentence does not go so
                    far as that claimant’s contention. All that sentence said was that a
                    respondent’s objection “should” be raised as soon as
                    possible. I agree that a respondent’s objection should be raised as soon
                    as possible. However, that is a far cry from saying that absence of a payment
                    response precludes a respondent from challenging an AD on any
                ground.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     Furthermore, the CA Judgment confines the role
                    of an adjudicator to certain functions which do not include the review of the
                    validity of a payment claim and suggests that the validity of a payment claim is
                    to be determined by the court (see [64]-[65] of the CA Judgment).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     This arguably also suggests that failure to
                    serve a payment response does not preclude a respondent from relying on an
                    alleged invalidity of a payment claim in a setting aside application made to the
                    court.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     I come now to Mr Lam’s other argument
                    that the validity of the payment claim could be waived and was waived by the
                    Plaintiff because (a) the Plaintiff had paid $110,000.00 being a partial payment
                    of the amount awarded under the AD and, in so doing, had waived its right to
                    challenge the validity of the payment claim and (b) any error by the adjudicator
                    about the validity of the payment claim was a mere irregularity which could be
                    waived, relying on the judgment of Prakash J in <em>Chip Hup
                        </em><em>Hup </em><em>Kee
                        </em><em>Construction Pte Ltd v Ssangyong Engineering
                        &amp; Construction Co Ltd</em> [2010] 1 SLR 658 (“CHHK”)
                    at [43] and [44].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     I was of the view that if the payment claim
                    was in breach of s 10(1) SOPA, as alleged by the Plaintiff, that was not an
                    irregularity which could be waived.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     In any event, the Plaintiff said that it had
                    made the alleged payment pursuant to a settlement agreement it had reached with
                    the Defendant after the AD was made and not pursuant to the AD whereas the
                    Defendant denied any settlement and alleged that the payment was made pursuant
                    to the AD. The evidence at present was insufficient to establish whether the
                    payment was made pursuant to the AD or not. Accordingly, on the available facts
                    so far, I did not think that the Defendant had established this
                    contention.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Issue 3 - Whether Progress Claim No 8 was an invalid payment claim
                under SOPA and, if so, its effect</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     As I mentioned above, the AR was of the view
                    that there was insufficient basis to support the setting aside of the AD on the
                    ground that Progress Claim No 8 was a repeat identical claim. Her reason was
                    that in order to do so, “I would first have to consider as a matter of
                    law whether a sum could be included in a fresh payment claim where no further
                    works had been carried out after service of the original claim but the said sum
                    had not been paid. I would also have to consider as a matter of fact what the
                    nature of the works originally claimed and what the nature of the works claimed
                    in the allegedly repeat claim were. This could entail a laborious process of
                    looking at the breakdown of the claim and going into an understanding of how
                    each item was incurred.”</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     I gather that the second reason, <em>ie</em>, the factual reason was the main reason why the AR
                    was of the view that there was insufficient basis to decide whether Progress
                    Claim No 8 was in fact a repeat claim in the first place.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     However, the facts before me were clear and
                    undisputed. Mr Lam did not suggest that Progress Claim No 8 was not a repeat
                    claim of Progress Claim No 7. I stress that my reference to a
                    “repeat” claim is one which merely repeats an earlier claim
                    without any additional item of claim, whether for additional or repair work or
                    otherwise although of course it may and should give credit for any payment
                    received since the earlier claim was made.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     There was no doubt that Progress Claim No 8
                    was a repeat claim. The question was whether it was a valid claim under SOPA.
                    Sections 10(1) and (4) SOPA state:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">

                            named, an amount that was the subject of a previous payment claim served
                            in relation to the same contract which has not been paid by the
                            respondent if, and only if, the first-mentioned payment claim is served
                            within 6 years after the construction work to which the amount in the
                            second-mentioned payment claim relates was last carried out, or the
                            goods or services to which the amount in the second-mentioned payment
                            claim relates were last supplied, as the case may be.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     Mr Chan submitted that s 10(1) implicitly
                    precluded a claimant from making a repeat claim. As for s 10(4), he
                    submitted that s 10(4) allows an earlier payment claim to be
                    “included” in a subsequent payment claim only if the earlier
                    payment claim is part of a larger subsequent payment claim. In other words,
                    s 10(4) does not allow a claimant to simply repeat an earlier
                claim.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     Mr Lam did not seem to dispute that
                    s 10(1) implicitly precluded a claimant from making a repeat claim.
                    However, he focussed on s 10(4) and submitted that it allows a claimant to
                    make a repeat claim.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     The Adjudicator was of the view that
                    s 10(4) did not prevent the Defendant from including in Progress Claim No 8
                    what had been claimed in Progress Claim No 7 (see [19] and [20] of the AD). He
                    seemed to assume that the word “include” in s 10(4) allows
                    the Defendant to make a repeat claim. In fairness to him, he might not have been
                    aware of the argument about s 10(1) as the Plaintiff did not participate in
                    the proceedings before the Adjudicator.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     SOPA is derived primarily from New South Wales
                    legislation, <em>ie</em>, their Building and Construction
                    Industry Security of Payment Act 1999 as amended in 2002 (“BCISOPA
                    Amended 2002”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     In 2002, New South Wales introduced various
                    provisions including a new section 13(5) and (6):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(5)    A claimant cannot serve more than one payment
                            claim in respect of each reference date under the construction
                            contract.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(6)    However, subsection (5) does not prevent the
                            claimant from including in a payment claim an amount that has been the
                            subject of a previous claim.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     As can be seen, s 13(5) BCISOPA Amended
                    2002 is explicit about prohibiting a claimant from serving more than one payment
                    claim whereas our s 10(1) does not have this express prohibition. The
                    argument before me was that the prohibition was implied. Another
                    “difference” is that the said s 13(5) talks about a payment
                    claim in respect of “each reference date under the construction
                    contract” whereas our s 10(1) talks about one payment claim in
                    respect of “a progress payment”. However, the definition of a
                    “reference date” in s 8(2)(a) BCISOPA Amended 2002 in turn
                    refers to a progress payment as it means “a date determined by ... the
                    terms of the contract as the date on which a claim for a progress payment may be
                    made ...”.</p>

                    BCISOPA Amended 2002. Fryberg J decided that a previous claim cannot be the sole

                    Appeal said, at [13] and [14]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">13    I see no warrant under either the contract or the
                            Act, s 8 for permitting a party in Dualcorp’s position to
                            create fresh reference dates by lodging the same claim for the same
                            completed works in successive payment claims. That is not the intended
                            operation of the last phrase of s 8(2)(b) (“and the last day of
                            each subsequent named month”).</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">14    Here, the work had been done; Dualcorp, the
                            subcontractor, had left the site; it claimed payment by six invoices;
                            six weeks later it repeated that claim by reference to the same invoices
                            and, in my view, in respect of the same reference date. Dualcorp was
                            prevented from serving the second payment claim. The terms of s 13(5)
                            are a prohibition. The words “cannot serve more than one payment
                            claim” are a sufficiently clear statutory indication that a
                            document purporting to be a payment claim that is in respect of the same
                            reference date as a previous claim is not a payment claim under the Act
                            and does not attract the statutory regime of the Act.</p>

                            which apparently was to limit the number of times a claim could be made

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a>61     The judgment of the Court of Appeal was
                    delivered by Fraser JA. He said at [23]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I return to the provision which is critical for the appellant’s
                        argument, s 17(6). In my respectful opinion, the text of s 17(6) is wholly
                        inapt to impose any restriction upon the generally expressed entitlement in
                        s 17(1). When s 17(6) is read in the context of the preceding provisions, as
                        it should be, its effect is merely to ensure that no implication may be
                        drawn that s 17(5) precludes a claimant from making a payment claim for
                        an unpaid amount claimed in a previous claim. Section 17(6) does not provide
                        that a payment claim may not claim only an unpaid amount of a previous
                        payment claim and it should not be given that construction. The prospect
                        that claimants might cause respondents undue expense and inconvenience by
                        using payment claims as rehearsals for a final claim is an insufficient
                        basis for such a construction. That concern should not be exaggerated.
                        Claimants will ordinarily have a powerful interest in putting their best
                        foot forward in the earliest payment claim so as to obtain prompt payment.
                        In any event, even on the appellant’s construction s 17(6)
                        permits repetitive claims if the subsequent payment claim also claims
                        another amount. That requires rejection of the appellant’s argument
                        that there is a general implication in BCIPA against any
                        “re-agitation” of a payment claim in a subsequent payment
                        claim, even where there has been no adjudication determination.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_62"></a>62     As for the observations made by Allsop P in
                        <em>Dualcorp</em>, Fraser JA distinguished <em>Dualcorp</em> from <em>Spankie</em> on
                    the basis that in <em>Dualcorp</em> the earlier claim was
                    the subject of a valid AD.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_63"></a>63     In view of the above authorities, I asked
                    counsel to do further research, <em>inter alia</em>, to see
                    if there was any Parliamentary statement (other than the one cited in <em>Doo Ree</em>) in any of the various jurisdictions including
                    Singapore which would shed more light on the issue. Notwithstanding their
                    diligence, counsel were unable to uncover any such statement although Mr Lam
                    came up with more cases which I will come to later.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_64"></a>64     If one were to apply Fraser JA’s
                    observations about the said s 17(6) to s 10(4) of SOPA, one might
                    think that this would mean that our s 10(4) is also inapt to impose any
                    restriction on repeat claims. While this may be so, I did not agree, for the
                    reasons stated below, that a claimant in Singapore may rely on a repeat claim as
                    the basis of an adjudication application.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_65"></a>65     I did not think that our s 10(1) is a
                    generally expressed entitlement. On the contrary, it stipulates that a claimant
                    may serve “one” payment claim. That restriction applies “in
                    respect of a progress payment”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_66"></a>66     In Queensland, s 17(1) is subject to
                    s 17(5) which restricts one payment claim in relation “to each
                    reference date” so that, in the view of Fraser JA, another payment claim
                    can be made so long as it is in relation to a different reference date even
                    though it is in respect of an identical sum for identical work previously
                    claimed and no more.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_67"></a>67     In my view, s 10(1) does impliedly
                    preclude a claimant from making a repeat claim. Otherwise there would be no
                    purpose in having s 10(1). Furthermore, it is because s 10(1) contains
                    this implied prohibition that s 10(4) starts off by stating “Nothing
                    in subsection (1) shall prevent ...”. If there is no prohibition in
                    s 10(1) in the first place, then the starting words in s 10(4) are
                    unnecessary. Furthermore, Mr Lam did not suggest that s 10(1) imposed a
                    prohibition other than the one contended by Mr Chan. Indeed, as mentioned above,
                    he appeared to accept Mr Chan’s position on s 10(1) but not on
                    s 10(4).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_68"></a>68     It also seemed to me that it is an abuse to
                    allow a claimant to make repeat claims which he will do if, for example, he has
                    missed the deadline under SOPA to serve his earlier payment claim. Indeed, the
                    deadline to do so would also be rendered largely nugatory if he can resurrect a
                    new deadline by merely issuing and serving a repeat claim.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_69"></a>69     I come now to the additional cases which Mr
                    Lam cited to support the Defendant’s position. I need only mention four
                    specifically.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_70"></a>70     In <em>Watpac Constructions v
                        Austin Corp</em> (2010) NSWSC 168, the facts were quite different. The
                    payment claim which was the subject of an AD included a claim for variation work
                    which had been the subject of an earlier AD by another adjudicator. The court
                    decided that such an inclusion did not make the entire payment claim an invalid
                    one.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_71"></a>71     The second case is <em>Olympia
                        Group Pty Ltd v Tyrenian Group Pty Ltd</em> [2010] NSWSC 319. Mr Lam
                    relied on what Hammerschlag J said at [32]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">So far as abuse of process point is concerned, I propose to follow what
                        was said by the Court of Appeal in <em>Falgat Constructions
                            Pty Ltd v Equity Australia Corporation Pty Ltd</em> [2006] NSWCA
                        259. In the judgment of Hodgson JA at par 36 his Honour held that the Act
                        permits successive payment claims to be made for the same work. This
                        disposes of the first plaintiff's submission.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_72"></a>72     The third case is <em>Falgat
                        Constructions Pty Ltd v Equity Australia Corporation Pty Ltd</em>
                    [2006] NSWCA 259 which was cited with approval by Hammerschlag J. In that case,
                    Hodgson JA adhered to what he had said in <em>Brodyn</em>
                    “to the effect that after cessation of work there continue to be
                    reference dates in respect of which successive payment claims can be made
                    ...” and that s 13(6) permits successive payment claims to be for
                    the same work.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_73"></a>73     However, what Hodgson JA said in <em>Brodyn</em> was not in respect of a repeat claim as such.
                    What he said there was that successive payment claims could still be made even
                    though no further work was done because an earlier claim may, for one reason or
                    another, have excluded a claim for work done. Hodgson JA said at [62] to
                    [64]:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">62</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">Brodyn’s submission was that the payment
                            claim served on 28 September 2003 was not a valid payment claim
                            under the Act, because the termination of the contract and cessation of
                            the work under it meant that there was thereafter only one reference
                            date, in respect of which only one final payment claim could be made.
                            This submission was supported by the decision of McDougall J in
                                <em>Holdmark Developers Pty Ltd v G J
                                </em><em>Formwork Pty Ltd</em> [2004]
                            NSWSC 905.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">63</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">However, s 8(2) of the Act does not provide
                            that reference dates cease on termination of a contract or cessation of
                            work. This may be the case under s 8(2)(a) if the contract so
                            provides but not otherwise; while s 8(2)(b) provides a starting
                            reference date but not a concluding one. In my opinion, the only
                            non-contractual limit to the occurrence of reference dates is that which
                            in effect flows from the limits in s 13(4): reference dates cannot
                            support the serving of any payment claims outside these
                        limits.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">64</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">In my opinion, as submitted by Mr Fisher for
                            Dasein, this view is supported by s 13(6), which indicates that
                            successive payment claims do not necessarily have to be in respect of
                            additional work; and especially by s 13(3)(a), which provides for
                            inclusion in payment claims of amounts for which the respondent is
                            liable under s 27(2A). Losses and expenses arising from suspension
                            of work could arise progressively for a substantial time after work has
                            ceased on a project, and s 13(3)(a) expressly contemplates that
                            further payment claims for these losses and expenses may be made
                            progressively.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_74"></a>74     The fourth case is <em>CC No 1
                        v Reed</em> [2010] NSWSC 294. Mr Lam relied on what MacReady AsJ said
                    at [25] to [27]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">25    The critical section to which regard has to be
                            given in any proper construction of the Act is of course s 13 and
                            in particular subsections (5) and (6). As the President said at
                            paragraph 8 of his judgment in <em>Dualcorp</em>
                            the subsections permit the inclusion in another payment claim
                            (necessarily by reference to another reference date) an amount that has
                            been the subject of a previous claim. He then gave a common example.
                            That example of course fits in well with the scheme of the Act as
                            frequently there are variation claims which proceed over a substantial
                            period of time and will have an increasing value as each progress claim
                            by reference to a new reference date is made.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">26    What was emphasised in the defendant's submissions
                            was a common situation that may occur where although the physical work
                            is complete the total cost might not be apparent at the time of
                            submitting a claim. For instance a subcontractors invoice might not be
                            received or some item of cost may be overlooked. Take a common example
                            of a cost plus contract which does not give a right to progress
                            payments. It may well be that after the completion of a separate part of
                            the work and a submission of the claim another item of the cost may come
                            to light. As long as it is included in the next reference date claim so
                            as not to administratively overburden the owner why should the builder
                            not be able to claim? It would not be fair to make him wait for the
                            conclusion of the contract for a chance to exercise his rights under s
                            32 of the Act.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">27    The defendant's construction of the Act seeks to
                            accommodate these additional claims being made in order to allow the
                            contractor to receive the benefit of the cash flow to which he is
                            entitled under the Act notwithstanding that a claim will be for an
                            amount in respect of work, which was physically complete at an earlier
                            time.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_75"></a>75     In my view, those observations did not assist
                    the Defendant. Mr Chan had accepted that the Defendant could present claims of
                    increasing value but not a repeat claim.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_76"></a>76     In the circumstances, I was of the view that a
                    claimant is precluded from making a repeat claim. Section 10(1) is an
                    important part of the scheme under SOPA and it is the legislative purpose that a
                    breach of s 10(1) renders the payment claim invalid. Hence, Progress Claim
                    No 8 was not a valid claim for the purpose of SOPA and the AD, which was based
                    on Progress Claim No 8, was to be set aside.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_77"></a>77     I must, however, refer to the CA Judgment
                    again. That case did not involve a repeat claim. Nevertheless, the judgment
                    said, <em>obiter</em>, at [92]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... In this connection, we should add that we do not approve the finding
                        of the Assistant Registrar in <em>Doo Ree Engineering &amp;
                            Trading Pte Ltd v Taisei Corporation</em> [2009] SGHC 218 that
                        s 10(1) of the Act prohibits all repeat claims (in that case, the
                        repeat claim was a non-adjudicated premature claim).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_78"></a>78     It is not clear to me whether the Court of
                    Appeal was referring to a repeat claim as I have described it at [48] above or
                    not. Moreover, no reasons were given for its view. Accordingly, I will say no
                    more about it for the time being.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Issue 4 - Whether Progress Claim No 8 was served out of time and, if
                so, its effect</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_79"></a>79     In respect of Issue 4, Mr Chan submitted that
                    because Progress Claim No 8 related to work carried out up to 30 November
                    2010, then it ought to have been submitted by 31 December 2010. However, it
                    was only submitted on 24 January 2011 and was therefore served outside the
                    period prescribed by Reg 5(1) of the Building and Construction Industry
                    Security of Payment Regulations (“the SOP
                Regulations”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_80"></a>80     Regulation 5(1) of the SOP Regulations
                    prescribes the time when a payment claim shall be served in the absence of a
                    contractual stipulation. Regulation 5(1) states:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Where a contract does not contain any provision specifying the time at
                        which a payment claim shall be served or by which such time may be
                        determined, then a payment claim made under the contract shall be served by
                        the last day of each month following the month in which the contract is
                        made.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_81"></a>81     It was not disputed that the contracts between
                    the parties do not specify the date on which a payment claim is required to be
                    served. As such, the Defendant was required to serve its payment claim in
                    accordance with Reg 5(1).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_82"></a>82     As can be seen, Reg 5 does not expressly
                    state that a payment claim must include all work done in the period which is the
                    subject of the claim. In <em>Chua Say Eng (formerly trading as
                        Weng Fatt Construction Engineering) v Lee Wee Lick Terence (alias Li Weili
                        Terence)</em> [2011] SGHC 109, the parties appeared to proceed on that
                    basis and so did the court. The question there was different, <em>ie</em>, whether a payment claim for work done in April 2010 had to
                    be served by 30 April 2010 or by 31 May 2010 in the absence of any
                    contractual provision stating otherwise. Tay J decided that it was the latter
                    after referring to comments from a book by Chow Kok Fong and a book and a paper
                    by Dr Philip Chan. Thus, Tay J said, at [49], that “for example, for work
                    done in April, payment must be claimed by 31 May ... if payment for work
                    done in a certain month is not claimed under the SOPA by the last day of the
                    subsequent month, then a claim in respect thereof cannot be made under the SOPA
                    anymore ...”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_83"></a>83     The CA Judgment has decided that Tay J was
                    wrong to conclude that a payment claim for work done in one month must be served
                    by the end of the next month (see [87]-[90] of the CA Judgment) because work
                    done in one month need not be the subject of a payment claim made in the next
                    month.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_84"></a>84     Therefore, it may be that Progress Claim No 8
                    was not served out of time, if the Defendant is not precluded from making a
                    repeat claim.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_85"></a>85     I will not say more on this issue as I have
                    concluded that the Defendant was precluded from making a repeat
                claim.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Issue 5 - Whether the Defendant’s Notice of Intention to Apply
                for Adjudication was invalid and, if so, its effect</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_86"></a>86     As mentioned above, Mr Chan raised Issue 5
                    only at the appeal stage. The relevant provisions are ss 11(1), 12(2)(b),
                    12(5), 13(1) to (3)(a) SOPA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_87"></a>87     Section 11(1)(b) SOPA stipulates that a
                    respondent named in a payment claim is to respond to the payment claim within
                    seven days after the payment claim is served under s 10 where the
                    construction contract does not specify a date to do so. It was not disputed that
                    the contracts in question did not specify a date to do so.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_88"></a>88     Sections 12(2)(b) and 12(5) state:</p>

                            response is required to be provided under section 11 (1).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_89"></a>89     I should mention for completeness that
                    s 12(2) pertains to a construction contract whereas there is another

                    supply contract. However, the parties proceeded on the basis that s 12(2)

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_91"></a>91     As Progress Claim No 8 was submitted on
                    24 January 2011, the Plaintiff had seven days to respond, <em>ie</em>, by 31 January 2011. The dispute settlement
                    period was seven days thereafter. According to Mr Chan, this would expire on
                    9 February 2011 in view of two Chinese New Year holidays and not on
                    8 February 2011 as the Defendant had thought. The difference of one day is
                    immaterial for present purposes. After 9 February 2011, the Defendant had
                    seven days to make its adjudication application, <em>ie</em>, between 10 February to 16 February 2011. Mr Chan
                    submitted that the Defendant had to give its notice of intention to apply for
                    adjudication (“NIAA”) during this period and not before because
                    the Defendant was not entitled to seek adjudication until the period between
                    10 February to 16 February 2011.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_92"></a>92     Mr Chan accepted that the Defendant did give
                    an NIAA to the Plaintiff twice before 10 February 2011.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_93"></a>93     The first NIAA was in the text of Progress
                    Claim No 8. It stated:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Kindly take note that you shall make payment response to us by
                        31 January 2011 in accordance with SOP Act and both parties shall
                        manage to settle the disputes within the next 7 days, that is, by
                        8 February 2011. We respectfully believe that adjudication is a fair
                        and reasonable process to deal with payment disputes, kindly please also
                        take this letter as our notice of intention to apply for

                    when the Defendant wrote to the Plaintiff. The letter recorded that the
                    Plaintiff had failed to make a payment response and reminded the Plaintiff that
                    the dispute settlement period ended on 8 February 2011 (which should be
                    9 February 2011 as mentioned above at [91]). In the letter, the Defendant
                    notified the Plaintiff of its intention to “proceed with adjudication on
                    9 February 2011 should the dispute be not settled and payment be not
                    made”. (see the AD at [24]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_95"></a>95     Mr Chan further submitted at pp 22-23 of his
                    written submissions dated 6 September 2012 as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">78.    While this result
                            [of his contention] is admittedly drastic, we submit that the Australian
                            Courts have taken an equally strict position in applying their
                            equivalent Act. Under the [BCISOPA Amended 2002]:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(i)    a respondent must provide a payment schedule
                                (the equivalent of a payment response) to the claimant either (1)
                                within the time required by the contract; or (2) within 10 business
                                days after the payment claim is served, whichever is earlier.
                                (section14)</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(ii)   If it fails to do so, the claimant then has
                                to notify the respondent of its intention to apply for adjudication.
                                (section 17(2)(a))</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(iii)   The respondent must then be given an
                                opportunity to provide a payment schedule within 5 business days
                                after receiving the claimant’s notice. (section
                                17(2)(b))</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(iv)   If the respondent still does not provide a
                                payment schedule within the 5 day period, then an adjudication
                                application must be made within the following 10 business days.
                                (section 17(3)(e))</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">79.    In the case of <em>Taylor Projects
                                Group Pty Ltd v Brick </em><em>Dept
                                </em><em>Pty Ltd</em> [2005] NSWSC 439
                                [(“<em>Taylor</em>”)]..., the
                            respondent had served its payment schedule one day after the stipulated
                            10 day period, but before the claimant notified the respondent of its
                            intention to apply for adjudication. However, after the claimant had
                            notified the respondent accordingly, the respondent failed to re-serve
                            its payment schedule within the subsequent 5-day period.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[80]. The Court held that although the respondent had
                            physically provided a payment schedule, it was not done within the
                            stipulated 10 day period. Therefore, the “payment
                            schedule” was not a proper payment schedule provided in
                            compliance with the NSW AOP Act. The same “payment
                            schedule” could also not be construed as being served during the
                            subsequent 5 day period, as the requisite notice had not yet been issued
                            by the claimant. As such, the Court held that the payment schedule was
                            not valid.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_96"></a>96     Mr Chan relied on what Einstein J said at [49]
                    and [51] in <em>Taylor:</em></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">49    The point was made in Emag that the whole of the
                            rationale underpinning the procedures laid down by the Act is directed
                            at providing a quick and efficient set of procedures permitting recovery
                            of progress payments and the quick resolution of disputes in that
                            regard; that the time limits under the Act are strict and that the
                            consequences of not complying with stipulated time limits may be
                            significant. In my view it is simply critical for a rigid approach to be
                            taken to compliance with the terms of the Act, particularly for the
                            reason that the legislation provides for a fast dual-track interim
                            determination, reserving the parties' final legal entitlements for
                            subsequent determination. The adjudicator is not shown to have erred in
                            failing to consider the payment schedule provided by Taylor on 20
                            January 2005.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">50    
              <b>...</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">51    Taylor’s submissions as to “technical
                            infringement” and “time-frames and requirements”
                            set up by section 17(2)(b) are rejected. The Act requires to be
                            construed in the orthodox fashion – in accordance with the
                            ordinary meaning of the words used.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_97"></a>97     Mr Chan also relied on <em>Security of Payments and Construction </em><em>Adjudication</em> by Chow Kok Fong, LexisNexis, 2005 Ed at pp 264-265
                    and a flowchart in the Building and Construction Authority’s SOPA 2004
                    Information Kit to support his contention that an NIAA can only be issued after
                    the claimant is entitled to apply for adjudication under
                s 12(2).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_98"></a>98     On the other hand, Mr Lam submitted that SOPA
                    does not expressly state when an NIAA is to be given. Furthermore, there was no
                    prejudice to the Plaintiff when the Defendant gave the NIAA before it was
                    entitled to apply for adjudication.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_99"></a>99     It seemed to me that SOPA envisages that the
                    NIAA will be given after the Defendant is entitled to apply for adjudication,
                        <em>ie</em>, after the expiry of the dispute settlement
                    period. The flowchart from the Information Kit which Mr Chan relied on
                    illustrates this point. The textbook by Chow Kok Fong at pp 264-265 also
                    supports this view. However, neither the flowchart nor the textbook goes so far
                    as to say that an NIAA may only be issued after the Defendant is entitled to
                    apply for adjudication. For example, pp 264-265 of Chow’s textbook merely
                    states:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>Time of Service</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It is interesting that, under the Singapore BCISP Act, no minimum interval
                        is prescribed between the service of the notice on the respondent and the
                        making of the adjudication application by the claimant. It would appear,
                        therefore, that the claimant can make the application the moment the notice
                        has been served. In the case of a payment dispute arising from a
                        construction contract, the notice is likely to be served at the conclusion
                        of the dispute settlement period if no settlement is reached.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_100"></a>100    Furthermore, while it is true that there is
                    an express deadline by which the adjudication application must be made and
                    consequently an NIAA must be given before that deadline, there is no express
                    stipulation that the NIAA may only be issued after the right to apply for
                    adjudication has arisen. The key question was whether such a stipulation should
                    be implied.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_101"></a>101    I did not think that <em>Taylor</em> assisted the Plaintiff much because in that case, the
                    respondent had served its payment schedule late and then omitted to serve it
                    within an additional period. The facts were different from the present
                    case.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_102"></a>102    It seemed to me that there are enough
                    timelines under SOPA for a claimant to watch for. It is one thing to impose the
                    severe consequence of invalidity if he takes a step too late. It is another to
                    impose the same severe consequence if he takes a step too early. On the other
                    hand, I was concerned that if I rejected Mr Chan’s contention, a claimant
                    may decide to give a blanket NIAA right from the very start when he makes his
                    first payment claim so as to avoid having to give an NIAA each time for each
                    progress claim. If a claimant gives a blanket NIAA, a respondent may forget that
                    the claimant intends to proceed with an adjudication application in respect of
                    subsequent claims, in the absence of a favourable response from the respondent.
                    However, s 13(2) appears to address this concern because it requires the
                    NIAA to contain the prescribed particulars which must mean the particulars of a
                    particular claim.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_103"></a>103    It may of course be argued that a claimant
                    who gives an NIAA even before the commencement of the dispute settlement period
                    evinces an intention not to even try to settle any dispute which may arise from
                    his payment claim. I would not agree with such an argument. I do not think that
                    the one necessarily leads to the other.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_104"></a>104    I considered the following:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_104-p2_a"></a>(a)     the absence of any express
                        prohibition against an early NIAA;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_104-p2_b"></a>(b)     the severe consequence which Mr Chan’s contention
                        will attract;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_104-p2_c"></a>(c)     the absence of any prejudice to the Plaintiff; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_104-p2_d"></a>(d)     the absence of any policy argument
                        favouring Mr Chan’s contention. I was of the view that I ought to
                        reject Mr Chan’s contention. In the circumstances, the
                        Defendant’s NIAA was not invalid.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Summary</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_105"></a>105    In the circumstances, I dismissed the
                    Defendant’s appeal with costs which I fixed. I would mention that because
                    the Plaintiff did not raise his objection to Progress Claim No 8 earlier, the AR
                    took this into account when she granted the Plaintiff costs of $200 only for the
                    hearing below. Since the Plaintiff had been penalised for its conduct, I awarded
                    it costs of $7,500 plus reasonable disbursements for the appeal.</p>
