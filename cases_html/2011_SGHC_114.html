<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Background</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       The plaintiff, Rafat Ali Rizvi, was served with
                    a statutory demand issued by the defendant, Ing Bank NV Hong Kong Branch. The
                    plaintiff disputed the validity of the statutory demand and sought to set it
                    aside. However, as he was out of time, he had to apply for an order to extend
                    time as well as order to set aside the statutory demand. When the applications
                    came before an Assistant Registrar (“AR”), both were dismissed and
                    the plaintiff is appealing against those orders.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The plaintiff, a British citizen and a Singapore
                    Employment Pass holder, is the sole shareholder and ultimate beneficial owner of
                    Arlington Assets Investments Ltd (“AAIL”), a company incorporated
                    in the British Virgin Islands (“BVI”). The defendant is the Hong
                    Kong branch of Ing Bank, NV AAIL is a customer of the defendant. The defendant
                    had granted credit facilities to AAIL up to a maximum limit of US$180 million.
                    The plaintiff had executed a continuing personal guarantee in favour of the
                    defendant to secure the facilities.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The statutory demand</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       The defendant issued a statutory demand dated 25
                    May 2009 on the plaintiff under s 62 of the Bankruptcy Act (Cap 20. 2009
                    Rev Ed) (“BA”) for the sums of US$117,143,874, €2,528,234.96,
                    S$16,117,571.11 and ¥1,976,752,632 owing under the facilities granted by the
                    defendant to AAIL (All references to sections refer to the BA.)</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The application for extension of time</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       Under r 97(1)(<em>a</em>) of the Bankruptcy Rules (Cap 20, R1, 2006 Rev Ed)
                    (“BR”), the plaintiff had to apply to set aside the statutory
                    demand within 14 days from the service of the statutory demand on him. (All
                    references to rules refer to the BR.) When the plaintiff filed his application
                    on 6 July 2009, he was eight days out of time. However, r 97(3)
                    provides that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The court may, upon the application of the debtor, allow the debtor an
                        extension of time to make his application to set aside the statutory
                        demand.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       In support of his application to extend time,
                    the plaintiff stated that he was not in Singapore when the statutory demand was
                    served by being posted on the main door of his Singapore residence. He claimed
                    that he was in the United Kingdom between 27 May 2009 and 26 June
                    2009. He explained that he was unable to return to Singapore as he had to
                    consult his English solicitors on the statutory demand served on him and other
                    statutory demands that were served on AAIL, and he also had to attend to his
                    aged father who was undergoing treatment in the United Kingdom.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       The defendant’s response was that the
                    plaintiff did not deserve an extension of time because he did not produce
                    evidence of his being in the United Kingdom, and that in any event, he was, by
                    his account, back in Singapore three days before the dateline for filing the
                    application to set aside the statutory demand.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The application to set aside the statutory demand</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       In the appeal, the plaintiff did not pursue all
                    the arguments he made before the AR and submitted that the statutory demand
                    should be set aside on the grounds that<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span>:</p>

<p class="Judg-1">I shall refer to these grounds as grounds (a), (b) and (c) and consider
                    each in turn.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Ground (a) – non-satisfaction of s 61(1) of the
                BA</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       The plaintiff directed his submissions to the
                    requirements of s 61(1)(<em>d</em>):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">61. —(1) No bankruptcy application shall be made to the
                        court in respect of any debt or debts unless at the time the application is

                                enforceable by execution in Singapore.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       The plaintiff’s argument was that as the
                    debt was incurred outside Singapore, and that no judgment or award obtained on
                    the debt which is enforceable by execution in Singapore, the statutory demand
                    should be set aside.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     Section 61(1)(<em>d</em>)
                    was enacted for a specific purpose. Its introduction into s 61(1) was
                    recounted by the Court of Appeal in <em>AmBank (M) Bhd v Yong Kim
                        Yoong Raymond</em> [2009] 2 SLR(R) 659 (“<em>AmBank v Yong</em>”) and I will not repeat the complete
                    narration of its gestation. To put it very briefly, it started at the
                    proceedings of the Select Committee on the Bankruptcy Bill. The Select Committee
                    received a submission from an associate professor of law who expressed concern
                    over the extra-territorial application of the criminal provisions in the BA. The
                    Select Committee agreed with the concern and revised the proposed provisions to
                    exclude debts incurred outside Singapore unless they are incorporated in
                    judgments or awards which are enforceable in Singapore.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     The Court of Appeal concluded at [24]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[T]he objective of s 61(1)(<em>d</em>) was to give
                        some added measure of <em>protection</em>, in the light
                        of the far-reaching amendments to the bankruptcy regime brought about by the
                        enactment of BA 1995, to persons with property in Singapore against
                        bankruptcy proceedings based on debts incurred outside Singapore. A
                        preliminary requirement that such debts have a <em>nexus</em> with Singapore through "a judgment or award which is
                        enforceable by execution in Singapore" must first and foremost be satisfied.
                        It is also abundantly clear that s 61(1)(<em>d</em>)
                        has purely local roots and has neither been adopted nor adapted from the UK
                        Insolvency Act.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     As s 61(1)(<em>d</em>) is unique to the BA, special care should be taken in
                    construing it. The provision refers specifically to the place where a debt is
                    incurred, and separates them into two categories, debts incurred in Singapore
                    and debts incurred outside Singapore. The starting point is the existence of a
                    debt. That is an amount owing by one party to another, whether or not it is
                    repayable immediately. In other words, the debt is a chose in action, but not
                    necessarily a cause of action. The place where the debt is incurred is the place
                    at which the debt came into existence. In the present case where the defendant
                    bank granted credit facilities to AAIL, it would be the place of AAIL’s
                    account. Each time AAIL operated the account on credit, a debt was incurred. If
                    the account was in Hong Kong, the debts were incurred in Hong Kong, and if the
                    account was in Singapore, the debts are incurred in Singapore. Other issues
                    which relate to a debt, such as the court/s with jurisdiction to hear disputes
                    relating to the debt, the law governing the debt, the place where the demand for
                    repayment is to be made, the place where the debt is to be repaid, the place
                    where a debt can be recovered, do not determine or change the place where the
                    debt is incurred.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     Section 61(1)(<em>d</em>)
                    does more than control the operation of the criminal provisions of our
                    bankruptcy law on foreign debts. It also narrows the exposure of Singapore
                    property to claims based on debts incurred outside Singapore.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     In <em>AmBank v
                    Yong</em>, the Court of Appeal gave valuable guidance to the
                    implementation of the provision when it declared at [27] that “whether a debt is incurred outside Singapore
                    under s 61(1)(<em>d</em>) is, in the final analysis, a
                    question of fact, not law.” While it did not (probably because it could
                    not) set out fact-finding criteria which can be applied in all cases, its
                    finding on the facts of that case is instructive.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     Some significant and material facts are
                    referred to in the Court’s judgment. AmBank is a Malaysian bank. The bank
                    granted loans to two Malaysian companies. Yong, a Singaporean, stood guarantor
                    for the two companies. When the two companies defaulted on repayment, the bank
                    obtained judgment against Yong in Malaysia. The bank registered the judgment in
                    Singapore under the Reciprocal Enforcement of Commonwealth Judgments Act (Cap
                    264, 1985 Rev Ed), but did not enforce it within six years from the date of the
                    judgment. Because of the delay, leave of court was required to enforce the
                    judgment in Singapore, which the bank did not obtain. The bank then served a
                    statutory demand on Yong (the judgment did not disclose the location of service
                    of the statutory demand.) When the demand was not met the bank instituted
                    bankruptcy proceedings against him.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     Against the basis of these facts, the Court of
                    Appeal held at [32] that “there
                    can be no doubt that the debt in question arose in Malaysia, and it is, in every
                    way, a debt “incurred outside Singapore””, and set aside
                    the statutory demand.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     From the facts set out in <a href="#p1_14">[14]</a> <em>supra</em>, the only factor connecting the debt to
                    Singapore is Yong’s nationality. The place of service of the statutory
                    demand was not disclosed, but that is unlikely to have been considered relevant
                    as the debt was incurred before the statutory demand was served. It is also
                    likely that the facilities were made in Malaysia as the lender and the borrowers
                    are all Malaysia entities and it is more probable than not that the
                    borrowers’ accounts with the bank were in Malaysia. If the accounts were
                    in Singapore, the bank would have relied on that. On the basis of the facts, the
                    Court of Appeal had ruled that the debts were incurred outside of Singapore for
                    the purpose of s 61(1)(<em>d</em>).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The corresponding facts</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     I do not think that all the facts relating to
                    the relationship of the parties and the transactions would have an equal bearing
                    in the determination of the place where the debt was incurred. In a situation
                    involving a lender, a borrower and a guarantor, the borrower owes the debt to
                    the lender and the guarantor guarantees the repayment of the debt. In other
                    words, this is a one-debt-multiple-debtors situation. Moving on from that, while
                    the same debt applies to the borrower and the guarantor, their liability may be
                    different; defences available to one of them may not be available to the
                    other.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     The facts of the present case are:</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(a)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">the lender bank is the Hong Kong branch of the
                            Ing Bank NV;</div>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     The question to be addressed is how the facts
                    and conclusion in <em>AmBank v Yong</em> are applicable to
                    the present case. The lender and borrowers are outside Singapore. From the know
                    facts, it is most likely that AAIL’s account with the defendant was at the
                    latter’s branch in Hong Kong and the credit facilities were disbursed
                    through that account. In any event, the exact place the account was maintained
                    is not critical as long as it is not Singapore. The burden was on the defendant
                    to establish that the statutory demand was a proper statutory demand, which did
                    not infringe s 61(1)(<em>d</em>). The defendant had to
                    show that the debt was incurred in Singapore, and it had not done
                that.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     For the reasons given in <a href="#p1_17">[17]</a> and <a href="#p1_18">[18]</a> <em>supra</em>, the issuance and service of the statutory
                    demand cannot change the place where a debt is incurred. The relevant facts in
                        <em>AmBank v Yong</em> are also present in the present
                    case:</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(a)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">the lender and borrowers are outside of
                            Singapore; and</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(b)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">the bank accounts were not located in
                            Singapore.</div>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     As the Court of Appeal had ruled that the
                    question whether a debt is incurred outside Singapore is a question of fact, and
                    the Court found that the debt in <em>AmBank v Yong</em> was
                    incurred outside Singapore, the debt in the present case, by the same reasoning,
                    must have been incurred outside Singapore.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     The defendant raised an objection against the
                    plaintiff’s reliance on s 61(1)(<em>d</em>). It
                    submitted that<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span>:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It should be noted that Section 61 of the Bankruptcy Act is only
                        applicable in the context of a bankruptcy application; the Bankruptcy Act
                        has no similar provision pertaining to statutory demands. No bankruptcy
                        application having yet been filed by the Defendant against the Plaintiff,
                        the Defendant takes the position that it is entirely premature for the
                        Plaintiff to rely on Section 61 of the Bankruptcy Act at this
                        juncture.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">That objection is founded on a narrow reading of s 61(1).
                    Inasmuch as the provision states that no bankruptcy application shall be made to
                    the court unless the four conditions set out in (a), (b), (c) and (d) are
                    satisfied, it can be argued that the penalty for the non-compliance of the four
                    conditions is that no bankruptcy application can be made, and not that a
                    statutory demand cannot be issued.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     Such a position is based on a reading of the
                    provision in isolation without regard to the purpose and effect of a statutory
                    demand in bankruptcy proceedings. The effect of a statutory demand is made clear
                    in s 62:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">For the purposes of a creditor’s bankruptcy
                        application, a debtor shall, until he proves to the contrary, be presumed to
                        be unable to pay any debt within the meaning of section 61(1)(<em>c</em>) if the debt is immediately payable and
                        —</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-2-No">(a)</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-2-Item">(i)   the applicant creditor to
                                whom the debt is owed has served on him in the prescribed manner, a
                                statutory demand;</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-2-No">(ii)</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-2-Item">at least 21 days have elapsed since the
                                statutory demand was served;</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1">Bankruptcy proceedings are often made on the basis of
                    a statutory demand (see r 102 BR), and the presumption of insolvency which
                    arises when it is not met. That is the only purpose of a statutory demand in the
                    BR.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     Taken in this broader context, there is little
                    merit in the argument that an objection under s 61(1)(<em>d</em>) can only be raised to resist a bankruptcy application, but
                    not to set aside a statutory demand. There is no reason to deny a party served
                    with a statutory demand the right to take immediate action to set it aside and
                    pre-empt a bankruptcy application, and to oblige the party to put up with the
                    presumption that it is unable to pay the debt demanded. In any event, r 97
                    allows a debtor who has been served with a statutory demand to apply to set it
                    aside and r 98(2)(<em>e</em>) decrees that a court
                    shall set aside a statutory demand if the court is satisfied that it ought to be
                    set aside. These rules entitle the plaintiff to apply to set aside a statutory
                    demand for non-compliance with s 61(1)(<em>d</em>).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Ground (b) – the debt is disputed on substantial
                grounds</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     Section 98(2)(<em>b</em>)
                    provides that a court shall set aside a statutory demand if “the debt is
                    disputed on grounds which appear to the court to be
                substantial”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     The plaintiff alleged that subsequent to the
                    execution of the guarantee but before the facility letter was signed (and before
                    any facilities were provided), he had been assured by Y N Nagendra
                    (“Nagendra”), the defendant’s Managing Director, Global Head
                    of Marketing, India Sub-Contenent, that there was no risk that the guarantee
                    being enforced against him because the defendant was “very comfortable
                    with the assets that were being provided as collateral for the Facilities and
                    ... the guarantee would not be called upon and is only there as a mere
                        formality”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span>. He also alleged that other
                    officers of the defendant had also assured him that the guarantee was a mere
                    formality, and he said that but for these assurances, he would not have signed
                    the guarantee.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span> In the
                    submissions before me, the plaintiff made the point that Nagendra had not
                    deposed any affidavit to deny the allegation.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     A few observations can be made on these
                    allegations:</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(a)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">the plaintiff did not disclose when Nagendra gave
                            the assurance;</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(b)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">the other officers who gave similar assurances
                            were not identified;</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(c)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">the plaintiff acknowledges that he has been
                            engaged in the financial industry and has “significant experience
                            and expertise in trading distressed debt, in particular bank
                            debt”, going back to before 1999<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_5" id="Ftn_5_1"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span>; and</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(d)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">the plaintiff had not recorded or obtained
                            confirmation of the assurance, the significance of which must have been
                            known to him when he executed the guarantee in reliance of
                        it.</div>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Ground (c) – the debtor has a valid counterclaim and set-off
                which is equivalent to or exceeds the amount of the debt</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     This ground was elaborated on in the
                    plaintiff’s submissions to be that “the primary debtor AAIL is not
                    only disputing the Defendants’ claim against them but has also
                    cross-claims against the Defendants which if established would extinguish their
                    liability to the Defendants.”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_6" id="Ftn_6_1"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     There are two components to this ground,
                    firstly the denial of the debt, and secondly the counterclaim. On the first
                    issue, it is open to the borrower and the guarantor to dispute the debt claimed
                    by the lender. Although the submissions are that AAIL was disputing the debt, it
                    is evident that the plaintiff also disputes the debt on the same grounds. This
                    has to be made clear because AAIL has been wound-up, and the liquidators of AAIL
                    are not disputing the debt or making any counterclaim on behalf of
                AAIL.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     The crux of AAIL’s dispute was that AAIL
                    had provided to the defendant some financial notes including notes known as
                    Tarquin Notes and Fund Linked Notes, which the defendant had been attributed
                    with zero values when Nomura International London, the organisation the
                    plaintiff and AAIL had instructed to structure or arrange for the structuring of
                    the notes ceased to issue valuations for them. The plaintiff disagrees with that
                    zero valuation and contends that the notes are “likely to be of
                    substantial value”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_7" id="Ftn_7_1"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span>, but without disclosing any basis
                    for the statement or putting forward any value for the notes.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">My decision</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Extension of time to apply to set aside the statutory
                demand</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     Rule 97(1)(<em>a</em>)
                    provides that the application was to be filed within 14 days from the service of
                    the statutory demand. Rule 97(3) empowers a court to extend the period. When an
                    application is made for an extension of time, a court would have to take into
                    consideration:</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(a)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">the period of the delay;</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(b)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">the reasons for the delay;</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(c)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">the grounds for setting aside the statutory
                            demand; and</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(d)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">the prejudice that may result from an extension
                            of time;</div>
<p class="Judg-1">but the weightage of each factor has to be determined on the
                    facts.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     In this case, the delay of eight days is quite
                    long. The reasons put forward, <em>ie</em>, that the
                    plaintiff was in the United Kingdom to attend to his ailing father and his
                    financial and legal problems when the statutory demand was served, and had
                    returned to Singapore three days before the date line for application were not
                    strong reasons for the delay. However the plaintiff had presented a good case
                    that the statutory demand should be set aside as it did not comply with
                        s 61(1)(<em>d</em>), and an extension of time will
                    not prejudice the defendant, as it will have to confront s 61(1)(<em>d</em>) if it takes out bankruptcy proceedings against the
                    plaintiff.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     For the sake of completeness, I add that I do
                    not consider the plaintiff’s arguments on assurances/estoppel and the
                    valuation issues to be <em>substantial</em> grounds of
                    disputes following within r 98(2)(<em>b</em>) because
                    of the deficiency of content of these allegations.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     After reviewing the matters, I conclude that
                    the application should be granted. With the finding that the debt was incurred
                    outside Singapore and was not recoverable by execution in Singapore, the case
                    for setting aside the statutory demand made up for the delay in the
                    application.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     I allow the plaintiff’s appeal and set
                    aside the AR’s orders. I grant the plaintiff’s applications to
                    enlarge time to file the application to set aside the statutory demand, and I
                    set aside the statutory demand. The plaintiff is to have the costs of the appeal
                    as well as the costs before the AR.</p>
