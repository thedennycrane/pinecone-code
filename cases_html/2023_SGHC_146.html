She denied committing the alleged offence and stated that she admitted committing the offence as the investigation officer told her that she will be given a death penalty if she did not agree to the charge. She stated that she considered the victim like a mother, even though the victim was physically abusive towards her and hit her on multiple occasions. She also alleged that the victim had burned her hands on two occasions[s] but shared that she had no grudge against the victim. She stated that on the day of alleged offence, at around 11 am, she went to the centralized rubbish chute outside the employer’s apartment to throw rubbish. At that time victim was at the apartment and when she came back, she saw two ‘dark skinned’ men standing inside the apartment. She reported that she was scared after seeing the two men and hence sat near the centralized chute for twenty minutes. When she came back to the apartment, the men were not there and found the victim lying on a sofa with blood on the floor…</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 The accused’s story about two dark-skinned men having caused the death of the deceased was untrue; so too was her attempt to blame her admission of the stabbing on the police having threatened her with the death penalty. In the statement of agreed facts, the accused agreed that her statement of 29 June 2018 (in which she admitted to the stabbing, and said that her story about the two dark-skinned men was untrue) was one of the statements recorded and given voluntarily by her, and that no threat, inducement, or promise was made to her at any time before or during the recording of the statements.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 Dr Lijo’s opinion as expressed in his first report dated 30 July 2018, was that the accused had no mental illness, and was not of unsound mind at the time of the alleged offence.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(8) What the accused told Dr Tan for his report</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 Dr Tan examined the accused on four occasions from March–September 2020, and gave a report dated 12 September 2020.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 The accused told Dr Tan that the deceased beat her with utensils such as a small frying pan or ladle on her head or back, and with her knuckles and palm; she was beaten many times through the day, almost every day. The accused also mentioned that she was kicked in the chest when she was cutting the deceased’s toenails, was burned on her right arm by the deceased pushing a hot pan against her, and was also cut by a knife when she was cutting onions and the deceased pulled the knife away.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 The accused said that she had caused something to fall on the deceased’s foot, in response to which the deceased hit her on the back of her head with an object, pulled her hair, and slapped her face. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 The accused said that she saw something stuck in the drawer of the altar and wanted to tell the deceased about it, but the deceased shouted at her and then took scissors and pointed them at her neck while scolding her. The accused said, “fear overcame her” and “don’t know what happened”, she was fearful that she was going to die, and she thought the deceased was going to kill her – but this is quite different from what she told the police in her statement dated 30 June 2018 ([30] above).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 The accused said that the deceased told her, “Tomorrow, I’m going to send you agency. Don’t work here.” The accused said that she was in a daze; she picked up the knife, but “my mind was blank” (in her native language, “nothing in my head”), and “I cannot recall what happened.” She told Dr Tan that she then realised something was wrong – “I think I stabbed her”. This account is also quite different from the detailed account she had given to the police about her stabbing of the deceased.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 Dr Tan’s opinion was that the accused had mixed anxiety and depressive reaction (under ICD–10) or adjustment disorder with mixed anxiety and depressed mood (under DSM–5) at the time of the alleged offence.

He noted that the accused had given different versions of what happened – one version (what the accused told the police on 29 June 2018) was that she had stabbed the deceased several times with a knife as she was very angry with the deceased because the deceased said that she would be sent back to her agent. The accused first gave Dr Lijo this explanation: she “might have told the investigation officer about what likely could have happened at the time of alleged offence”, but subsequently she accepted that she had told the investigation officer in June 2018 that she had stabbed the victim – she claimed that she said so because she believed that by telling the investigation officer that she stabbed the victim she could get a lighter sentence.

</div></div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Findings</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 I accept that the deceased had hit the accused (to get her attention, or to reprimand her), and that the deceased had also retaliated when the accused had accidentally hurt the deceased. I do not believe that the accused would have stabbed the deceased if there were just an isolated statement by the deceased, on the day in question, that the accused would be sent back to the agent. Rather, that statement was made after a period in which the deceased had scolded, hit, and hurt the accused.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 But for the threat to send the accused back to the agent, however, the accused would not have stabbed the deceased. From what the accused said, the deceased’s treatment of her would not, in itself, have caused her to stab the deceased. The accused did not report the deceased’s treatment of her to her employer or his family members, or to her agent, or to her family. It seems that she was willing to tolerate such treatment, although she was hurt, sad, and felt unappreciated.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 The accused however feared being sent back to the agent (and consequently back to her home country in debt), and when the deceased threatened to do so, that triggered the stabbing. As the accused told the police, she was “very angry” when the deceased said that; she took a knife, went to the deceased, and stabbed her.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 I do not accept that the accused was in a dissociative state at the time of the stabbing. From what she told the police, she reacted in anger at the deceased, and she was aware of what she was doing. Indeed, she described the stabbing in detail. I do not accept that she was not conscious of what she was doing.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 The accused’s behaviour in the aftermath of the stabbing is also inconsistent with her being in a dissociative state – she retrieved her belongings, washed the knife, changed, tried to get her passport from the maid agency, and denied that the bag and money she left in the taxi (which were stained with her blood) belonged to her.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 Turning to the elements of the defence of diminished responsibility, I find that for the first limb (abnormality of mind) the accused was not suffering from an abnormality of mind at the time of stabbing. An abnormality of mind “means a state of mind so different from that of ordinary human beings that the reasonable man would term it abnormal”: <span class="font-italic">Iskand</span><span class="font-italic">ar</span> at [81], citing <span class="font-italic">R v Byrne </span>[1960] 2 QB 396 at 403.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 I prefer Dr Lijo’s medical opinion to that of Dr Tan’s – that the accused’s reported symptoms of feeling sad and stressed were normal and expected reactions to her situation. I find Dr Lijo’s opinion to be more consonant with the rest of the evidence, including what the accused admitted to the police.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 On the second limb (that the abnormality of mind was caused by a cause such as disease, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, mental illness), I find that the accused was not suffering from a mental illness at the time of the stabbing: in particular, she was not suffering from adjustment disorder (as diagnosed by Dr Tan).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 For the purposes of Criterion B in DSM-5, on the evidence, the accused was not suffering from marked distress out of proportion to the severity or intensity of the stressor (the deceased), nor did she suffer from significant impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of function.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">71 The accused’s decision to stab the deceased was an emotional, irrational one. But that, <span class="font-italic">per se</span>, does not mean that the accused was suffering from an abnormality of mind caused by mental illness. As the accused told the police, she stabbed the deceased because she was very angry at the deceased for threatening to send her back to the agent. She then tried to get her passport from the agent – presumably to leave the country. When she was arrested, she denied having stabbed the deceased, seeking to blame that on two fictitious dark-skinned men. Evidently, the accused thought that she might be able to escape responsibility if that lie were believed; and she would also have removed the cause of her concern (the deceased, the one who had threatened to send her back to the agent).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">72 On the third limb (that the abnormality of mind substantially impaired her mental responsibility for her acts and omissions in causing the deceased’s death), I find that the accused’s mental responsibility for causing the deceased’s death was not substantially impaired.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">73 The defence relied on the case of <span class="font-italic">Juminem </span>where two foreign domestic workers, aged 18 and 15, successfully relied on the defence of diminished responsibility. In that case, the High Court found that they both suffered from a depressive disorder at the time of the offence which amounted to an abnormality of the mind which had significantly affected and impaired their judgment.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">74 The court accepted that persons suffering from a depressive illness did not necessarily lose their capacity to think or the ability to carry out complex tasks (at [32]) and held that the disaffected mood drew the first accused to a course of action that she would not otherwise have followed – she was unable to distinguish or appreciate irrational urges (such as killing) from more rational ones (such as complaining to the maid agency). Likewise, the court found that the second accused, who also had low intellectual capacity, had her ability to rationalise or will herself out of the crime impaired (at [37]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">75 In considering <span class="font-italic">Juminem</span>, I am mindful of the observations by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Nagaenthran </span><span class="font-italic">a/l K Dharmalingam v Public Prosecutor and another appeal</span> [2019] 2 SLR 216 at [27] that “past cases will have little precedential value when it comes to establishing whether a particular medical condition is an abnormality of mind within the meaning of the first limb…the question is ultimately one for the finder of fact to answer, having regard to all the surrounding circumstances of the offender’s conduct and his offence.”</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">76 One distinction between <span class="font-italic">Juminem</span> and the present case, is that in <span class="font-italic">Juminem</span> the court found that the accused persons were impaired in not being able to distinguish or appreciate irrational urges (such as killing) from more rational ones, whereas in the present case the contention was that the accused was impaired by being in a dissociative state – which Dr Tan explained as, “your action is different from what your thoughts are”.

That undermines Dr Tan’s conclusion that the accused’s mind was not conscious of what she was doing. Indeed, the accused mentioned to the police not only <span class="font-italic">how</span> she had stabbed the deceased, but also <span class="font-italic">why</span> she had stabbed the deceased – because the deceased had threatened to send her back to the agent, and that had made the accused very angry.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">80 The opinion in Dr Tan’s report, that the accused was unable to control her acts, was premised on the accused not knowing what she was doing at the time. In his testimony, however, Dr Tan accepted that it was possible that she knew exactly what she was doing,

</div> In that scenario, however, the accused would not be in a dissociative state – there would be no dissociation between her thoughts and her actions. As for Dr Tan’s assertion that she would still be unable to control her actions (even if she knew what she was doing), Dr Tan did not explain how, if at all, adjustment disorder would lead to that. That was not the premise of his report in the first place, which was based on the accused telling him that she only knew that she had stabbed the deceased after it had happened – but that is a version of events that I do not accept.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">81 Moreover, the accused only relied on the partial defence of diminished responsibility under Exception 7 to s 300 of the Penal Code to resist the charge, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, that what she did was culpable homicide, not murder. The Exceptions to s 300 stipulate when culpable homicide is not murder; the Exceptions are not a defence to culpable homicide. From what the accused admitted to the police, she had caused the deceased’s death by doing an act with the intention of causing such bodily injury as is sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death – that was culpable homicide if not murder, and the only issue was whether she could rely on the defence of diminished responsibility such that she had only committed culpable homicide, not murder. I did not understand it to be the accused’s case that she had not intended to stab the deceased – on the contrary, the accused contended that she was triggered to stab the deceased by the deceased saying, “Tomorrow. You. Go. Agent.”

</div> If, however, the accused were denying the element of intention, I find on the evidence that she <span class="font-italic">had</span> intended to stab the deceased.
