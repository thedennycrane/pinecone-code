</div> </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Relevant procedural history  </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">6 At a pre-trial conference (“PTC”) before the learned Assistant Registrar Justin Yeo (“the AR”) on 11 April 2019, parties were informed that the suit was fixed for trial from 16 to 19 July 2019. Parties were also directed to exchange their affidavits of evidence-in-chief (“AEICs”) by 30 May 2019 and set down for trial by 1 July 2019. (The deadline for exchange of AEICs was eventually extended by consent of parties to 18 June 2019, while the deadline for setting down was subsequently extended by me to 8 July 2019.) </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">7 The plaintiff was calling one witness of fact, Mr Omae, and one expert witness, Ms Katherine Ann Colchester (“Ms Colchester”). The defendant was similarly calling one witness of fact (the defendant himself) and one expert witness, Mr Tan Boon Hoo (“Mr Tan”).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">8 The AEICs of Mr Omae, Mr Tan and the defendant were filed on 20 June 2019. At the judge PTC (“JPTC”) held before me on 24 June 2019, the plaintiff’s counsel explained that Ms Colchester’s AEIC was delayed because there were logistical difficulties getting her AEIC notarised as she was not located in London but (in the plaintiff’s counsel’s words) “way out in Suffolk”. Ms Colchester’s AEIC was eventually filed on 27 June 2019, less than three weeks before the commencement of trial. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Plaintiff missed the deadline for setting down</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">9 On 8 July 2019, the plaintiff filed a notice for setting down an action for trial without payment of the requisite fees. The notice was not accepted by the Registry for filing pending the payment of the said fees. The plaintiff was therefore deemed to have failed to set down by the 8 July 2019 deadline. On 10 July 2019, the Registry sent a reminder to the plaintiff to complete setting down prior to the PTC scheduled to be held before the AR on 11 July 2019. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">10 About an hour after the reminder was sent, the plaintiff’s counsel wrote to court to inform that:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Unforunately [<span class="font-italic">sic</span>], the Plaintiff instructs that they [<span class="font-italic">sic</span>] unable to reach their expert (who is believed to be in the UK) without whom they are unable to proceed to [<span class="font-italic">sic</span>] the trial as fixed. In the premises, the Plaintiff instructs that they require additional time to reach their expert or to find a replacement expert. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">The letter added that the plaintiff’s counsel had been instructed to bring this development to the AR’s attention at the PTC on 11 July 2019. The AR brought this letter to my attention, and I indicated that, if the plaintiff was unable to get in touch with its expert witness in order to bring her to Singapore before the trial commenced, the trial should still proceed on 16 July 2019 with the factual witnesses only. I also offered to see parties urgently for a JPTC on 12 July 2019, if required.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Plaintiff sought vacation of trial dates five days before trial</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">11 At the PTC on 11 July 2019, the plaintiff’s counsel explained that the plaintiff had not set the matter down for trial because the plaintiff’s expert was uncontactable and the plaintiff needed additional time to locate the expert. The plaintiff’s counsel further sought a vacation of the trial dates, explaining that he needed two to three weeks to ascertain what was going on, and to see whether Ms Colchester was still willing to come forward as the plaintiff’s expert witness. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">12 The defendant’s counsel objected strongly. He explained that the defendant had already incurred tremendous costs in arranging for the attendance of his expert witness, booking the facilities for the defendant to give evidence by video-link from Japan, and arranging for the defendant’s Japanese lawyer to fly to Singapore to observe the trial. (I had, on 29 February 2019, granted leave for the defendant to give evidence by video-link from Japan, as the defendant feared being arrested for extradition to the US to face the charge referred to at [3] above if he were to travel to Singapore to attend trial. In doing so, I declined to follow the High Court’s decision in <span class="font-italic">Anil Singh </span><span class="font-italic">Gurm v J S Yeh &amp; Co and another </span>[2018] SGHC 221.)</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">13 When the AR put to the plaintiff’s counsel my suggestion for proceeding first with the factual witnesses as scheduled and then hearing the expert witnesses at a later tranche, the plaintiff’s counsel objected that this would not be feasible. He explained that his main witness was in fact the expert witness, as the crux of the plaintiff’s case lay in the construction of the various declarations found in Form 22A. The plaintiff’s counsel further explained that, as their expert witness had gone missing, they might need to find a new expert, and this might entail adjustments to the evidence of the plaintiff’s factual witness. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">14 The plaintiff’s counsel added that he was not able to prepare for trial without the expert. So if the trial was not vacated he might be placed in a situation where he would have to discharge himself.

</div> Strangely, although the summons for discharge of solicitor was framed as an application by the plaintiff’s counsel to discharge himself, the application was supported, not by an affidavit from the plaintiff’s counsel, but by an affidavit from Mr Omae on behalf of the plaintiff. The affidavit explained that as the plaintiff had been unable to pay the plaintiff’s counsel’s fees and related charges, and as the plaintiff did not wish to “unfairly take advantage of their solicitors”, the plaintiff had on 11 July 2019 revoked the plaintiff’s counsel’s warrant to act. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">17 I brought the case of <span class="font-italic">Furniture &amp; Households Square Ltd v </span><span class="font-italic">Brosco International Pte Ltd </span>[1997] SGHC 9 (“<span class="font-italic">Brosco</span><span class="font-italic"> International</span>”) to the plaintiff’s counsel’s attention and asked to be addressed on how the case might bear on the plaintiff’s counsel’s application to discharge himself in such circumstances. In that case, on the third day of trial, in the midst of the cross-examination of the plaintiff’s second witness, the defendant’s counsel applied for an adjournment, as the defendant wished to make an application for the trial judge to recuse himself. Upon the judge disallowing the adjournment, the defendant’s counsel applied to be discharged from further acting for the defendant. The plaintiff’s counsel pointed out that, if the defendant’s counsel were to be discharged, there would be difficulty in carrying on with the hearing as the defendant, being a body corporate, could not carry on any proceedings without a lawyer. The judge dismissed the application, reasoning that allowing the discharge in such circumstances would result in the waste of time allocated for the hearing and also cause inconvenience and expense to the plaintiff. The defendant’s pique at not being allowed an adjournment was not sufficient justification for allowing the application for discharge. This was the more so since, if the discharge was allowed, the defendant would have achieved its purpose of adjourning the hearing, which the judge had already disallowed. Upon the dismissal of the application to discharge herself, the defendant’s counsel informed the court that she had been instructed not to participate further in the proceedings. The judge then continued hearing the evidence for the plaintiff and gave judgment in favour of the plaintiff.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">18 The plaintiff’s counsel submitted that <span class="font-italic">Brosco</span><span class="font-italic"> International </span>could be distinguished as the application for discharge in that case was made after commencement of trial while the present case had not even been set down. I pointed out that the failure to set down by 8 July 2019 was a breach of the court’s directions, and it was not open to the plaintiff to take advantage of its own breach of the court’s directions in this way.

</div> In any event, I did not consider the difference between an application made during the trial and one made just before the trial to be a relevant distinction. The considerations in both situations should be the same – whether the wastage of time allocated for hearing and the inconvenience and expense caused to the other party if the discharge were allowed could be justified in the circumstances.   </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">19 The plaintiff’s counsel then reiterated the difficulties faced by the plaintiff because of the “disappearance of the plaintiff’s expert”.

I then asked whether that meant he was no longer making an application for vacation of the trial dates. He responded that the plaintiff was making the application, but he had no authority to do so. I then asked who was in court to speak on behalf of the plaintiff to make the application. Mr Omae responded that the court should speak to the plaintiff directly. Since the plaintiff was not a natural person but a body corporate, I asked Mr Omae how he expected me to speak to the plaintiff directly. Mr Omae responded that it should be done through “[f]ormal writing”. I explained that it was the plaintiff’s responsibility to send someone to court who could speak on its behalf.

The plaintiff sued the defendant for professional negligence. The defendant brought third party proceedings against the vendor of the property, the property agent who represented the plaintiff in the transaction, and the property agency at which the said property agent was employed at the material time. Both the vendor and the property agent participated in the trial. The vendor was found liable for fraudulent misrepresentation while the property agent was found liable for negligent misrepresentation. The property agency filed its defence to the third party proceedings but was neither present nor represented at trial. The only issue in relation to the property agency was its vicarious liability for the property agent’s default. Belinda Ang Saw Ean J gave judgment against the property agency in default of its appearance at trial, as she considered that a judgment on the merits against the property agency was inappropriate because the evidence “appeared incomplete”, based on the following four grounds (at [226]): </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) the property agent was not asked about his relation to the property agency in detail during trial;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) the defendant’s Statement of Claim against the property agency merely stated that the property agency was the property agent’s employer and would be responsible and liable in law for the actions and liabilities of the property agent;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) the defendant relied on an associate agreement signed by the property agent in its Reply to the property agency’s Defence, but the property agent was not asked about this document at trial; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) there might have been other documents that might prove to be relevant to the action but were not before the court.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 In the present case, the plaintiff had participated in the proceedings up to the first day of trial and had filed numerous affidavits and voluminous documentary evidence, not only for the trial but also in respect of numerous interlocutory applications.

This was certainly not a case where the evidence was “incomplete” in the sense contemplated in <span class="font-italic">Su</span><span class="font-italic"> Ah Tee.</span> This was therefore an appropriate case to exercise my discretion to go into the merits of the defendant’s counterclaim and render judgment on the merits.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Evaluation of the defendant’s case</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 The defendant’s counterclaim comprised four heads of claim:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) arrears in salary up to the termination of his employment;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) three months’ salary in lieu of notice;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) return of rental deposit; and </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) payments made to an executive search firm for the defendant’s employment pass application as well as the incorporation of a company.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 In relation to the first head of claim, the defendant gave evidence that he was employed in March 2013 by the plaintiff at a salary of $16,700 per month.

I found no reason to doubt the veracity of the defendant’s evidence on this point having regard to the overall context of the events which had transpired from end 2013 to early 2014. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 More importantly, the plaintiff did not rely on the 5 December 2013 resignation e-mail sent by the defendant and had not pleaded that the defendant resigned voluntarily <span class="font-italic">on 5</span><span class="font-italic"> December 2013</span>. Instead, para 10 of the plaintiff’s Reply and Defence to Counterclaim merely denied the defendant’s claim and put the defendant to strict proof, while cross-referencing certain paragraphs in the plaintiff’s Statement of Claim (“SOC”). The paragraphs in the SOC so cross-referenced did not mention the 5 December 2013 resignation e-mail from the defendant. Instead, reference was made to the defendant’s resignation on 14 January 2014.

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 Thus the arrangement between the plaintiff and the defendant was that, once the plaintiff agreed to take over the tenancy of the property from the defendant, the rental deposit became the plaintiff’s responsibility. Therefore the plaintiff gave a cheque to the defendant to replace the rental deposit which in the end was used to defray the outstanding rent for October and November 2013 instead at the plaintiff’s request due to the plaintiff’s dire financial situation. As a result of this arrangement, the defendant failed to obtain the return or reimbursement of the rental deposit which he initially paid. I therefore found the plaintiff liable to repay the rental deposit to the defendant.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 I should note for completeness that there appeared to be a discrepancy between the nature of the claim described in the previous paragraph and that stated in para 76(b)(ii) of the defendant’s AEIC. Paragraph 76(b)(ii) appeared to state that the defendant was claiming reimbursement of a security deposit he paid to the landlord for a new tenancy concluded in or after November 2013. As I had difficulty understanding a claim framed in this manner, I sought clarification from the defendant during his oral testimony. The narrative set out in the previous paragraphs reflected the explanations so given, which I found reasonable and satisfactory. I therefore accepted those explanations on the balance of probabilities. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 In relation to the fourth head of claim, the defendant’s evidence was that, upon termination of the defendant’s employment with the plaintiff, Mr Omae informed the defendant that the plaintiff would be cancelling the defendant’s employment pass within five days. As the defendant’s children were still studying in Singapore, the defendant decided to incorporate a new company in Singapore and apply for an employment pass under the auspices of this new company to enable his family to continue remaining in Singapore.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 I decided to dismiss this head of claim. First, the defendant failed to tender any documentary evidence in support of the claim. Secondly, the claim was not legally sustainable in any event because the defendant’s employment contract specifically allowed for the termination of his employment without notice by way of payment of salary in lieu of notice. The costs in question therefore could not be said to have been caused by any breach of contract on the plaintiff’s part.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 For the foregoing reasons, I dismissed the plaintiff’s claim and I gave judgment for the defendant’s counterclaim for the following amounts:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) $43,400 for arrears in salary;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) $50,100 for three months’ salary in lieu of notice; and </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) $13,400 for return of the rental deposit.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Costs</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 As noted in the passage from <span class="font-italic">Singapore Civil Procedure </span>quoted at [32] above, the defendant should be awarded the whole costs of the action and counterclaim. The matter was fixed for trial for four days and the trial only took two days due to the plaintiff’s last minute decision not to participate in the trial. Having regard to the fact that the defendant had already done all the getting up in preparation for the full four-day trial, I fixed costs at $90,000 and allowed the defendant’s claim for disbursements of $56,817.55.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Final observations</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 The plaintiff’s expert witness, Ms Colchester, has held senior positions in various financial institutions over the years and currently heads her own business advisory firm. For a person of such professional stature to suddenly become totally “uncontactable” as claimed by the plaintiff is difficult to believe. Ms Colchester is based in Suffolk, UK and not in some remote, difficult-to-reach part of the world. Significantly, there was no affidavit from the plaintiff explaining how it lost contact with Ms Colchester, when they were last in touch, and what efforts had been made to get in touch with her. While the true reason for Ms Colchester’s non-availability remains a matter of speculation, the fact was that Ms Colchester’s absence (for whatever reason) did not prevent the plaintiff’s only factual witness, Mr Omae, from going into the witness stand first to give his evidence. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 As a witness of fact, Mr Omae’s evidence was locked in once he filed his AEIC. His evidence should not change depending on whether the plaintiff’s expert was present or absent in court. To suggest, as the plaintiff’s counsel had done at [13] above, that Mr Omae’s AEIC would need adjustment if the plaintiff were to find a new expert to replace Ms Colchester, was plainly ridiculous. It amounted to a suggestion by the plaintiff’s counsel that Mr Omae was prepared to perjure himself according to which way the expert’s opinion went.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 Had the plaintiff’s counsel explained that he would be hampered in the cross-examination of the defendant without the plaintiff’s expert sitting behind him in court to advise him, that would have sounded more reasonable. But that was not the submission made by the plaintiff’s counsel. In any event, even if that had been the submission, it would afford no answer to why the trial could not proceed, at the minimum, with Mr Omae’s evidence first.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 In the final analysis, whatever may have been the actual merits in favour of vacating the trial dates, no factual foundation to support the vacation was ever placed before me in a sworn affidavit. Instead of seeing me on 12 July 2019 with a summons for vacation of trial dates as suggested by the AR, the plaintiff’s counsel turned up with a summons for discharge of solicitor, thereby foregoing all opportunities of placing before me any evidence which may have favoured vacating the trial. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 Neither the summons for discharge of solicitor nor Mr Omae’s affidavit supporting the said summons contained a request to vacate the trial or referred to any reason why the trial should not proceed. It was as though the plaintiff expected that, once the summons for discharge of solicitor was filed, the trial would have to be vacated as a matter of course and there was no further need for the plaintiff to persuade the court that the trial should be vacated. In these circumstances, and especially in the light of what the plaintiff’s counsel told the AR at [14] above on the previous day, the filing of the summons for discharge of solicitor should rightly be seen as a cynical attempt to present the court with a <span class="font-italic">fait accompli</span>, an attempt to obtain through the back-door what the plaintiff did not believe it could obtain by an application for vacation of trial dates. This was not a manoeuvre which the court should condone.</div><div class="Judg-Sign text-left">Pang Khang Chau  <br/>Judge  </div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Arvind Daas Naaidu (Arvind Law LLC) for the plaintiff; <br/>Walter Ferix Silvester (Silvester Legal LLC) for the defendant.</div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div><div class="Judg-Quote-List text-justify"> </div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
