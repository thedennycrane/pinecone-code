                        Winai Phutthaphan, were parties to a criminal conspiracy, and in such
                        capacity, agreed and engaged with one another to do an illegal act, namely,
                        to traffic in diamorphine, a controlled drug specified in Class A of the
                        First Schedule to the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185) (“the
                        Act”), without any authorization under the Act or the Regulations
                        made thereunder, whereby the said Phuthita Somchit was in possession of
                            <b>not less than 62.14 grams of diamorphine</b>
                        at Block 21 Bedok Reservoir View #01-02, Aquarius by the Park, Singapore,
                        for the purpose of trafficking in pursuance of the said conspiracy, an
                        offence under section 5(1)(a) read with section 5(2) of the Act, and you
                        have thereby committed an offence punishable under section 120B of the Penal
                        Code (Cap 224) read with section 33 of the Act.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       At the commencement of the trial, the
                    prosecution applied to stand down a second charge against Quek under the same
                    provisions of the Act, which I allowed. The prosecution and both counsel for
                    Somchit and Quek tendered a statement of agreed facts (“SAF”)
                    pursuant to s 376(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 1985 Rev
                    Ed) (“CPC”). The effect of this was that the facts stated in the
                    SAF were conclusively proved in this trial. I set out below the SAF in its
                    entirety (incorporating amendments made at the end of the first day of the
                    trial):</p>

<b>THE ACCUSED PERSONS</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">1.    The accused persons are:</p>

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">3.    Somchit is Quek’s girlfriend. She is also the

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>THE ACCUSED PERSONS’ PLACE OF

                            of Winai, Somchit and Quek was at Block 21 Bedok Reservoir View #01-02,
                            Aquarius by the Park, Singapore.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">5.    Investigations revealed that Quek had entered into
                            a lease agreement dated 6 September 2008 for the rental of the unit. He
                            had done this by using his forged driving licence under the name of
                            “Lim Chay Yong”. He had also informed the landlord that
                            Somchit and one Wannarat Tancharoen will also be staying at the unit. He
                            had produced photocopies of their passports as well as his forged
                            driving licence, which were then attached to the lease
                        agreement.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">6.    Investigations further revealed that Quek had asked
                            Winai to move into Block 21 Bedok Reservoir View #01-02 on the day
                            before 3 October 2008.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>EVENTS LEADING TO THE ARREST</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">7.    On 3 October 2008, at about 7.45 p.m., a team of
                            officers from the Central Narcotics Bureau (“CNB”)
                            consisting of Assistant Superintendent of Police Tai Kwong Yong
                            (“ASP Tai”), Station Inspector Neo Han Siong (“SI
                            Neo”), Senior Staff Sergeant Pang Hee Lim Joe (“SSSgt Joe
                            Pang”) and Staff Sergeant Yeo Kheng Wei Daniel (“SSgt
                            Daniel Yeo”) arrested <b>Quek</b> next to
                            his rented vehicle, a red colour car SJJ 2514A (“the
                            car”), which was parked next to the badminton hall along Pine
                            Lane, Singapore.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">8.    After <b>Quek</b> was
                            arrested, ASP Tai opened the rear left door of the car and saw a
                            “Nokia” handphone box on the floor mat on the floorboard.
                            ASP Tai then placed it back on the floor mat. The team of CNB officers
                            then escorted <b>Quek</b> to the multi-storey car
                            park at Block 56A, Cassia Crescent, to conduct a search on him and the
                            car. SI Neo drove the red car SJJ 2514A, with <b>Quek</b>, SSgt Daniel Yeo and ASP Tai inside, while SSSgt
                            Joe Pang drove the CNB operations car to the same carpark.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">9.    At the carpark, SSSgt Joe Pang and SSgt Daniel Yeo
                            guarded <b>Quek</b>, while ASP Tai and SI Neo
                            searched the car. ASP Tai and SI Neo recovered, amongst other things,
                            cash amounting to a total of S$5948.00, from various parts of the
                            car.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">10.    SSSgt Joe Pang also searched and recovered one (1)
                            bunch of four (4) keys attached to a key tag with the words “21
                            Aquarius #01-02” written on it from <b>Quek’s</b> trousers’ pocket. <b>Quek</b> was questioned on the exact address to which the
                            keys belonged, but he did not reveal the address. SSSgt Joe Pang then
                            handed the keys over to ASP Tai, who reported to CNB Headquarters
                            (“HQ”) about the keys. ASP Tai’s team of CNB
                            officers subsequently received instructions to proceed to Block 21,
                            Bedok Reservoir View, #01-02, Aquarius by the Park (“the
                            unit”) to conduct a raid.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">11.    Other CNB officers consisting of Woman Assistant
                            Superintendent of Police Tan Siew Fong (“W/ASP Tan”),
                            Senior Staff Sergeant Chong Wee Loong Henry (“SSSgt Henry
                            Chong”) and Sergeant Low Yew Weng James (“Sgt James
                            Low”) had also arrived at the multi-storey car park at Block 56A,
                            Cassia Crescent, to provide reinforcement to ASP Tai’s
                            team.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">12.    On the same day (3 October 2008), at about 8.45
                            p.m., the CNB officers escorted <b>Quek</b> and
                            reached Block 21, Aquarius by the Park, Bedok Reservoir View. Thereat,
                            ASP Tai tasked SI Neo and SSSgt Joe Pang to proceed to check out the
                            unit discreetly. SSSgt Joe Pang subsequently spotted <b>Winai</b> at the door to the unit. However, when Winai saw
                            SSSgt Joe Pang, Winai quickly turned and walked away from the door of
                            the unit. SSSgt Joe Pang and SI Neo Han Siong (“SI Neo”)
                            then proceeded to follow Winai, and they reported this over the radio
                            set.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">13.    ASP Tai then proceeded to raid the unit with W/ASP
                            Tan, SSSgt Henry Chong and Sgt James Low. They gained access to the unit
                            by using the bunch of keys that had been recovered from <b>Quek</b> earlier. SSgt Daniel Yeo was guarding
                                <b>Quek</b> in the car during this
                            time.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">14.    After entering the unit, the CNB officers arrested
                                <b>Somchit</b>, as well as one Wannarat
                            Tancharoen (FIN No.: G9046930X) and one Samruai Phutthawan (FIN No.:
                            G9046931U) within the unit.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">15.    Meanwhile, SSSgt Joe Pang and SI Neo had arrested
                                <b>Winai</b> near the poolside. Cash
                            amounting to a total of S$2700.00 was seized from a black colour sling
                            bag that <b>Winai</b> was carrying at the time of
                            his arrest.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">16.    ASP Tai subsequently gave instructions for
                                <b>Quek</b> and <b>Winai</b> to be brought to the unit.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">

</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">17.    CNB officers
                            conducted a search of the unit. There were 3 rooms: one was a master
                            bedroom (later established to be occupied by Quek and Somchit), one was
                            a guests’ room (occupied by Winai, Wannarat, Samruai and an
                            unknown female Thai National named Min) and a third room was a

<b>HSA ANALYSIS OF URINE SAMPLES</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">30.    
              <b>Somchit</b>, <b>Quek</b> and <b>Winai</b>
                            provided their urine samples for analysis. <b>Somchit</b>’s urine samples were only tested positive
                            for methamphetamine. <b>Winai</b>’s urine
                            samples were not tested positive for any controlled drug. <b>Quek</b>’s urine samples were only tested
                            positive for methamphetamine and nimetazpam. The urine samples of all
                            three of them were tested negative for morphine.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       The prosecution called a total of 45 witnesses
                    to give evidence on its behalf. At the end of the prosecution’s case, I
                    found that a <em>prima facie</em> case had been made
                    against Somchit and Quek and called upon them to give evidence in their defence.
                    Somchit elected to give evidence as well as call witnesses to give evidence in
                    her defence. Quek elected to remain silent. Before going further, it should be
                    clarified that Somchit also refers to Quek as “Wan” and Winai
                    Phutthaphan (“Winai”) as “Od”.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The case for and against Somchit</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       The following were the evidence against Somchit.
                    124 packets of white granular substance comprising not less than 62.14 grams of
                    diamorphine (“the seized drugs”) were found at Block 21 Bedok
                    Reservoir View #01-02 Aquarius by the Park (“Bedok Condominium”),
                    where Somchit resided. Somchit admitted to being in possession of the seized
                    drugs, and in any event, that was clear from the evidence. Not only did Somchit
                    know of the existence of the seized drugs, she was also the one who handed the
                    Nokia Speaker Box (A1) to Winai and the one who kept the white bag (B1). By
                    operation of s 18(2) of the Act, Somchit was “presumed to have known
                    the nature” of the seized drugs. As far as trafficking was concerned,
                    Somchit readily admitted her involvement with Quek’s drug
                        dealings<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span>. She
                    was involved in the packing process, took orders from customers, instructed
                    Winai to deliver packets of drugs to customers, and kept records of the sales.
                    However Somchit denied knowledge that the seized drugs were diamorphine. The
                    sole issue, as far as Somchit was concerned, was whether she had rebutted the
                    presumption in s 18(2) of the Act.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Somchit’s statements to the Central Narcotics Bureau
                (“CNB”)</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       Somchit made a number of statements to the CNB
                    officers from the time she was arrested. On the night of the arrest
                    (3 October 2008), W/ASP Tan Siew Fong (“W/ASP Tan”)
                    questioned her on various items in the Bedok Condominium. A Thai interpreter,
                    Orawan Triteeyaprasert (PW40), interpreted from English to Thai and vice versa.
                    The following is an extract from the question and answer record, which was given
                    within three hours of her apprehension:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">Q6:</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">What do the customer(s) buy from
                            ‘Wan’?</span></p>

<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">Q7:</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">What do you mean by white colour?</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">A7:</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">I do not know what is the white colour.
                            ‘Wan’ only engage me to help him pack into smaller packets
                            and he will pay me for the work.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       At 6.31am on 4 October 2008, at the
                    CNB headquarters, after she was charged, Somchit said as follows in answer to
                    it:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I know the white colour item is one kind of drug which is controlled.
                        However I do not know what is the effect of the drug and I also do not know
                        how heavy of the sentence for the offence. My boyfriend told me if anything
                        happen regarding the drug it will have no problem for me, the worst they
                        will just send me back to Thailand and he will admit that all the drug
                        belong to him. This is the reason why I help him.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       Somchit subsequently gave a number of long
                    statements to the CNB, all of which she agreed to admit in evidence. In relation
                    to the issue of her knowledge of the nature of the seized drugs, the following
                    are relevant:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(a)    Statement recorded on 6 October 2008 at
                            3.30pm</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">5    … I do know that the white substance are
                            drugs but I do not know exactly what type of drugs it is. I ever asked
                            my boyfriend what drug is that but my boyfriend told me that I do not
                            need to know.</p>

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">15    … When I saw the white colour substance, I
                            asked ‘Wan’ what it is the white colour substance and he
                            answered me that this is his job …</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">16    … ‘Wan’ did not tell me what the
                            white colour substance is but I think it is drugs because once
                            ‘Wan’ came home, he asked me to closed [sic] up everything.
                            I suspect the reason for doing this is that substance he brought back is
                            illegal.</p>

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">18    After the first time I saw ‘Wan’ packed
                            the white substance, he did not bring home anymore white substance until
                            2 days later. About 2 days later ‘Wan’ came home with a
                            shopping bag … I asked ‘Wan’ if he need me to help
                            him pack white substance and he say ‘Ok’. I know that the
                            white substance is a kind of drug because when ‘Wan’ brought
                            home this kind of white colour substance the first time, I did ask him
                            if it is drugs and he say ‘Yes’.</p>

                            carrying is drugs. I told him to finish up his visa make some money for
                            the time being and go back to Thailand when his visa
                        expired.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(d)    Statement recorded on 16 January 2009 at
                            10.00am</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">42    I am asked with regards to paragraph 16, what do I
                            mean by close everything when Wan comes home with the white colour
                            substance. I mean to say he will ask me to close the curtains and check
                            that the main door was locked. In the same paragraph, I had also said
                            that I suspected that the reason that he did this was because the
                            substance was illegal. I am asked why I had not left him, left the place
                            or reported to the police if I had suspected that the things were
                            illegal. Actually, I wanted to leave him. However, I had no money and I
                            still depended on him for my livelihood. Secondly, I still loved him.
                            Thirdly, I thought it was not a very serious matter as Wan did not
                            appear that he was afraid. He behaved normally.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">43    I am asked if I had suspected that the white
                            substance were drugs. I suspected that they were because Wan always told
                            [me] not to let anybody see the white substances. But I do not know what
                            time of drugs they were…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">44    With regards to paragraph 23 of my statement, I
                            said that I had told Od that he was carrying drugs. I decided to tell
                            him as I wanted to let him make his own decision as to whether to
                            continue working or to stop, and I will respect his decision. He was
                            surprised when I told him that he was carrying drugs, but he was not
                            angry. Od did ask me if they are really drugs, and I replied that I
                            think so. He then told me to let him continue working till his visa
                            expired and he will go back. He told [me] that at least he can have some
                            money to return home. He also told me to go back together with him as he
                            was worried about me. I had intended to go back with him and not return
                            to Singapore anymore. He also asked me if I was scared and I said I was.
                            When he said scared, he meant how are our families to survive if
                            something happened to us.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">49    I am asked if I had I [sic] ever told Od that what
                            he was carrying were herbs. I am not sure, but I am very sure that
                            eventually, I had told him that the white substance are drugs
                            …</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Somchit’s evidence at trial</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       Somchit related her background<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span>.
                    She was born in 1975 and had only completed primary school after which she went
                    out to work. She first worked as a masseuse and then turned to prostitution. She
                    had married a man but subsequently divorced him. She has two sons, presently
                    aged 19 and 17. This meant that she became a mother at the age of 15 or 16
                    years. She had at some stage visited London for a short period, where she worked
                    as a prostitute. Around 2004, she came to Singapore, also to work as a
                    prostitute. She would remain here for two weeks to a month each time, until her
                    social visit pass expired. She plied the alleys of Geylang, earning about $2,500
                    to $3,000 per month. This was her source of income out of which she supported
                    her mother, two sons, a niece and nephew. Her family members were not aware that
                    she was working as a prostitute. Quek was one of her clients; she had first met
                    him around June 2007. Shortly thereafter, they took a liking to each other
                    and Somchit stopped working as a prostitute when Quek offered to take care of
                    her. Since then, Somchit would travel back and forth from Thailand and live with
                    Quek whenever she was in Singapore. Quek was supportive both of Somchit and her
                    family in Thailand – he gave her an average of $2,000 a month and even
                    conversed over the telephone with the members of her family. Their relationship
                    progressed to the point where they discussed marriage. Sometime in the middle of
                    August 2008, Somchit arranged for her nephew, Winai, to come to Singapore
                    to work for Quek. Quek agreed to pay him 25,000 baht (equivalent to S$1,000) a
                    month. Winai came to Singapore on 24 August 2008<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span> (Somchit was not in
                    Singapore at that time).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       Somchit recounted her first encounters with
                    Quek’s drug dealings<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span>. She returned to Singapore on
                    28 August 2008. The first time she saw the drugs Quek dealt with
                    (which turned out to be diamorphine) was a few days after moving into the Bedok
                    Condominium on 6 September 2008. Quek asked her to close the door and
                    windows. They then went into the study room and Quek took a black bundle out of
                    a plastic bag. Quek walked to the kitchen, and cut open the black bundle which
                    contained a white substance which he then poured into a bowl and started
                    repacking into other packets. Due to the surreptitious circumstances, Somchit
                    suspected that the white substance was illegal and asked Quek if it was a drug
                    and he admitted that it was. Somchit then contacted Winai and informed him that
                    Quek was dealing with “<em>yaaseptit</em>”
                    (which she understood to mean narcotic or illegal drug). Somchit told Winai that
                    they should go back to Thailand after their visa expired. Subsequently, on a
                    second occasion, Somchit again questioned Quek if the white substance was a drug
                    and Quek again admitted that it was. Somchit asked Quek what type of drug it
                    was. Quek did not tell her the name of the drug, but told her it was a
                    “not serious drug” and that if anything were to happen, she would
                    be sent back to Thailand. Upon hearing Quek’s assurance, Somchit
                    volunteered her help with the packing of the drugs.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     When asked by counsel why she believed
                    Quek’s representations, Somchit stated the following<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_5" id="Ftn_5_1"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span>:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">Q</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">Okay. When he told you it was not a serious drug and

<p class="Judg-1">Finally, Somchit testified that while she had heard of other drugs
                    which in Thai she referred to as “Yaba” and “Ganja”,
                    she had no knowledge of “Phong Khaou”, which the Thai interpreter
                    explained was the Thai term for heroin<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_7" id="Ftn_7_1"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Winai’s evidence</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     The third person to the alleged conspiracy,
                    Winai, gave evidence for the prosecution. Having heard his evidence which was
                    also tested during cross-examination, I found it to be inconsistent in parts.
                    For example, Winai initially testified that Somchit never told him that the
                    drugs were <em>yaaseptit</em> (the Thai interpreter
                    explained that this was a general term for narcotic or illegal drug). However,
                    subsequently, he claimed that he could not remember if she did<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_8" id="Ftn_8_1"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span>. Another
                    example related to whether Winai made any drug deliveries for Quek between
                    26-28 August 2008, <em>ie</em> the two days
                    during which Winai was alone in Singapore with Quek. Winai stated in his
                    statement to the CNB<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_9" id="Ftn_9_1"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span> (dated
                    8 October 2008) that because he could not understand Quek’s
                    instructions, he refused to make any deliveries. At trial, Winai testified that
                    in fact, he did make deliveries when he understood Quek’s instructions or
                    when Somchit translated Quek’s instructions to him by phone.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_10" id="Ftn_10_1"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span> When
                    cross-examined on the apparent inconsistency, Winai explained that when his
                    statement was being recorded, he informed the interpreter and recording officer
                    that he did make deliveries.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_11" id="Ftn_11_1"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span> Nevertheless, even taking
                    Winai’s statement at its highest, two points may be noted. The first was
                    that at no time did Winai allege that Somchit knew that the drugs they dealt
                    with were heroin. The second was that Winai consistently stated that he was
                    asked to make drug deliveries by Quek. These points will be further discussed
                    below.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The prosecution’s submissions</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     The prosecution submitted that Somchit had
                    failed to rebut the presumption under s 18(2) of the Act. Firstly, the
                    prosecution submitted that the relevant authorities supported the first
                    interpretation of <em>Tan Kiam Peng v Public
                        Prosecutor</em> [2008] 1 SLR(R) 1 <em>(“Tan Kiam Peng</em>”) <em>ie</em>
                    that the prosecution need only to prove that the accused knew that he or she was
                    in possession of a controlled drug (see below at <a href="#p1_19">[19]</a>). Since Somchit admitted that she knew the seized drugs
                    were illegal, on this interpretation, the prosecution would have proven the
                    charge beyond reasonable doubt.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     Secondly, in any case, Somchit had actual
                    knowledge that she was dealing in diamorphine:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_13-p2_a"></a>(a)     Somchit knew and referred to the
                        seized drugs as the “white substance” or “white
                        one”, which were common parlance for diamorphine.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_13-p2_b"></a>(b)     When Somchit informed Winai that they
                        were dealing with drugs, he asked her if she was scared and she said that
                        she was; this suggested that Somchit knew that the drugs she was dealing in
                        attracted severe penalties under the law.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_13-p2_c"></a>(c)     Somchit was intimately involved with the
                        trafficking process. Not only did she pack the drugs into 8-gram packets, as
                        was the market practice for selling diamorphine, she also dealt directly
                        with customers. Furthermore, she knew that the drugs were sold at a high
                        price (between S$240 to S$320 per packet) and she was remunerated
                        lucratively for her work.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_13-p2_d"></a>(d)     Somchit was not a stranger to controlled drugs. She
                        consumed methamphetamine (“Ice”) and was introduced to
                        nimetazepam (“Erimin 5”) by Quek. It would have been odd that
                        when it came to diamorphine, Quek did not even mention its name to her. She
                        had also witnessed firsthand the way by which it was consumed by Quek and
                        the effects it had on him. Given the intimacy of their relationship, as
                        Somchit had claimed, there was no reason why Quek would refrain from
                        referring to the drugs as “<em>peh
                        hoon</em>” or withhold from her the fact that it was
                        diamorphine.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_13-p2_e"></a>(e)     It
                        was inconceivable that during the period in which she assisted Quek, which
                        lasted almost one month, Somchit had never heard Quek refer to the drugs as
                            “<em>peh
                    hoon</em>”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">From the above, the prosecution
                    submitted that Somchit was not an innocent courier in a one-off transaction.
                    Instead, she was intimately involved in the entire transaction and her behaviour
                    suggested that she must have known the nature of the seized drugs. Furthermore,
                    the prosecution submitted that Somchit’s claim that Quek had told her that
                    the drugs he dealt with were “not serious” drugs was an
                    after-thought, which she did not mention in any of her nine statements to the
                    CNB officers (comprising of contemporaneous statements, cautioned statement and
                    long statements). Likewise, it was not apparent from Winai’s evidence that
                    Somchit thought that the drugs were “not serious”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     Thirdly, even if she did not have actual
                    knowledge that the seized drugs were diamorphine, she was at least wilfully
                    blind as to its nature. In particular, the circumstances surrounding the drug
                    dealings were suspicious. For example, Quek had asked her to lock the doors,
                    close the windows and draw the curtains when he packed drugs in the Bedok
                    Condominium. Furthermore, Somchit was not a stranger to drugs, and knew that it
                    was illegal to deal in controlled drugs. In fact, she was worried when she first
                    learnt that Quek dealt with controlled drugs. Against this backdrop, although
                    she had opportunities to probe further <em>eg</em> by
                    asking Quek or the customers, she chose to turn a blind eye and was content to
                    rely on Quek’s answers without attempting further to ascertain the true
                    nature of the drugs.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The defence’s submissions</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     The defence submitted that Somchit had
                    rebutted the presumption under s 18(2) of the Act. Firstly, the defence
                    submitted that Somchit did not have actual knowledge of the nature of the seized
                    drugs. In her statements to the CNB officers and her testimony in court
                    subsequently, Somchit freely and readily admitted to her involvement in the
                    trafficking process, but did not at any point concede that she knew that the
                    drugs she dealt with was diamorphine. In fact, Somchit’s statements to the
                    CNB were consistent with her defence at trial. Furthermore, neither
                    Winai’s evidence nor Quek’s statements to the CNB suggested that
                    Somchit was aware of the nature of the seized drugs. Secondly, the defence
                    submitted that Somchit was not “wilfully blind” but
                    “rendered blind” by her trust in Quek and her belief in the
                    representations made by Quek. Somchit had no reason to disbelieve Quek as he
                    treated her well, and did not conceal the fact that the drugs he dealt with were
                    a controlled drug.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The law</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     Subsections (1) and (2) of s 18 of the
                    Act provide as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(1)    Any person who is
                            proved to have had in his possession or custody or under his control
                            —</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(a)    anything containing a controlled
                            drug;</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(b)    the keys of anything containing a controlled
                                drug;</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(c)    the keys of any place or premises or any part
                                thereof in which a controlled drug is found; or</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(d)    a document of title relating to a controlled
                                drug or any other document intended for the delivery of a controlled
                                drug,</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">shall, until the contrary is proved, be presumed to have had that drug
                            in his possession.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(2)    Any person who is proved or presumed to have had a
                            controlled drug in his possession shall, until the contrary is proved,
                            be presumed to have known the nature of that drug.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">These provisions establish two presumptions in the law. The first
                    is the presumption of possession in s 18(1) of the Act. Any person who is
                    proved to have in his possession, custody or control anything containing a
                    controlled drug or the keys to anything, place or premises which contain a
                    controlled drug, shall be presumed to have had that drug in his possession. This
                    presumption extends to possession of any document intended for delivery of a
                    controlled drug. The second is the presumption of knowledge – once
                    possession is proved or presumed under s 18(1), s 18(2) of the Act
                    operates to presume that the person knew the nature of that drug. The effect of
                    this is to place on the accused the burden of proving, on a balance of
                    probability, that he did not know the “nature of the
                drug”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     I first considered <em>Warner v
                        Metropolitan Police Commissioner</em> [1969] 2 AC 256
                        <em>(“Warner”)</em>, the English
                    authority that had spawned the precedents in Singapore on s 18 of the Act.
                    The appellant in <em>Warner</em> had picked up two parcels
                    from a cafe which he believed had contained scent. However one parcel contained
                    amphetamine sulphate tablets, a substance specified in the Schedule to the Drugs
                    (Prevention of Misuse) Act 1964 (c 64) (“the 1964 Drugs Act”)
                    and possession of which would, without lawful authority, be an offence under
                    s 1(1). The point of law that was stated by the English Court of Appeal to
                    the House of Lords was:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[w]hether for the purposes of section 1 of the [1964 Drugs Act], a
                        defendant is deemed to be in possession of a prohibited substance when to
                        his knowledge he is in physical possession of the substance but is unaware
                        of its true nature.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The House ruled, by a majority, that s 1 of the 1964 Drugs Act
                    was an absolute offence and a person in possession of any of the scheduled drugs
                    without lawful authority commits an offence even if he had no knowledge that it
                    was a scheduled drug. In his judgment, Lord Pearce said (at 304–306) that
                    parliamentary intention in the 1964 Drugs Act was to prevent or curtail the drug
                    traffic and the term “possession” must not be construed so
                    narrowly “as to stultify the practical efficacy of the Act or so broad
                    that its creates absurdity or injustice.” He reasoned that it could not
                    have been intended to be a defence for an unauthorised person to show that he
                    possessed the drugs for a laudable purpose but on the other hand, it could not
                    have been the intention that a person would be guilty if he did not know he had
                    the thing at all. Lord Pearce concluded that “possession” would
                    exclude the situation where the thing had been planted on him without his
                    knowledge, but it would cover one in which the person had knowledge of the
                    existence of the thing itself but not its qualities. In relation to things in
                    containers, Lord Pearce said as follows at 305-306:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The situation with regard to containers presents further problems. If a
                        man is in possession of the contents of a package, prima facie his
                        possession of the package leads to the strong inference that he is in
                        possession of its contents. But can this be rebutted by evidence that he was
                        mistaken as to its contents? As in the case of goods that have been
                        "planted" in his pocket without his knowledge, so I do not think that he is
                        in possession of contents which are quite different in kind from what he
                        believed. Thus the prima facie assumption is discharged if he proves (or
                        raises a real doubt in the matter) either (a) that he was a servant or
                        bailee who had no right to open it <em>and</em> no
                        reason to suspect that its contents were illicit or were drugs or (b) that
                        although he was the owner he had no knowledge of (including a genuine
                        mistake as to) its actual contents or of their illicit nature and that he
                        received them innocently and also that he had had no reasonable opportunity
                        since receiving the package of acquainting himself with its actual contents.
                        For a man takes over a package or suitcase at risk as to its contents being
                        unlawful if he does not immediately examine it (if he is entitled to do so).
                        As soon as may be he should examine it and if he finds the contents
                        suspicious reject possession by either throwing them away or by taking
                        immediate sensible steps for their disposal.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">So to read the Act would, I think, accord with what Parliament intended
                        and would give it a sense which would accord with the practical views of a
                        jury, although I realise that a deeper investigation of the legal
                        implications of possession might support various differing views. It would
                        leave some unfortunate victims of circumstances who move innocently but
                        rashly in shady surroundings and who carry packages or tablets for strangers
                        or unreliable friends. But I think even they would have an opportunity of
                        ventilating their story and in some cases, if innocent of any knowledge and
                        bad motives, obtaining an acquittal. Some of the persons in some of the
                        rather far-fetched circumstances which have been envisaged in argument would
                        still be left in difficulties. But I do not think that Parliament intended
                        to cater for them in its efforts to stop a serious evil.</p>

                        Public Prosecutor</em> [1979-1980] SLR(R) 311
                        (“<em>Tan Ah Tee</em>”), the second
                    appellant claimed that she did not know that the contents of the plastic bag she
                    was carrying were diamorphine. Her contention before the Court of Appeal
                    (“CA”) was that she had proved, on a balance of probabilities,
                    that “she did not have possession under the Act of the contents of the
                    plastic bag and did not know the nature of its contents” (at <a href="#p1_18">[18]</a>). A major issue before the CA was the
                    presumption of possession in s 16(1) of the Act (now s 18(1)). The
                    court referred to the speech of Lord Pearce in <em>Warner</em> and concluded as follows at [25]-[26]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">25    In our opinion the word “possession”
                            in the Act should be construed as that word has been construed by Lord
                            Pearce and we would respectfully adopt his reasons as contained in his
                            speech. There is, however, one qualification because of the statutory
                            presumptions in the Act. Under our Act where a person is in possession
                            of a bag or package which contains in fact a controlled drug it is
                            presumed that he is in possession of and knows the nature of the
                            controlled drug unlike in the United Kingdom where there is only a
                                <em>prima facie</em> strong inference that he
                            is in possession of its contents. Thus under our Act the burden rests on
                            him to prove on a balance of probabilities that he was not in possession
                            of and did not know the nature of the controlled drug which was
                            contained in the package or bag.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">26    For all these reasons the appeals of both
                            appellants are dismissed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     It should be noted that the CA in <em>Tan Ah Tee</em> dealt only with the presumption of possession
                    in s 18(1) of the Act. There was no discussion on the nature of the
                    presumption in s 18(2) and <em>Tan Ah Tee</em> is not
                    authority on this presumption. In <em>Tan Kiam Peng</em>,
                    the CA discussed the interpretation of s 18(2). The court set out, at [80]
                    and [81] of the grounds of decision, the two possibilities as to the nature of
                    the knowledge that the accused is presumed to have, <em>viz</em>:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_19-p2_a"></a>(a)     the accused is presumed to have
                        known that the drug concerned was a controlled drug (“the first
                        interpretation”); or</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_19-p2_b"></a>(b)     the accused is presumed to have known that the drug
                        concerned was not only a controlled drug, but was the specific drug for
                        which he was charged (“the second
                    interpretation”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     The CA noted that the decided cases supported
                    the first interpretation, and made the following observations at [85]-[87] of
                    the grounds of decision:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">85    Let us, however, now
                            turn to the <em>case law</em> which, as we shall
                            see, supports the first interpretation - especially when viewed in
                                <em>the context of the underlying policy of the Act
                                itself</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">86    In this
                            court's decision in <em>Fun Seong Cheng</em>
                            … the following passage from Lord Pearce's judgment in <em>Warner</em> (… at 305) was cited …
                            :</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">One may, therefore, exclude from the ‘possession’ intended
                            by the Act the physical control of articles which have been
                            ‘planted’ on him without his knowledge. <em>But how much further is one to go? If one goes to the extreme
                                length of requiring the prosecution to prove that
                                ‘possession’ implies a full knowledge of the name and
                                nature of the drug concerned, the efficacy of the Act is seriously
                                impaired, since many drug pedlars may in truth be unaware of this. I
                                think that the term ‘possession’ is satisfied by a
                                knowledge only of the existence of the thing itself and not its
                                qualities</em> ...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">87    The above
                            observations by Lord Pearce, cited and adopted by this court in
                                <em>Fun Seong Cheng</em>, clearly <em>exclude</em> the need by the prosecution to prove
                            that the accused knew of the <em>precise
                                nature</em> of the drug; the prosecution need only prove that
                            the accused knew that the drug is (in the Singapore context) a
                            controlled drug. This would, in fact, be an appropriate juncture to
                            emphasise that this basic approach was not only embodied within the
                            quotation above but generally within <em>Warner</em> itself - a point which emerges from our analysis
                            of <em>Warner</em> above … Indeed, the court
                            in <em>Fun Seong Cheng</em> proceeded to point out
                            … that <em>this</em> particular meaning of
                            possession (enunciated by, <em>inter alia</em>,
                            Lord Pearce in <em>Warner</em>) had in fact been
                            adopted by this court as well in the earlier decision of <em>Tan Ah Tee …</em> see also the decision of
                            this court in <em>Gulam bin Notan Mohd Shariff Jamalddin
                                v PP</em> [1999] 1 SLR(R) 498 at [66]). <em>Tan Ah Tee</em> is, in fact, a seminal decision where
                            the court cited, in addition to the observations quoted above, <em>in extenso</em> from the judgment of Lord Pearce in
                                <em>Warner</em>. As we have already emphasised
                            … to the extent that the court in <em>Warner</em> was dealing with the <em>general
                                concept</em> of <em>possession</em>, then
                                <em>that</em> approach (<em>adopted</em>, as we have just seen, in <em>Tan
                                Ah Tee</em> as well as other Singapore decisions) clearly
                            supports the view that s 18(2) <em>does</em> not
                            refer to the <em>specific</em> drug in question
                            but, rather, simply to controlled drugs generally. Indeed, Lord Pearce's
                            views in <em>Warner</em> … find a similar
                            expression in Lord Guest's observations in the same case, as follows
                            (… at 301):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">If the correct interpretation of section 1 [of the 1964 UK Act] is
                            that the prosecution are required to prove knowledge by the accused of
                            the existence of the substance this will be, in my view, <em>a drug pedlar's charter in which a successful prosecution
                                will be well-nigh impossible in the case of the trafficker who
                                conceals the drugs and on questioning remains silent or at any rate
                                refuses to disclose the origin of the drug. ... If, therefore, this
                                is not an absolute offence the prosecution will, in my view, require
                                to establish knowledge by the accused not only of possession of the
                                actual substance but also knowledge of the nature of the substance,
                                namely, that it is a prohibited drug under the Act. This would, in
                                my view, lead to wide-scale evasion of the Act</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Interestingly and perhaps even significantly, this particular approach
                        towards the concept of possession has apparently been <em>retained in the UK context</em>, despite the presence of a quite
                        different statutory regime to that which existed at the time <em>Warner</em> was decided: see, for example, the English
                        Court of Appeal decisions of <em>McNamara</em> …
                        at 251-252; <em>R v Gareth Edmund Lewis</em> (1988) 87
                        Cr App R 270 at 276 and <em>John A Leeson v R</em>
                        [1999] EWCA Crim 2176 ("Leeson"); as well as the House of Lords decisions of
                            <em>R v Boyesen</em> [1982] AC 768 at
                        773-774 and <em>Regina v Lambert</em> [2002]

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis in original]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     However, the CA in <em>Tan Kiam
                        Peng</em> also observed (at [84]) that simply looking at the ordinary
                    meaning of the words “the nature of that drug” in s 18(2) of
                    the Act, the second interpretation must prevail. Although the CA did not make a
                    conclusive finding on the interpretation of s 18(2), it made clear that it
                    preferred the second interpretation, <em>ie</em> that the
                    accused must have knowledge of the nature of the drug. The CA said as follows at
                    [90]-[93] and [95]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(<em>c</em>)    
              <em>The second interpretation</em>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">90    As already mentioned above, the key argument in
                            favour of the second interpretation (that the reference to knowledge in
                            s 18(2) of the Act is to knowledge that the drug concerned is <em>not only</em> a controlled drug <em>but is also</em> the <em>specific
                                drug</em> which it turns out the accused was in possession of)
                            is the <em>literal wording</em> of s 18(2) itself.
                            However, as we have also seen, the literal wording of this provision is
                            also (at least arguably) consistent with a <em>contrary</em> interpretation ... More importantly, we have
                            also referred to the fact that the second interpretation would tend to
                                <em>undermine</em> the general policy of the
                            Act itself.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">91    In summary, it would appear that there are fewer
                            arguments that support the second interpretation. The fact that an
                            accused charged under the Act might receive very harsh punishments is,
                                <em>in and of itself</em>, not conclusive.
                            However, it does not thereby follow that this particular fact is wholly
                            irrelevant. What <em>is</em> of <em>direct</em> relevance for the purposes of the present issue
                            is this: That where the possible punishments are harsh and may even
                            result in the imposition of the death penalty, the fact that an
                                <em>ambiguity in the statutory language</em>
                            exists (thus giving rise to these two possible interpretations) does
                            tend to suggest that the benefit of the doubt ought to be given to the
                            accused in the light of the fact that adoption of the first
                            interpretation would tend, on balance, to work against him or her
                            … Indeed, the present appeal is precisely one such instance. In
                            this regard, it is important to note that the very strict approach in
                                <em>Warner</em>, albeit general in nature, was
                            adopted in the context of punishments that were less harsh than those
                            under the Act, and which certainly did not include the death penalty. In
                            our view, this particular argument appears to be the strongest in so far
                            as support for the second interpretation is concerned. Indeed, it might
                            even be argued that there is no ambiguity in the statutory language and
                            that the literal language is, instead and in addition to the argument
                            just mentioned, the strongest argument in favour of the second
                            interpretation. We also pause to observe that there has been, to the
                            best of our knowledge, no local decision that has in fact adopted the
                            first interpretation.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(<em>d</em>)    
              <em>Conclusion</em>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">92    Unfortunately, no detailed argument with respect to
                            which of these two interpretations was to be preferred was proffered by
                            counsel before this court.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">93    In the circumstances, we cannot - and ought not to
                            - express a definitive conclusion. This being the case, and in fairness
                            to the appellant, our analysis and decision will proceed on the footing
                            that the second interpretation applies (which interpretation in fact
                            constituted the nub of his argument before this court).</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">95    However, given the specific language of s 18(2) of
                            the Act, the need (given the extreme penalties prescribed by the Act) to
                            resolve any ambiguities in interpretation (if they exist) in favour of
                            the accused, as well as the fact that no case has (to the best of our
                            knowledge) adopted the first interpretation, it would appear, in our
                            view, that (whilst not expressing a conclusive view in the absence of
                            detailed argument) the second interpretation appears to be the more
                            persuasive one and … will in fact be adopted in the present

                    detailed submissions on that issue. The CA proceeded on the basis that the
                    second interpretation (<em>ie</em> that knowledge that the
                    drug was the specific drug the subject matter of the charge) was the correct one
                    and dismissed the appeal on the ground that the appellant had actual knowledge
                    of the nature of the drug he was in possession of.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     I observe that the CA in <em>Tan Kiam Peng</em> had held at [84], and reiterated at [90], that the
                    ordinary meaning of the words in s 18(2) of the Act pointed to the second
                    interpretation. In my opinion, this alone ought to have determined the issue.
                    However the CA felt constrained by earlier decisions and by the view that the
                    first interpretation is consistent with the general policy of the Act whereas
                    the second would undermine it (see [85], [88] and [90] of <em>Tan
                        Kiam Peng</em>). Unfortunately the CA did not proceed to consider what
                    the underlying policy of the Act is in order to test this proposition. I will
                    attempt to do so now.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     The long title to the Act states that it is
                    “for the control of dangerous or otherwise harmful drugs and substances
                    and for purposes connected therewith”. Part II of the Act establishes
                    offences of trafficking, manufacture, import and export, possession and
                    consumption of controlled drugs specified in the First Schedule. Part III
                    contains rules of evidence pertaining to prosecutions under the Act, provisions
                    pertaining to enforcement and forfeiture and sets out the punishments for
                    various offences. There are several sections setting up presumptions, including
                    s 18. Part IV deals with treatment and rehabilitation of drug addicts. Part
                    V contains provisions empowering the taking of photographs of and body samples
                    from persons under supervision. Part VI deals with the establishment of
                    committees of inquiry for matters connected with discipline and other functions
                    of any approved institution for rehabilitation of drug addicts. Considering the
                    Act as a whole, and the parliamentary debates dealing with its enactment in
                    1973, it is clear that the Act was enacted to deal with the problem of narcotic
                    drug abuse and addiction. It punishes persons not only for trafficking, but also
                    for consumption of controlled drugs. It provides for incarceration for the
                    purposes of rehabilitation of drug addicts. It would not be inaccurate to state
                    that the general policy underlying the Act is that of reducing and even
                    eradicating narcotic drug abuse in Singapore. The next question is whether
                    taking the first interpretation or the second would further the policy or
                    undermine it. There is no doubt that adopting the first interpretation would
                    make it much easier for the prosecution to secure a conviction in cases where
                    the presumption in s 18(2) of the Act is required to be invoked. But it is
                    quite a different thing to say that making it easier for the prosecution to
                    secure a conviction would promote the general policy of the Act whereas making
                    it more difficult to do so would undermine it. Our system of criminal justice
                    requires the prosecution to prove an accused person’s guilt beyond
                    reasonable doubt in order to secure a conviction. The presumption in
                    s 18(2) of the Act shifts the burden of proof of knowledge to the accused
                    person once the conditions therein are met. The legislature had decided where
                    the line should be drawn in relation to that burden. If, as the CA in <em>Tan Kiam Peng</em> held, the ordinary meaning of the words in
                    s 18(2) point to the second interpretation, then it is my respectful
                    opinion that there cannot be room for any consideration as to whether this
                    meaning “undermines the general policy” of the Act as Parliament
                    had decided on this line as the appropriate balance between burden on the
                    prosecution and on the accused.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     Even if there is an ambiguity in s 18(2)
                    of the Act, it should be noted that this is a criminal provision. The CA in
                        <em>Tan Kiam Peng</em> stated at [91] that, as the
                    punishments for offences under the Act are harsh and even encompass the death
                    penalty, any ambiguity in the statutory language ought to be resolved in favour
                    of the accused. I would point out that this is a principle of statutory
                    interpretation of great antiquity in the common law. In Francis Bennion,
                        <em>Bennion on Statutory Interpretation</em>
                    (LexisNexis, 5<sup>th</sup> Edition, 2008), the writer put it in
                    the following manner at s 271, p 825:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It is a principle of legal policy that a person should not be penalised
                        except under clear law ... The court, when considering, in relation to the
                        facts of the instant case, which of the opposing constructions of the
                        enactment would give effect to the legislative intention, should presume
                        that the legislator intended to observe this principle. It should therefore
                        strive to avoid adopting a construction which penalises a person where the
                        legislator’s intention to do so is doubtful, or penalises him or her
                        in a way which was not made clear …</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     In <em>Tuck &amp; Sons v
                        Priester</em> (1887) 19 QBD 629, the plaintiffs entered into a
                    contract with the defendant to make copies of a drawing which belonged to the
                    plaintiffs. The plaintiffs subsequently registered their copyright. Without the
                    consent of the plaintiffs, the defendant made additional copies in a foreign
                    country with the intention of selling them for his own profit. An issue before
                    the court was whether under the Fine Arts Copyright Act 1862 (25 &amp; 26 Vict.
                    c. 68) (“the Victorian Act”) the defendant made copies of the work
                    unlawfully and was therefore subjected to additional penalties pursuant to
                    s 6 of the Victorian Act. Lord Esher MR held that (at 638):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… We must be very careful in construing that section, because it
                        imposes a penalty. If there is a reasonable interpretation which will avoid
                        the penalty in any particular case we must adopt that construction. If there
                        are two reasonable constructions we must give the more lenient one. That is
                        the settled rule for the construction of penal sections …</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     This decision was followed in <em>Teng Lang Khin v Public Prosecutor</em>
                    [1994] 3 SLR(R) 1040, an appeal to the High Court from the
                    Magistrate’s Court. The appellant there was convicted under s 101(2)
                    of the Road Traffic Act (Cap 276, 1985 Rev Ed) (“RTA”) for causing
                    a vehicle registered for private use to be used as a public service vehicle
                    without there being in force a public service licence in respect of the vehicle.
                    She had rented to customers cars registered for private use. At issue was what
                    constituted a “public service vehicle” under the RTA.
                    Section 2 of the RTA stated:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">‘public service vehicle’ means a vehicle used or kept for use
                        for the carriage of passengers for hire or reward, other than a vehicle
                        constructed for use on fixed rails or specially prepared ways ...</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Yong Pung How CJ (“Yong CJ”) held, albeit
                    “not without some reluctance”, that the literal construction of
                    s 2 of the RTA was that the cars hired out by the appellant did not
                    constitute “public service vehicles” since they were hired out as
                    self-drive cars and there was no evidence that they had been used for carriage
                    of passengers for hire or reward. Yong CJ cited with approval the passage
                    from <em>Tuck &amp; Sons v Priester</em> reproduced above
                    at <a href="#p1_26">[26]</a> and also made the following
                    statement (at [18]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... in the present case the definition of "public service vehicle" in s 2
                        of the Road Traffic Act appeared to me to be quite clear. The deputy public
                        prosecutor did not attempt to suggest that there might be some underlying
                        ambiguity to s 2; and wisely so, for any suggestion that ambiguity existed
                        would only have led to the alleged ambiguity being resolved in favour of the
                        person otherwise liable under s 101(2) - in this case, the appellant.
                        Indeed, in view of the draconian penalty prescribed in s 101(6) of
                        forfeiture of an accused's vehicles, I would have had no hesitation in
                        resolving any obscurity in favour of the appellant, unmeritorious though her
                        conduct might have been …</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     This rule has been attenuated in recent times
                    and the courts adopt a more pragmatic purposive approach to statutory
                    interpretation especially after the enactment of s 9A of the Interpretation
                    Act (Cap 1, 2002 Rev Ed). In <em>Public Prosecutor v
                        Low Kok Heng</em> [2007] 4 SLR(R) 183, V K
                    Rajah JA opined at [38]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">38     The modern local position on
                        the construction of penal statutes is appositely summarised by Yong Pung
                        How CJ in [<em>Forward Food Management Pte Ltd and
                            another v Public Prosecutor</em> [2002] 1 SLR(R) 443]
                        … at [26] in the following
                        terms:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">[T]he strict construction rule is only applied to ambiguous statutory
                            provisions as a tool of last resort. The proper approach to be taken by
                            a court construing a penal provision is to first consider if the literal
                            and purposive interpretations of the provision leave the provision in
                            ambiguity. It is only after these and other tools of ascertaining
                            Parliament's intent have been exhausted, that the strict construction
                            rule kicks in in the accused person's favour.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">To my mind, this is decidedly the most appropriate approach to adopt,
                        particularly in the light of the principle of statutory construction of
                        statutes endorsed by Parliament in the Interpretation Act (Cap 1, 2002 Rev
                        Ed), as discussed below.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">...</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The general position in Singapore with respect to the construction of
                    written law should be the same whether the provision is a penal or civil one.
                    Purposive interpretation in accordance with s 9A(1) of the Interpretation Act is
                    the paramount principle of interpretation even with respect to penal statutes;
                    it is only in cases where penal provisions remain ambiguous notwithstanding all
                    attempts at purposive interpretation that the strict construction rule
                    applies.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     However this rule is nevertheless germane in
                    capital cases. In <em>Forward Food Management Pte Ltd and another
                        v Public Prosecutor</em> [2002] 1 SLR(R) 443, Yong CJ
                    said at [21]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">To my mind, it was therefore important to consider the theoretical basis
                        of the rule and its applicability in the modern legal environment, where
                        courts are more disposed to applying the purposive approach to statutory
                        interpretation. The origins of the strict construction rule can be found in
                        capital cases where the courts construed ambiguous statutory provisions
                            <em>in favorem vitae</em> as this was regarded as a
                        form of fairness to the individual. According to Prof Andrew Ashworth,
                        “Interpreting Criminal Statutes: A Crisis of Legality?” (1991)
                        LQR 419 at 432, the principle was subsequently carried over into other areas
                        of criminal law, probably because criminal proceedings were viewed as an
                        unequal contest between the individual and the State. This seems to be
                        supported by the <em>dicta</em> of Wilson J in
                            <em>R v Paré</em> (1987) 60 CR (3d) 346
                        at 368. Furthermore, the editors of <em>Cross on Statutory
                            Interpretation</em> (3rd Ed) opined, at p 173, that the
                        application of this rule in earlier cases like <em>Rex v
                            Harris, Balls, and Moses</em> (1835) 7 Car &amp; P 416
                        was justified on humanitarian grounds because of the manifest injustice
                        brought about by other interpretations of a statute. These, however, have
                        been rendered unnecessary by the mitigation of the rigours of the criminal
                        law. Moreover, courts have increasingly taken the view that an extreme slant
                        in favour of the accused is not always desirable because it often defeats
                        the purposes of the legislation and this in turn leads to some other form of
                        injustice.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     Therefore, if there is an ambiguity in
                    s 18(2) of the Act, as the CA in <em>Tan Kiam
                        Peng</em> put in at [91], “the benefit of the doubt ought to be
                    given to the accused”. There is a further reason for doing so. Under
                    s 18(1), an accused is presumed to have possession of the controlled drug
                    if it is proved that he had possession of the keys to a place or premises or
                    even a document intended for delivery. Under s 18(2), once this presumption
                    of possession is operative, the presumption of knowledge is invoked.
                    Section 18(2) therefore involves a presumption upon a presumption, a
                    further reversal of the burden of proof from the prosecution to the accused. In
                    my opinion, “the second interpretation” of s 18(2) that the
                    CA in <em>Tan Kiam Peng</em> had considered (at [95] of
                    their judgment) to be “the more persuasive” one must be the
                    correct one in law.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">My finding in relation to Somchit</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     From both her demeanour in the witness box and
                    the consistency of her evidence, I found Somchit to be a witness of truth.
                    Somchit gave evidence over almost three days. She came across as a person of
                    average intelligence and displayed a level of street smart savvy that can be
                    expected from her background. I had noted that throughout her testimony, she
                    answered questions without hesitation and in a forthright manner. She admitted
                    to every question put to her save on the issue of her knowledge that the drugs
                    she was dealing with were heroin. Somchit had maintained this position right
                    from the time of her arrest in the Bedok Condominium. There, W/ASP Tan had
                    asked, through an interpreter, what Quek’s customers bought from him. She
                    said that it was the “white colour”. To the follow-up question,
                    she had said: “I do not know what is the white colour. ‘Wan’
                    only engage me to help him pack into smaller packets and he will pay me for the
                    work.” Somchit was then taken to CNB headquarters and questioned through
                    the night. In the morning, at around 6.30am on 4 October 2008, Somchit
                    was charged with trafficking heroin and that was when it was brought to her
                    attention that she was facing a capital offence in relation to that drug. In her
                    statement in response to the charge, she said that she knew that it was a
                    controlled drug, but she did not know its effect nor the severity of the
                    punishment. She said that Quek told her that if anything happened, she would not
                    get into serious trouble; and at worst, she would be deported. It can be seen
                    that her reactions in the hours after the shock of arrest, and when faced with a
                    capital charge, are consistent with what she maintained in her defence. Over
                    several months she gave a number of statements to the CNB. There were no
                    significant inconsistencies there with her defence. Finally, the evidence given
                    at the trial by Winai and Somchit herself were also consistent with her defence.
                    I took into consideration Somchit’s background. She had only completed
                    primary school in Thailand and thereafter had gone to work, first as a masseuse
                    before resorting to prostitution. Her life had been a constant struggle, and she
                    stooped to the lowliest occupation a woman could take to support her sons and an
                    extended family. Therefore when Quek rescued her from this life and not only
                    placed her in comfortable surroundings, treated her well and provided for her
                    family, but also professed his love for her and intention to marry her, it is
                    not surprising that she trusted him and took his words literally. Having had the
                    opportunity to observe her demeanour in the witness box, I found her evidence to
                    be truthful.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     For completeness, I will now deal with what
                    the prosecution has submitted are the weaknesses in Somchit’s
                    defence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     The first point highlighted by the prosecution
                    was that the circumstantial evidence, <em>ie</em> the money
                    she received, the packing, Quek’s method for consuming the drug <em>etc</em> points to the conclusion that Somchit knew that the
                    seized drugs were diamorphine. However, given the nature of their relationship,
                    I accepted Somchit’s evidence that Quek would have given her money whether
                    or not she helped him in his drug dealings. More importantly, Somchit had
                    admitted that she knew that the substance was some kind of illegal drugs, and
                    therefore it would not be surprising to her that there would be money in the
                    operation.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     The second point was that Somchit did not
                    mention in her statements to the CNB that Quek told her the drug he dealt with
                    was a “not serious drug”; on the contrary, she stated then that
                    Quek told her she did not need to know what the drug was. When cross-examined on
                    this apparent omission from her statements to the CNB, Somchit stated
                        that<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_12" id="Ftn_12_1"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span>:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">My understanding at that time was not serious of my doing and not serious
                        about the drug that he sell. That is why I thought --- I never think of the
                        words “serious drug”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">In my view, Somchit’s evidence to this court was consistent with
                    her statements to the CNB. Firstly it must be emphasised that s 122(6) of
                    the CPC does not require the accused person to minutely detail the defence he
                    will be relying on at the trial: see <em>Roshdi v Public
                        Prosecutor</em> [1994] 3 SLR(R) 1 at [21]. More importantly, I found that although
                    Somchit did not state specifically that Quek told her the drugs were “not
                    serious”, her statements had in fact alluded to it. As noted above, from
                    the moment she was arrested, Somchit had denied knowledge of the nature of the
                    seized drugs. In her cautioned statement, she stated that she did not know the
                    effect of the drug or the severity of the penalty. I noted that Somchit’s
                    statement to the CNB was slightly different from her evidence in trial,
                        <em>ie</em> in her cautioned statement, she denied
                    knowledge of the severity of <em>the penalty</em>, and not
                        <em>the drug</em> itself. However in the context, I was
                    of the view that the two are connected. Taking into account Somchit’s
                    background, I found that it was reasonable that when laying out the material
                    aspect of her defences in her statement, she did not appreciate the difference.
                    I therefore found her cautioned statement to be consistent with her evidence at
                    trial, and that by stating that Quek told her that the worst that would happen
                    would be for her to be sent back to Thailand, Somchit alluded to the fact that
                    Quek told her that the drugs he dealt with were “not serious”. The
                    prosecution submitted that the reason why Somchit thought that the worst that
                    would happen to her was being sent back to Thailand was because Quek told her
                    that he would admit that all the drugs belonged to him. While that is a
                    plausible interpretation, in my view, it was necessary to consider her evidence
                    in its totality. Again, here I noted the consistency of her statements and her
                    defence at trial.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     The third point raised was that when Somchit
                    learnt that Quek was dealing with drugs, and Winai asked her if she was scared,
                    she said she was<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_13" id="Ftn_13_1"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span>. In Somchit’s statements to the CNB,
                    she stated the following:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">23    ... When I came to know that the white substance is
                            drugs, I did inform [Winai] that what he is carrying is drugs. I told
                            him to finish up his visa make some money for the time being and go back
                            to Thailand when his visa expired.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_14" id="Ftn_14_1"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">44    With regards to paragraph 23 of my statement, I
                            said that I had told [Winai] that he was carrying drugs. I decided to
                            tell him as I wanted to let him make his own decision as to whether to
                            continue working or to stop, and I will respect his decision. He was
                            surprised when I told him that he was carrying drugs, but he was not
                            angry. [Winai] did ask me if they are really drugs, and I replied that I
                            think so. He then told me to let him continue working till his visa
                            expired and he will go back. He told [me] that at least he can have some
                            money to return home. He also told me to go back together with him as he
                            was worried about me. I had intended to go back with him and not return
                            to Singapore anymore. He also asked me if I was scared and I said I was.
                            When he said scared, he meant how are our families to survive if
                            something happened to us.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_15" id="Ftn_15_1"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1">As for what would happen to her, Somchit agreed with the
                    prosecution that she thought she may be imprisoned<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_16" id="Ftn_16_1"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span>. Thus, she wanted to go back to Thailand
                    when her visa expired. The prosecution submitted that these suggested that she
                    knew the seriousness of the drugs Quek dealt with. Somchit testified that she
                    had two conversations with Winai. The first conversation took place after she
                    first found out that Quek dealt with drugs when he brought the drugs to the
                    Bedok Condominium. Somchit called Winai to inform him that Quek dealt with drugs
                    and that Winai and her should return to Thailand after their visa
                        ended<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_17" id="Ftn_17_1"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a></span>. It was
                    during this conversation with Winai where Somchit expressed that she was
                        “scared”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_18" id="Ftn_18_1"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a></span>. The second conversation with Winai,
                    where Somchit told Winai that at the very most, they would be sent back to
                    Thailand, took place subsequently after she began to help Quek with the packing
                        <em>ie</em> after Quek had told her that the drugs were
                    not serious.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_19" id="Ftn_19_1"><sup>[note: 19]</sup></a></span> Thus, the defence submitted that although
                    Somchit was initially “scared”, her fears were removed when Quek
                    represented to her that the drugs were “not serious”, and she
                    therefore decided to help him as well as extend her visa. I accepted
                    Somchit’s explanation as to the apparent inconsistency in her evidence. In
                    my view, it was consistent with her explanation as to why she chose to extend
                    her visa although she initially stated that she wanted to return to Thailand
                    with Winai after their visas were expired. I also noted that para 44 of
                    Somchit’s statement (see above at <a href="#p1_35">[35]</a>) related to the events which took place after the first time
                    she saw Quek bringing the drugs back to the Bedok Condominium.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     The fourth point was that even if Somchit did
                    not have <em>actual knowledge</em> as to the nature of the
                    drugs, she was at least wilfully blind as to its nature. As for what amounted to
                    “wilful blindness”, the prosecution relied on the CA’s
                    decision in <em>Tan Kiam Peng</em>, which states the
                    following:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">104    ... The proof of an
                            actual situation of actual knowledge is, in the circumstances, going to
                            be equally rare. This is a <em>fortiori</em> the
                            case in so far as offences under the Act are concerned. Accused persons
                            are hardly likely to admit to possessing actual knowledge and can
                            (indeed, will) easily disavow such knowledge even if it existed, given
                            the surreptitious nature inherent in drug offences as well as the
                            draconian penalties that are imposed on conviction. In any event, as we
                            have already noted, wilful blindness has, in any event, always been
                            treated, in law, as <em>actual</em> knowledge. In
                            this regard, Yong CJ, in <em>Koo Pui Fong</em>,
                            observed that the “concept of wilful blindness does not introduce
                            a new state of mind to that of knowing” and that “[i]t is
                            simply a reformulation of actual knowledge” … the learned
                            Chief Justice then proceeded to observe as follows
                        …:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">It seems to me that it is wholly in keeping with common
                            sense and the law to say that an accused knew of certain facts if he
                            deliberately closed his eyes to the circumstances, his wilful blindness
                            being evidence from which knowledge may be inferred. Thus I fully agree
                            with the following passage of Lord Bridge in <em>Westminster City Council v Croyalgrange Ltd</em> (1986) 83 Cr
                            App R 155 at 164:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-3">... it is always open to the tribunal of fact, when knowledge on
                                the part of a defendant is required to be proved, to base a finding
                                of knowledge on evidence that the defendant had deliberately shut
                                his eyes to the obvious or refrained from inquiry because he
                                suspected the truth but did not want to have his suspicion
                                confirmed.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis in original]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     It should also be observed that the CA
                    distinguished between <em>wilful blindness</em> and
                        <em>constructive knowledge</em> in the following
                    manner:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">116    In <em>Roper</em> … although the court arrived at its decision on
                        a comparatively narrow ground to the effect that the court below had taken
                        into account inadmissible evidence and that the defendants’ appeal had
                        therefore to be allowed, Devlin J (as he then was) nevertheless proceeded to
                        make the very pertinent observations, which merit quotation in full, as
                        follows (at 288-289):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">There are, I think, three degrees of knowledge which it may be
                            relevant to consider in case[es] of this kind. The <em>first</em> is <em>actual</em> knowledge,
                            which the justices may find because they infer it from the nature of the
                            act done, for no man can prove the state of another man’[s] mind;
                            and they may find it even if the defendant gives evidence to the
                            contrary. They may say, “We do not believe him; we think that
                            that was his state of mind.” They may feel that the evidence
                            falls short of that, and if they do they have then to consider what
                            might be described as knowledge of the <em>second</em> degree; <em>whether the defendant
                                was, as it has been called, shutting his eyes to an obvious means of
                                knowledge</em>. Various expressions have been used to describe
                            that state of mind. I do not think it necessary to look further,
                            certainly not in cases of this type, than the phrase which Lord Hewart,
                            C.J., used in a case under this section, <em>Evans v.
                                Dell</em> ((1937) 53 <em>The Times</em>
                            L.R. 310), where he said (at p. 313): “... the respondent
                            deliberately refrained from making inquiries the results of which he
                            might not care to have.”</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">The <em>third</em> kind of knowledge is what is
                            generally known in the law as <em>constructive</em>
                            knowledge: <em>it is what is encompassed by the words
                                “ought to have known” in the phrase “knew or
                                ought to have known”. It does not mean actual knowledge at
                                all</em>; it means that the defendant had in effect the means
                            of knowledge. When, therefore, the case of the prosecution is that the
                            defendant fails to make what they think were reasonable inquiries it is,
                            I think, incumbent on them to make it plain which of the two things they
                            are saying. <em>There is a vast distinction between a
                                state of mind which consists of deliberately refraining from making
                                inquiries, the result of which the person does not care to have, and
                                a state of mind which is merely neglecting to make such inquiries as
                                a reasonable and prudent person would make</em>. If that
                            distinction is kept well in mind I think that justices will have less
                            difficulty than this case appears to show they have had in determining
                            what is the true position. <em>The case of shutting [the]
                                eyes is actual knowledge in the eyes of the law; the case of merely
                                neglecting to make inquiries is not knowledge at all - it comes
                                within the legal conception of constructive knowledge, a conception
                                which, generally speaking, has no place in the criminal
                                law</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis in original]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The above observations - quoted at length because, as we shall see
                    below, of their signal importance - are instructive. Although the learned judge
                    spoke of “three degrees of knowledge”, there are, in point of
                    fact, only <em>two distinct categories</em>, <em>viz</em>, actual knowledge and constructive knowledge,
                    respectively. The former, however, comprises two sub-categories - first, actual
                    knowledge in (for want of a better way of putting it) an actual sense and,
                    secondly, actual knowledge in the form of <em>wilful
                        blindness</em>. And, as Devlin J aptly put it, the other main category
                    of knowledge, <em>viz</em>, constructive knowledge
                    “has no place in the criminal law”. However, as we shall see below
                    at <a href="#p1_38">[38]</a> (especially at [133] of <em>Tan Kiam Peng</em>), the line between actual and constructive
                    knowledge is not always that clear, owing to the very factual nature of the
                    inquiry.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     The CA went on to state the general principles
                    relating to the concept of wilful blindness:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">123    The first is that wilful blindness is treated,
                        in law, as being the <em>equivalent</em> of <em>actual</em> knowledge ...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">124    What is clear from the above observations is
                        that the accused is under no legal obligation not to turn a blind eye.
                        However, if he does in fact turn a blind eye, that could, on the facts, be
                        taken to be wilful blindness on his part. If so, this would be tantamount to
                        actual knowledge in law, and the accused would have failed to have rebutted
                        the presumption of knowledge under s 18(2) of the Act ...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">125    The second central principle is that <em>suspicion is</em> legally sufficient to ground a finding
                        of wilful blindness provided the relevant factual matrix warrants such a
                        finding <em>and</em> the accused deliberately decides
                        to turn a blind eye ... What is of vital significance, in our view, is the
                        substance of the matter which (in turn) depends heavily upon the <em>precise facts</em> before the court. It is equally
                        important to note that in order for wilful blindness to be established, the
                        appropriate level of suspicion (as just discussed) is a necessary, but not
                        sufficient, condition, inasmuch as that level of suspicion <em>must then lead to a refusal to investigate further</em>,
                        thus resulting in "blind eye knowledge" (see also the second quotation from
                        the article by Wasik &amp; Thompson at [127] below).</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">126    That having been said, the requirement of
                            <em>suspicion</em> is nevertheless a vital (and,
                        indeed, threshold) one. So, for example, if the accused makes merely token
                        inquiries because he suspects that making more substantive inquiries might
                        lead him to the truth which he does not want to know, that is wilful
                        blindness. If the factual matrix was such that the accused ought to have
                        been suspicious, the court must then consider the accused's reasons for not
                        making further inquiries. We will come to this point below but it suffices
                        to state at this juncture that a court would be well justified in thinking
                        that the reason why an accused refused to make further inquiries may be
                        because he or she was virtually certain that if further inquiries were made,
                        his or her suspicions would be confirmed ...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">127    We would venture to state a third central
                        principle... is imperative, in order to avoid any unnecessary confusion,
                        that we emphasise, once again, that wilful blindness is a combination of
                        suspicion <em>coupled with</em> a <em>deliberate</em> decision not to make further inquiries, whereas
                        the recklessness that has been referred to by Prof Williams refers to
                        recklessness in terms of the accused’s conduct in the context of
                        circumstances <em>which would not otherwise have aroused
                            suspicion</em> on the part of the accused …</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">128    Finally, a fourth central principle is that
                        whether or not a presumption (here, of knowledge) under the Act is <em>rebutted</em> (on a balance of probabilities …
                        depends, in the final analysis, on <em>the precise factual
                            matrix</em> concerned ...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">129 Indeed, in the context of the doctrine of wilful blindness, while some
                        illustrations may be helpful, it is nevertheless imperative to note that,
                        owing to the intensely factual nature of the inquiry, they cannot be
                        representative, let alone comprehensive. Generally speaking, if an accused
                        has had his or her suspicions aroused in the manner set out at [125] above,
                        the accused can still rebut the relevant presumption under s 18 of the Act
                        by demonstrating that he or she took reasonable steps to investigate by
                        making further inquiries that were appropriate to the circumstances ...
                        However, to the extent that the Judge later suggests that it would be wrong
                        to convict accused persons <em>solely</em> on the basis
                        that they had failed to make proper inquiries … we would respectfully
                        disagree with such a suggestion ... Wilful blindness <em>cannot</em> be equated with virtual certainty for, as already
                        explained above, this would be to equate wilful blindness with actual
                        knowledge in its purest form. The result would be to erase the doctrine of
                        wilful blindness from the legal landscape altogether ...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">130    Situations such as that which exists on the
                        facts of the present appeal underscore this point since the accused already
                        knows that he or she is carrying controlled drugs and surely cannot rely
                            <em>merely</em> on the fact that he or she had
                        asked for assurances that the controlled drugs concerned were not of a
                        nature which carried the death penalty. If the accused chooses to take an
                        enormous (indeed, deadly) risk and proceed without establishing the true
                        nature of the drugs he or she is carrying, that constitutes, in our view,
                        wilful blindness ...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">132    However, as we have
                            emphasised, the possible factual scenarios are far too many to admit of
                            blanket propositions and, hence, the decision of the court in a given
                            case will have to depend on the precise facts, the evidence adduced as
                            well as the credibility of the witnesses themselves (not least the
                            accused) (this was also, as we have seen in the preceding paragraph, the
                            apparent position ultimately adopted by the Judge in the court below).
                            To reiterate an obvious (but important) example, where the accused has
                            had the controlled drugs slipped into a bag without his or her
                            knowledge, it is clear that no offence under the Act would have been
                            committed (see, once again, the passage by Lord Parker CJ in
                                <em>Lockyer v Gibb</em> … ). Where, to
                            take another example, the accused is asked by a close family member to
                            carry a box containing controlled drugs on the understanding that the
                            box (wrapped up, say, in ribbons) contains a cake which is to be
                            delivered to another close relative, there might be a strong case for
                            arguing that the accused could not be said to be wilfully blind because
                            the circumstances ought not to have aroused his or her suspicions, let
                            alone entailed further investigation. Again, however, much would (to
                            reiterate an extremely important point) depend on the precise facts,
                            evidence as well as credibility of the witnesses (especially the
                            accused).</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">133    Given our views on
                            actual knowledge as well as wilful blindness (which is, in law, a form
                            of actual knowledge), it is unnecessary, in our view, to consider other
                            forms of knowledge. In particular, and here we agree with the Judge, it
                            is <em>inappropriate</em> to include <em>constructive</em> knowledge as falling within the
                            ambit of s 18(2) of the Act. However, given the objective approach
                            that this (indeed, any) court must adopt <em>as well
                                as</em> the very factual nature of the inquiry itself, we
                            should emphasise that <em>there might be occasions when
                                the line between actual and constructive knowledge might be
                                blurred</em> (this may particularly be the case in so far as
                            (in the nature of things) the application of the doctrine of wilful
                            blindness is concerned). Indeed, as Scott LJ (as he then was)
                            perceptively observed in the English Court of Appeal decision of
                                <em>Polly Peck International plc v Nadir (No
                                2)</em> [1992] 4 All ER 769 (at 777):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">The various categories of mental state identified in <em>Baden’s</em> case are not rigid categories with
                            clear and precise boundaries. <em>One category may merge
                                imperceptibly into another</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis in original]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     It is clear that the CA considered wilful
                    blindness to be the <em>legal</em> but not <em>actual</em> equivalent to actual knowledge. In any case, I
                    was of the view that Somchit was not wilfully blind as to the nature of the
                    drug. I noted that Somchit had asked Quek what the drug was, to which he replied
                    that it was a “not serious” drug. I further noted that Somchit had
                    testified that, had Quek told her that the drugs were medicinal, or not illegal,
                    she would not have believed him. This showed that Somchit was not blindly
                    willing to accept anything Quek said – she had considered his
                    representations, and given the nature of their relationship, I found that
                    Somchit had a <em>genuine belief</em> that the drugs she
                    dealt with were “not serious”. This was therefore different from a
                    situation where there was “suspicion <em>coupled
                        with</em> a <em>deliberate</em> decision not to
                    make further inquiries” (see [127] of <em>Tan Kiam
                        Peng</em>). I found that although Somchit was initially suspicious of
                    the nature of the drugs Quek dealt with, her suspicions were allayed when Quek
                    told her that the drugs were “not serious”. The decision not to
                    make further inquiries was therefore a result of her trust in Quek (along with
                    her reasonable belief that Quek had no reason to lie to her since he had already
                    readily admitted to her that the white substance was an illegal drug), and not a
                    refusal to investigate further to avoid her suspicions being
                confirmed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     In view of the foregoing, I believed
                    Somchit’s defence that she believed that the drug was a “not
                    serious drug” and therefore found that Somchit had succeeded in proving,
                    on a balance of probability, that she did not know the nature of the drug the
                    subject of the charge against her. I therefore acquitted her of the
                    charge.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     However, as Somchit had intended to traffic in
                    a “not serious drug”, and the evidence supported it, I exercised
                    my power under s 175(2) of the CPC and convicted Somchit of the following
                    charge:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">That you, Phuthita Somchit, on or about the 3<sup>rd</sup>
                        day of October 2008 in Singapore, did attempt to traffic in a controlled
                        drug under Class C of the First Schedule to the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap
                        185) (“the Act”), without any authorisation under the Act or
                        the Regulations made thereunder, to wit, by having in your possession of not
                        less than 62.14 grams of diamorphine at Block 21 Bedok Reservoir View
                        #01-02, Aquarius by the Park, Singapore, which you believed was a controlled
                        drug as defined in section 2 of the Act, for the purpose of trafficking, an
                        offence under section 5(1)(a) read with section 5(2) and section 12 of the
                        Act, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under section 33
                        of the Act.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     In my view, although Somchit admitted to an
                    intention to traffic a “not serious drug”, it could not be proven
                    beyond a reasonable doubt that the “not serious drug” she intended
                    to traffic was a Class A or Class B drug. However, since Somchit admitted to her
                    intentions and her knowledge that the white substance was an illegal drug, I
                    found that she must have intended, at the very least, to traffic a Class C
                    drug.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     After hearing counsel’s submissions on
                    sentencing, I sentenced Somchit to 9 years’ imprisonment, for the reason
                    that Somchit had participated in the offence over a period of a month and was
                    actively involved in packing the drugs, taking orders and had not only recruited
                    Winai for the operation but had also directed him in conducting
                it.</p>

<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Evidence against Quek</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     I now turn to the evidence against Quek. Quek
                    was arrested on 3 October 2008 at about 7.45pm. At about 8.45pm, CNB
                    officers raided the Bedok Condominium using keys that had been found on
                    Quek’s person. As noted above, the seized drugs were found in the Bedok
                    Condominium (also see SAF above at <a href="#p1_2">[2]</a>).</p>

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">33    ... In the white bag, there is a paper carton box.
                            Inside the paper box, I am told there are 2 packets of granular
                            substance and 17 plastic packets each containing 5 packets of granular
                            substance. These are all heroin and I wish to say that these heroin are
                            meant for sale ...</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     The Bedok Condominium was tenanted to one
                    “Lim Chay Yong”, who was in fact Quek (Quek also stated in his
                    statement recorded on 7 October 2008 that at the time of his arrest,
                    he was staying at a Bedok Condominium which he rented). By virtue of
                    s 18(1)(c) of the Act, Quek was presumed to have the seized drugs in
                    possession. In any case, it was not necessary to rely on the presumption under
                    s 18(1)(c). Quek admitted in his statements that the drugs belonged to him.
                    By virtue of s 18(2), Quek would be presumed to have known the nature of
                    the drugs. However, again it was unnecessary to rely on this presumption. It was
                    clear from his statements that Quek knew that the drugs were heroin. Likewise,
                    from his statements, Quek’s intention to traffic the drugs was
                    apparent.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     The evidence against Quek was corroborated by
                    both Somchit and Winai. Somchit testified that she resided in the Bedok
                    Condominium with Quek<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_20" id="Ftn_20_1"><sup>[note: 20]</sup></a></span>. Somchit also testified that it was Quek who
                    procured the seized drugs<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_21" id="Ftn_21_1"><sup>[note: 21]</sup></a></span> and that she had packed the drugs found
                    in the Nokia Box for Quek’s customers<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_22" id="Ftn_22_1"><sup>[note: 22]</sup></a></span>. Likewise, Winai testified that Quek had
                    instructed him to deliver white substances to customers.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_23" id="Ftn_23_1"><sup>[note: 23]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">My finding in relation to Quek</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     Quek elected to remain silent upon his defence
                    being called and did not call any witness to give evidence on his behalf.
                    Evidence of possession and knowledge by prosecution witnesses and Somchit were
                    not disputed by Quek’s counsel in cross-examination. From the evidence of
                    the events from the time of Quek’s arrest to the search in the Bedok
                    Condominium, I found that there was sufficient evidence to prove beyond
                    reasonable doubt that Quek had possession and knowledge. Counsel for Quek
                    submitted that there was no evidence before the court that showed that Quek had
                    possession of the drugs the subject of the charge for the purpose of
                    trafficking. Counsel argued that while there was evidence that Quek had sold
                    drugs in earlier transactions, those drugs were not the subject of the charge. I
                    did not agree with this submission for two reasons. Firstly, the presumption of
                    trafficking in s 17 of the Act was available to the prosecution as the
                    amount in question, 62.14 grams of diamorphine, was more than the threshold of 2
                    grams under that provision. Secondly and more importantly, Quek had packed the
                    drugs in question for the purpose of selling them. The drugs in question were
                    his stocks in his continuing narcotic drug retailing operation. There was
                    therefore ample basis for finding that Quek had intended to traffic the drugs
                    the subject of the charge.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     However, in view of my finding that Somchit
                    did not have knowledge, I exercised my power under s 163(1) of the CPC to
                    amend the charge against Quek to the following:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">That you, Quek Hock Lye, on or about the 3<sup>rd</sup>
                        day of October 2008 in Singapore, together with one Winai Phutthaphan, were
                        parties to a criminal conspiracy, and in such capacity, agreed and engaged
                        with one another to do an illegal act, namely, to traffic in diamorphine, a
                        controlled drug specified in Class A of the First Schedule to the Misuse of
                        Drugs Act (Cap 185) (“the Act”), without any authorisation
                        under the Act or the Regulations made thereunder, whereby you were in
                        possession of not less than 62.14 grams of diamorphine at Block 21 Bedok
                        Reservoir View #01-02, Aquarius by the Park, Singapore, for the purpose of
                        trafficking in pursuance of the said conspiracy, an offence under section
                        5(1)(a) read with section 5(2) of the Act, and you have thereby committed an
                        offence punishable under section 120B of the Penal Code (Cap 224) read with
                        sections 12 and 33 of the Act.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     Pursuant to s 163(2) of the CPC, this
                    altered charge was read and explained to Quek. Pursuant to s 164(1), Quek
                    was called upon to plead thereto and to state whether he was ready to be tried
                    on the altered charge. He claimed trial and stated that he was ready to be tried
                    on the altered charge. Pursuant to s 167 of the CPC, I invited Quek and the
                    prosecution to state whether they wished to recall or re-summon and examine with
                    reference to the altered charge any witness who may have been examined. Both
                    responded that they did not require to recall any witness. I asked Quek if he
                    wished to call any new witnesses and whether he wished to give evidence in
                    relation to the altered charge and he replied to both in the negative. I was of
                    the view that, as there was no material difference between the altered charge
                    and the original charge that would require recalling any witness or calling any
                    new witness, the trial on the altered charge could proceed without any prejudice
                    to Quek.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     I proceeded to examine the evidence against
                    Quek on the altered charge and upon evaluating all the evidence in the trial and
                    submissions of counsel, I found that the evidence was sufficient to prove beyond
                    reasonable doubt his guilt in relation to the altered charge, convicted him and
                    sentenced him to death, which is the mandatory punishment under the
                    charge.</p>
