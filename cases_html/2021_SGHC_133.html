SHSY’s joinder applications present two questions which are novel, at least in Singapore. Both questions lie at the intersection of company law and procedural law. The first question is whether the intended defendant in proposed derivative proceedings may be joined under O 15 r 6(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) as a party to the s 216A application which seeks leave to bring the derivative proceedings. The second question is, if so, whether the intended defendant may be so joined even after the court has granted the leave.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">4 SHSY advances three arguments in support of its joinder applications. First, the intended defendant in proposed derivative proceedings has an obvious interest in the subject-matter and outcome of the s 216A application. SHSY therefore satisfies the requirements for joinder set out in O 15 r 6(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>). Second, even though I have already granted Reignwood the leave which it sought, the s 216A applications have not yet concluded. Therefore, I continue to have the power under O 15 r 6(2) to join SHSY as a party to the s 216A applications. Third, SHSY is not to blame for bringing its joinder applications only after I had granted leave to Reignwood. Reignwood deliberately concealed the s 216A applications from SHSY and misled SHSY to prevent SHSY from opposing them.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">5 Reignwood advances two arguments in response to SHSY. First, these s 216A application concluded when I granted the leave to Reignwood or, at the very latest, when the time expired for the Opus Tiber Companies to appeal against my grant of leave. Therefore, I no longer have any power under O 15 r 6(2) to join SHSY to the s 216A applications. Second, the subject matter of the s 216A applications  – leave to bring proposed derivative proceedings under s 216A(2) of the Act – raises only issues which are  internal to the company and which are no concern of the intended defendant in the proposed derivative proceedings. Therefore, SHSY cannot satisfy the requirements of O 15 r 6(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>).

</div>
</div> That is not correct. No doubt the Rules of Court are built on the fundamental conception of fairness. But they give effect to that conception by setting out specific statutory procedures that a person must follow and specific statutory requirements that it must satisfy in order to secure a desired procedural result. The overarching consideration on an application under O 15 r 6(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) is therefore whether the party applying to be joined satisfies O 15 r 6(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>). Fairness is just one element of that consideration. It is not the overarching consideration.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 Second, SHSY suggests that a person can satisfy O 15 r 6(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) merely by showing that joinder is “necessary” or that joinder is “just and convenient”.

</div> I reject this submission also.

I do so because that is the word which s 216A itself uses to describe a person who has standing to bring an application under that section. A complainant will typically be a member of the company who is to be the plaintiff in the derivative proceedings. But as Reignwood’s s 216A applications demonstrate, that will not always be the case (see [29] above). Section 216A(1)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) gives standing to any person whom the court considers a “proper person” to bring a s 216A application against a company.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 Second, the parties in the application before me use the word “intervene” and its cognate expressions throughout their written and oral submissions to describe what SHSY seeks to do by these four joinder applications. In fact, O 15 does not empower the court to allow a person to “intervene” in proceedings at all. The word “intervene” appears nowhere in O 15. What O 15 empowers the court to do is only to sever, add or join <span class="font-italic">parties</span> to proceedings.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 There are only two kinds of person whom the Rules of Court call an “intervener”: (a) a person who secures leave under O 70 r 16(2) to intervene in an action <span class="font-italic">in rem</span> on the basis that it has an interest in the property against which that action is brought or in money representing the proceeds of sale of that property; and (b) a person who secures leave to intervene in a probate action under O 72 r 4. A person who applies to be joined as a party to proceedings under O 15 r 6(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) is in neither category. That person therefore is not, strictly speaking, an “intervener”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 The distinction is not merely one of semantics. An intervener in the strict sense of the word does not, simply by intervening, become a party to the proceedings in which it intervenes for all purposes. A person who is joined to proceedings under O 15 r 6(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) does, simply by the joinder, become a party to those proceedings for all purposes. Further, the effect of the joinder relates back to the date on which the plaintiff commenced the proceedings (see [75]–[76] below). Having said that, however, it probably does no harm to use the word “intervene” in connection with joinder under O 15 r 6(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) so long as this distinction is always borne in mind.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 I now deal with the four questions in turn.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Existence of the power</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 On the first question (see [39(a)] above), the following two propositions are common ground. First, the court has no power to order a party to be joined to proceedings after the proceedings have concluded: <span class="font-italic">Ernest Ferdinand </span>([38] above) at [195]. Second, proceedings are not concluded so long as something remains to be done in the proceedings: <span class="font-italic">Ernest Ferdinand </span>at [198], citing <span class="font-italic">The Duke of Buccleuch </span>[1892] P 201.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 What is not common ground is the nature of that “something” which must remain to be done in order to prevent the proceedings from being concluded and thereby to keep alive the court’s power to order joinder.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 The relevant chronology is as follows: (a) I made the s 216A orders in May 2019; (b) the time for the Opus Tiger Companies to appeal against those orders expired in June 2019; (c) the Opus Tiger Companies filed the Directions Applications on 18 October 2019; and (d) SHSY filed its joinder applications on 31 October 2019.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The parties’ arguments</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 Reignwood’s argument on the first question is as follows. The s 216A applications concluded either in May 2019, when I made the s 216A orders, or at the very latest, in June 2019 when the Opus Tiger Companies allowed the time for appealing against those orders to expire without appealing. In either event, the s 216A orders were final well before October 2019, when SHSY applied to be joined. The s 216A applications have therefore concluded. SHSY has failed to bring its joinder applications “at any stage of the [s 216A] proceedings” within the meaning of O 15 r 6(2).

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 SHSY’s argument in response is as follows. Even after a court makes a final order in proceedings, there will often be issues which the court has to deal with before those proceedings conclude. These issues include assessing damages, levying execution, making orders in aid of enforcement and giving directions on how to implement the court’s orders.

</div> In this case, the fact that the Opus Tiger Companies have taken out the Directions Applications show that there indeed remains something to be done in the s 216A applications. SHSY has therefore applied for joinder “at any stage of the [s 216A] proceedings”. The power to join SHSY to the s 216A applications under O 15 r 6(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) remains alive.

</div></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The orthodox principle or a more liberal standard?</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 The phrase “at any stage of the proceedings” in O 15 r 6(2) has been part of the rules of civil procedure governing joinder in England, the ultimate source of our Rules of Court, since the Victorian era. The <span class="font-italic">locus classicus</span> in both England and Singapore on the interpretation of this phrase is the decision of the English Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">The</span> <span class="font-italic">Duke of Buccleuch</span>. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 In <span class="font-italic">The</span> <span class="font-italic">Duke of Buccleuch</span>, a cargo-owner applied to have itself joined to an action as the plaintiff in place of its agent after the defendant had been adjudged liable for a collision at sea. Lord Esher MR (at 211) and Fry LJ (at 212) held that the judgment on liability did not conclude the action because damages had yet to be assessed. As Fry LJ put it, proceedings are not concluded so long as “anything remains to be done in the case”. The cargo-owner’s application was therefore allowed.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 In <span class="font-italic">Ernest </span><span class="font-italic">Ferdinand</span>, the Court of Appeal held (at [198]) that <span class="font-italic">T</span><span class="font-italic">he Duke of Buccleuch</span> represented the current state of Singapore law on the meaning of the phrase “at any stage of the proceedings” in O 15 r 6(2): </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">198  We … find that <span class="font-italic">The Duke of Buccleuch</span> does represent the current state of the law in Singapore in so far as the existence of the power to order joinder post-judgment is concerned – <span class="font-italic">viz</span>, it exists if and only if something remains to be done in the matter, such as the assessment of damages.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">The Court of Appeal called this “the orthodox <span class="font-italic">Duke of Buccleuch</span> principle” (at [201]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 The orthodox <span class="font-italic">Duke of Buccleuch</span> principle holds that proceedings conclude for the purpose of the rules relating to joinder as soon as the court makes an order or enters judgment which determines with finality the entire <span class="font-italic">lis</span> between the parties to the proceedings. In an ordinary writ action for damages, the court determines the entire <span class="font-italic">lis</span> with finality when it enters the last judgment which, when taken with any preceding interlocutory judgments, fully determines both liability and quantum. Of course, there is no scope for any bifurcation in a s 216A application. Thus, on the orthodox <span class="font-italic">Duke of Buccleuch</span> principle, a s 216A application concludes as soon as the court makes an order determining with finality whether the complainant is or is not to be granted leave under s 216A(2) of the Act.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 The Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Ernest Ferdinand</span> recognised, however, that the English authorities have gone beyond the orthodox <span class="font-italic">Duke of Buccleuch</span> principle and established a more liberal standard in English law for determining when proceedings are concluded for the purposes of joinder. The more liberal standard holds that proceedings do not conclude upon a final order or judgment disposing of the entire <span class="font-italic">lis</span> between the parties. Instead, the proceedings continue until the final order or judgment has been fully performed or satisfied. Thus, in an ordinary writ action resulting in a money judgment for damages, the proceedings – and therefore the court’s power to order joinder – continue until the judgment is fully satisfied.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 The application of the orthodox <span class="font-italic">Duke of Buccleuch</span> principle sufficed for the Court of Appeal to dispose of the appeal in <span class="font-italic">Ernest Ferdinand</span> (at [201]). The Court of Appeal thus held that it was unnecessary for it to decide whether the more liberal standard should be recognised in Singapore law. It expressly left that issue to be “explored on an appropriate occasion” (at [201]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60  The parties’ arguments on the first question require me to decide whether it is the orthodox <span class="font-italic">Duke of Buccleuch</span> principle or the more liberal standard which represents Singapore law on the meaning of “at any stage of the proceedings” in O 15 r 6(2). If it is the orthodox <span class="font-italic">Duke of Buccleuch</span> principle, SHSY’s joinder applications fail at the first stage of the <span class="font-italic">Ernest Ferdinand</span> inquiry (see [39(a)] above). On the other hand, if it is the more liberal standard, SHSY succeeds at the first stage.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 As the Court of Appeal made clear in <span class="font-italic">Ernest Ferdinand</span> (at [201]), it is not the <span class="font-italic">ratio</span> of that case that Singapore law does not recognise the more liberal standard. I am therefore not obliged by <span class="font-italic">stare decisis</span> to reject SHSY’s arguments on the first question. I am conscious, however, that the Court of Appeal did express serious doubts about the desirability of recognising the more liberal standard, calling it a “bold proposition” (at [200]) with “troubling implications for finality in litigation” (at [201]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 Even bearing those points in mind, I consider with respect that Singapore law should recognise the more liberal standard. I say that for three reasons: (a) it is correct as a matter of statutory interpretation; (b) it permits the court to take a more pragmatic approach to joinder; and (c) it is the more conceptually appropriate approach to joinder.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 I deal with each reason in turn.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Statutory interpretation</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 The Rules of Court are subsidiary legislation. Section 9A of the Interpretation Act (Cap 1, 2002 Rev Ed) establishes that the starting point for ascertaining the meaning of O 15 r 6(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) is the ordinary meaning of its words, taking into account its context: <span class="font-italic">Tan Cheng Bock v Attorney-General</span> [2017] 2 SLR 850 at [37].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 The ordinary meaning of the phrase “at any stage of the proceedings” is wide enough to accommodate the more liberal standard. The words “any stage” are words of unrestrained width. Further, the word “proceedings” is not a legal term of art. Instead, it is a protean word, whose meaning depends on the context in which it is used. I therefore turn to consider that context.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 The purpose of O 15 r 6 is set out very clearly in O 15 r 6(1): to prevent civil proceedings from being defeated by misjoinder or nonjoinder of parties. The purpose of O 15 r 6 is therefore to give the court a wide discretion to deal with misjoinder and nonjoinder by elevating substance and pragmatism over form and technicality. In that context, the intent of the phrase “at any stage of the proceedings” is clearly to expand the scope of the power under O 15 r 6(2) so as to advance its purpose rather than to restrict that scope. In other words, the intent of the phrase is to eliminate technical arguments about whether or not proceedings are concluded rather than to generate such arguments.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 This suggests to me that the phrase “at any stage of the proceedings” should be interpreted with an inclination towards keeping the court’s power under O 15 r 6(2) alive, to ensure that it can be exercised whenever issues of misjoinder and nonjoinder can arise. Those issues may arise whenever there remains an avenue for the parties to return to the court for its assistance even after the <span class="font-italic">lis</span> between the parties has been fully and finally determined. This in turn suggests to me that the phrase ought to be given the widest meaning which remains consistent with its ordinary meaning. That widest meaning is the more liberal standard.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 Thus, in my view, the more liberal standard is the correct interpretation of the phrase “at any stage of the proceedings” in O 15 r 6(2) because it is the interpretation which better advances the purpose of O 15 r 6(2).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Pragmatic considerations</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 That leads me to my second reason for preferring the more liberal standard: pragmatism. The case which the Court of Appeal cited in <span class="font-italic">Ernest Ferdinand</span> ([38] above) as establishing the more liberal standard in English law is the decision of Aikens J (as he then was) in <span class="font-italic">C Inc plc v L</span> [2001] Lloyd’s Rep 459 (“<span class="font-italic">C Inc</span>”). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 The facts of <span class="font-italic">C</span><span class="font-italic"> Inc</span> are an excellent example of the pragmatic advantages of the more liberal standard. In that case, a plaintiff secured final judgment against a defendant. When the plaintiff attempted to enforce the judgment, the defendant claimed that she held all of her known assets on trust for her husband. The plaintiff therefore applied to join the husband as a party to the proceedings in order to seek a post-judgment <span class="font-italic">Mareva</span> injunction against him in aid of execution.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">71 Aikens J held that “the word ‘proceedings’ should be given a broad interpretation … [and] should embrace all stages of an action from the time it has been started until it becomes finally complete or moribund”. As Aikens J pointed out in <span class="font-italic">C Inc</span> (at [83]), there are any number of reasons the court’s assistance may be needed even after a final judgment has been entered:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… There are many ‘proceedings’ in which a judgment is obtained but it is not satisfied. At that stage further action may be needed in order to enforce the judgment. The ‘proceedings’ have not finished at that point. A claimant may wish to appoint a receiver by way of equitable execution to get in the assets of the defendant to satisfy the judgment. Or he may wish to obtain a freezing order in aid of execution. The ‘proceedings’ must still be continuing in those instances. In my view the ‘proceedings’ against [the defendant] are still continuing.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">Aikens J therefore joined the husband as a party to the proceedings and granted the<span class="font-italic"> </span><span class="font-italic">Mareva</span> injunction against him.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">72 I consider it almost certain that if a case like <span class="font-italic">C Inc</span> came before our courts, we would incline towards Aikens J’s pragmatic approach. On the facts of <span class="font-italic">C Inc</span>, it would be the height of technicality to decline joinder – and thereby to decline post-judgment relief against a non-party in aid of execution – simply because the court had already entered final judgment against the defendant.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">73 It may be said that the application of the more liberal standard in <span class="font-italic">C Inc</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>is not surprising. <span class="font-italic">C Inc</span> was a case in which it was the <span class="font-italic">plaintiff</span> who was asking the court to join an additional <span class="font-italic">defendant</span> to the proceedings. In that sense, the outcome of <span class="font-italic">C Inc</span> is merely an application of the general principle that it is the plaintiff’s prerogative to choose its defendants (see [91] below). <span class="font-italic">C Inc</span> was not a case, such as the present, in which a person was asking to be joined as a party <span class="font-italic">against</span> the plaintiff’s wishes.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">74 I do not consider that that distinction of fact makes any difference of principle. Whether joinder is consistent with or contrary to the plaintiff’s wishes has no bearing on the meaning of the phrase “at any stage of the proceedings”. Proceedings are either concluded or not concluded. The outcome of that inquiry is independent of who it is who is seeking the joinder. Thus, Aikens J interpreted the phrase in<span class="font-italic"> C Inc</span> on its own, in terms independent of who was seeking the joinder. So too, O 15 r 6(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) is framed in terms which are independent of who is seeking the joinder. A plaintiff’s attitude towards joinder is, at most, a factor which goes to the discretionary assessment at the second stage of the <span class="font-italic">Ernest Ferdinand</span> inquiry, not to the first stage.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Conceptual considerations</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">75 My third reason for preferring the more liberal standard is related to the first two reasons. I must, of course, accept the Court of Appeal’s valid concerns expressed in <span class="font-italic">Ernest Ferdinand</span> about facilitating an overly broad approach to misjoinder and nonjoinder. A person, once joined under O 15 r 6(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>), becomes a party to the proceedings for all purposes. It is entitled to behave, and is liable to be treated, just like any other party. Therefore, it can make a claim or defend one. It can make a counterclaim or defend one. It can bring an interlocutory application or oppose one. It can secure a final judgment in its favour or suffer one against it. It can be awarded costs or be ordered to pay costs.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">76 Further, the joinder does not operate only prospectively. It relates back to the commencement of the proceedings. The joined party is therefore treated as though the plaintiff had named it as a party from the outset. The relation back can defeat the effect of an expired limitation period. It can permit a joined party to appeal against orders made before it was joined. If the joined party is out of time to appeal, it can apply for an extension of time. That is one of SHSY’s objectives in seeking to be joined to these originating summonses (see [35] above).

</div>
</div>
</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">77 I accept that joining a party to proceedings creates an unintended and undesirable risk to finality in litigation. But I do not accept that it is conceptually appropriate to place the entire strain of addressing this risk on the interpretation of the phrase “at any stage of the proceedings”. The intent of that phrase, as I have found, is to expand the court’s power of joinder rather than to restrict it. It is far more appropriate that the strain of addressing this risk falls: (a) on the interpretation of the non-discretionary requirements for severance and joinder under O 15 r 6(2); (b) on the discretionary assessment of whether to order severance and joinder under O 15 r 6(2); and (c) on the principles which govern the application which actually and directly poses a risk to finality in litigation.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">78 SHSY’s objectives for seeking joinder illustrate my point (see [35] above). One of its objectives is to seek an extension of time to appeal against the s 216A orders. Any such application carries precisely the “troubling implications for finality in litigation” which caused the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Ernest Ferdinand</span> (at [201]) to express grave misgivings about the more liberal standard. But SHSY would, I think, readily accept that it will face an uphill task in at least two respects: (a) on the discretionary assessment for joinder, if its <span class="font-italic">only</span> objective in seeking joinder were to reverse the s 216A orders; and (b) if it is joined, on its application to extend time to appeal against the s 216A orders. No doubt, SHSY would insist bravely that it can and will crest both hills. But that does not detract from my conceptual point as to where the strain of addressing that risk should fall.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">79 The desire to prevent an unintended and undesirable consequence of joinder should not result in an artificially narrow interpretation of the phrase “any stage of the proceedings”, contrary to its ordinary meaning. After all, there is a risk even now that the Opus Tiger Companies will themselves seek an extension of time to appeal against the s 216A orders. Any such application would have equally troubling implications for finality in litigation. But those implications are addressed by the principles which govern an application for an extension of time to file an appeal. The risk that SHSY will pose to finality, if joined, is no different conceptually from the risk which the Opus Tiger Companies now pose to finality. The principles which govern the application to extend time for appeal suffice to address and mitigate that risk, whoever it is who is posing it.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">80 In conclusion, for the foregoing reasons, it is my view that the more liberal standard best advances the purpose of O 15 r 6(2) by focusing the inquiry on the merits of the joinder application rather than on the technical question as to whether the proceedings in which the joinder application is made are or are not concluded. I therefore consider with respect that the more liberal standard represents Singapore law on the meaning of “at any stage of the proceedings” in O 15 r 6(2).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">81 I now turn to consider how the more liberal standard should be applied to a s 216A application. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Applying the more liberal standard to a s 216 application </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">82 If the court <span class="font-italic">dismisses</span> a s 216A application, the difference between the orthodox <span class="font-italic">Duke of Buccleuch</span> principle and the more liberal standard is of little relevance. Once the application is dismissed, there is no longer anything which remains to be done in the proceedings, save perhaps in connection with enforcing or levying execution on the relatively small sum which may have been awarded as costs. It is thus fair to say that, even on the more liberal standard, the court’s power to join a party to a s 216A application comes to an end for all intents and purposes when it dismisses the s 216A application.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">83 However, if a court <span class="font-italic">allows</span> a s 216A application, the more liberal standard permits the court’s power to order joinder to continue even after it makes the order granting the leave and even though that order is final. In these circumstances, just as in an ordinary civil suit such as<span class="font-italic"> </span><span class="font-italic">C Inc</span> ([69]<span class="font-italic"> </span>above), something remains to be done in the s 216A application. In fact, the position on a s 216A application is <span class="font-italic">a fortiori</span> the position on an ordinary civil suit. A civil suit ends with one or more judgments which, taken together, fully and finally determine the parties’ substantive rights and liabilities. A s 216A application does not end in a judgment and does not address the parties’ substantive rights and liabilities. The effect of a s 216A order is purely procedural. It merely clothes the complainant with the statutory authority conferred by s 216A to bring derivative proceedings against the intended defendant in the name of the company.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">84 For these reasons, there is even greater potential for the court’s continued involvement in a s 216A application after it makes an order granting leave than in an ordinary civil suit. The court’s continued involvement can arise in two ways. First, as SHSY points out,
                   <sup><button class="btn btn-link superscript-btn" data-target="#fn-c3bbf19c-6968-4e4d-bf91-2781a0470333" data-toggle="modal" type="button">45</button></sup>

</div> a successful complainant has a right on a purposive interpretation of s 216A(5)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the Act to return to the court for orders which are “necessary for the derivative action to be brought in a fair manner for adjudication by the court at a trial, whether or not there [are] specific directions in the leave order to that effect”: <span class="font-italic">Lew </span><span class="font-italic">Kiat Beng v Hiap Seng &amp; Co Pte Ltd and another appeal </span>[2012] 1 SLR 488 (“<span class="font-italic">Lew </span><span class="font-italic">Kiat Beng</span>”)<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [29]. Second, an order granting a complainant leave to commence derivative proceedings may expressly give the parties liberty to apply. That liberty will not, of course, allow the parties to return to court to vary or reverse the order. But a liberty to apply does allow the parties to return to court for directions on interpreting or implementing the order.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">85 In any event, the critical point on the more liberal standard is that there is clear potential for the court’s continued involvement in a s 216A application even after the final order granting the complainant leave to commence the derivative proceedings. That potential comes to an end only when the derivative proceedings themselves are concluded. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">86 For these reasons, therefore, I consider that a successful s 216A application does not conclude for the purposes of the court’s power to order joinder so long as the derivative proceedings themselves have not concluded.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Applying the more liberal standard to the facts of this case</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">87 Applying the more liberal standard to the facts of this case, I hold that SHSY has brought its joinder applications “at any stage of the proceedings” as required by O 15 r 6(2).

</div> I have dealt with this objection at [75]–[78] above. This is indeed an undesirable and unintended consequence of the more liberal standard. But, for the reasons I have given, the proper place to address this consequence is not in artificially restricting the meaning of “at any stage of the proceedings”. In any event, the inquiry at the first stage is whether the s 216A <span class="font-italic">proceedings</span> have concluded, not whether an <span class="font-italic">issue</span> that SHSY wishes to contest in the s 216A proceedings upon being joined has been finally decided.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">90 For these reasons, I accept that my power to join SHSY as a defendant to the s 216A applications continues to exist even though I have made final orders in Reignwood’s favour under s 216A(2) and even though the time for appealing against those orders has expired. So long as the arbitrations against SHSY have not concluded, the power of joinder remains alive. This approach puts the true focus of the court’s inquiry on a joinder application where it should lie: on the second stage of the inquiry. I therefore turn now to consider the second stage. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The non-discretionary requirements</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">91 In our adversarial system of civil procedure, the general rule is that it is plaintiff’s prerogative “to choose the person against whom to proceed, and to leave out any person against whom he does not desire to proceed”: <span class="font-italic">Singapore Civil Procedure 2020</span>, vol 1 (Chua Lee Ming gen ed) (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 10th Ed, 2019) at para 15/6/7.

</div>
</div> SHSY’s case for joinder therefore turns on whether SHSY can satisfy the non-discretionary requirements of one or both limbs of O 15 r 6(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">94 In my view, SHSY cannot satisfy the non-discretionary requirements of either limb. I consider that neither limb of O 15 r 6(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) allows a person to be joined as a defendant to a s 216A application simply because it is the intended defendant in the proposed derivative proceedings.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">95 I now analyse the non-discretionary requirements of each limb of O 15 r 6 (2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) in turn. It is easiest to carry out that analysis first on the assumption that SHSY had applied to be joined to the s 216A applications <span class="font-italic">b</span><span class="font-italic">efore</span> I made the s 216A orders. I do that for two reasons. First, nothing in O 15 r 6(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) turns on the precise stage in the proceedings at which an application for joinder is made. Second, even if I am wrong on that point, if SHSY would have been unable to satisfy the non-discretionary requirements of O 15 r 6(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) <span class="font-italic">before</span> I made the s 216A orders, it cannot be better off because it applied for joinder <span class="font-italic">after</span> I made the s 216A orders.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The necessity limb </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">96 I begin my analysis of O 15 r 6(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) with the necessity limb before turning to the just and convenient limb. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The scope of the necessity limb</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">97 A person who seeks to be joined to proceedings under the necessity limb must satisfy one of two alternative non-discretionary requirements: (a) the person must be one who ought to have been joined as a party to the proceedings; or (b) joining the person must be necessary to ensure that the court determines and adjudicates all issues in the proceedings effectually and completely.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">98 The scope of the necessity limb is narrower than the scope of the just and convenient limb (see <span class="font-italic">Singapore Court Practice 2021 </span>(Jeffrey Pinsler gen ed) (LexisNexis, 2021) at para 15/6/9). A textual analysis and a comparison of the limbs reveal three ways in which this is true.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">99 First, the necessity limb (as the term suggests) requires joinder to be <span class="font-italic">necessary</span>: <span class="font-italic">Ernest</span><span class="font-italic"> Ferdinand</span> ([38] above) at [203]. Necessity is implicit in the first alternative requirement (see [97] above): the person to be joined must be one whom the plaintiff <span class="font-italic">ought to have</span> joined from the outset of the proceedings, not merely one whom it was desirable for the plaintiff to have joined from the outset. Necessity is explicit in the second alternative requirement, as indicated by the word “necessary”. Joinder being necessary for one purpose is a narrower test than joinder being just and convenient for an analogous purpose.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">100 Second, the necessity limb requires there to be a <span class="font-italic">lis</span> between a party to the proceedings and the person to be joined. The requirement of a <span class="font-italic">lis</span> is implicit in the first alternative requirement. It cannot be said that a plaintiff ought to have joined a person to proceedings from the outset unless there is a <span class="font-italic">lis</span> between that person and the plaintiff. The requirement of a <span class="font-italic">lis</span> is explicit in the second alternative requirement, as indicated by the conjunctive use of the verbs “determine” and “adjudicate”. The verb “determine” envisages the court ascertaining or establishing disputed issues by making findings of fact or holdings of law. The verb “adjudicate” envisages the court resolving those disputed issues fully and finally by entering a formal order or judgment making those issues <span class="font-italic">res judicata</span>. No judgment can be entered between any two persons unless there is a <span class="font-italic">lis</span> between them. Both alternative requirements of the necessity limb therefore require there to be a <span class="font-italic">lis</span> between the person to be joined and a party to the proceedings. That party may not be the plaintiff. For example, the person to be joined could have a <span class="font-italic">lis</span> as against a defendant on its counterclaim against the plaintiff. In contrast, the just and convenient limb uses only the verb “determine”. It makes no reference to “adjudicate” at all. The just and convenient limb therefore does not require there to be any such <span class="font-italic">lis</span> between the person to be joined and the parties to the proceedings.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">101 Finally, only two types of persons may be joined under the necessity limb: (a) a person “who ought to have been joined as a party”; and (b) a person “whose presence before the court is necessary to ensure that all matters…may be effectually and completely determined and adjudicated upon”. Thus, building on the second point, the necessity limb applies only to: (a) a person whom the plaintiff could have and should have joined as a party to the proceedings; or (b) a person who has a <span class="font-italic">lis</span> as against a party to the proceedings to be determined <span class="font-italic">and adjudicated upon</span>. In contrast, the just and convenient limb does not restrict the person to be joined in the same way: any person may be joined under the just and convenient limb so long as the non-discretionary requirements of that limb are satisfied (see [137] below).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">102 Bearing these points in mind, it is my view that SHSY does not come within the necessity limb for three reasons: (a) SHSY is not a person whom Reignwood ought to have, in any sense, joined to the s 216A applications; (b) the s 216A applications give rise to no <span class="font-italic">lis</span> as between SHSY and either Reignwood or the Opus Tiger Companies; and (c) it is not necessary to join SHSY to the s 216A applications in order to ensure that the court determines and adjudicates completely and effectually all issues in the s 216A applications.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">103 I deal with each of these reasons in turn.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Reignwood had no obligation to name SHSY as a defendant</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">104 Section 216A is silent as to whom the complainant is to name as a defendant to a s 216A application. The company must, of course, be a defendant. Beyond that, the ordinary rule of civil procedure applies (see [91] above). It is therefore the complainant’s prerogative whom else it names as a defendant, subject only to the procedural consequences for misjoinder, including the liability to pay a misjoined party’s costs.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">105 The important point for present purposes is that s 216A does not in any way oblige a complainant to name an intended defendant as a defendant to a s 216A application. In every case, therefore, it remains the complainant’s procedural prerogative whether to do so or not. It is of course open to a complainant to name the intended defendant, or even the shareholders and the directors of the company, as defendants to a s 216A application. If the plaintiff does so, those parties have a right to be served with the application and to be heard upon it. And they would be bound directly by the s 216A order as a party, including any orders under s 216A(5) and any order as to costs. But this joinder takes place by the voluntary act of the complainant when it commences the proceedings. This joinder is thus free of the non-discretionary requirements of O 15 r 6(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>). The fact remains that s 216A itself makes clear that an intended defendant is not a person whom a plaintiff “ought to have joined” to a s 216A application within the meaning of the first alternative requirement of the necessity limb.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">106 In short, a complainant has no obligation whatsoever to name the intended defendant as a defendant to a s 216A application. SHSY is therefore not a person whom Reignwood ought to have joined to the s 216A applications. SHSY cannot satisfy the first alternative non-discretionary requirement under O 15 r 6(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">There is no lis as between SHSY and the parties</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">107 For the reasons I have set out above, the necessity limb requires there to be a <span class="font-italic">lis</span> as between the person seeking joinder and the parties to the proceedings. In my view, there is no <span class="font-italic">li</span><span class="font-italic">s</span> between an intended defendant and either the complainant or the company in a s 216A application. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">108 The sole <span class="font-italic">lis</span> in every s 216A application is whether the court ought to sanction a deviation from a fundamental principle of company law, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the principle of majority rule. That fundamental principle vests: (a) ultimate control of the company in a majority of its shareholders in general meeting; and (b) executive control of the company in a majority of its directors in a board meeting. The fundamental principle of majority rule naturally extends to the shareholders’ and the directors’ decision as to whether the company should litigate and, if so, how much of the company’s resources to commit to the litigation.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">109 The sole issue in a s 216A application is therefore whether (and if so on what terms under s 216A(5)) the court should sanction a deviation from the fundamental principle of majority rule by compelling the company to litigate contrary to the will of the majority of its shareholders and directors. As the Court of Appeal said in <span class="font-italic">Pang Yong Hock and another v PKS Contracts Services Pte Ltd</span> [2004] 3 SLR(R) 1 at [19], the legislative intention of s 216A is to provide “a procedure for the protection of genuinely aggrieved minority interests and for doing justice to a company while ensuring that the company’s directors are not unduly hampered in their management decisions by loud but unreasonable dissidents attempting to drive the corporate vehicle from the back seat”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">110 When a s 216A application is viewed that way, as I consider it must, the only persons who have a <span class="font-italic">lis</span> as against the complainant or the company are those persons whose concern it is whether the court should sanction a deviation from the fundamental principle of majority rule. Those persons can only be insiders to the company. These insiders will, of course, include the company’s other shareholders, whether majority or minority, and the company’s directors. The shareholders and the directors are, after all, the persons whose ultimate or executive control over the decision to litigate the complainant is inviting the court to override. In the case of shareholders, they are also the persons who will bear the ultimate economic consequence of committing the company’s resources to the litigation.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">111 A “proper person” within the meaning of s 216A(1)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) may also have a <span class="font-italic">lis</span> against the complainant or the company. A “proper person” can include a shareholder in the company’s parent company, like OOL. Such a person has equal standing with the complainant to bring a s 216A application and may well be able to demonstrate a direct concern in whether the court sanctions a deviation from the fundamental principle of majority rule. A “proper person” may also have a direct concern as to whom – as between itself and the complainant – the court should authorise to exercise control over that litigation and the extent to which the company’s resources should be committed to pursuing it.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">112 The authority for this analysis is <span class="font-italic">Lederer v 372116 Ontario Ltd (cob Hemispheres International Manufacturing Co)</span> (“<span class="font-italic">Lederer</span>”) [2001] OJ No. 565. <span class="font-italic">Lederer</span> is a decision of the Ontario Court of Appeal on s 246 of the Ontario Business Corporations Act, RSO 1990, c B-16 (“OBCA”). Section 246 of the OBCA is <span class="font-italic">in </span><span class="font-italic">pari materia</span> with s 216A of the Act. Indeed, s 246 was one of the models for s 216A. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">113 In <span class="font-italic">Lederer</span>, Goudge JA explained why the legislation does not contemplate an intended defendant as a participant in an application for leave to commence derivative proceedings (at [14]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… the seeking of leave to commence a derivative action under s. 246 of the Act is fundamentally a proceeding between the complainants on the one hand and the corporation and the directors on the other. The complainants seek to have the company do something which they say is in its interest but which the directors refuse to authorize. That these are the core players in the application for leave is confirmed by s. 246(2) which requires that advance notice of the complainants' intention to apply for leave be given solely to the directors of the company. There is no suggestion in s. 246 that intended defendants are to be participants in an application for leave to commence a derivative action.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">114 What is clear is that an intended defendant does not – simply because of its status as the intended defendant – have a <span class="font-italic">lis</span> of any kind against any party to a s 216A application. For the reasons I have already given, the sole issue in a s 216A application concerns only the company’s shareholders, its directors and perhaps “proper persons” within the meaning of s 216A(1)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the Act. It is not <span class="font-italic">necessary</span> for the court to <span class="font-italic">determine</span> or <span class="font-italic">adjudicate</span> – as against the intended defendant – whether to sanction a deviation from the fundamental principle of majority rule.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">115 None of the following circumstances is capable of giving rise to a <span class="font-italic">lis</span> as between an intended defendant and the complainant or the company: (a) the fact that granting the complainant leave to commence derivative proceedings against the intended defendant in the name of the company will affect the intended defendant’s economic or other interests; (b) the fact that the intended defendant can assist the court in deciding the s 216A application; or (c) the fact that the intended defendant wishes to have an early opportunity to put its defence to the derivative proceedings before the court in order to establish that those proceedings will lack merit.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">116 If any one of these circumstances sufficed in itself to satisfy the non-discretionary requirements of the necessity limb, or indeed of the just and convenient limb, then every intended defendant has a right to be joined to every s 216A application. That would directly contradict the premise of s 216A, which is that no intended defendant is entitled even to notice of the s 216A application, let alone to be joined to it as a defendant. As Griffin J said of this argument in the decision of the Supreme Court of British Columbia in <span class="font-italic">Pierce v Chalice Capital Inc</span> [2016] BCJ No. 892 (“<span class="font-italic">Pierce</span>”) (at [55]): </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">If the logic of the argument of [the intended defendant] is accepted, it would virtually mean that in all petition proceedings to commence a derivative action, the potential defendants of the derivative action should be given notice and standing. This would greatly change the character and nature of such a petition proceeding, and in my mind, for the worse and contrary to the intention of the [British Columbian Business Corporations Act] and to the interests of the efficient administration of justice.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">117 The decision in <span class="font-italic">Pierce </span>turned on ss 232 and 233 of British Columbia’s Business Corporations Act, SBC 2002, c 57 and rr 6-2(7)(b) and 6-2(7)(c) of British Columbia’s Supreme Court Civil Rules, BC Reg 168/09.<span class="font-italic"> </span>Although the British Columbian provisions are not identical to the Singapore provisions, the elements that are material to this case are sufficiently similar (see <span class="font-italic">Woon’s</span><span class="font-italic"> Corporations Law </span>(LexisNexis Singapore, 1999, April 2021 release) at para 406). The reasoning in <span class="font-italic">Pierce</span> therefore carries great force by analogy. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">118 Any one of the circumstances listed at [115] above may be grounds for a court to exercise its inherent jurisdiction to hear from the intended defendant on a s 216A application either as an indulgence to the intended defendant or to assist the court in achieving rectitude of decision. But none of these circumstances suffice to satisfy the non-discretionary requirements of the necessity limb.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">119 The structure of s 216A shows a positive legislative intent that the intended defendant’s opportunity to present its case on the merits of the derivative proceedings will come in the derivative proceedings themselves, not on the s 216A application. As Griffin J put it in <span class="font-italic">Pierce</span> (at [89]), when a plaintiff decides to sue a person in the usual way, that person has no opportunity to prevent the plaintiff from commencing suit. It would be exceptional if that person did have such a right simply because it was an intended defendant in proposed derivative proceedings. Goudge JA said much the same in <span class="font-italic">Lederer</span> (at [17]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… it is hard to see why intended defendants in a derivative action should have any earlier opportunity to stop the proceedings than defendants in other proceedings just because the derivative action requires a leave application before it is begun.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">120 For all of the foregoing reasons, I hold that a s 216A application creates no <span class="font-italic">lis</span> as between the intended defendant on the one hand and either the complainant or the company on the other. Accordingly, SHSY cannot satisfy the second alternative non-discretionary requirement under O 15 r 6(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">No matters which the court will fail to determine and adjudicate</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">121 The necessity limb requires that the person to be joined be one whose “presence before the court is necessary to ensure that all matters…may be effectually and completely determined and adjudicated upon”. To see whether an intended defendant satisfies this non-discretionary requirement of O 15 r 6(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>), it is necessary to identify the issues which a court must determine and adjudicate upon in a s 216A application.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">122 A s 216A application requires the court to adjudicate upon only one issue: whether to sanction a deviation from the fundamental principle of majority rule. In order to enliven the court’s power to adjudicate upon that single issue, s 216A requires the complainant to satisfy four conditions precedent:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) First, the complainant must establish that it comes within one of the three limbs of s 216A(1) and therefore has standing to apply for an order under s 216A(2).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Second, the complainant must establish that it has given 14 days’ notice of its intention to bring the s 216A application to the directors of the company as required by s 216A(3)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Third, the complainant must establish that it is acting in good faith within the meaning of s 216A(3)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) in bringing the s 216A application.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) Fourth, the compliant must establish that bringing, prosecuting, defending or discontinuing the proposed derivative proceedings appears to be <span class="font-italic">prima facie </span>in the company’s interests within the meaning of s 216A(3)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">123 The merits of the proposed derivative proceedings arise on a s 216A application only as a subsidiary issue on the fourth condition precedent, <span class="font-italic">ie</span> only as one factor in establishing that the proceedings will be <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> in the interests of the company. That is why the threshold for establishing the merits of the proposed derivative proceedings on a s 216A application is deliberately set low. The complainant need only show that the proceedings have a “legitimate or arguable basis” (see <span class="font-italic">Ang Thiam Swee v Low </span><span class="font-italic">Hian Chor</span> [2013] 2 SLR 340 (“<span class="font-italic">Ang Thiam Swee</span>”) at [58]). A complainant need not establish that there is a serious question to be tried let alone that the intended derivative proceedings are likely to succeed.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">124 SHSY submits that the fact that it has submissions and evidence to contradict Reignwood’s case in the s 216A applications on the third and fourth conditions precedent is sufficient to satisfy the non-discretionary requirements of the necessity limb.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">125 I do not accept this submission. First, the third and fourth conditions precedent raise considerations which are all fundamentally internal to the company. An outsider to the company has no basis to insist on being heard on whether the complainant has standing, whether the complainant is acting in good faith or whether the proposed derivative proceedings are <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> in the company’s interests. In <span class="font-italic">Pierce</span>, Griffin J surveyed the law in Ontario and Manitoba and then held as follows for British Columbia (at [66]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">In this province as in Ontario and Manitoba, the issue to be determined on an application to commence a derivative action is one between the applicant complainant and the company and the directors who refuse to commence the action. The key question, whether the lawsuit is in the best interests of the company, cannot be answered by the defendant to the proposed lawsuit who is directly adverse in interest on that question.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">126 It is only on the subsidiary issue as to the merits of the proposed derivative proceedings that an intended defendant can even hope to mount an argument that it satisfies the non-discretionary requirements of the necessity limb. Even then, I do not consider that an intended defendant is a person whose presence before the court is <span class="font-italic">necessary</span> on a s 216A application to ensure the effectual and complete determination and adjudication of whether the proposed derivative proceedings have sufficient merit. I say that for three reasons.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">127 First, whether the proposed derivative proceedings have sufficient merit is determined on a s 216A application solely for a purpose which is specific to the s 216A application and which is of no concern to the intended defendant at all. That purpose is to ascertain whether it is <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> in the interests of the company to compel it to commit its resources and its name to litigation contrary to the majority will of its shareholders and directors. It is for that reason that a complainant need only cross a deliberately low threshold to establish that the proposed derivative proceedings have sufficient merit. This is so that “only the most obviously unmeritorious claims will be culled”: <span class="font-italic">Ang Thiam Swee </span>at [55]. That is also why the court does not adjudicate factual disputes arising from the proposed derivative proceedings on a s 216A application: <span class="font-italic">Jian Li Investments Holding Pte Ltd v </span><span class="font-italic">Healthstats International Pte Ltd</span> [2019] 4 SLR 825 at [50]. The court determines whether the proposed derivative proceedings have sufficient merit at a very low threshold and only for a very specific purpose. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">128 This point can be illustrated by an example. Assume that a complainant exercises its prerogative and names an intended defendant as a party to a s 216A application. Assume also that the court determines – with the benefit of evidence and submissions from the intended defendant – that the proposed derivative proceedings do indeed have sufficient merit to help establish the complainant’s case on the fourth condition precedent. That determination is made purely for the purposes of and in the context of determining whether the complainant has established that condition precedent. The determination does not result in any <span class="font-italic">adjudication</span> as to the merits of the proposed derivative proceedings. It creates no issue estoppel or <span class="font-italic">res judicata</span> binding the intended defendant, the company or the complainant. The intended defendant remains at liberty in the derivative proceedings to present a full substantive defence to the claim. It even remains at liberty to apply to strike out the derivative proceedings under O 18 r 19 of the Rules of Court. That is simply because the court determined the sufficiency of the merits of proposed derivative proceedings on the s 216A application at an entirely different threshold and for an entirely different purpose.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">129 Now assume instead that the court determines that the proposed derivative proceedings <span class="font-italic">do</span><span class="font-italic"> not</span> have sufficient merit. That determination too does not bind the intended defendant, the company or the complainant. It gives rise to no issue estoppel or <span class="font-italic">res judicata</span> which precludes the company from pursuing the intended defendant on the same claim in the future if the majority of the company’s shareholders or directors resolve to do so. That can happen if the shareholders and directors change. It can also happen if the shareholders and directors do not change, but simply change their minds. Once again, this is simply because the court determined the sufficiency of the merits of proposed derivative proceedings on the s 216A application at an entirely different threshold and for an entirely different purpose.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">130 Second, the first point shows that joining an intended defendant to a s 216A application does not advance the purpose of O 15 r 6(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>). That purpose is to prevent a multiplicity of proceedings in order to: (a) prevent the waste of time, money and judicial resources which would result from multiple parties commencing multiple actions against each other arising from the same cause or matter; and (b) to prevent the same or substantially the same questions or issues of fact or law arising from the same cause or matter being tried twice or more before different tribunals with possibly different or conflicting results: <span class="font-italic">Wee Soon Kim Anthony v Law Society of Singapore </span>[2001] 2 SLR(R) 821 (“<span class="font-italic">Wee Soon Kim</span>”) at [19]; <span class="font-italic">Singapore Civil Procedure 2020 </span>at para 15/6/8.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">131 As I have demonstrated, there is no sense in which joining an intended defendant to a s 216A application prevents a multiplicity of proceedings. That is because the four conditions precedent (see [122] above) are not determined in a s 216A application as forensic ends in themselves but simply as the prescribed statutory rubric for enlivening the court’s jurisdiction to sanction a deviation from the fundamental principle of majority rule. Even if the intended defendant is a party to a s 216A application – whether by being named as a co-defendant from the outset or as a result of being joined under O 15 r 6(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) contrary to the complainant’s wish – none of these four conditions precedent will be determined in a way which binds the intended defendant in any adjudicatory sense, as is required by the necessity limb.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">132 For the reasons I have already given, the sole issue in a s 216A application – and the four conditions precedent for enlivening the court’s jurisdiction to adjudicate on that sole issue – is of no concern to an intended defendant. They are simply not matters on which an intended defendant can or should assist the court. As Griffin J put it in <span class="font-italic">Pierce</span> ([116] above) (at [75]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… the proposed defendant…has no direct interest in the issue to be determined on this proceeding, which is a question having to do with whether it is in the best interests of [the company] to commence the action, a director of [the company] having refused to do so. The outcome of the determination of this issue, if leave is granted, will not prejudice [the intended defendant’s] rights to defend itself in the proposed action. The proposed defendant… will be in no worse position than any other defendant sued by a corporation.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The effect of Reignwood initially joining SHSY as a party</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">133 There is one fact which may be said to complicate the analysis on the necessity limb. Even though it had no obligation to do so, Reignwood did in fact name SHSY as the second defendant in each s 216A application. Further, on 2 January 2019, Reignwood notified SHSY of the s 216A application against OT1 by pleading a reference to the application in its defence in the English litigation.

</div> However, on 3 January 2019, Reignwood applied for and secured leave to discontinue all four of the s 216A applications as against SHSY. On 7 January 2019, Reignwood filed the notices of discontinuance terminating the s 216A applications. It did so without ever having served the s 216A applications on SHSY and without informing SHSY that the applications had been discontinued.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">134 SHSY, quite correctly, does not suggest that Reignwood’s discontinuance of the s 216A applications as against SHSY is in any way procedurally defective. The result of the discontinuance is therefore that SHSY ceased to be a party to the s 216A application on 7 January 2019. SHSY was, from that date, as much a stranger to the s 216A applications as any other person whom Reignwood chose not to name as a defendant to those applications. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">135 The fact that Reignwood initially named SHSY as a party to the s 216A applications and then discontinued the applications against SHSY does not assist SHSY in satisfying the non-discretionary requirements of the necessity limb. Whether a person ought to have been joined as a defendant to a s 216A application is an objective question of law. Its answer does not turn on the complainant’s actual conduct in joining or omitting the intended defendant as a party to the s 216A application. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">136 Having found that SHSY cannot satisfy the non-discretionary requirements of the necessity limb, I now turn to consider whether SHSY can satisfy the non-discretionary requirements of the just and convenient limb.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The just and convenient limb</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">137 A person who seeks to be joined to proceedings under the just and convenient limb must satisfy two cumulative non-discretionary requirements: (a) there must be an issue between that person and any party to the proceedings which is connected in some way to an issue between the existing parties to the proceedings; and (b) the court must be of the opinion that it is just and convenient to determine that issue as between that person and that party as well as between the existing parties to the proceedings: <span class="font-italic">Ernest Ferdinand </span>([38] above) at [204], citing <span class="font-italic">Singapore Civil Procedure 2017</span>, vol 1 (Foo Chee Hock gen ed) (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 7th Ed, 2016) at para 15/6/8.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">138 SHSY argues that an intended defendant satisfies the non-discretionary requirements of the just and convenient limb because the issue which arises on a s 216A application as between the complainant and the company and also as between the two of them and the intended defendant is whether the derivative proceedings appear to be <span class="font-italic">prima facie </span>in the company’s interests within the meaning of s 216A(3)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the Act.

In each case, an intended defendant was joined to an application for leave to commence statutory derivative proceedings at least in part because the intended defendant could assist the court in determining whether the complainant had established the conditions precedent to enlivening the court’s jurisdiction to grant the leave.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">140 I do not accept SHSY’s submission at [138] above for three reasons.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">141 First, the mere fact that an intended defendant can assist the court in determining whether a complainant can establish the four conditions precedent does not make the issue on that condition precedent one which it would be just and convenient to determine as between the intended defendant and either the complainant or the company as well as between the complainant and the company. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">142 In <span class="font-italic">Actis</span><span class="font-italic"> Excalibur</span>, the complainant sought leave under s 216A to sue the intended defendants in the name of the company for breaches of fiduciary and directors’ duties. The intended defendants applied to be joined to the s 216A application so that they could argue: (a) that the application was not taken out in good faith; and (b) that the proposed derivative proceedings lacked merit and were therefore not <span class="font-italic">prima facie </span>in the companies’ interests.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">143 The Assistant Registrar joined the intended defendants to the s 216A application under the just and convenient limb. He held that it was “not objectionable” to join an intended defendant to a s 216A application so that it could demonstrate to the court that the complainant could not establish the third and fourth conditions precedent: <span class="font-italic">Actis</span><span class="font-italic"> Excalibur </span>at [34]–[35].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">144 In <span class="font-italic">A R Evans</span>, the Hong Kong Court of First Instance joined intended defendants to an application under s 168BC of the Hong Kong Companies Ordinance (Cap 32) (“the Ordinance”) by which a complainant sought leave to commence derivative proceedings against the intended defendants. The court considered that it would be “likely, in general, to be assisted by submissions that bear on such questions as the jurisdiction to make an order under the section, or indeed as to the merits of the proposed claim”: at [27]. Whether in their capacity as shareholders of the company or in their capacity as the intended defendants, the court held that the intended defendants were entitled to be heard in opposition to the application for leave: at [27].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">145 In my view, <span class="font-italic">Actis</span><span class="font-italic"> Excalibur </span>and <span class="font-italic">A R Evans</span> go too far if they suggest that the mere fact that a person is able to assist the court with evidence and submissions on an issue which the court will have to determine in pending proceedings is sufficient in itself to warrant joining that person as a party to those proceedings under the just and convenient limb. There will always be many persons who can assist the court with evidence and submissions on an issue which the court will have to determine in pending proceedings. It will no doubt be appropriate to receive that evidence and to hear those submissions in some cases, subject to according procedural fairness to the parties, before determining that issue, either as an indulgence to that person or to assist the court in achieving rectitude of decision. But it cannot seriously be suggested that all of those persons are entitled to be joined <span class="font-italic">as parties</span> to the proceedings under the just and convenient limb if they insist upon it, with all of the consequences which follow from joinder (see [75]–[76] above). Further, as I have pointed out, a test framed so widely would allow every intended defendant in every s 216A application to satisfy this non-discretionary requirement, contrary to the deliberate scheme of s 216A.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">146 For the reasons I have already given, whether Reignwood can establish the four conditions precedent necessary to enliven the jurisdiction under s 216A is not SHSY’s concern. Whether Reignwood can do so is a concern only of the Opus Tiger Companies’ shareholders and directors, and perhaps of any “proper person” within the meaning of s 216A(1)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) (see [107]–[120] above). If s 216A intended the court to determine whether the complainant had established these conditions precedent as between an intended defendant and a complainant or as between an intended defendant and the company, one would expect s 216A to require a complainant to name an intended defendant as a defendant to a s 216A application, or at the very least to give the intended defendant notice of a s 216A application so that it can consider whether to apply to be joined to it.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">147 The second reason I do not accept SHSY’s submission at [138] above is that the just and convenient limb requires the question or issue involving the intended defendant to be one that can be determined in the s 216A application as between complainant or the company and the intended defendant and also as between the complainant and the company. SHSY argues that the merits of the proposed derivative proceedings are one such issue. The argument is that the threshold for assessing the merits of the derivative proceedings on a s 216A application is the converse of the threshold for assessing whether the derivative proceedings, once brought, ought to be struck out under O 18 r 19 of the Rules of Court.

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">148 That is not correct. It is true that a complainant will fail to establish that the proposed derivative proceedings are <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> in the interests of the company if the derivative proceedings lack merit. It is also true that proceedings which would be struck out under O 18 r 19 if brought voluntarily by the company lack sufficient merit for the purposes of the fourth condition precedent. But it does not follow that the threshold on the merits which a complainant must clear to prove that the proposed derivative proceedings are <span class="font-italic">prima</span><span class="font-italic"> facie</span> in the interests of the company is the converse of – and therefore the same issue as – the threshold on the merits which an intended defendant must clear to strike out the derivative proceedings under O 18 r 19 after they have been commenced. The threshold on the merits for the fourth condition precedent is set deliberately low. It is to be carried out at a high level. It is to be carried out without any need to resolve contested facts. It is carried out without discovery and even before pleadings are filed. The fourth condition precedent does not raise the same issue as that which would arise as between the intended defendant and the company on an application to strike out the derivative proceedings once commenced.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">149 The link between a successful s 216A application and the derivative proceedings which follow it also does not suffice to give rise to the type of issue which the just and convenient limb requires. It is true, as held in <span class="font-italic">Actis</span><span class="font-italic"> Excalibur</span>, that the questions or issues between the complainant and the intended defendants are “clearly and directly linked” to the relief or remedy which the complainant claims in the s 216A application, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, leave to bring the derivative proceedings: at [33]. They are necessarily linked because the only derivative proceedings which the complainant can bring against the intended defendant in the name of the company are the very same proceedings that the court gave the complainant leave to bring when it made the s 216A order. But, for the reasons I have given, that does not mean that there is a question or issue to be determined as between the company and the intended defendant as well as between the company and the complainant on that issue for the purposes of the just and convenient limb.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">150 The third reason I do not accept SHSY’s submission at [138] above is that <span class="font-italic">Actis</span><span class="font-italic"> Excalibur</span> and <span class="font-italic">A</span><span class="font-italic"> R Evans</span> are distinguishable. In <span class="font-italic">Actis</span><span class="font-italic"> Excalibur</span>, the intended defendants were company insiders. They were <span class="font-italic">de jure</span> or <span class="font-italic">de facto</span> directors of the companies in whose name the complainant was seeking leave to commence the derivative proceedings (at [3]–[4]). As such, it was the intended defendants’ own decision not to cause the companies to litigate the subject matter of the derivative proceedings that the complainant was asking the court to override under s 216A. The intended defendants therefore had a <span class="font-italic">lis</span> as against the complainant and the company, sufficient to support joinder under O 15 r 6(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>). But that <span class="font-italic">lis</span> arose from their status as directors of the companies, not from their status as intended defendants. I do recognise, however, that the decision in <span class="font-italic">Actis</span><span class="font-italic"> Excalibur</span> did not rest on this point. Indeed, this argument was put forward by the complainant (at [10(b)] and rejected in that case. In that respect, and with respect, I consider <span class="font-italic">Actis</span><span class="font-italic"> Excalibur</span> to be wrong. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">151 <span class="font-italic">A R Evans</span> is distinguishable for two reasons. First, it is not clear whether the court assessed critically whether the intended defendant satisfied the non-discretionary requirements for joinder under the Hong Kong equivalent of the just and convenient limb. Assuming in SHSY’s favour that the court did do so, it is my view, for the reasons that I have already given, that an intended defendant does not satisfy those requirements. I therefore decline to adopt the reasoning in <span class="font-italic">A R Evans</span>. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">152 Second, s 168BC of the Ordinance is materially different from s 216A of the Act. Like s 216A(3)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the Act, s 168BC(3)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the Ordinance requires a complainant to establish that granting leave appears on the face of the application to be in the company’s interests. But s 168BC(3)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the Ordinance goes further and requires the complainant to establish that the proposed derivative proceedings raise “a serious question to be tried”. The Ordinance therefore sets the merits of the proposed derivative proceedings as an independent condition precedent for the complainant to establish, unlike the Act which makes no express mention of the merits at all. Further, the Hong Kong legislation sets a higher threshold for the complainant on the merits than the Singapore courts have in interpreting and applying the fourth condition precedent under s 216A.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">153 These differences may be sufficient, under Hong Kong law, for the threshold on the merits on an application under s 168BC of the Ordinance to be the converse of the threshold on the merits on a striking out application. If that is indeed the effect of the “serious question to be tried” condition precedent in the Ordinance, it is obviously a waste of time, money and judicial resources to grant a complainant leave to commence derivative proceedings if the intended defendant can demonstrate at the leave stage that it will be able to have those proceedings struck out if brought.

</div> In that case, the consenting subsidiary proprietors of a strata development appealed to the High Court against the Strata Titles Board’s decision to reject its application for approval of an <span class="font-italic">en</span><span class="font-italic"> bloc </span>sale: at [5]. The <span class="font-italic">en</span><span class="font-italic"> bloc</span> buyer then applied to be joined as a party to the appeal. The buyer argued that: (a) it was the only person with a real interest in the appeal succeeding, because the property market had moved post-contractually in its favour and against the interests of the consenting subsidiary proprietors; and (b) the outcome of the appeal might have a severe effect on its separate claim against the consenting subsidiary proprietors for breach of contract: at [2]. Choo Han Teck J held that “prudence requires that [the buyer] be heard” because whether the outcome of the appeal would affect the buyer’s claim against the consenting subsidiary proprietors could not be determined until the court heard from the buyer: at [5]. In my view, this case is best understood as an instance of the court exercising its inherent jurisdiction to permit a party to be heard as an indulgence to that party and to assist the court in achieving rectitude of decision, and not as an instance of the court exercising its power of joinder for all purposes under O 15 r 6(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">SHSY’s authorities</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">155 I now turn to consider some of the other authorities which SHSY has cited on both limbs of O 15 r 6(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>).

</div> To reconcile this practice with the non-discretionary requirements of O 15 r 6(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>), SHSY suggests that these requirements are not applied as strictly on a s 216A application as they are in other proceedings. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">158 All of these authorities involve a complainant seeking leave to commence derivative proceedings in the name of the company against either: (a) a director of the company for breaches of directors’ duties; or (b) a shareholder of the company for breach of a shareholders’ agreement to which the company was also a party. The intended defendants in each of these cases were therefore insiders to the company. The sole issue in these applications (see [110] above) was one which concerned them, <span class="font-italic">i</span><span class="font-italic">e,</span> whether the court should sanction a deviation from the fundamental principle of majority rule.

I reject SHSY’s submission that the non-discretionary requirements of O 15 r 6(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) are not applied as strictly on a s 216A application as they are in other proceedings.

</div>
</div> In <span class="font-italic">ARW(HC)</span>, the High Court allowed the Attorney-General’s application to be joined as a party to proceedings under both limbs of O 15 r 6(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) in order to oppose the defendant’s discovery application against the Comptroller of Income Tax. On appeal, in <span class="font-italic">ARW (CA)</span>, the Court of Appeal applied the framework set out in <span class="font-italic">Ernest Ferdinand</span> and affirmed the High Court’s decision. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">166 The Court of Appeal’s reasons for affirming the first instance decision make <span class="font-italic">ARW(CA)</span> distinguishable. On the necessity limb, the Court of Appeal held that it was necessary to join the Attorney-General because the issue of public interest privilege could not be effectually and completely determined without the Attorney-General’s participation. As the guardian of the public interest, the Attorney-General could present a perspective distinct from that of either party on the issue, given that the issue necessarily involved the public interest. Further, in performing this public duty, the Attorney-General would be able take into account confidential information and considerations to which the parties to the proceedings were not privy: <span class="font-italic">ARW (CA) </span>at [42].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">167 It is true, by analogy with <span class="font-italic">ARW (CA)</span>, that an intended defendant can present a perspective on the merits of proposed derivative proceedings which is distinct from both the complainant’s and the company’s perspectives. But SHSY does not argue that a mere difference in perspective suffices to satisfy the non-discretionary requirements of O 15 r 6(2)(b). In any event, both <span class="font-italic">ARW </span><span class="font-italic">(HC)</span> and<span class="font-italic"> ARW (CA)</span> were decided in an “unique context” (see <span class="font-italic">ARW (HC) </span>at [54]). That case involved the public interest and public interest immunity, an area of law laden with issues of high policy. I do not think it is possible to draw any general proposition from that case about joining a person to ordinary civil litigation in between private persons raising issues of only private law. <span class="font-italic">ARW (HC) </span>and <span class="font-italic">ARW (CA)</span> do not assist SHSY.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">168 I therefore do not consider that any of the authorities which Reignwood has cited detracts from my analysis above of the non-discretionary requirements of O 15 r 6(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) as applied to a s 216A application. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Conclusion on the requirements of O 15 r 6(2)(b)</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">169 For all these reasons, I hold that a person like SHSY who is an intended defendant but is not at the same time an insider to the company cannot satisfy the non-discretionary requirements of O 15 r 6(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>). The fundamental difficulty is that a s 216A application raises different issues as between different persons to be decided on different principles at a different threshold and for a different purpose from any issue that may arise in any proposed derivative proceedings which may follow the s 216A application.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">170 An intended defendant will have its day in court and its chance to contest the derivative proceedings <span class="font-italic">in those </span><span class="font-italic">proceedings</span>, once they are commenced. In <span class="font-italic">Pierc</span><span class="font-italic">e </span>([116] above), Griffin J noted that “it is hard to see why intended defendants in a derivative proceedings should have any earlier opportunity to stop the proceedings than defendants in other proceedings just because the derivative proceedings requires a leave application before it is begun”: at [81], citing <span class="font-italic">Lederer</span> ([112] above) at [17]. That observation in <span class="font-italic">Pierce</span> applies equally to s 216A and O 15 r 6(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>). It is no part of the purpose of s 216A to give an intended defendant a first bite of the cherry on the merits of the claim against it. Like any other defendant, an intended defendant like SHSY will have its first and only bite at first instance when it defends the claim.</div><div class="txt-body text-justify">171 My decision would be different if SHSY were, for example, a shareholder in OOL or even in the Opus Tiger Companies. That status as a shareholder – equivalent to Reignwood’s status (see [10] above) – would satisfy the non-discretionary requirements of O 15 r 6(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) and would be a basis for joining SHSY as a party to the s 216A applications. But SHSY is not a shareholder of the Opus Tiger Companies at any level. Its position is that, as the largest creditor of OOL, it is the economic owner of the Opus Tiger Companies with a better claim (because they are insolvent) to control the Opus Tiger Companies than an indirect shareholder like Reignwood has.

</div> Reignwood provided these documents to SHSY on 8 January 2019. This factor is, to my mind, immaterial. SHSY was still named as the second defendant on the face of those documents. This was consistent with Reignwood’s description of the s 216A application against OT1 in its defence filed in the English litigation (see [184] above). However, by that time, Reignwood had already secured leave to discontinue the applications as against SHSY. Reignwood did not disclose this to SHSY.</div><div class="txt-body text-justify">189 I am prepared to accept that SHSY actually believed in January 2019, and on reasonable grounds, that: (a) it was still a party to the OT1 application; and (b) Reignwood was in the process of serving the application on SHSY through the judicial authorities of the PRC. I am prepared also to accept that SHSY did not know that Reignwood had discontinued the OT1 application as against SHSY until June 2019 when it inspected the court file. However, none of this suffices to explain SHSY’s failure to bring its joinder application before May 2019. </div><div class="txt-body text-justify">190 In the defence filed in the English litigation (see [184] above), Reignwood disclosed to SHSY that it anticipated that the OT1 application would be heard, and that leave would be granted, in or around March 2019.

</div> SHSY is a sophisticated and substantial commercial party. It is not unused to litigation (see [25] above). Given that SHSY knew about the OT1 application in January 2019 and knew that Reignwood expected the OT1 application to be heard in March 2019, I would have expected SHSY to have asked Reignwood for an update on the application in or around March 2019 if not before. At the very least, I would have expected SHSY to appoint solicitors in Singapore no later than March 2019 to inspect the court file in the OT1 application to ascertain its status. SHSY did not inspect the court files in the s 216A applications until Reignwood gave SHSY copies of the s 216A orders in June 2019.

SHSY says that it was waiting for the Opus Tiger Companies to file the Directions Applications. But, given that at least one of SHSY’s objectives in applying to be joined to the s 216A applications is to reverse the s 216A orders, there was no reason for SHSY to wait for the Directions Applications to be filed before applying to be joined.</div><div class="txt-body text-justify">192 Having said that, it appears to me also that Reignwood was playing tactical games with SHSY. It first named SHSY as the second defendant in the s 216A application against OT1 and informed SHSY of that fact. It then discontinued the s 216A applications as against SHSY without informing SHSY of that fact. Reignwood secured the s 216A orders in May 2019, but did not inform SHSY of them until June 2019, just before the deadline for appeal was to expire. Reignwood did not give copies of the notices of discontinuance to SHSY until July 2019, eight months after the discontinuances took place.

They were merely jockeying for advantage as litigants, shareholders and creditors inevitably do. As was their prerogative, they were both acting within the strict letter of their procedural and legal rights. Reignwood had no duty to inform SHSY promptly or at all: (a) that it had brought four s 216A applications and not just one against OT1; (b) that it had discontinued all four applications as against SHSY in January 2019; or (c) that it had obtained the s 216A orders in May 2019. And SHSY was entitled to sit back and wait to be served with the OT1 application in the PRC even if it knew that Reignwood intended to have the application heard in March 2019 and even if SHSY received no updates from Reignwood as to the progress of the application around or after March 2019.</div><div class="txt-body text-justify">194 I make these observations only as a basis for my conclusion that I consider both parties’ acts and omissions from January 2019 to October 2019 to be a neutral factor in the discretionary assessment, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, a factor which does not weigh in either party’s favour.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Prejudice, inconvenience and alternative forum</span></div><div class="txt-body text-justify">195 A factor which points against joinder is the prejudice and inconvenience that Reignwood would suffer if SHSY is now joined as a party to the s 216A applications. The prejudice and inconvenience operate on two levels.</div><div class="txt-body text-justify">196 First, joining a person to any proceedings causes prejudice and inconvenience to the parties to the proceedings. The joinder increases the length and the costs of the proceedings. In <span class="font-italic">Siow</span><span class="font-italic"> Doreen </span>([154] above), Choo Han Teck J joined the <span class="font-italic">en</span><span class="font-italic"> bloc</span> buyer as a party to an appeal from the Strata Titles Board to the High Court. The most relevant factor was that the appeal “concerned a very narrow point (or two) of law”. Choo Han Teck J therefore considered that the joinder was warranted even though it increased the number of parties the court would have to hear: at [6].</div><div class="txt-body text-justify">197 The prejudice and inconvenience are compounded when joining an intended defendant to a s 216A application in order to allow it to contest the four conditions precedent which a complainant must establish (see [122] above). That is especially so when the intended defendant’s purpose is to contest the merits of the proposed derivative proceedings. Joining an intended defendant who is not an insider purely to contest the merits of the proposed derivative proceedings creates a real risk of complicating and lengthening a s 216A application with no countervailing benefit, given the very low threshold at which the merits are to be assessed. If allowed to do so, an intended defendant has every incentive to maximise this first bite of the cherry by turning the s 216A application into an application to strike out the proposed derivative proceedings even before they are brought or, worse still, into a full dress rehearsal of the derivative proceedings. No doubt, a robust judge will be vigilant to prevent this from happening. But the risk exists nonetheless. That in turn poses a real risk of increasing costs and delay. It may also delay the commencement of the derivative proceedings themselves, contrary to the purpose of s 216A. As the Ontario Court of Appeal noted in<span class="font-italic"> Lederer</span> ([112] above) at [15]:</div><div class="txt-body text-justify">… the application procedure envisaged by [the Ontario equivalent of s 216A] is intended to be expeditious so that if litigation is necessary in the interest of the corporation its commencement will not be unduly delayed. This suggests that additional participants in a leave application beyond those envisaged by [the Ontario equivalent of s 216A] ought to be the exception, not the norm. …</div><div class="txt-body text-justify">198 SHSY submits that refusing joinder will cause it prejudice because it will have no opportunity to present “the full facts” as to whether the court should have granted Reignwood leave to commence the derivative proceedings.

</div> But s 216A does not require a complainant to notify an intended defendant of the s 216A applications, let alone to name it as a defendant. That is a deliberate legislative choice. Further, in a s 216A application, the court need not and should not determine “the full facts”; it need only determine whether the complainant has established the four conditions precedent and whether it should sanction a departure from the fundamental principle of majority rule.</div><div class="txt-body text-justify">199 Second, joining SHSY as a party to the s 216A applications will cause prejudice or inconvenience to Reignwood. SHSY argues in response that, if it is joined as a party, it will take out the necessary applications to challenge the s 216A orders. And if its challenge fails, the s 216A orders will stand and Reignwood will suffer no prejudice.

This is where the fact that SHSY has applied for joinder after the s 216A orders have been made becomes highly relevant. Reignwood has, since June 2019, proceeded on the basis that the s 216A orders are final and cannot be reversed even by appeal. On that basis, Reignwood has now commenced all four arbitrations. Reignwood has paid the filing fees for all four arbitrations. All four tribunals have been constituted. The OT1 arbitration is at the pleadings stage.

</div> if SHSY is now joined to the s 216A applications in order, at least in part, to appeal against the s 216A orders out of time, there is a risk that all of the time, money and other resources that Reignwood has expended in progressing the arbitrations will be wasted. The potential prejudice to Reignwood is not addressed by allowing the joinder and leaving it to Reignwood to raise these arguments on SHSY’s application for leave to appeal out of time. The mere risk of prejudice to Reignwood suffices to count against SHSY in the discretionary assessment. </div><div class="txt-body text-justify">202 For all of these reasons, even if I had been of the view that SHSY had managed to satisfy the non-discretionary requirements of O 15 r 6(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>), I would have declined it leave to be joined as a party to the s 216A applications on the discretionary assessment. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The inherent jurisdiction to order joinder</span></div><div class="txt-body text-justify">203 Quite apart from the power to join SHSY under O 15 r 6(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>), some authorities refer to the court’s inherent jurisdiction to join a person to proceedings. For completeness, I shall briefly address whether SHSY’s joinder applications can succeed under the court’s inherent jurisdiction.</div><div class="txt-body text-justify">204 The court’s inherent jurisdiction to prevent injustice and to prevent an abuse of the process of the court is preserved by O 92 r 4: <span class="font-italic">Wee Soon Kim </span>([130] above) at [21]. Order 92 r 4 reads:</div><div class="txt-body text-justify">For the avoidance of doubt it is hereby declared that nothing in these Rules shall be deemed to limit or affect the inherent powers of the Court to make any order as may be necessary to prevent injustice or to prevent an abuse of the process of the Court.</div><div class="txt-body text-justify">How the court should exercise its inherent jurisdiction “should not be circumscribed by rigid criteria or tests” but by the strict and essential touchstone of necessity: <span class="font-italic">Wee Soon Kim </span>at [27]; <span class="font-italic">Family Food Court</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>[2008] 4 SLR(R) 272<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [63]. The court’s inherent jurisdiction should be invoked only in “exceptional circumstances where there is a clear need for it and the justice of the case so demands”: <span class="font-italic">ARW (HC) </span>([165] above) at [66], citing <span class="font-italic">Roberto Building Material Pte Ltd and others v Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp Ltd and another </span>[2003] 2 SLR(R) 353<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [17]. An overly liberal approach to exercising the court’s inherent jurisdiction runs the risk of undermining the entire purpose of the carefully constructed edifice of procedural rights, obligations, powers, discretions and safeguards set out in the Rules of Court.</div><div class="txt-body text-justify">205 I refuse to join SHSY to the s 216A applications in the exercise of my inherent jurisdiction. SHSY has not established that any exceptional circumstances exist. Further, the same list of factors I have relied on in explaining why SHSY cannot satisfy the non-discretionary requirements of O 15 r 6(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) and why I would have exercised my discretion under O 15 r 6(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) against joining SHSY demonstrates that exercising my inherent jurisdiction to join SHSY to the s 216A applications is in no sense necessary to prevent injustice.</div><div class="txt-body text-justify">206 Once again: (a) the sole issue to be adjudicated on the s 216A applications is no concern of SHSY; (b) SHSY is entitled to only one opportunity to defeat the derivative proceedings, and that opportunity comes in the arbitrations themselves; and (c) even creating a risk that the s 216A orders might be belatedly reversed is prejudicial to Reignwood, given that the sole issue on a s 216A application is of no concern to an intended defendant.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">207 For all of these reasons, SHSY’s application to be joined as a party to the s 216A applications cannot succeed even under the inherent jurisdiction.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Hearing SHSY on the Directions Applications</span></div><div class="txt-body text-justify">208 I have thus far rejected SHSY’s application to be joined as a party to the s 216A applications either under O 15 r 6(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) or in the exercise of the court’s inherent jurisdiction.</div><div class="txt-body text-justify">209 I now consider whether it is appropriate to make a limited order granting SHSY leave only to be heard on the Directions Applications. That limited order would give SHSY a procedural right to present evidence and submissions on the Directions Applications but would not make it a party to the s 216A applications. That would avoid the undesirable and unintended consequences of joinder (see [75]–[76] above). In particular, this type of limited order ensures that SHSY cannot even attempt to reverse the s 216A orders. The fact that I have already made the s 216A orders therefore becomes an irrelevant consideration in the discretionary assessment as to whether to make this type of limited order.</div><div class="txt-body text-justify">210 There is no express power in the Rules of Court for me to make this type of limited order. I do not consider that O 15 r 6(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) allows me to do so. It is true that the word “proceedings” in O 15 r 6(2) is wide enough to include interlocutory proceedings such as the Directions Applications. But the entire purpose of O 15 r 6 is to deal with misjoinder and nonjoinder of “parties”. A person cannot be a “party” to an interlocutory application. A person can be a party only to the originating process in which that interlocutory application is brought.</div><div class="txt-body text-justify">211 I do consider, however, that the court’s inherent jurisdiction as preserved by  92 r 4 extends to allowing a person who is not a party to an originating process to present evidence and submissions either on a particular interlocutory application in that originating process or at the hearing which disposes of the originating process with finality, without making that person a party to the originating process. A limited order does not cut across or undermine any established procedure under the Rules of Court. Further, a limited order could assist the court in achieving rectitude of decision on the s 216A application without the undesirable and unintended consequences of a joinder. Indeed, the existence and exercise of this inherent jurisdiction may be the best procedural explanation for the basis on which intended defendants who are not shareholders, directors or “proper persons” have been permitted to present evidence and make submissions at the hearing of a s 216A application.</div><div class="txt-body text-justify">212 By the Directions Applications, the Opus Tiger Companies seek my directions on the proper scope of the s 216A orders. In particular, the Direction Applications pose the following questions:

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">214 It is true that the questions raised in the Directions Applications affect SHSY in that they arise from contracts to which SHSY is the counterparty. It is also true that Reignwood’s conduct of the derivative proceedings will affect SHSY, and therefore the outcome of the Directions Applications may affect SHSY. But that does not give rise to a question or issue involving SHSY that relates to an existing question or issue in the Directions Applications.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">215 The Directions Applications are an extension of the s 216A applications and the s 216A orders. Just as the sole issue which arises on a s 216A application is internal to the company, so too the questions and issues which arise on the Directions Applications as to the scope and implementation of the s 216A orders are internal to the company. As a result, these issues arise only between Reignwood and the Opus Tiger Companies. The questions and issues which arise on the Directions Application do not cross the contractual divide between the Opus Tiger Companies and SHSY. They are therefore no concern of SHSY’s.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">216 Even if I were to look more broadly at whether to make a limited order – without reference even by analogy to O 15 r 6(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) but as a matter of an overall unfettered discretion arising from my inherent jurisdiction – I would also decline to make the order. Whatever my decision on the Directions Applications may be, whether the steps which Reignwood takes in the name of the Opus Tiger Companies in conducting the derivative proceedings against SHSY fall within the scope of the s 216A orders is a matter internal to the Opus Tiger Companies. It therefore concerns only the closed class of insiders to the company: Reignwood, the Opus Tiger Companies, OOL (as a shareholder of Reignwood), the JPLs and other directors of the Opus Tiger Companies and possibly the other shareholders of OOL (as “proper persons” within the meaning of s 216A(1)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>)). Whether those steps fall within the scope of the s 216A order is no concern, in any legal or procedural sense, of SHSY’s.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">217 In that sense, SHSY is like any other defendant facing a claim by a corporate plaintiff or claimant. Whether the corporate claimant is acting beyond its powers and whether the directors controlling the conduct of the litigation are acting beyond the limits of their authority are all matters internal to the corporation. They are of no concern to the defendant.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">218 For all of the foregoing reasons, I have decided that: (a) SHSY does not satisfy the non-discretionary requirements and fails the discretionary assessment for joinder as a party to the s 216A applications under Order 15 r 6(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) and in the exercise of my inherent jurisdiction; and (b) it is not necessary for me to exercise my inherent jurisdiction to receive evidence and submissions from SHSY on the Directions Applications.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">219 I have therefore dismissed SHSY’s joinder applications in their entirety. The effect of my decision is, of course, to preclude SHSY from applying again to be joined as a party to the s 216A applications. But nothing in my decision precludes SHSY from applying under the court’s inherent jurisdiction to be heard on an interlocutory application that arises after this decision. Reignwood does not suggest otherwise.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">220 I make one final point before concluding. Rule 9(3)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the Legal Profession (Professional Conduct) Rules 2015 (S 706/2015) obliges every legal practitioner who conducts proceedings before a court “to inform the court…of every relevant decision…of which the legal practitioner is aware, whether that decision…supports or rebuts the legal practitioner’s contentions…”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">221 The obligation imposed by this rule is a wide one. It does not require the decision to be one that is binding on the court. It does not even require the decision to be a decision of a Singapore court. But the obligation applies only if the legal practitioner is aware of the decision. As such, a breach of the obligation is extremely difficult to detect, let alone to sanction. It is thus fair to say that the only real motivation for complying with this obligation is the legal practitioner’s own professional conscience. In that sense, I have often wondered whether this rule is more honoured today in the breach than the observance. Nevertheless, the rule exists. And the rule exists not merely as a professional obligation: it also encapsulates one of the best traditions of the bar in extending its members’ assistance to the court in administering justice.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">222 In dismissing SHSY’s joinder applications, I have derived support from the Canadian decisions of <span class="font-italic">Lederer</span> ([112] above) and <span class="font-italic">Pierce</span> ([116] above). It was Mr Daniel Chia, counsel for SHSY, who drew both decisions to my attention. He did so even though both decisions rebutted his contentions and even though neither decision was in any way binding on me.
