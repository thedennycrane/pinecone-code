<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       This dispute between the defendant
                    Overseas-Chinese Banking Corporation Limited (“the Bank”) and its
                    customer, Hwang Cheng Tsu Hsu, also known as Nellie Hwang (“the
                    plaintiff”), arose when the Bank refused to allow the plaintiff to close
                    her accounts with the Bank and withdraw her funds therefrom. The plaintiff has
                    since passed away (on 11 May 2010). The plaintiff had visited the Bank at
                    its main branch at No. 65, Chulia Street, OCBC Centre (“the Bank’s
                    premises”) on 13 May 2008, accompanied by her adopted daughter Amy
                    Hsu (“Amy”), to close her fixed deposit accounts but her
                    instructions were not complied with. The plaintiff had been a customer of the
                    Bank since 1989 and its private banking customer since December
                2005.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Background</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The plaintiff formally adopted Amy in 1967 when
                    she was 48 years of age and when Amy was two years old. The plaintiff retired
                    from teaching after the adoption in order to take care of and bring up Amy. The
                    plaintiff was widowed in 1987 and in 1999 purchased an apartment at No, 11
                    Tanjong Rhu #02-02, Singapore (“the Waterside”) where she resided
                    until her death. Amy lived with the plaintiff until she moved out after her
                    marriage in 2007.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       On or about 5 November 1999, the plaintiff
                    executed a Will in which she provided for several beneficiaries (“the
                    1999 Will’). She also executed a codicil to her 1999 Will on
                    22 October 2007 (“the October Codicil”). Dr Teo Sek Khee
                    (“Dr Teo”), a consultant and head of the geriatic unit at
                    Raffles Hospital, was a witness to the execution of the October Codicil. In her
                    third affidavit filed on 18 December 2008, Amy testified that the 1999 Will
                    and the October Codicil were unfair to her and were not in accordance with the
                    plaintiff’s instructions.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       The plaintiff executed a power of attorney on
                    19 August 2004 (“the 2004 Power of Attorney”) appointing her
                    nephew Michael Hwang (“Michael”) and her niece, Frances Hwang
                    (“Frances”) as her attorneys. This power of attorney was
                    purportedly revoked by a Deed of Revocation dated 28 May 2008. A fresh
                    power of attorney was purportedly executed by the plaintiff on 29 May 2008
                    giving Amy the power to <em>inter alia</em> institute legal
                    proceedings on the plaintiff’s behalf, and to do all acts that were
                    necessary or expedient to manage the plaintiff’s property (“the
                    2008 Power of Attorney”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       According to Dr Teo, in March 2008 Amy
                    informed him that the plaintiff wanted to change her will and requested
                    Dr Teo to confirm that the plaintiff was competent to do so. Dr Teo
                    testified that he did not so confirm as he was concerned that the discomfort
                    caused by her constipation problem (for which she was warded at Raffles
                    Hospital) might have clouded the plaintiff’s cognitive functions.
                    Nevertheless, the plaintiff executed a new will on 24 March 2008
                    (“the March 2008 Will”). At trial, it was revealed that the March
                    2008 Will was changed twice, once in May 2008 and again in August 2008
                    (“the August 2008 Will”). Amy revealed that she was appointed the
                    sole executrix and was also the sole beneficiary under the August 2008
                    Will.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The plaintiff’s medical history</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       The plaintiff had been seeing a doctor at Tan
                    Tock Seng Hospital for memory disorder since the year 2000. The plaintiff then
                    consulted Dr Teo on 26 May 2003 for xerodermatitis (dry skin).
                    Subsequently, Dr Teo attended to the plaintiff several times. Frances would
                    usually bring the plaintiff for her appointments with Dr Teo. In June 2003
                    Frances initiated discussions about getting a carer or nurse to help the
                    plaintiff with her medication as Dr Teo discovered that the plaintiff
                    sometimes forgot to take her prescriptions.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       On or about 7 February 2008, the plaintiff
                    sustained a fall at home. She suffered a hip fracture and was hospitalized at
                    Raffles Hospital where she underwent hip replacement surgery. Ms Chen Ching
                    Ling (‘Ching Ling’), who was the plaintiff’s then relationship
                    manager (“RM”) in the private banking division of the Bank
                    informed Ms Lim Sar Lee, (‘Sar Lee’), the Bank’s (group)
                    regional marketing manager that Amy had telephoned and had told Ching Ling that
                    the plaintiff had sustained a fall and was hospitalised. Amy claimed that the
                    plaintiff had difficulty issuing her own cheque to pay for the hospital bill and
                    asked Ching Ling to help clear the plaintiff’s cheque. In mid-February
                    2008, Ching Ling and Sar Lee visited the plaintiff in Raffles Hospital. Sar Lee
                    requested the plaintiff to sign her signature on a piece of paper which the
                    plaintiff did. The plaintiff’s signature was consistent with the specimen
                    signature kept in the Bank’s records. No cheques were signed by the
                    plaintiff in Sar Lee’s presence during that hospital visit.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       According to Amy, at the hospital, Sar Lee and
                    Ching Ling had suggested that the plaintiff should open a joint account with Amy
                    so that Amy could help the plaintiff to operate the joint account. Amy claimed
                    that she and the plaintiff agreed to this suggestion. Sar Lee’s evidence
                    on the other hand was that neither she nor Ching Ling had made any suggestion to
                    the plaintiff or Amy to open a joint account during that visit. Ching Ling left
                    the employment of the Bank on 30 April 2008 and Chua Eng Leong (‘Eng
                    Leong’) took over her role as the plaintiff’s RM with effect from
                    1 May 2008.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       On or about 16 February 2005, Dr Teo
                    diagnosed the plaintiff as suffering from mild Alzheimer’s dementia. He
                    also gave evidence that the plaintiff could not recall her hip surgery when he
                    attended to her on 4 March 2008. He further testified that Amy was
                    overheard shouting at the plaintiff for about two to three minutes in the
                    hospital ward. In his report dated 17 June 2009, Dr Teo noted that the
                    plaintiff’s dementia had worsened between 2003 and 2007 while under his
                    care and her condition deteriorated further between 2007 and 2008 with problems
                    of her personal grooming and poor nutrition becoming apparent.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     The plaintiff was attended to by several
                    doctors aside from Dr Teo from March to May 2008, namely a psychiatrist
                    Dr Lim Hsin Loh (“Dr Lim”); a clinical psychologist
                    Dr Zena Kang (“Dr Kang”); and a specialist in geriatic
                    medicine Dr Sitoh Yih Yiow (“Dr Sitoh”). The plaintiff
                    was examined by Dr Lim on 28 March 2008. In the examination, the
                    plaintiff was found to have deficits in recent memory and orientation. After
                    five minutes, the plaintiff could not recall a name or an address that had been
                    given to her. Neither could she recall three simple items (a clock, a book, a
                    chair) after the same interval. However, the plaintiff’s memory for past
                    events was good as she could tell Dr Lim her life history. The plaintiff
                    told Dr Lim that she owned two properties, one at Mandarin Gardens and the
                    other at the Waterside. Dr Lim believed that the plaintiff’s recent
                    memory deficiency was serious enough to warrant a further medical examination.
                    Hence he referred her to Dr Kang, a clinical psychologist, for assessment
                    of the plaintiff’s mental state and cognitive functioning.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     Dr Kang examined the plaintiff on 1 and
                    3 April 2008. She gave evidence that the two sessions basically involved
                    the administration of one test. When Dr Kang asked the plaintiff how old
                    her daughter was, the plaintiff replied that she was not allowed to reveal a
                    woman’s age. Dr Kang conducted a brief neuropsychological test called
                    the Mini Mental State Exam (‘MMSE’) to assess the plaintiff’s
                    mental status and cognitive function. She testified that the MMSE was not
                    intended for a diagnostic purpose and was not sufficient to determine whether
                    one has dementia but was merely indicative of the level of cognitive impairment.
                    In conducting the MMSE, Dr Kang had asked the plaintiff what was the date,
                    day, month and year on that day. The plaintiff was unable to answer and
                    explained that every day was the same to her. When asked to repeat the three
                    objects (an apple, a clock and a table) <em>immediately
                        after</em> Dr Kang had told the plaintiff what they were, the
                    plaintiff was only able to repeat apple and clock on the first try. The
                    plaintiff made three attempts before she was able to recall all three objects.
                    After an interval of less than five minutes, Dr Kang asked the plaintiff if
                    she could remember the three items mentioned a few minutes earlier; the
                    plaintiff could not.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     The plaintiff did better at the Wechsler Adult
                    Intelligence Scale test. This test assesses a person’s thinking and
                    reasoning skills. When asked what was the similarity between an
                    ‘egg’ and a ‘seed’, the plaintiff replied that they are
                    both the ‘beginning of life’. The plaintiff also answered that
                    ‘republic’ and ‘monarchy’ were similar in that both were
                    ‘forms of government’. Dr Kang concluded in her report that the
                    plaintiff’s deficits were mainly in her short term memory which had an
                    impact on her ability to learn new information. There was no impairment in her
                    speech, language and reasoning skills. Dr Kang opined that the
                    plaintiff’s previous diagnosis of dementia was of a mild
                form.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     Dr Sitoh saw the plaintiff between
                    8 April 2008 and 28 July 2009. On the plaintiff’s first visit,
                    Dr Sitoh made a general assessment of her health. Although the assessment
                    covered both the physical and mental aspects of her health, Dr Sitoh
                    cautioned that his report on that assessment was not intended to reflect the
                    plaintiff’s mental competence in anyway as he was not requested to assess
                    her decision-making capacity at that time. Dr Sitoh’s assessment of
                    8 April 2008 found that the plaintiff required some physical assistance
                    with bathing and toileting, probably attributable to the hip replacement surgery
                    the plaintiff had undergone earlier. The plaintiff was unable to name the year
                    (2008) and the then Prime Minister. She could not complete the Clock Drawing
                    Test as she was unable to recall the time to be represented.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     On 12 May 2008, Dr Lim examined the
                    plaintiff for the second time. As with the first examination, it is not disputed
                    that Dr Lim examined her for the purpose of determining the
                    plaintiff’s testamentary capacity. Dr Lim was of the opinion that the
                    plaintiff knew the nature and consequences of making a will. When Dr Lim
                    asked what a will was, the plaintiff replied “before you die, to make a
                    will to give away your property; you cannot carry away”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     Based on Dr Lim’s examinations on
                    28 March 2008 and 12 May 2008 and Dr Kang’s psychometric
                    assessment report, Dr Lim diagnosed the plaintiff in his report dated
                    24 May 2008 as suffering from <em>mild dementia</em>.
                    Her dementia was characterised mainly by the impairment of her <em>short term memory</em>. Dr Lim found that the
                    plaintiff’s judgment and reasoning had remained intact, and he concluded
                    that she was fit to make a will.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     It is pertinent to note that the Bank did not
                    have access to the medical information and reports referred to above until much
                    later. The Bank’s pleaded case was that it did not know of the
                    plaintiff’s dementia until after legal proceedings had commenced (on
                    29 August 2008) when an affidavit was filed by Dr Lim on
                    3 October 2008.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The visit of the plaintiff and Amy to the Bank on 13 May
                2008</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     On 13 May 2008, the plaintiff and Amy
                    attended at the Bank’s premises to give instructions for the opening of a
                    new joint account. The plaintiff and Amy were attended to in a meeting room on
                    the 31<sup>st</sup> floor by Kang Eu Jin (‘Eu Jin’)
                    a client services officer of the Bank. Eu Jin introduced himself as the
                    assistant to Eng Leong, Amy introduced herself as the plaintiff’s daughter
                    and informed Eu Jin that the plaintiff wished to transfer monies then held by
                    the Bank by way of fixed deposits to a new joint account to be opened in her
                    name and the name of the plaintiff.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     Eu Jin testified that the plaintiff appeared
                    dazed, and was ‘staring into blank space’ all the time. He felt
                    uncomfortable as he noticed that while the plaintiff’s accounts with the
                    Bank were in the plaintiff’s sole name, the instructions to transfer the
                    monies from the plaintiff’s accounts to a new joint account came from Amy.
                    Eu Jin consulted Sar Lee because he was concerned over whether the plaintiff
                    knew what transaction she was entering into and what Amy had wanted to do. On
                    Sar Lee’s advice, Eu Jin proceeded with filling the account opening forms
                    although he informed Amy that the opening of the joint account would be subject
                    to the Bank’s management’s approval. When he attempted to explain to
                    the plaintiff details about opening the account, Amy cut him off and said
                    ‘Qin Meng!’
                    [??!] to the plaintiff (which words mean ‘sign’
                    in the Cantonese language) in a stern and peremptory tone. The plaintiff was
                    startled but complied by signing the account opening form.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     Eu Jin remained concerned and approached Sar
                    Lee to inform her of what had transpired. Later, Eu Jin also briefed Eng Leong.
                    Both then approached Sar Lee to discuss the matter. On the other hand, Amy
                    testified that Eu Jin “never said a word” to the plaintiff
                    throughout the meeting The day after the visit of Amy and the plaintiff, Sar Lee
                    and Eng Leong decided that as a prudent measure, they should meet with the
                    plaintiff to verify her instructions to open a joint account. Eng Leong tried to
                    make an appointment by telephoning the plaintiff several times that day but to
                    no avail – she was not contactable.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The home visit on 15 May 2008</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     On 15 May 2008, Sar Lee and Eng Leong
                    visited the plaintiff at her residence at the Waterside. Amy was in Australia at
                    that time. It was Amy’s contention that the Bank made the visit knowing
                    full well Amy was away from Singapore. During the visit, the plaintiff walked
                    out of her room unaided. Sar Lee and Eng Leong introduced themselves to the
                    plaintiff and informed her that they were visiting as part of the Bank’s
                    customer care services.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     That was the first time Eng Leong had met the
                    plaintiff. He introduced himself as her new RM. The plaintiff did not appear to
                    recognise Sar Lee from the latter’s visit at Raffles Hospital. According
                    to Sar Lee, the plaintiff just smiled when Sar Lee asked if the plaintiff
                    remembered her Sar Lee testified that the plaintiff warmed up to her and became
                    chattier. When Sar Lee asked the plaintiff how old she was so as to be able to
                    recover so fast from her surgery, the plaintiff replied that a woman’s age
                    was a secret. The plaintiff eventually told Sar Lee she was 80 years old (she
                    was actually 90 at that time).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     Sar Lee asked if the plaintiff had attended at
                    the Bank’s premises on 13 May 2008 and whether the plaintiff wished
                    to open any joint account. The plaintiff replied that she did not recall either
                    event. Sar Lee then asked how long the plaintiff had been the Bank’s
                    customer. The plaintiff replied that she had been a ‘long-time’
                    customer. Subsequently, Sar Lee asked the plaintiff a second time whether she
                    remembered going to the Bank’s premises to open a joint account, the
                    plaintiff replied that she could not remember. However, the plaintiff could
                    recall that she had, at one time, gone to the Bank’s premises to check her
                    safe deposit box but could not remember when that took place.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     Sar Lee then specifically asked if the
                    plaintiff wanted to open a joint account, and the plaintiff replied
                        ‘<em>No</em>’. Further, when Sar Lee asked
                    the plaintiff if she had a daughter, the plaintiff replied ‘<em>No</em>’. Subsequently however, the plaintiff said that
                    she had a daughter who was overseas on vacation. The plaintiff told Sar Lee that
                    the daughter lived with her, and that her maid had been working for her for
                    about 2 years. However, before their departure, Sar Lee was told by the maid
                    that the plaintiff lived alone and that the maid had only started working for
                    her about three months back.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Events after the home visit of 15 May 2008</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     The home visit on 15 May 2008 lasted for
                    about half an hour. When Sar Lee and Eng Leong left, they discussed the
                    observations they made regarding the plaintiff and her inconsistent answers.
                    They were concerned about the plaintiff’s mental capacity. On the same
                    day, Sar Lee and Eng Leong had a meeting with Olivier Denis
                    (“Denis”), the head of private banking of the Bank. They reported
                    to Denis what Eu Jin had observed of the plaintiff on 13 May 2008 at the
                    Bank’s premises and what they had noted on 15 May 2008 at the
                    plaintiff’s residence. Subsequently, Denis had about four internal
                    meetings which involved Sar Lee, Eng Leong as well as the Bank’s legal and
                    operational risk management and compliance departments.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     On 20 May 2008, Eng Leong received a call
                    from Amy who enquired whether the joint account had been opened. After Eng Leong
                    informed Amy that the Bank’s management was still considering the issue,
                    Amy replied that if it was so difficult for the joint account to be opened, the
                    plaintiff would close her accounts with the Bank instead. Amy said she would
                    come by with the plaintiff on 22 May 2008 to close all the latter’s
                    accounts. Eng Leong conveyed Amy’s message to Denis, who decided that the
                    Bank’s senior management would meet the plaintiff on 22 May 2008 to
                    determine if she understood what she was doing.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     On 22 May 2008, Siau Kee Liam
                    (“Siau”) (who is the Bank’s head of operational risk
                    management &amp; compliance) sent an email to Eng Leong setting out the
                    questions (‘list of questions’) he had prepared to ask the plaintiff
                    at the meeting that same day. The email was copied to Denis, Sar Lee, Peter Wong
                    and Christian Wong (both were from the Bank’s legal
                department).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The meeting at the Bank’s premises on 22 May
                2008</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     Amy and the plaintiff arrived at the
                    Bank’s premises at around 4pm. That was the first time Eng Leong met Amy.
                    Eng Leong led them to a room to meet Denis, Siau and Jo Goh, who is a compliance
                    officer with the Bank. (All the Bank’s representatives at the meeting
                    testified at the trial.) Amy introduced herself as the plaintiff’s
                    daughter and informed those present that the plaintiff wished to close all her
                    bank accounts with the Bank. Siau informed Amy that since the plaintiff’s
                    accounts were in the plaintiff’s sole name, the Bank would have to receive
                    instructions to close her accounts directly from the plaintiff.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     According to Siau, Amy became agitated on
                    hearing his request. She spoke to the plaintiff in Cantonese, saying that the
                    Bank was suspecting Amy of trying to cheat the plaintiff of her money. Amy then
                    told the plaintiff in a very commanding and loud voice that if the plaintiff did
                    not transfer the money to her and close all her accounts without the Bank, the
                    plaintiff would lose all her money. Siau viewed Amy’s statement as
                    involving elements of threat and control. The plaintiff kept silent when Amy was
                    speaking to her. After making those statements, Amy agreed to leave the meeting
                    room. Eng Leong and Siau noticed that the plaintiff became at ease after Amy
                    left. On the other hand, Amy’s version of the incident was that the
                    plaintiff was upset that Amy had to leave the meeting room as she wanted Amy to
                    be ‘her ears’ at the meeting.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     The Bank began the meeting by asking the
                    plaintiff based on the list of questions which it intended only to use as a
                    guide. However, the Bank was only able to ask the plaintiff questions 1 to 4 and
                    question 12 on the list of questions during the meeting.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     Eng Leong asked the plaintiff whether she knew
                    where she was, the plaintiff shook her head and said she did not know. When he
                    told the plaintiff that she was at the Bank’s premises, she replied that
                    she had an account with the Bank. Eng Leong then asked the plaintiff if she
                    remembered who he was. The plaintiff shook her head and said no. Eng Leong
                    further asked the plaintiff whether she knew why she was at the Bank’s
                    premises. The plaintiff shook her head and responded that she did not know why
                    she was there. She however said that she was a customer of the Bank. Next, Eng
                    Leong questioned the plaintiff whether she knew how much money she had deposited
                    with the Bank. The plaintiff replied that she was not sure but she knew she had
                    banked with the latter for many years and should therefore have quite a lot of
                    money with the Bank.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     Crucially, Eng Leong asked the plaintiff
                    whether she wanted to close her accounts with the Bank. The plaintiff replied
                    that there was no need to as she had no problems with the Bank. When Eng Leong
                    asked the plaintiff who was the lady who had accompanied her to the Bank’s
                    premises, she said that it was her niece. When Eng Leong asked the plaintiff who
                    was Amy Hsu, the plaintiff said that Amy was her daughter. Eng Leong asked
                        <em>for the second time</em> whether the plaintiff
                    wanted to close her joint account. The plaintiff replied that she was happy with
                    the Bank and there was no need to close her accounts. The meeting lasted about
                    ten minutes.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     Denis was silent throughout the meeting. He
                    did not speak to the plaintiff nor did he ask her any questions. The other
                    officers present translated to him in English what Amy had said to the plaintiff
                    in Cantonese. Denis expressed shock at what Amy told the plaintiff at <a href="#p1_28">[28]</a> above, that the plaintiff would lose all her
                    money if she did not transfer it out of the Bank.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     It was the Bank’s evidence that the
                    meeting with the plaintiff was interrupted and ended abruptly when Amy stormed
                    into the room and demanded that its officers stop talking to the plaintiff. Amy
                    told the Bank’s officers that they would hear from her lawyers, slammed
                    the door and left. When Eng Leong asked who Amy’s lawyer was, she replied
                    ‘AE’.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     Contrary to Amy’s assertion (in
                    para 18 of the statement of claim), Eng Leong denied that he had suggested
                    to Amy that it would facilitate the operation of the plaintiff’s accounts
                    if Amy procured a power of attorney from the plaintiff. I find it highly
                    improbable that Eng Leong would make such a suggestion when he and his
                    colleagues were already very concerned about the mental state of the
                    plaintiff’s health or that he would follow Amy out after she had slammed
                    the meeting room door in his face and left in a huff.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Exchange of correspondence subsequent to the meeting of 22 May
                2008</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     By a letter dated 28 May 2008,
                    Amy’s solicitor AE demanded an apology and an explanation from the Bank on
                    the plaintiff’s behalf for the Bank’s non-compliance with her
                    instructions. Denis testified that the Bank was convinced that the 28 May
                    2008 letter had not been written on the plaintiff’s instructions due to
                    the plaintiff’s answer at the 22 May 2008 meeting that she did not
                    want to close her accounts with the Bank. The Bank informed AE by a letter dated
                    6 June 2008 that the Bank needed confirmation from the plaintiff that the
                    Bank was authorised to disclose privileged customer information to
                AE.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     By a letter dated 10 June 2008, AE
                    enclosed a letter dated 6 June 2008 which stated that AE was fully
                    authorised to write to the Bank by the letter dated 28 May 2008. However,
                    the Bank’s position was that this letter dated 6 June 2008 was a
                    ‘red flag’ of possible fraud against the plaintiff, because
                        <em>the signature on the letter was inconsistent with the
                        plaintiff’s specimen signature</em> on record with the Bank.
                    Denis testified that it was a basic practice on the part of a banker to compare
                    signatures, and highlighted the inconsistencies in the plaintiff’s
                    signature in the letter dated 6 June 2008.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     First, Denis observed that the signature there
                    was an extended signature with a slight angle. Second, the ‘H’ of
                    the specimen signature was a straightforward one with two vertical bars and one
                    horizontal bar, whereas the ‘H’ in the signature found on the
                    6 June letter was a complex one with a spiral on one of the vertical bars.
                    Third, the ‘W’ and ‘G’ were different. Siau, Jo, Eng
                    Leong, Eu Jin, as well as staff from the Bank’s fraud department had
                    compared the plaintiff’s signature on the letter dated 6 June 2008
                    with the Bank’s specimen of her signature and agreed that it was not the
                    plaintiff’s signature. Denis contended that the signature could have been
                    made by Amy.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     The Bank wrote on 17 June 2008 to AE, to
                    say that as the signature in the letter dated 6 June 2008 differed from the
                    plaintiff’s specimen signature, the Bank was unable to disclose any
                    customer information to AE. The letter requested to be furnished with a fresh
                    consent in writing from the plaintiff which bore the same signature as that kept
                    in the Bank’s records.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     On 18 June 2008, the Bank received a
                    letter dated 16 June 2008 purportedly written by the plaintiff that
                    appointed Amy “with the power to authorise all [the plaintiff’s]
                    correspondence and instructions with immediate effect”. The letter of
                    appointment was signed by Amy on behalf of the plaintiff (“the
                    self-authorizing letter”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     The Bank replied on 19 June 2008 to the
                    plaintiff to say that the self-authorizing letter dated 16 June 2008 was
                    ineffective as it had not been signed by the plaintiff. AE replied on
                    24 June 2008 to inquire how much longer the Bank intended to prolong the
                    charade. The letter enclosed a letter dated 20 June 2008 apparently signed by
                    the plaintiff before a notary public, confirming it was her signature on the
                    letter dated 6 June 2008.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     AE wrote on 24 June 2008 in reply to the
                    defendant’s letter dated 17 June 2008 and repeated the demand for an
                    explanation for the alleged non-compliance with the plaintiff’s
                    instructions. The Bank replied to AE on 9 July 2008 stating it had not had
                    sight of a Warrant to Act signed by the plaintiff appointing AE as her
                    solicitors.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     The Bank wrote to the plaintiff separately
                    9 July 2008, stating that as her bankers, they had a duty at law to
                    “take reasonable steps to ensure that [the Bank] act only in accordance
                    with [the plaintiff’s] instructions and not otherwise”. The letter
                    stated that the Bank had concerns with the plaintiff’s “current
                    state of health”, as well as the self-authorizing letter of Amy dated
                    16 June 2008. The Bank proposed a face-to-face meeting with the plaintiff,
                    so as to allay the Bank’s concerns and to verify the plaintiff’s
                    instructions.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     AE responded on 15 July 2008 challenging
                    the Bank to “state the basis, medical or otherwise, for [its] assertion
                    that [the plaintiff’s] health is a matter of concern”. AE added,
                    “if [the Bank had] a medical report to support [its] allegation, please
                    forward the same for [AE’s] perusal”. AE rejected the Bank’s
                    proposal of a face-to-face meeting. AE claimed that the plaintiff was unwilling
                    to subject herself to “another inquisition” adding that apart from
                    mental stress and anxiety caused by the Bank’s refusal to follow the
                    plaintiff’s instructions, her health was “<em>perfectly satisfactory</em>”. AE also enclosed a copy of the
                    2008 Power of Attorney.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     The Bank wrote to the plaintiff on
                    18 July 2008 pointing out that the 2008 Power of Attorney raised more
                    questions than answers. The Bank said that if the 2008 Power of Attorney existed
                    on 29 May 2008 and was genuine, it would have been produced to the Bank
                    earlier and the self-authorizing letter of Amy would have been
                    ‘redundant’. The Bank added it was willing to carry out the
                    plaintiff’s mandate if, in the course of any court proceedings, it was
                    established that the plaintiff was in a position to validly provide
                    instructions.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     By a letter dated 3 August 2008, Amy
                    complained to the Bank’s chairman. Denis replied on the Bank’s
                    behalf on 15 August 2008 stating that from its interaction with the
                    plaintiff since around April 2008, the Bank came to believe that the plaintiff
                    may not have the necessary mental capacity to provide the Bank with any
                    instructions. The letter stated that “the Bank will act if a reputable
                    specialist opinion regarding the customer’s mental capacity is produced,
                    or a committee of persons is appointed by the court”. The Bank pointed
                    out that the face-to-face meeting it proposed to the plaintiff was intended to
                    explore the Bank’s concerns. It requested the plaintiff to reconsider this
                    proposal. Until the Bank’s concerns were addressed, the Bank stated it
                    could not accept instructions in relation to all of the plaintiff’s
                    accounts.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     I should add that besides writing to the
                    Bank’s chairman, Amy also complained about the Bank’s
                    “unreasonable conduct” to the Monetary Authority of Singapore on
                    4 August 2008. She further complained to her Member of Parliament at
                    “a Meet-the-People” session prompting the latter to write to the
                    Bank’s chief executive officer on 29 May 2009.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     According to Denis, the Bank tried to be
                    diplomatic and tactful. As such, it did not make a direct request for a medical
                    report but instead highlighted its concerns about the plaintiff’s
                    “current state of health” in its aforesaid letter. However, due to
                    the uncooperative stance taken by Amy and the plaintiff’s solicitor as
                    shown in the chain of correspondence set out in the preceding paragraphs, the
                    Bank had no option but to write the letter dated 15 August 2008 stating its
                    concerns about the plaintiff’s mental capacity.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     In a letter dated 21 August 2008 from AE
                    to the Bank’s solicitors (“R&amp;T”), there was a <em>volte face</em> by the plaintiff. Contrary to the stand she
                    had taken in AE’s letter dated 15 July 2008, AE indicated that the
                    plaintiff (accompanied by Amy) was willing to have a face- to-face meeting with
                    Eng Leong with a view to an amicable resolution to her demand for closure of her
                    accounts. However, AE added that there was no necessity for the plaintiff
                    “to face a panel of three bank officials and the Bank’s legal
                    advisers”. In its letter dated 28 August 2008, R&amp;T accepted
                    AE’s proposal and indicated that besides Eng Leong, two other officers of
                    the Bank would attend the meeting together with the Bank’s
                counsel.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     Notwithstanding the meeting proposed between
                    the parties, the writ of summons herein was served on R&amp;T on
                    2 September 2008. On 10 September 2008, AE replied to R&amp;T to
                    inquire who were the Bank’s two other officers who would be attending the
                    meeting, adding that the plaintiff was not comfortable with Denis and did not
                    want to see him. This was a strange comment considering that Denis had not, at
                    the meeting on 22 May 2008 (see <a href="#p1_32">[32]</a>),
                    said a word to the plaintiff or at all.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     On 12 September 2008, R&amp;T informed AE
                    that the Bank no longer considered a meeting necessary, given that the matter
                    was before the court. On 14 April 2009, the balance sum of monies in the
                    plaintiff’s accounts with the Bank ($8,805,843.14) was paid into Court
                    pursuant to an Order of Court dated 26 March 2009. By the time of the
                    trial, Amy had made three applications to court for payments out, from the
                    monies paid into court. Subsequently, she made two similar applications to this
                    court.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     On 14 December 2009, Amy was appointed
                    the plaintiff’s litigation representative. By then, the plaintiff no
                    longer had the capacity to act for herself because of her advanced dementia. In
                    fact, the plaintiff did not/could not testify for her case. To all intents and
                    purposes, this was Amy’s suit against the Bank.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The Court Expert</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     Dr Francis Ngui
                    (“Dr Ngui”) was appointed as the court expert by order of
                    court dated 5 December 2008. Dr Ngui conducted his first medical
                    examination of the plaintiff <em>on 15 January
                        2009</em>. Dr Ngui observed that the plaintiff was a feisty lady
                    with a witty personality. However, the plaintiff was disoriented as to day and
                    date and she could not give her identity card number or full address. The
                    plaintiff’s Clock Drawing Test was satisfactory. In Dr Ngui’s
                    report dated 19 October 2009 (Dr Ngui’s report) at
                    para [37], he stated his finding that the plaintiff showed significant
                    defects in orientation and memory recall.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     On or about 8 August 2009, Dr Ngui
                    conducted his second medical examination of the plaintiff in the presence of
                    Dr Sitoh. Her condition had worsened by then. Dr Ngui observed that
                    the plaintiff was frail, much thinner, and breathless at times. She appeared to
                    have lost her ability to speak in English, and her Clock Drawing Test was
                    grossly abnormal. The plaintiff was able to give her address as
                    ‘Waterside, second floor’ and house number ‘02’
                    correctly. However, she said she was in Turkey and then England.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     Dr Ngui’s report included his
                    perusal of the medical reports of Drs Lim, Kang, Teo and Sitoh. In
                    Dr Ngui’s report, he concluded that up until the time he saw the
                    plaintiff on 15 January 2009, the stage of her dementia had remained in the
                    mild stage. Dr Ngui opined that the home visit by the Bank’s officers
                    on 15 May 2008 would have been somewhat daunting to the plaintiff, and she
                    could have been overwhelmed and stressed by the questions put to
                her.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     Dr Ngui added that up to 15 January
                    2009, the plaintiff had been mentally competent to manage her financial affairs
                    as well as to provide instructions to others in relation to her bank accounts.
                    Dr Ngui further stated that generally, cognitive functions in dementia
                    fluctuate over time. He found that the plaintiff did have episodes where she was
                    less lucid, due to physical infirmities which aggravated her cognitive function
                    such that she could be temporarily deemed unfit to manage her financial affairs
                    or to give instructions during those episodes of ill health.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The Pleadings</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The plaintiff’s case</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     In the statement of claim, the plaintiff
                    claimed the sum of $8,832,862.30 representing the credit balance in the
                    plaintiff’s accounts maintained with the Bank. The plaintiff contended
                    that the Bank was in breach of contract for its failure to follow her
                    instructions as the customer, to close all her accounts with the Bank and to
                    repay the monies standing to her credit in those accounts.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     The plaintiff further contended that the Bank
                    had failed in its duty of care to act prudently. The plaintiff complained that;
                    (i) after having been attended by Eu Jin on 13 May 2008, Amy told Eu Jin to
                    inform Eng Leong to contact Amy before she left for Australia but Eng Leong had
                    made no attempts to call Amy before the home visit; (ii) between 13 May
                    2008 and 22 May 2008, Eng Leong should have done more to investigate the
                    relationship between the plaintiff and Amy; (iii) the Bank as prudent bankers
                    ought to have “done more than defer the opening of the joint
                    account”; (iv) the Bank ought to have verified with its officers who had
                    previously dealt with the plaintiff and Amy so as to establish their
                    relationship; (v) the Bank should have acknowledged Amy as the plaintiff’s
                    authorised attorney under the 2008 Power of Attorney.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a>58     The plaintiff noted that the Bank’s
                    letter to Amy dated 15 August 2008 had claimed that the Bank would act if,
                        <em>inter alia</em>, a reputable specialist opinion on
                    the plaintiff’s mental capacity was produced. The plaintiff argued that
                    since the Bank had been served with Dr Lim’s psychiatric report on
                    3 October 2008, the Bank should have acted thereon to close the
                    plaintiff’s accounts.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a>59     The plaintiff’s position was that as a
                    prudent banker would have done, the Bank should have checked if the plaintiff
                    had other joint accounts with the Bank. The plaintiff had a joint account with
                    her nephew Michael and on 13 March 2008, Michael had, jointly with the
                    plaintiff, given instructions to the Bank to place a sum of $3,497,671.08 in a
                    fixed deposit account in the plaintiff’s name. The plaintiff submitted
                    that the Bank should have verified with Michael the plaintiff’s mental
                    condition and that she had the capacity to give joint instructions with him on
                    13 March 2008.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a>60     In addition, the plaintiff asserted that the
                    Bank’s failure to close her accounts and to repay her the monies standing
                    to her credit in those accounts had deprived her of the use of her monies,
                    specifically the opportunity to purchase an apartment at a new development
                    called ‘De-Centurion’ which was opposite The Waterside. The
                    plaintiff claimed damages to be assessed in respect of the loss of bargain in
                    the property market, alternatively, for the loss of use of the monies in her
                    accounts. The plaintiff further sought an order from the court that the accounts
                    she maintained with the Bank be closed.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The defendant’s case</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a>61     In its defence, the Bank contended that it had
                    acted in accordance with the duty of care imposed on them by law to withhold
                    payment and that any reasonable and prudent bank in the same circumstances would
                    have been put on notice, and would have regarded its actions
                justifiable.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_62"></a>62     The Bank contended that it had no duty to
                    contact Amy or to take her instructions as she was not the Bank’s
                    customer. At all times, the Bank was in a banker-customer relationship with the
                    plaintiff only.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_63"></a>63     The Bank argued that it had no duty to
                    investigate the relationship between the plaintiff and Amy and that it had no
                    duty to do more than to defer the opening of the joint account as the plaintiff
                    herself confirmed she did not want to open such an account. The Bank further
                    contended that neither Amy nor Michael were qualified persons to confirm the
                    plaintiff’s mental capacity. The Bank was further prevented by banking
                    secrecy from asking Amy or Michael on a customer’s mental
                capacity.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_64"></a>64     The Bank contended that the medical reports by
                    Drs Lim and Kang, as furnished to the Bank did not address the issue of the
                    plaintiff’s mental capacity to give instructions in relation to her bank
                    accounts. The Bank emphasized that the request in its letter of 15 August
                    2008 for a reputable specialist opinion was meant to address its doubts as to
                    whether the plaintiff had the necessary mental capacity to give instructions in
                    respect of her accounts.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Issues</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_65"></a>65     The main issue here is <em>not</em> whether the plaintiff had, on a balance of probabilities,
                    the mental capacity to operate her bank accounts with the Bank. That is not the
                    crux of the problem. The plaintiff’s cause of action was for breach of
                    contract. On the facts of this case, it is clear that the Bank had no knowledge
                    of the plaintiff’s dementia at the material time when the apparent
                    instructions for her bank accounts were given in May 2008. Consequently, the
                    issue is:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id=""></a>Given the Bank’s knowledge of the circumstances
                        surrounding the apparent instructions from the plaintiff, did the Bank
                        breach its contractual obligations by failing to:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_65-p2_a"></a>(a)     follow the plaintiff’s
                        instructions to open a joint account and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_65-p2_b"></a>(b)     to close all her accounts with the Bank and
                        paying to her the amounts standing to her credit in those
                    accounts?</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The legal principles underpinning the relationship between a
                bank’s duty to follow its customer’s instructions and its duty to take
                reasonable care</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_66"></a>66     The Court of Appeal in <em>Yogambikai Nagarajah v. Indian Overseas Bank and another appeal</em>
                    [1996] 2 SLR(R) 774 (‘<em>Yogambikai</em>’) clarified that a bank’s contractual duty to
                    make payment on the demand of the account holder co-exists with a contractual
                    duty to take reasonable care in all the circumstances as agent of the account
                    holder. As Lai Kew Chai J observed at [53]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">“The relationship between the bank and the deposit account holder
                        is premised on the debtor-creditor relationship. It carries with it the
                        obligation on the part of the bank to honour the customer's mandate as
                        regards the payment of money from that account. The bank's duty to pay on
                        the demand of an account holder however co-exists with a duty to take
                        reasonable care in all the circumstances as agent of the account holder. The
                        duty to take reasonable care in the discharge of its obligations under the
                        contract between banker and customer <em>includes withholding
                            payment</em> where there has been fraudulent conduct resulting in
                        wrongful loss by a party. In <em>Bank of New South Wales v
                            Goulburn Valley Butter Company Proprietary</em>
                        [1902] AC 543, Lord Davey at 550 said: "The law is well-settled
                        that <em>in the absence of notice of fraud or
                            irregularity</em> a banker is bound to honour his customer's
                        cheque." Of course, where somebody cries "Fraud!", it is not always the case
                        that the bank must withhold payment. The question in every case, including
                        the present, is whether the <em>bank behaved reasonably in
                            view of all the circumstances and discharged its duty of
                        care</em>.</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_67"></a>67     The Court of Appeal in <em>Yogambikai</em> considered the decisions in <em>Selangor United Rubber Estates Ltd v Cradock (No 3)</em> [1968]
                    2 Lloyd's Rep 289 (‘<em>Cradock’</em>) and <em>Lipkin Gorman v Karpnale

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_68"></a>68     In <em>Cradock</em>, a
                    bank’s customer had been defrauded by the acts of the customer’s
                    agents. The customer alleged that its paying bank was liable for, <em>inter alia</em>, breach of contract. The relevant transaction
                    involved the take-over of a company and it was carried out in a meeting attended
                    by the company’s directors and an officer of the company’s bank. In
                    the meeting, a cheque of a huge amount drawn on the company’s account was
                    exchanged for a banker’s draft issued by the bank. The effect of this
                    arrangement was that the company had lent money to a middleman, who had in turn
                    undertaken to lend a similar amount to the makers of the take-over bid to
                    finance the take-over. The bank was unaware that such an arrangement was a
                    breach of the financial assistance rule. The company went into liquidation and
                    the Official Receiver sought to recover the money from the bank.
                    Ungoed-Thomas J, in finding that the bank had failed its duty of care,
                    observed at p 324:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…a bank has a duty under its contract with its customer to exercise
                        'reasonable care and skill' in carrying out its part with regard to
                        operations within its contract with its customer. The standard of that
                        reasonable care and skill is an objective standard applicable to bankers.
                        Whether or not it has been attained in any particular case has to be decided
                        in the light of all the relevant facts, which can vary almost infinitely.
                        The relevant considerations include the prima facie assumption that men are
                        honest, the practice of bankers, the very limited time in which banks have
                        to decide what course to take with regard a cheque presented for payment
                        without risking liability for delay, and the extent to which an operation is
                        unusual or out of the ordinary course of business. <em>An
                            operation which is reasonably consonant with the normal conduct of
                            business</em> (such as payment by a stockbroker into his account
                        of proceeds of sale of his client's shares) <em>of necessity
                            does not suggest that it is out of the ordinary course of
                            business</em>. <em>If 'reasonable care and skill'
                            is brought to the consideration of such an operation, it clearly does
                            not call for any intervention by the bank</em>. What intervention
                        is appropriate in that exercise of reasonable care and skill again depends
                        on circumstances. Where it is to inquire, the failure to make inquiry is not
                        excused by the conviction that the inquiry would be futile, or that the
                        answer would be false.</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_69"></a>69     The Court of Appeal in <em>Yogambikai</em> endorsed Ungoed-Thomas J's formulation of a
                    bank’s duty of care but had expressed doubts over whether the law had been
                    applied too harshly against the bank in that case. The Court of Appeal further
                    considered the decision in <em>Lipkin Gorman</em> and
                    accepted its position that when a bank is faced with what appears to be a
                    genuine mandate presented by an agent acting within his authority, the bank's
                    duty of care did not require it to do anything other than to honour the mandate
                    in the absence of circumstances which put the bank on enquiry.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_70"></a>70     In <em>Lipkin
                    Gorman</em>, Lloyds Bank plc had appealed against, <em>inter alia</em>, a finding of liability for breach of contract. A
                    partner in a firm of solicitors who had become a compulsive gambler, misused his
                    authority to draw cheques on the firm’s clients’ account. At certain
                    times, the cheques made payable to “cash” were honoured by the
                    bank over the counter when presented on the partner’s behalf by a clerk.
                    At other times, cheques were made payable to a building society from whose
                    account the partner withdrew the proceeds, and at other times, the cheques were
                    made payable to the bank itself. The branch manager had knowledge of the
                    partner’s gambling activities and was aware that the method used for the
                    drawing of the cheques was unusual, but he had failed to inform the other
                    partners in the solicitors’ firm.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_71"></a>71     May L.J. found (at p 1356) that
                    Ungoed-Thomas J had in <em>Cradock</em> stated the
                    duty of care too highly and held that in the absence of abnormal circumstances
                    which put a bank on inquiry, the paying bank would have to honour the
                    customer’s mandate in making payment out to the customer; he said:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The relationship between the [Bank and customer] is contractual. The
                        principal obligation is on the bank to honour its customers' cheques in
                        accordance with its mandate on instructions. There is nothing in such a
                        contract, express or implied, which could require a banker to consider the
                        commercial wisdom or otherwise of the particular transaction. Nor is there
                        normally any express term in the contract requiring the banker to exercise
                        any degree of care in deciding whether to honour a customer's cheque which
                        his instructions require him to pay. In my opinion any implied term
                        requiring the banker to exercise care must be limited. To a substantial
                        extent the banker's obligation under such a contract is largely automatic or
                        mechanical. Presented with a cheque drawn in accordance with the terms of
                        that contract, the banker must honour it save in what I would expect to be
                        exceptional circumstances.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_72"></a>72     In <em>Barclays Bank plc v.
                        Quincecare</em> [1992] 4 All ER 363 (‘<em>Quincecare</em>’), the Court held that it was an
                    implied term of the contract between a bank and its customer that the bank would
                    observe reasonable care and skill in and about executing the customer’s
                    orders. Steyn J held that a bank was under a duty to refrain from executing
                    an order (given by the agent of the bank’s customer) if and for so long as
                    he was put on inquiry in the sense that he had <em>reasonable
                        grounds</em> (although not necessarily proof) for believing that the
                    order was an attempt to misappropriate the customer’s funds. Steyn J
                    was of the view that if a bank acted on the order despite knowing the order to
                    be dishonestly given, or shut its eyes to the obvious fact of the dishonesty, or
                    acted recklessly in failing to make such inquiries as an honest and reasonable
                    bank would do, the bank would plainly be liable.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_73"></a>73     The position in <em>Quincecare</em> has been applied in <em>Verjee v. CIBC
                        Bank Trust (Channel Islands) Limited</em> [2004] All ER (D) 183
                        (‘<em>Verjee’</em>). In <em>Verjee</em>, the customer had given a Mr Sonjy two blank cheques
                    drawn on CIBC and signed by the customer on the understanding that Mr Sonjy
                    would not present the cheques for payment except for the purpose of withdrawing
                    commissions owing from their joint enterprise. Mr Sonjy presented the cheques,
                    and even though the customer had a nil balance in his account and had not
                    applied for overdraft facilities, the bank honoured the cheques. The court found
                    that in the circumstances where the apparent signatory of the cheques is himself
                    the account holder, there was no reason for the bank not to believe that the
                    signature signed was not genuine, and as such, the bank was not placed on
                    enquiry.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_74"></a>74     It is clear from the above authorities that
                    the Bank’s contractual duty to honour payment instructions in accordance
                    with the customer’s mandate is not an absolute one. There is no duty on
                    the Bank to follow the customer’s instructions to make payment under any
                    circumstances because its obligation to honour payment instructions is qualified
                    by its contractual duty to take reasonable care in carrying out its operations
                    within its contract with its customer. The question is whether a reasonable and
                    prudent banker with knowledge of the relevant circumstances would have withheld
                    payment because of a serious or real possibility of an irregularity. The
                    relevant irregularity differs from case to case, it could be that the customer
                    might be defrauded, that the customer might make financial decisions regarding
                    her accounts under undue influence or that the customer lacked the mental
                    capacity to make financial decisions regarding her accounts. In particular, the
                    English Court of Appeal decision of <em>Drew v. Nunn</em>
                    [1879] 4 QBD 661 highlighted that any pre-existing mandate between an
                    agent and the principal is revoked upon the agent’s <em>knowledge</em> of the principal’s incapacity. It was further
                    observed in <em>Paget’s Law of Banking</em>
                        (13<sup>th</sup> Ed, LexisNexis Butterworths) p 478
                    that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">If the state of the customer’s mind is such that he does not know
                        what he is doing, he can give no mandate and any existing mandate is
                        revoked; but i<em>f the bank has no knowledge and no reason
                            to suspect</em>, then the mandate is operative. <em>What is sufficient to entitle a banker to refuse to obey his
                            customer’s mandate, on the ground that he is suffering from a
                            mental disorder depriving him of mental capacity, is not easy to
                            define</em>. The opinion of the customer’s medical
                        practitioner would be a guide but not conclusive, though if he advised
                        positively that his patient was of sound mind, the banker would normally be
                        justified in paying.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_75"></a>75     The above view is reiterated in <em>Halsbury’s Laws of Singapore 2007</em> reissue Lexis
                    Volume 12 at p 195 para 140.223:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">A mentally ill or otherwise incapable person, as a general rule, cannot be
                        a customer of a bank. Where a bank learns that one of its customers has
                        become mentally ill, all operations on the account must be stopped, pending
                        the establishment of any appropriate arrangement under the relevant
                        statutory provision relating to mental illness.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_76"></a>76     Based on this general rule that a bank’s
                    pre-existing mandate is revoked by its <em>knowledge</em>
                    of the customer’s mental incapacity, it must <em>necessarily</em> be implied into the contract between a bank and its
                    customer that the bank should not (and is entitled not to) proceed with the
                    relevant banking transaction if the circumstances are such that they put the
                    bank <em>on inquiry</em> of the customer’s mental
                    capacity. The evidence of suspicious circumstances must necessarily be based on
                    an objective standard (per Slade L.J. in <em>Lipkin
                        Gorman</em> at p 1378).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_77"></a>77     While the Bank should not question the
                    commercial wisdom of the relevant transaction, if there are <em>reasonable</em> grounds to believe that the person attempting to make
                    a withdrawal lacks authority (as an example of an irregularity) to give a valid
                    mandate, then the Bank would be placed on enquiry. The mere suspicion of the
                    Bank does not constitute reasonable grounds. In the determination of whether
                    there are reasonable grounds of belief, reference could be made to banking
                    practice and commercial realities. For instance, the Court of Appeal in
                        <em>Lipkin Gorman</em> found that in view of the
                    substantial number of cheques handled daily by the branch, and having regard to
                    cheques drawn in the past by the partner, the bank there was not placed on
                    enquiry.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_78"></a>78     If the answer to the test is ‘no’,
                    such that the reasonable and prudent banker with knowledge of the circumstances
                    would not consider that there was a serious possibility of the irregularity,
                    then the Bank is not placed on inquiry and <em>all that the
                        Bank’s duty of care</em> requires it to do is to carry out the
                    customer’s mandate as per an <em>ordinary
                        transaction</em> with due care and diligence. If however, the answer
                    to the test is ‘yes’, such that the facts would have placed a
                    reasonable and prudent bank on inquiry, the Court must decide whether a bank had
                    acted reasonably <em>in the context of those irregular
                        circumstances</em>. This is an objective standard. The test as stated
                    in <em>Yogambikai</em> is whether a reasonably prudent
                    banker, faced with the same circumstances, would regard the course of action
                    taken on the facts as justifiable. Just as in the first inquiry, reference could
                    be made to banking practice and commercial realities to determine what the
                    reasonably prudent bank would have done, although it must be noted that banking
                    practice evolves over time.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_79"></a>79     The important point is this – the
                    reasonableness of the actions carried out by a bank would be decisively
                    influenced by the nature of those irregular circumstances that placed the bank
                    on inquiry. For example, if the bank had reasonable grounds to believe that
                    there is i<em>n fact</em> no mandate, or that the customer
                    lacks capacity to give instructions, the bank would, at most times, be justified
                    in acting against the customer’s apparent mandate by refusing payment of
                    monies out of the customer’s account. If so, there would have been no
                    breach of the contractual duty to honour payment instructions in accordance with
                    the customer’s mandate. Nonetheless, the general principle remains that
                    whether or not a bank has acted reasonably, and <em>the specific
                        steps or inquiries</em> that it ought to make, must be decided in the
                    light of all the relevant facts.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_80"></a>80     At this juncture, I make the observation that
                        <em>Lipkin Gorman</em> did not change the test for a
                    bank’s duty of care as stated by Ungoed-Thomas J in <em>Cradock</em>. Given the facts in <em>Lipkin
                        Gorman</em>, the Court of Appeal found that the circumstances were
                    insufficient to place the bank there on inquiry. In <em>Cradock</em>, the Court’s finding that the bank there had
                    failed to take reasonable care <em>presupposed</em> that
                    the circumstances in that case have placed the bank on inquiry. As such, the
                    difference lies in the two courts’ interpretation of the two different
                    sets of factual circumstances, where only the factual circumstances in <em>Cradock</em> were (implicitly) found to have placed the bank
                    there on inquiry. As the Court of Appeal observed in <em>Bank of
                        America National Trust Savings Association v. Herman Iskandar and
                        another</em> [1998] 1 SLR(R) 848 at para [47]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<em>Lipkin Gorman</em> was concerned with how the
                        reasonable banker test should be applied in the context of whether a bank
                        had been negligent in honouring a cheque drawn within the authority of its
                        customer's agent without enquiries. The formulation of the reasonable banker
                        test in ordinary transactions remained the same, but the criticism only went
                        to when the court should hold that the bank would be put on inquiry, and its
                        failure to investigate amount to negligence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_81"></a>81     I would add that if the factual circumstances
                    in <em>Cradock</em> in 1968 were to be considered in line
                    with present banking practice and commercial realities, a court would be slow to
                    find that the bank there was put on inquiry, from the <em>mere</em> circumstance where a huge sum of monies standing to the
                    credit of the customer’s (a company’s) account was lent to another
                    financial institution.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_82"></a>82     It would be apposite at this point to refer to
                    an article by the Australian Credit Union Dispute Resolution Centre,
                        “<em>Financial Abuse of the Vulnerable Older
                        Person</em>”, May 2008, that provides guidance on a
                    bank’s duty of care to elderly customers. While the guidelines are not
                    binding, I find that they are helpful in understanding how a reasonable bank
                    might respond to allegations of impropriety. The article stated that apart from
                    situations of criminal conduct and fraud, there is a grey area of financial
                    abuse of the elderly. This happens where the conduct is ‘improper’,
                    where an existing relationship of trust or dependence may cloud the question of
                    consent; at p 4 of the article:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">What is meant by improper? We think it covers conduct by a third party
                        which may fall short of criminal conduct but which is within the realm of
                        civil law and equity – conduct which involves, for example,
                        intimidation, deceit, coercion, emotional manipulation, physical neglect,
                        psychological abuse, undue influence or empty promises.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_83"></a>83     It also explained that banks should not make
                    payment when they are placed on notice of the customer’s mental incapacity
                    (at p 12):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">A credit union officer is not expected to be a detective and is entitled
                        to proceed on the <em>prima facie</em> assumption that

                        to the contrary. It is the indications to the contrary that are the
                        important qualification. A credit union officer is not entitled to turn a
                        blind eye to known facts that indicate that there is a serious possibility
                        that a member is being defrauded or that the funds are being
                        misappropriated.</p>

                        their ability to understand the nature of the decision and what they are
                        doing by making it.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_84"></a>84     The article observed that a bank may be placed
                    on actual or constructive notice, and the ‘observable indications’

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_85"></a>85     Further, the article cautioned bank officers

<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The Findings</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The Bank’s refusal to open a joint account</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_86"></a>86     The evidence here showed several red flags
                    that would place a reasonable and prudent bank on enquiry. The plaintiff had
                    kept quiet and had appeared dazed when Eu Jin attended to her for the opening of
                    the account on 13 May 2008. She was <em>staring into blank
                        space</em> while Amy was the <em>one doing all the
                        talking</em>. All the instructions to open the joint account came from
                    a non-customer (Amy), to whom the Bank owed no contractual duties. This aspect
                    of Eu Jin’s testimony was not challenged by the plaintiff’s counsel
                    nor was evidence adduced to contradict what Eu Jin said.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_87"></a>87     When Eu Jin tried to stress to the plaintiff
                    that her monies in the existing accounts would all be paid into the joint
                    account, the plaintiff remained non responsive and <em>again
                        stared into blank space</em>. The plaintiff did not even nod her head
                    to give a response. Although Amy deposed in her affidavit (at [32]) that Eu Jin
                    had not said a word to the plaintiff, her evidence was not put to Eu Jin during
                    cross-examination. Eu Jin had no opportunity to respond to Amy’s contrary
                    assertion. This was so even when Eu Jin had reiterated several times in Court
                    that the plaintiff had been staring into blank space despite repeated attempts
                    to talk to her. Indeed, looking at the questions asked during his
                    cross-examination, they were premised on Eu Jin having spoken to and given
                    explanations to the plaintiff. It was also not put to Eu Jin that he had not
                    spoken to the plaintiff at all.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_88"></a>88     In addition, Eu Jin gave evidence that when he
                    was explaining the account opening procedure to the plaintiff, Amy suddenly
                    interrupted and gave the peremptory command ‘Qin Meng!’
                    [??!] requiring the plaintiff to sign the account opening
                    form. The plaintiff then signed the account opening form without saying
                    anything. Lead counsel (“Khoo”) for the plaintiff did not dispute
                    Eu Jin’s account of events that fateful day. He sought to explain the
                    plaintiff’s behaviour by contending that as Eu Jin was attempting to speak
                    in a polite manner, it was plausible that the plaintiff, being hard of hearing,
                    did not hear Eu Jin and was therefore unresponsive. Eu Jin, however,
                    satisfactorily disposed of Khoo’s arguments when he testified that he was
                    mindful of that possibility and therefore placed his hand in front of the
                    plaintiff and moved in closer and spoke louder to her, so as to let her know
                    that he was talking to her. Eu Jin’s evidence was that the plaintiff still
                    stared blankly into space when he did that; I accept his evidence. Although it
                    was pointed out to Eu Jin that this evidence was not stated in his affidavit, I
                    find it curious that counsel for the plaintiff left it at that. More
                    importantly, it was not even suggested to Eu Jin that Amy had not said
                    ‘Qin Meng’ to the plaintiff.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_89"></a>89     I further accept Eu Jin’s evidence as
                        <em>undisputed</em> (<em>viz</em>,
                    that the plaintiff had been staring into blank space during attempts at
                    explaining the form to her and that Amy had interrupted his explanation with her
                    peremptory command ‘<em>Qin Meng</em>’ to the
                    plaintiff) because <em>nothing</em> was said by Amy
                    regarding the visit to the Bank’s premises on 13 May 2008 that would deny
                    or contradict Eu Jin’s evidence. Even more telling, when counsel for both
                    parties were given the opportunity to further amend their pleadings after the
                    trial, the plaintiff did not seek leave of court to include any facts to deny or
                    contradict Eu Jin’s evidence. Having accepted Eu Jin’s evidence, I
                    find there to be a strong inference (from the plaintiff’s
                    non-responsiveness and staring into blank space), that she did not seem to
                    understand the transaction of opening the joint account, nor the consequences of
                    doing so. I find that any reasonable and prudent bank would have been alarmed by
                    the sudden interruption by Amy.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_90"></a>90     On the home visit of 15 May 2008, the
                    plaintiff could not recall that she had gone to the Bank with Amy just two days
                    earlier. When asked the second time whether she remembered going to the
                    Bank’s premises to open a joint account, the plaintiff had said no.
                    Further, when asked twice whether she wished to open a joint account, she had
                    said no. More importantly, her counsel did not dispute that the plaintiff had
                    given those answers. In fact, Amy herself admitted that the plaintiff could have
                    had a lapse of memory during the house visit. In her AEIC (at para 11.3)
                    she had said:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I <em>do not deny that my mother could have had a lapse of
                            memory</em> [,] however, she was on medication after hip surgery
                        in late February 2008 and also on medication for her constipation. So it was
                        possible that she ‘appeared frail and disoriented’ as
                        alleged.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_91"></a>91     The fact that she did not remember going to
                    the Bank’s premises just two days earlier to open a joint account gave
                    grounds to believe that the plaintiff had problems with her mental health. What
                    mattered here was the undisputed evidence that the plaintiff could not remember
                    that she had wanted to open a joint account. The <em>reasons</em> for her memory deficiencies may be numerous (according
                    to the various doctors who testified) but they are not in issue here. Given that
                    the plaintiff had twice said that she did not want to open a joint account as
                    the Bank’s customer, that meant that her instructions were diametrically
                    opposed to the <em>apparent</em> instructions given by Amy
                    a non-customer. I use the word ‘apparent’ to emphasize that a non
                    customer is in no position to give instructions to the Bank. On the evidence
                    therefore, I find that the home visit of 15 May 2008 <em>only
                        served to reinforce</em> the Bank’s duty of care which required
                    the Bank to refuse to open the joint account. I accept Eu Jin’s evidence
                    of what transpired on 13 May 2008 as well as Sar Lee’s and Eng
                    Leong’s evidence of what happened on 15 May 2008.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_92"></a>92     I should add that I am unconvinced by
                    Khoo’s interpretation of the evidence of the events that transpired at
                    this meeting. He submitted that Sar Lee should not be surprised when the
                    plaintiff said that she did not have a daughter because Sar Lee was never told
                    that Amy was the plaintiff’s adopted daughter. I am puzzled by this
                    explanation. Regardless of whether Sar Lee and/or the Bank knew this fact, why
                    would the plaintiff not inform Sar Lee and Eng Leong that Amy was her daughter
                    if she has one? Further, Khoo argued that the plaintiff said that her age was 80
                    when it was in fact 90 because she did not want to reveal her true age. This
                    piece of evidence may be equivocal if considered in isolation, but when viewed
                    against the entire conversation it was clear to me that there were indeed
                    reasonable grounds to entertain serious doubts as to the defendant’s
                    capacity to give valid instructions on her accounts with the Bank.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_93"></a>93     The plaintiff’s counsel argued that,
                    apart from its refusal to open the joint account, the Bank should have done more
                    – it should have found out more about the relationship between the
                    plaintiff and Amy. The plaintiff’s argument missed the point. Although
                    finding out the relationship between Amy and the plaintiff was a relevant
                    consideration, there cannot be imposed upon the Bank a contractual <em>duty</em> to do so. After all, as Khoo himself had pointed
                    out, there was nothing irregular <em>per se</em> about a
                    customer opening a joint account with someone who was not the customer’s
                    family member or relative. It must be remembered what inquiry the Bank was being
                    tasked to make; that of the customer’s capacity to give valid instructions
                    to the Bank to deal with her accounts. As such, the overriding consideration of
                    the Bank would be to make further enquiries to satisfy itself whether the
                    plaintiff had the capacity to give valid instructions to deal with her bank
                    accounts. The Bank had done this as shown in the home visit on 15 May 2008 and
                    the meeting on 22 May 2008.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_94"></a>94     Further, the evidence showed that Amy was a
                        <em>stranger</em> as far as the Bank was concerned. Amy
                    said that it was in May 2008 that she had for the first time had contact with
                    the Bank in relation to the plaintiff’s accounts. As such, Amy’s
                    contention that Eu Jin could have verified with the officers of the Bank who had
                    previously dealt with the plaintiff and her daughter so as to establish their
                    relationship was without basis.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_95"></a>95     The plaintiff pointed to the fact that the
                    plaintiff’s nephew, Michael, had given joint instructions together with
                    the plaintiff to deposit a certain sum of money into a fixed deposit account in
                    the plaintiff’s name by way of a letter dated 13 March 2008. The plaintiff
                    argued that the Bank could have, at that time, verified with Michael the
                    plaintiff’s mental capacity. This argument is wholly irrelevant. The
                    depositing of monies into a customer’s own account is vastly different
                    from transferring monies out of the customer’s account into a joint
                    account. The risks to the customer in the latter transaction are much greater
                    than the former. As such, Michael’s actions had no relevance to the
                    present matter.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_96"></a>96     From the above evidence, there were
                    circumstances which would raise alarm bells with any bank officer. To proceed
                    with the account opening despite the circumstances would be turning a blind eye
                    against the serious possibility of the customer’s lack of capacity and its
                    consequent abuse. I therefore find that the Bank had not breached its
                    contractual obligation to the plaintiff when it refused to open a joint
                    account.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The Bank’s refusal to close the plaintiff’s accounts and
                pay the monies standing to the credit of the accounts</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_97"></a>97     It is significant that the plaintiff and her
                    counsel did not dispute what Amy said just before the meeting of 22 May
                    2008 begun – if the plaintiff did not transfer the money to Amy and close
                    all her accounts with the Bank, the plaintiff would lose all her money. No
                    evidence was adduced to contradict or deny this piece of evidence even when the
                    plaintiff amended her pleadings after the trial. There was also undisputed
                    evidence from the Bank’s officers that the plaintiff seemed happier and
                    more relaxed when Amy left the meeting room. I did not agree with Khoo that the
                    plaintiff decided to close her accounts because she was upset with the
                    Bank’s alleged intrusion into her privacy. While Khoo had suggested to
                    Siau that Amy was not necessarily being threatening and the Bank had no way of
                    knowing her reasons for saying what she had said, I am of the opinion that the
                    evidence speaks for itself. Read with the ‘Qin Meng’ incident on 13
                    May 2008, this episode presented a strong case to any reasonably prudent bank
                    that the plaintiff’s mental incapacity had been exposed to <em>coercion</em>. Indeed, Amy admitted at the trial that the
                    Bank was <em>entitled</em> to be concerned that there was
                    some form of undue influence when an elderly customer is accompanied by a very
                    vocal child. In making this finding, I disregarded Dr Teo’s evidence
                    that Amy was overheard shouting at the plaintiff at Raffles Hospital on 13 March
                    2008 because that fact was unknown to the Bank at the time.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_98"></a>98     Although the plaintiff’s answers and
                    behaviour at the 22 May 2008 meeting showed that she had no intention to
                    close all her accounts, she was also confused about her accounts and the nature
                    of the transaction of closing the same. When asked why she was at the
                    Bank’s premises, she shook her head and said she did not know. When asked
                    whether she knew how much money she had in her accounts, the plaintiff said she
                    did not know. Such evidence presented serious doubts about the plaintiff’s
                    mental health to a reasonable and prudent bank. Eng Leong asked the plaintiff if
                    she remembered who visited her at her home a week earlier and the plaintiff
                    could not. Asked who was the lady (Amy) who had accompanied her to the Bank on
                    the day of the meeting, the plaintiff said that it was <em>her
                        niece</em>. The plaintiff was asked twice whether she wanted to close
                    her accounts and had answered no, adding there was no need to as she had no
                    problems with the Bank. This evidence, read with Eu Jin’s account of
                    events on 13 May 2008, and Sar Lee’s evidence on the plaintiff’s
                    behaviour on 15 May 2008, provided reasonable grounds to believe that the
                    plaintiff lacked capacity to give valid instructions. In any case, any
                    reasonably prudent bank would have chosen not to carry out Amy’s apparent
                    instructions because they were inconsistent with the plaintiff’s
                    answers.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_99"></a>99     Khoo did not dispute the fact that Eng Leong
                    had indeed asked the questions in <a href="#p1_30">[30]</a> and
                        <a href="#p1_31">[31]</a> at the meeting on 22 May 2008,
                    and that the plaintiff had given the answers Eng Leong testified to. Rather,
                    Khoo tried to explain that the plaintiff had said she did not know where she was
                    because the plaintiff was unsure if she had been taken to the meeting room on
                    the 30<sup>th</sup> floor or 31<sup>st</sup>
                    floor of the Bank’s premises. I reject Khoo’s explanation. The
                    plaintiff could have simply said that she was at the Bank’s premises or
                    even that she was at a bank, it was not relevant which floor she was
                on.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_100"></a>100    I also dismiss the contention that the
                    plaintiff had answered ‘<em>niece</em>’ because
                    Frances had on previous occasions accompanied her to the Bank. There was no
                    evidence to prove this was true (there was only evidence that Frances had
                    accompanied the plaintiff to medical appointments with Dr Teo and this had
                    no bearing on the issue of the plaintiff’s mental capacity).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_101"></a>101    At this juncture, I would stress that
                    although there was nothing substantive in the plaintiff’s affidavits to
                    contradict the Bank’s evidence, I am not prepared to admit into evidence
                    any of the affidavits that she filed previously. Order 38 Rule 2(1) of the Rules
                    of Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2006 Rev Ed) (“the Rules”) gives the court
                    a wide discretion to disallow the admission of a witness’ affidavit
                    evidence if the person fails to attend trial. There was some suggestion in the
                    course of the trial that the plaintiff may not have affirmed the affidavits
                    purportedly stated to be in her name. Denis had speculated that if she was
                    capable of giving instructions to her counsel for the contents in her
                    affidavits, the plaintiff would have had no problems in giving equally clear
                    instructions to the Bank which she could not. Khoo himself agreed with
                    Denis’ surmise as can be seen from the following extract of the notes of
                    evidence (at p 2086):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Olivier Denis: If Madam Hwang at this point of time was able to write this
                        affidavit, she could have met with us, no problem, okay. She would have been
                        very clear, and she would have been able to give us absolutely crystal clear
                        instruction…from May…to November, had Madam Nellie Hwang been
                        as clear as in the affidavit, she would have met with us, no problem, and
                        she would have given us clear instruction, and it didn't happen.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Mr Khoo: I agree with that.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">There are serious doubts as to whether the plaintiff could have made
                    those affidavits given her state of health. I will therefore disregard
                    them.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_102"></a>102    As I have found that there are reasonable
                    grounds to believe that the plaintiff lacked the capacity to give instructions
                    to operate her bank accounts, I find that the Bank was justified in not making
                    payment to the plaintiff of the monies standing to the credit of those accounts.
                    At most times, a bank would be justified in <em>acting
                        against</em> the customer’s <em>apparent</em> mandate by refusing payment of monies out of the
                    customer’s account if it has reasonable grounds to believe that there was
                        <em>in fact</em> no proper mandate or, that the
                    customer lacked the capacity to give instructions on her accounts to the bank.
                    This flowed naturally from the general rule that a bank has no mandate on which
                    to act if the customer is mentally incapacitated and the bank is aware of the
                    fact. The bank however, cannot suspend the banking transaction and hold on to
                    the money in the accounts indefinitely. On the other hand, it would be
                    impractical and commercially unworkable to expect the bank to investigate into
                    the degree of mental incapacity of its own customer. In this case, the Bank
                    could only act on the basis of the facts available and with the cooperation (or
                    lack thereof) of the customer and her family. The Bank’s officers are not
                    doctors. All that the Bank could have done (and did) was to carry out
                    face-to-face meetings with its own customer to evaluate for itself the
                    appropriate measures to be taken. In the given circumstances where such meetings
                    had placed the Bank on inquiry of the plaintiff’s capacity to give valid
                    instructions, the Bank had acted correctly and reasonably in refusing to close
                    all the plaintiff’s accounts and make payment of monies therefrom based on
                    the instructions of a non-customer, Amy.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The correspondence between the Bank and AE and the Power of
                Attorney</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_103"></a>103    The 2008 Power of Attorney was only served
                    on the Bank on 15 July 2008. The plaintiff contended that the Bank was in
                    breach of contract for failing to acknowledge Amy as her duly authorised
                    attorney thereunder. The issue is not to determine whether the document was
                    forged but whether in the context of the factual matrix, the Bank had <em>reasonable grounds</em> to believe that the same was not
                    authentic. If it had reasonable grounds to do so, the Bank’s duty of care
                    in fact dictated that the Bank should not pay out monies from the
                    customer’s account without further verification of the customer’s
                    instructions.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_104"></a>104    The 2008 Power of Attorney cannot be viewed
                    in isolation. On a contextual analysis, a prudent bank would have reasonable
                    grounds to believe that the document was not authentic. First, it had been
                    prepared and certified as a ‘true copy’ by AE. The evidence
                    presented doubt on whether AE was indeed the plaintiff’s solicitor. Right
                    after the meeting of 22 May 2008 when Amy interrupted the Bank’s
                    interview of the plaintiff, Amy told the Bank’s officers that they would
                    hear from <em>her lawyer</em>. When Eng Leong asked, Amy
                    replied the person was AE. This evidence was not disputed nor denied by Amy.
                    Further, AE ignored the Bank’s request to see a Warrant to Act signed by
                    the plaintiff appointing him as her solicitor.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_105"></a>105    Second, the 2008 Power of Attorney was
                    served on the Bank about a month after the Bank had received a letter dated
                    6 June 2008 purportedly from the plaintiff, where the signature was
                        <em>inconsistent</em> with the plaintiff’s
                    signature in the Bank’s records. This evidence was not challenged by Amy
                    or her counsel. When the Bank asked AE for proof that his letter dated
                    28 May 2008 had been written under the plaintiff’s instructions, what
                    it received in return was the letter dated 6 June 2008 with the dubious
                    signature and which raised even more questions. As such, the <em>apparent</em> forgery would have stayed in the mind of a reasonable
                    and prudent banker at the time it received a copy of the 2008 Power of Attorney.
                    Moreover, Denis’ evidence that in the banking industry, an inconsistent
                    signature is a huge red flag was not disputed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_106"></a>106    Third, the defendant’s suspicions
                    would have been raised even higher when <em>just after</em>
                    the Bank received the letter of 6 June 2008 with the <em>inconsistent</em> signature of the plaintiff, it received Amy’s
                    letter dated 16 June 2008 where she authorised herself with the power to
                    handle all of the plaintiff’s correspondence and instructions. The letter
                    dated 16 June 2008 reads:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I have <em>legally appointed my daughter</em>, Hsu
                        Ann Mei, with the <em>power to authorise</em> all my
                        correspondence and instructions with immediate effect.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_107"></a>107    Amy herself signed that self authorising
                    letter. Without any evidence to show (and indeed none was adduced) that the
                    plaintiff had authorised Amy to legally appoint herself with the power to
                    authorise the plaintiff’s transactions, the self-serving letter of
                    16 June 2008 was meaningless, as far as the authorization of Amy went.
                    Further, if the 2008 Power of Attorney had indeed existed on 28 May 2008,
                    there was no reason why (and none was offered) it was not given to the Bank on
                    16 June 2008 instead of the self-authorising letter.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_108"></a>108    The events leading up to the service of the
                    2008 Power of Attorney were disturbing and reading the evidence in totality, I
                    find that a reasonable and prudent bank in the Bank’s position would have
                    reasonable grounds to believe that the document was not validly executed.
                    Therefore, the Bank had not acted in breach of its contractual obligations when
                    it made the decision not to close any of the plaintiff’s accounts and not
                    to make payment of monies out of those accounts.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The Bank’s receipt of the medical reports</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_109"></a>109    Khoo argued that the Bank ought to have
                    changed its position given the medical reports certifying the plaintiff’s
                    mental competence. I am of the view that a reasonable and prudent bank in the
                    Bank’s position, having been served with the reports of Dr Lim and
                    Dr Kang on 3 October 2008, would be justified in choosing not to close the
                    plaintiff’s accounts and paying out moneys therefrom.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_110"></a>110    First, the Bank did not have access to those
                    medical reports when it made its initial assessment of the appropriateness of
                    following the plaintiff’s apparent instructions. This was not a case where
                    the Bank had gone ahead to deny making payments from a customer’s bank
                    account despite medical reports certifying the customer’s mental
                    competence. By the time the Bank received the medical reports after this action
                    was commenced, there was ample reason for the Bank to suspect the apparent
                    instructions did not reflect the plaintiff’s intentions. Indeed, the Bank
                    had received a letter from AE dated 15 July 2008 where it was alleged,
                    apart from mental stress caused by the Bank’s refusal to follow the
                    plaintiff’s instructions, the plaintiff’s health was <em>perfectly satisfactory</em>; yet both Dr Lim’s
                    report dated 24 May 2008, and Dr Kang’s report made in April,
                    had agreed that the plaintiff suffered from <em>mild
                        dementia</em>. This would raise serious concerns in any reasonable
                    bank’s mind. The reasonable concern would be that, if AE’s letter of
                    15 July 2008 was correct, the authenticity and basis of the medical reports
                    would be in serious doubt. It is noteworthy that at the time the medical reports
                    were served on the Bank, it had no contact with either Dr Lim or
                    Dr Kang. There were no avenues to verify their doubts.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_111"></a>111    Second, the Bank had stated in its letter 15
                    August 2008 that it would act if a reputable specialist opinion (from a clinical
                    psychologist or neuropsychologist) <em>regarding the
                        customer’s mental capacity</em> was produced, or a committee of
                    persons was appointed by the Court. The phrase ‘customer’s mental
                    capacity’ referred to the plaintiff’s capacity to give instructions
                    to deal with her bank accounts; it did not/could not refer to any other
                    capacity. The evidence here suggested that Dr Lim and Dr Kang’s
                    reports were <em>not</em> concerned with the
                    plaintiff’s capacity to give instructions to deal with her bank accounts.
                    Dr Lim’s examinations of the plaintiff and his medical report dated
                    24 May 2008 were made for the purpose of determining the plaintiff’s
                    testamentary capacity, not to determine the plaintiff’s capacity to
                    operate her bank accounts. As for Dr Kang’s report, she had testified
                    that the tests she conducted were not purpose-specific, neither were the tests
                    designed to make a diagnosis. The tests served only as an <em>indication</em> of the degree of cognitive impairment. Moreover,
                    Dr Kang did not give any diagnosis of the degree of dementia, she had
                    merely stated that she was of the ‘impression’ that the
                    plaintiff’s earlier diagnosis of dementia was of a mild one. This was
                    merely descriptive of Dr Teo’s 2005 diagnosis that the plaintiff had
                    ‘mild dementia’.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_112"></a>112    Third, notwithstanding the <em>medical</em> consequences of a diagnosis of <em>mild dementia</em>, a reasonable bank with access to the
                    reports would have entertained serious doubts over whether the plaintiff could,
                    for all <em>practical</em> purposes, give valid
                    instructions to deal with her accounts. The reports showed that the
                    plaintiff’s short term memory deficiency was quite serious. For
                    Dr Lim’s examination, the plaintiff could not recall three simple
                    items (clock, book, chair) after an interval of five minutes. The plaintiff
                    fared worse in Dr Kang’s examination. The plaintiff was asked to
                    repeat three items (‘apple, clock, table’) <em>immediately after</em> she was told what the objects were and she was
                    only able to repeat apple and clock. Dr Kang had to tell the plaintiff the
                    three items for the third time before the plaintiff could recall them all.
                    Dr Kang’s report itself stated that the plaintiff’s short term
                    memory deficiency would impact on her ability to learn new
                information.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_113"></a>113    I pause here to emphasise that the
                    court’s task here is not to determine whether the medical reports showed
                    on a balance of probabilities that the plaintiff had the capacity to give valid
                    instructions. The issue is whether a prudent bank with access to those reports
                    would have been satisfied that the plaintiff had the capacity to give valid
                    instructions. I find that a prudent bank with access to those reports should in
                    fact entertain very serious doubts of the customer’s capacity, and would
                    therefore require further (and possibly more independent) medical evidence to
                    satisfy itself that her cognitive abilities were functioning
                normally.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_114"></a>114    I therefore conclude from the evidence that
                    the Bank had not acted unreasonably when it continued to defend the
                    plaintiff’s claim in the light of the medical reports
                produced.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The plaintiff’s mental capacity</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_115"></a>115    Both sides made submissions on the evidence
                    that allegedly showed that the plaintiff was not mentally capable to manage her
                    bank accounts with the Bank during the material month of May 2008. The plaintiff
                    has unfortunately passed away and it is not strictly necessary for me to make a
                    finding on her mental capacity now. Her affairs will in future be managed by the
                    executor of her estate. There was no allegation that the plaintiff lacked mental
                    capacity when she entered into the initial contract with the Bank. The defence
                    pertained to the situation where the plaintiff was found to lack mental capacity
                        <em>after</em> the formation of the contract,
                    specifically in <em>May 2008</em>. Unfortunately, neither
                    party adequately explained the effect of the plaintiff’s mental incapacity
                    (if established on the evidence) on the Bank’s existing contractual
                    obligations, specifically the obligation to follow the customer’s
                    instructions.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_116"></a>116    One <em>possible</em>
                    analysis would be the principle as discussed earlier that there is no mandate if
                    the Bank has knowledge of the customer’s mental incapacity. Even if the
                    plaintiff was found to be mentally incapacitated, the evidence did not show that
                    the Bank had <em>knowledge</em> of this incapacity at the
                    time when the apparent instructions had been given by Amy purportedly on the
                    plaintiff’s behalf. The evidence showed that at best the Bank was
                        <em>placed on inquiry</em> of its customer’s
                    mental incapacity. The Bank did not submit any authorities that there would be
                        <em>no mandate</em> merely because the Bank was placed
                        <em>on inquiry</em> of its customer’s mental
                    incapacity. I do not think the Bank can be allowed to argue retrospectively and
                    on hindsight, that there was no mandate, based on the argument that the customer
                    was mentally incapable, when the Bank had <em>no
                        knowledge</em> of this fact at the material time.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_117"></a>117    I must first emphasise the difference
                    between the situation where a customer is <em>in fact, on a
                        balance of probabilities</em>, mentally incapacitated to give valid
                    instructions; and the situation where <em>a prudent
                        bank</em> has reasonable grounds to believe that a customer is
                    mentally incapacitated and cannot give valid instructions. The two are not
                    necessarily related. A person can be perfectly sane and yet behave in such an
                    irrational manner that a reasonable and prudent bank would in its duty of care,
                    choose not to follow his instructions pending further verification. A bank would
                    not be in breach of its contractual duties in such a situation. Conversely, a
                    person can be mentally incapacitated on a balance of probabilities for the
                    purpose of giving valid instructions to deal with his account. Yet if such a
                    person behaves normally when doing his banking transactions, such that no
                    reasonable and prudent bank would have reasonable grounds to believe that there
                    are any irregularities, the bank does not breach its duty in following the
                    customer’s apparent instructions. Of course, if the bank <em>has knowledge</em> or has been given notice of the
                    customer’s mental incapacity, it must not follow the customer’s
                    apparent instructions until further inquiries have been made to verify those
                    instructions. As such, the outcome of this case does not depend on whether the
                    plaintiff was in fact mentally incapacitated. As Khoo rightly pointed out, the
                    Bank’s officers are not medically trained and are in no position to
                    formally assess a customer’s mental health. What matters is the behaviour
                    of the customer as perceived by the Bank and whether those perceptions
                    constitute reasonable grounds of belief, based on the information available to
                    the Bank at the time when apparent instructions were given.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_118"></a>118    That is not to say the plaintiff’s
                    mental capacity is irrelevant. If the customer was <em>in
                        fact</em> mentally incapacitated at the material time, this could be
                    corroborative of the prudent bank’s reasonable belief that the customer
                    was mentally incapacitated.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_119"></a>119    Dr Ngui opined that <em>up to 15 January 2009</em>, the plaintiff had been <em>mentally competent</em> to manage her financial affairs as well as to
                    provide instructions on her bank accounts. With respect, I am unable to accept
                    his opinion. First, Dr Ngui’s medical examination of the plaintiff
                    was done on 15 January 2009 and 8 August 2009, he did not examine the plaintiff
                    in May 2008. Second, Dr Ngui had based his finding of the plaintiff’s
                    mental capacity before 15 January 2009 on third parties’ medical reports
                    and not on his own assessment of the plaintiff. At [55] of his report he
                    said:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Up to the time I saw her on 15 January 2009, the stage of her dementia
                        remained in the mild range. This can be inferred from observations made by
                        Dr Teo Sek Khee, Dr Lim Hsin Loh, Ms Zena Kang and
                        Dr Sitoh.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_120"></a>120    Dr Ngui relied on Dr Teo’s
                    observations (at para 57 of Dr Ngui’s report) that the plaintiff
                    was seen unkempt with long fingernails in <em>April
                        2007</em>. This was slightly a year before May 2008. He then made
                    reference to the test scores conducted by Dr Teo. However, Dr Teo had
                    already stressed that his assessment was not meant to determine the
                    plaintiff’s decisional capacity in any way.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_121"></a>121    Indeed, apart from mentioning how he used
                    Dr Teo’s evidence, Dr Ngui failed to justify why and how he had
                    used the reports of Drs Lim, Sitoh and Kang to draw those
                    ‘inferences’ in his report. As has already been observed, none of
                    those reports were prepared for the specific purpose of assessing the
                    plaintiff’s capacity to give instructions on her bank accounts.
                    Consequently, I find Dr Ngui’s opinion unconvincing given that he
                    failed to explain how he had arrived at his opinion based on those reports or
                    even how he had used them.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_122"></a>122    Third, Dr Ngui was himself of the
                    opinion that the mental capacity of dementia patients fluctuates, such that
                    there would be intervals of lucidity. This opinion was shared by Drs Lim, Sitoh
                    and Teo. This evidence does not gel with Dr Ngui’s general opinion
                    – if the plaintiff had intervals of lucidity, his general statement that
                        ‘<em>up to 15 January 2009</em>’ she had
                    the mental capacity to give instructions, cannot stand.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_123"></a>123    I make the further observation that
                    Dr Ngui’s opinion “that the Home visit by the Bank’s
                    officers on 15 May 2008 <em>would have been somewhat</em>
                    daunting to the plaintiff and <em>she could have been</em>
                    overwhelmed and stressed by the questions put to the plaintiff”, is at
                    best speculative and hearsay. Dr Ngui was not present at the home visit on
                    15 May 2008. His opinion is without basis as none of the medical reports he
                    relied on covered this incident.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_124"></a>124    It was not in dispute that on 14 March 2008,
                    the plaintiff had no recollection of a major surgery (hip-replacement) that she
                    had undergone in February 2008. The plaintiff’s inability to retain
                    information was clear – as of 28 March 2008, the plaintiff could not
                    recall three simple items a mere five minutes after they were told to her. As of
                    3 April 2008, the plaintiff was unable to tell the date, day, month and year.
                    When asked to repeat three simple items immediately after she was told, she
                    could not. The plaintiff managed to name all three items only after three
                    attempts. Less than five minutes later, when asked what those three items were,
                    she could not recall a single item. Although it is outside the purview of this
                    court to determine whether on a balance of probabilities the plaintiff lacked
                    the requisite mental capacity, the totality of the evidence presents a strong
                    inference that the plaintiff lacked the ability to give proper instructions on
                    her bank accounts in the months leading up to May 2008.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_125"></a>125    My comments are made without reference to
                    the Mental Capacity Act (Cap 177A, 2010 Rev Ed) (“MCA”) which
                    defined ‘mental incapacity’ in sections 4 and 5. The definition of
                    ‘mental incapacity’ in the MCA is of no assistance to this case as
                    the legislation came into operation on 1 March 2010 after the conclusion of the
                    trial. Had the MCA applied, I believe that the plaintiff was not in the frame of
                    mental health to give proper instructions on her bank accounts in the months
                    leading up to May 2008.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Terms and Conditions Governing Deposit Accounts</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_126"></a>126    After the trial had concluded but before
                    parties tendered their closing submissions, I directed both sides to consider
                    amending their respective pleadings so that the evidence adduced in the course
                    of the trial accorded with each party’s pleaded case. The plaintiff sought
                    leave to amend the statement of claim to include Amy’s evidence on the
                    first day of trial that although she believed the Bank had acted prudently, the
                    Bank had not done enough and should have done more, specifically to find out
                    more about her relationship with the plaintiff. The Bank similarly applied to
                    amend its defence to include the Terms and Conditions Governing Deposit Accounts
                    (‘Terms and Conditions’) pertaining to the plaintiff’s
                    accounts.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_127"></a>127    There was no irremediable prejudice caused
                    to either side by the amendments. The plaintiff suffered no prejudice by the
                    Bank’s amendments as the Terms and Conditions were incorporated into one
                    of the bundles before the court and were exhibited to Denis’ AEIC. Khoo
                    could have cross-examined Denis on the Terms and Conditions had he wished to do
                    so. He did not object to the Bank’s amendments. In any case, the original
                    defence made reference to the Terms and Conditions as the indemnity clause (cl
                    28) was pleaded.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_128"></a>128    As I have found that the Bank had not acted
                    in breach of contract and had taken reasonable care as a prudent bank, I will
                    not belabour the point of the Bank’s alternative defence which relied upon
                    several clauses found in the Terms and Conditions. Suffice it to say that the
                    clauses were in clear and unequivocal language. Notably however, the clauses
                    only applied to the plaintiff’s deposit accounts; they did not apply to
                    the current account she maintained with the Bank.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_129"></a>129    The Terms and Conditions extended to
                    customer’s instructions by cl 2 which said:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">2.1    All Instructions in respect of an Account must be
                            given by or on behalf of the Customer strictly in accordance with the

                            such Account. All Instructions shall be given to the Bank in writing or
                            in such other mode(s) and/or method(s) agreed by the bank from time to
                            time.</p>

                            written revocation of the same from the Customer.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">2.7    If there is any <em>ambiguity</em> or <em>inconsistency</em>
                            or <em>conflict</em> in the instructions, the Bank
                            may choose not to act upon them unless and until the ambiguity or
                            conflict has been <em>resolved to the Bank’s
                                satisfaction</em> or the Bank may choose to act only on the
                            instructions of all the authorised signatories notwithstanding that any
                            relevant existing mandate or instructions require
                        otherwise.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_130"></a>130    Clause 2.7 is of particular significance. I
                    had highlighted how Amy’s purported and apparent
                    ‘instructions’ had been inconsistent with the plaintiff’s own
                    instructions. In the face of those inconsistencies, the Bank had the contractual
                    right not to carry out any purported instructions until the inconsistencies were
                    resolved to the Bank’s satisfaction. The home visit on 15 May 2008
                    reinforced the inconsistencies revolving around the instructions to open a joint
                    account. The answers given by the plaintiff clearly showed she had no intention
                    to close all her accounts with the defendant. Her instructions were
                    diametrically opposed to the purported ‘instructions’ given by Amy
                    to the Bank.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_131"></a>131    The other Terms and Conditions included

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_132"></a>132    I have already dealt with the letter of
                    6 June 2008 in [36] which contained a signature inconsistent with the
                    plaintiff’s signature on record with the Bank. I have also dealt with the
                    ineffectiveness of Amy’s self-authorising letter in [107]. In view of
                    those factors, I find that there were no proper instructions given to the Bank
                    to close all the plaintiff’s accounts. Therefore, the Bank was entitled to
                    rely on cll 6 and 20 of the Terms and Conditions to refuse to close all her
                    accounts and return the monies forthwith.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_133"></a>133    Further, cl 27 of the Terms and Conditions
                    included an exemption from liability for the Bank. As I have held that the Bank
                    was not in breach of contract, it would not be necessary to deal with cl 27 as
                    the question of exemption from liability does not arise.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Loss of opportunity to purchase a flat at De Centurion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_134"></a>134    As there was no breach of contract, there is
                    no issue of loss of opportunity. I would add that the plaintiff’s
                    contention of loss of opportunity has no merit. The evidence did not show any
                    intention on the part of the plaintiff to purchase a unit at
                    De-Centurion.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_135"></a>135    The plaintiff (through Amy) had made several
                    applications for interim payments, one being the application on 31 December 2008
                    where another court allowed the monthly payment out of $11,300 from the monies
                    in her accounts with the Bank. In a later application made on 12 February 2009,
                    the court ordered the sum of $8,357.80 to be paid out from the plaintiff’s
                    accounts On 26 March 2009, the court ordered a further sum of $25,000 to be paid
                    out from the plaintiff’s accounts. The dates of these applications
                    coincided with the plaintiff’s pleaded case that the loss of opportunity
                    occurred between December 2008 and March 2009. However, in all those
                    applications for interim payments, not once did the plaintiff or Amy apply to
                    withdraw monies for the payment of the booking/option fee for De-Centurion nor
                    did they mention any desire to use the monies in the accounts for the purpose of
                    purchasing a property.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_136"></a>136    The plaintiff had pleaded in the statement
                    of claim (Amendment No. 1 and 2) that “By reason of the defendant’s
                    refusal to comply…the plaintiff was deprived of the use of her monies in
                    her said accounts opportunity to buy properties…” When asked what
                    the properties were, the plaintiff clarified in the Further and Better
                    Particulars of Statement of Claim (Amendment No. 1) that “the plaintiff
                    was denied opportunity to purchase<b><em> a flat</em></b> at a
                    new development called De-Centurion at Tanjong Rhu Road…” Any
                    attempts to claim an intention to purchase <em>more than a
                        flat</em> was unsupported by the pleadings and are therefore
                    rejected.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_137"></a>137    In this regard, I found the expert testimony
                    of Lim Soo Chin (“Lim”) to be of no assistance. Lim’s AEIC
                    made no reference to De-Centurion and he admitted that his evidence of a 10%
                    fall in market value was an arbitrary judgment call made without basis. He had
                    based his findings on properties that were not comparable to De-Centurion as the
                    comparative properties were not situated in district 15 where the De-Centurion
                    was located.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_138"></a>138    On the facts and evidence presented before
                    this court, I hold that the Bank was not in breach of its contractual duties to
                    the plaintiff. It was under no absolute duty to make payment out of the
                    plaintiff’s bank accounts in the circumstances that prevailed in May 2008.
                    Banks cannot turn a blind eye to facts which would have shown a serious
                    possibility of irregularities in the apparent mandate it received from its
                    customer.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_139"></a>139    The Bank admirably acted to ensure payment
                    was made only if it had the actual mandate from its customer. Indeed, the Bank
                    tried to protect the interests of its customer and found itself sued in the
                    process. By standing its ground, the Bank risked damaging its reputation and its
                    relationship with its other existing customers. Considerable (adverse) publicity
                    was also generated by this trial. The Bank did the right thing by its conduct
                    and lived up to its social responsibilities in this case.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_140"></a>140    As it is my finding that the evidence
                    presents a strong inference that the plaintiff was not in the proper frame of
                    mental health to give valid instructions on her accounts in the months leading
                    up to May 2008, it must follow that doubts are also raised on the validity
                    and/or authenticity of the Deed of Revocation executed on 28 May 2008. I
                    note that the execution of the Deed of Revocation as well as the 2008 Power of
                    Attorney was not witnessed by a medical practitioner, unlike the October Codicil
                    to the 1999 Will. Needless to say, the validity of the August 2008 Will is also
                    cast in doubt.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_141"></a>141    By all accounts, the plaintiff (when she was
                    in full possession of her faculties) and even when she started becoming
                    forgetful (due to the onset of mild dementia) was a witty, lively and cheeky
                    lady. The doctors who treated her (Dr Teo being one of them) described her
                    as “delightful”. (They fondly referred to her as
                    “Nellie”). Even when she could not remember certain things such as
                    her own age, the plaintiff would skilfully parry the doctors’ question by
                    saying no woman would want to reveal her age.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_142"></a>142    It is a pity that the plaintiff was no
                    longer the lively personality she used to be from around May 2008 until her
                    demise. It is also sad that the incidents in 2008 involving the Bank showed that
                    her only child Amy did not seem to treat the plaintiff with the affection and
                    respect that she rightly deserved. The payments out sought by Amy from the sum
                    paid into court reinforces my observation. Suffice it to say that this court and
                    other courts disallowed some items claimed by Amy in those applications as
                    either being unjustified or unnecessary or if justified, were inflated. One is
                    left to speculate, had the plaintiff been lucid, would this suit have been
                    pursued to the bitter end? Denis was steadfast in his belief that this action
                    was completely out of character where the plaintiff was concerned.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Costs</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_143"></a>143    I note that the Terms and Conditions
                    contained an indemnity provision in cl 28 in favour of the Bank. As the
                    plaintiff’s submissions contained no arguments why cl 28 should not apply,
                    I award costs to the Bank on an indemnity basis.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_144"></a>144    Who should bear the costs of this
                    litigation? Should it be the plaintiff’s estate or Amy personally as the
                    plaintiff’s litigation representative? Order 76 r 12(3) of the Rules gives
                    the court a wide discretion to order payment of costs from the monies kept in
                    court:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Control of money recovered by person under disability (O.76, r. 12)</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">12.–(1) Where in any proceedings –</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(b) money paid into Court is accepted by or on behalf of a plaintiff who
                        is a person under disability,</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">the money shall be dealt with in accordance with directions given by the
                        Court.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(3) Without prejudice to paragraphs (1) and (2), directions given under
                        this Rule may include any general or special directions that the Court
                        thinks fit to give and, in particular, directions as to how the money is to
                        be applied or dealt with and as to any payment to be made, either directly
                        or out of the amount paid into Court, to the plaintiff, or to the litigation
                        representative in respect of moneys paid or expenses incurred for or on
                        behalf or for the benefit of the person under disability or for his
                        maintenance or otherwise for his benefit to the plaintiff’s solicitor
                        in respect of costs.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_145"></a>145    I find that a litigation representative is
                        <em>prima facie</em> liable for the costs of an action
                    that has been dismissed. When proceedings are brought by a third party on behalf
                    of a mentally incapacitated party, that third party has represented himself as
                    having the authority to bring proceedings and will be personally liable for
                    costs, regardless of whether he has knowledge of such mental incapacity and
                    regardless of whether he has knowledge that his actual authority has or has not
                    ceased (see <em>Yonge v Toynbee</em> [1910]
                    1 K.B. 215). I direct that the costs awarded to the Bank on an
                    indemnity basis shall be borne by Amy personally.</p>
