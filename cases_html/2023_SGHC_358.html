At the material time, the accused was suffering from major depressive disorder (“MDD”), as substantially impaired his capacity to know whether his acts were wrong. As this defence of diminished responsibility is applicable to the accused, the charge brought against him is one of culpable homicide <span class="font-italic">not</span> amounting to murder punishable under s 304(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the Penal Code. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">4 The charge reads: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">That you, [the accused], on 19 July 2021, between 11.16 a.m. and 11.44 a.m., inside the toilet located at level 4 of Block D in [RVHS] at 6 Boon Lay Avenue, Singapore, caused the death of [the deceased], male, 13 years old, to wit, by slashing the head, neck and body of [the deceased] multiple times with an axe (measuring 50cm by 22cm), with the intention of causing the death of [the deceased], and you have thereby committed an offence of culpable homicide not amounting to murder punishable under section 304(a) of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">5 The accused pleaded guilty to the charge, and he also admitted to the facts and circumstances of the offence as set out in the Statement of Facts.

</div> The submission was that the accused was as culpable or less culpable compared to the offenders in those precedents. On that basis, a sentence of around five years of imprisonment was sought. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Decision </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">16 Section 304(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the Penal Code prescribes that whoever commits culpable homicide not amounting to murder shall be punished <span class="font-italic">either</span> with imprisonment for life (and shall also be liable to caning) <span class="font-italic">or</span> for imprisonment for a term which may extend to twenty years (and shall also be liable to fine or to caning).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">17 The parties’ sentencing positions diverged to a considerable degree. To reiterate, the Prosecution sought 12 to 16 years of imprisonment, while the Defence’s position was that a term of approximately five years’ imprisonment would be appropriate. As noted, the Defence accepted the seriousness and gravity of the offence. The Prosecution also accepted the mitigating factors of the accused’s MDD, his youth and plea of guilt. The divergence arose largely from their disagreement over the appropriate mitigating weight to be attributed to the mitigating factors, particularly the accused’s mental condition, and whether the dominant sentencing principle or principles in the present case ought to be rehabilitation (as argued by the Defence), or retribution and deterrence (as contended by the Prosecution).   </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">18 It is worth observing that despite their divergent positions, the parties did not disagree on two important points. First, that this was not a case justifying a life sentence to be imposed. In relation to a mentally disordered offender committing a grave offence, a life sentence is justified for the sake of public protection, where the offender will pose “a serious danger to the public for an indeterminate time” (<span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v Aniza bte Essa </span>[2009] 3 SLR(R) 327 (“<span class="font-italic">Aniza bte Essa</span>”) at [14] citing <span class="font-italic">AG’s Reference No 32 of 1996 (Steven Alan Whittaker) </span>[1997] 1 CR App R (S) 261 at 264). The evidence did not show that the accused is a long-term threat to society. Alternatively, a life sentence, being the highest punishment for the offence, is to be reserved for the <span class="font-italic">worst</span> type of cases (<span class="font-italic">Aniza bte Essa </span>at [34]). Given that this case is not devoid of any mitigating circumstances, the Prosecution did not press for a life sentence. In fact, in view of the mitigating circumstances, the Prosecution, very fairly, did not submit for a sentence at the upper end of the sentencing range for culpable homicide <span class="font-italic">ie, </span>17 to 20 years of imprisonment. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">19 Secondly, the parties agreed that caning would not be necessary. There is no compelling need to impose caning on mentally disordered offenders, and caning has generally not been imposed on such offenders even in cases of culpable homicide not amounting to murder.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">20 With those preliminary points clarified, it bears remembering that the range of circumstances in which culpable homicide is committed is extremely wide and varied (<span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v P Mageswaran and another appeal </span>[2019] 1 SLR 1253<span class="font-italic"> </span>(“<span class="font-italic">P Mageswaran</span>”) at [46]). The sentencing inquiry in respect of such offences must therefore be highly fact-sensitive (<span class="font-italic">Dewi Sukowati v Public Prosecutor </span>[2017] 1 SLR 450 at [15]), and limits the utility of precedents (<span class="font-italic">Lim Ghim Peow v Public Prosecutor</span> [2014] 4 SLR 1287 (“<span class="font-italic">Lim Ghim Peow</span>”) at [55]). This is all the more so for the present case, which, as the Prosecution and the Defence both acknowledged, is without precedent in Singapore’s history. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The accused’s mental disorder  </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">21 With that, I address the key point of disagreement between the parties, which concerns the mitigating weight which ought to attach to the accused’s MDD. Based on the evidence, the accused suffered from MDD of moderate severity for about six months prior to the killing. There was, however, insufficient evidence that the accused was suffering from psychopathy. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">22 Turning to the law, the starting point is that the moral culpability of mentally disordered offenders lies on a spectrum, and depends on the nature and severity of the mental disorder (<span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v Kong Peng Yee</span> [2018] 2 SLR 295 (“<span class="font-italic">Kong Peng Yee</span>”) at [60] and [65]). On one end, where the mental disorder severely impairs the offender’s ability to understand the nature and consequences of their acts, to make reasoned decisions or control their impulses, deterrence should not be a dominant consideration (<span class="font-italic">Kong Peng Yee </span>at [66]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">23 Conversely, where an offender retains understanding of his actions, the ability to reason, to think logically and coherently, to weigh the consequences of his actions, and where his mind ultimately remains rational notwithstanding his mental affliction, that affliction can only ameliorate his culpability to a limited extent (<span class="font-italic">Kong Peng Yee </span>at [65]). Even if the mental affliction might be severe, the underlying reason for the offender’s subsequent action might nonetheless be founded on a true and rational factual basis rather than fantasy, fiction or delusion. For example, an offender may experience severe depression, intense jealousy, and anger over a spouse’s actual infidelity, or fear of losing their employment or being subject to disciplinary action when some wrongdoing on the offender’s part is discovered (<span class="font-italic">Kong Peng Yee</span> at [65]). In respect of such offenders, deterrence and retribution must remain the predominant sentencing principles, for no matter how severe, depression cannot be a license to kill or to harm others (<span class="font-italic">Kong Peng Yee</span> at [65]).  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 In a joint report by Dr Cai Yiming (“Dr Cai”), a psychiatrist at the Institute of Mental Health (“IMH”), and Dr Kenji Gwee (“Dr Gwee”), the Principal Clinical Forensic Psychologist at IMH, dated 9 December 2022 (“the second joint report”), they state that notwithstanding his MDD, the accused retained control over his actions, and understood that what he was doing was morally and legally wrong.

</div> His entire plan was premised on his keen awareness that what he planned to do would be so outrageous and horrific that it could not but incite a lethal response from law enforcement officers. However irrational his goals might have been, and however twisted and perverse the means by which he sought to achieve them, the sheer sophistication and planning displayed made clear that he fully retained his ability to think logically and coherently (<span class="font-italic">Kong Peng Yee </span>at [65]). This clearly placed him in the second category of offenders described at [23] above – where culpability should be ameliorated only to a limited extent by a mental disorder. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 For this amongst other reasons, the cases of <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v Ho Wei Yi</span> [2014] SGHC 96 (“<span class="font-italic">Ho Wei Yi</span>”) and <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v Rosdi bin Joenet</span> [2016] SGHC 58 (“<span class="font-italic">Rosdi</span>”), in which the respective offenders were sentenced to eight and nine years respectively, were of little assistance to the accused. The offender in <span class="font-italic">Ho Wei Yi</span> suffered from paranoid schizophrenia, delusion, and auditory hallucinations, and started the fire which killed his father to exorcise evil spirits whose voices he heard from the master bedroom (<span class="font-italic">Ho Wei Yi</span> at [3] and [6]). The killing in <span class="font-italic">Rosdi</span> was committed in anger and jealous delusion (<span class="font-italic">Rosdi </span>at [2]), and the offender was diagnosed with delusional disorder which subsisted even up till the time of his sentencing (<span class="font-italic">Rosdi </span>at [16]–[17]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 In sharp contrast, the accused was neither deprived of self-control, nor beset by any fit of uncontrollable rage or jealousy. As for whether the accused was delusional, the Defence made several references to his mistaken belief that “suicide by cop” was “compatible with our local reality” and sought to attribute this to his mental affliction.

</div> that the question in <span class="font-italic">Ahmed Salim </span>was whether the offender could avail himself of the defence of diminished responsibility <span class="font-italic">at all</span>. I recognise that Dr Cai and Dr Gwee responded in the negative when directly asked whether the accused had any realistic moment of rationality and self-control that would have enabled him to pull back from executing his plan to commit the attack. In the present case, it was already common ground that the accused’s MDD played a sufficiently significant role at the time of the killing to warrant a charge of culpable homicide rather than murder. In other words, the mitigating effect of his MDD on him – that he was not able to pull back from that killing – had been reflected, in the Prosecution’s charging decision. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 Beyond that, as further noted in the second joint report, the accused had been wrestling with ambivalence for <span class="font-italic">months</span> before the killing. Dr Gwee’s report on 18 August 2021 also notes that, while the accused had initially planned to carry out his suicide by cop plan in May 2021, he had postponed it with “self-talk and extenuating circumstances” and by focusing on things he enjoyed.

</div> In addition, even after the accused resolved to commit suicide by cop in early 2021, he retained the capacity to recognise that something was wrong with his own mind, as evinced by his visit to a webpage titled “Suicidal Ideation: Symptoms, Diagnosis, Treatment, Coping”.

</div> Therefore, based on the evidence, despite his mental affliction, it is clear that the accused <span class="font-italic">knew</span> that what he intended to do was legally and morally wrong, and struggled with it for <span class="font-italic">months</span>. He <span class="font-italic">knew</span> there was something wrong with himself. He <span class="font-italic">had </span>the capacity to talk himself out of doing what he intended to do.

RVHS had advised his parents to seek professional help for him. Unlike many persons who suffer from mental health issues, his parents were supportive and willingly offered help to him. They also expressed willingness to go for family therapy. However, the accused would not share what bothered him, and rejected all offers of help.

</div> Moreover, as pointed out by the Prosecution, the accused’s consumption of snuff videos (which commenced in April 2020) predated the onset of his MDD by at least half a year. Indeed, it should be noted that the accused resumed watching snuff videos a month before the offence to prepare for his intended attack, reporting to Dr Gwee that he focused on knife attack videos in preparation of his plan.

This was in the two poems which the accused wrote prior to the killing in February to March 2021,

</div> the contents of which make clear that the accused did not simply see the act of killing as the only regrettable and morally wrong option which he had left available to him to achieve his goal of committing suicide. The contents of the poem he titled “_Liberated_”, which the accused explained was about a school stabber who not only harmed people, but killed them, were particularly troubling. As the Prosecution submitted, which I accepted, the poem shows the accused as someone “who was enthralled with the idea of a school killing and followed through this idea to completion”.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 Beyond the sheer brutality and randomness of the attack, the fact that the accused found the idea of a school killing appealing clearly sets the present case apart from the trio of cases upon which the Defence relied on to support a sentence of five years. In <span class="font-italic">P</span><span class="font-italic">ublic Prosecutor v BAC </span>[2016] SGHC 49, the offender who suffered from major depressive disorder killed her child out of frustration and a misguided perception that the child had been the cause of her marital problems (at [4]). In <span class="font-italic">Pu</span><span class="font-italic">blic Prosecutor v Goh Hai Eng</span> (Criminal Case No 4 of 2010), the offender (who suffered from bipolar disorder) killed her daughter as she did not want to leave her daughter behind. In <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v Graffart Philippe Marcell Guy</span> (Criminal Case No 36 of 2016), the offender, who had major depressive disorder, was mired in a contested battle for his child’s custody, and attempted to “take” his son with him prior to his own suicide attempt. It is pertinent to note that these cases concern killings in the familial context. Such cases involve different sentencing considerations. Furthermore, none of the offenders saw the act of killing as anything more than a means to end their own suffering, or to take their children with them before taking their own lives (<span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v CAD</span> [2019] SGHC 262 at [9]). They did not contemplate the appeal of a killing, or the notoriety that it may bring. The same points should be made of the offenders in <span class="font-italic">Ho Wei Yi </span>and <span class="font-italic">Rosdi.</span> On this count, the accused’s culpability stood in a category of its own.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The dominant sentencing principles </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 By all of the above, I was of the view that this case is one so serious and heinous that retribution must prevail over the principle of rehabilitation, even though the accused is a young offender (<span class="font-italic">Mohammad Al-Ansari bin Basri</span> at [34]-[35]) and even though he was labouring under a serious mental disorder (<span class="font-italic">Lim Ghim Peow </span>at [39]; <span class="font-italic">Kong Peng Yee</span> at [59(g)]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 This was a gratuitously violent killing, terrifying and incomprehensible in its randomness. It was meticulously planned. It was deliberately perpetrated in a school, where young people ought to feel their safest, against a victim who was particularly vulnerable. A young and innocent life has been lost. While the accused’s decision to take his own life was clearly directly attributable to his MDD, it did not prevent him from recognising that his plan to kill others pursuant to his plan to commit suicide by cop was wrong. It did not impair his ability to physically control his actions. He must also bear responsibility for failing to accept the professional help that was offered to him, and for continuing to expose himself to violent and graphic content despite knowing that it was wrong for him to do so, which were both major factors which contributed to the killing.

</div> Were it not for his MDD, and for his young age, this would arguably have qualified as amongst the worst type of offences warranting the maximum sentence of life imprisonment, or the upper end of the sentencing range of between 17 to 20 years of imprisonment. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 In addition to retribution, another dominant sentencing principle in the present case was that of general deterrence. The court had to be mindful of the possibility that others who might find themselves in the same state of mind as the accused was in early-mid 2021, might be inclined to act in a similar manner. A clear message of deterrence had to be sent to deter any other potentially like-minded individuals who might be similarly situated from ever entertaining the thought of engaging in similar conduct (<span class="font-italic">Amin bin Abdullah v Public Prosecutor</span> [2017] 5 SLR 904 at [66]). The signal, to be sent in the strongest possible terms, is that any who might think of following in the accused’s footsteps will be harshly punished. No less will suffice if the criminal law is to serve its function not only of preserving society’s moral fabric and values (<span class="font-italic">P</span><span class="font-italic">ublic Prosecutor v Kwong Kok Hing</span> [2008] 2 SLR(R) 684 at [17] and <span class="font-italic">P</span><span class="font-italic">ublic Prosecutor v Law Aik Meng</span> [2007] 2 SLR(R) 814 at [25(c)]), but of protecting those who are society’s very future.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 For completeness, I did not find that the principle of prevention carried significant weight. Indeed, the Prosecution did not seriously contend otherwise. I accepted the evidence of Dr Cai and Dr Gwee that the accused’s depression is in remission and has not relapsed, his recovery is progressing well, and that his likelihood of re-offending remains low given that the major risk factor of mental illness remains absent.

</div>
</div> Nonetheless, they remained of some guidance to the task at hand. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 I begin with <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v Gaiyathiri d/o Murugayan </span>[2022] 4 SLR 560 (“<span class="font-italic">Gaiyathiri</span>”). The offender (who had major depressive disorder and obsessive-compulsive personality disorder) killed her 24-year-old domestic worker in a fatal assault. This took place after the offender physically and psychologically tortured the victim over at least 35 days prior to her death. The offender was sentenced to 20 years of imprisonment for the s 304(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) culpable homicide charge, and to a global sentence of 30 years of imprisonment. The aggravating factors there were that there was an abuse of position by the offender of a vulnerable victim, prolonged abuse of the victim, use of weapons to cause hurt, as well as an absence of remorse. In my view, the accused’s culpability is marginally lower than that of the offender in <span class="font-italic">Gaiyathiri</span>. Further, the accused is a young offender, who has shown remorse and who has a low risk of re-offending. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 Based on the aggravating factors, however, the present case is more egregious than <span class="font-italic">P Mageswaran</span><span class="font-italic">, </span>where 18 years of imprisonment was imposed on the offender who suffered from executive deficits which caused him to act impulsively in strangling and suffocating an elderly family friend after he failed to get a loan from her. That said, unlike the offender in <span class="font-italic">P Mageswaran, </span>the accused is a young offender (who is now only 18 years old), and he acted under a more serious mental affliction when he was only 16 years old. Also, he has shown remorse and pleaded guilty. Next, I turn to <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v Sumanthiran s/o Selvarajoo</span> [2017] 3 SLR 879 (“<span class="font-italic">Sumanthiran</span>”), where a sentence of 14 years of imprisonment was imposed on the 18-year-old offender who suffered from impulsivity, and who physically assaulted a 64-year-old victim causing his death simply because he was irritated and angry at the sight of the victim in the park. Unlike the young offender in <span class="font-italic">Sumanthiran</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>who had antecedents and was at risk of re-offending<span class="font-italic">, </span>the accused has a low risk of reoffending (but only so long as certain protective factors remain). That said, his culpability is far higher than the young offender in <span class="font-italic">Sumanthiran.</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>By way of comparison, an appropriate sentence for the accused would fall between 15 to 18 years of imprisonment. In relation to the Prosecution’s submission for a range that would fall between 12 to 16 years of imprisonment, the lower end was not supported by the precedent cases cited at all. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 Drawing the threads together, balancing the aggravating factors against the mitigating factors of the accused’s mental condition, youth and plea of guilt, I imposed a sentence of 16 years’ imprisonment on the accused. Subject to remission for good behaviour, which the accused has indeed so far exhibited, he will spend slightly more than 10 years behind bars. This sentence is backdated to 19 July 2021. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span style="color: rgba(255,0,0,1) "></span><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span><span class="font-weight-bold" style="color: rgba(255,0,0,1)"> </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 In closing, I turn to address the Defence’s exhortation that this sad episode cannot be of punishment, but must rather be about redemption. At the hearing, the Defence urged the court to focus on the <span class="font-italic">recovery </span>of the accused. In part, I agreed. While the accused made deliberate choices which he could have made differently, and which led him to take the innocent life of another, it is also true that he would not have made them but for the mental affliction he suffered, and his desire to end his own life. However, the substantial sentence meted out is necessary to be proportionate to the responsibility which he must bear for what he did in pursuit of that goal. Five years of imprisonment, or even eight to nine years of imprisonment, as contended by the Defence, would hardly reflect the seriousness of the offence, or the high culpability of the accused. Further, the sentence is not intended only as retribution. The sentence is also necessary to deter others from doing what he has done, and from acting for the same twisted and misguided reasons. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 Although retribution and deterrence largely overrode rehabilitation in so far as sentencing was concerned, it did not mean that rehabilitation is impossible, or that redemption is out of reach, even while he remains in prison. Having been incarcerated for the past two years, there are some promising signs. The accused has turned in a stellar performance in his O level examinations, and he hopes to pursue studies in the social sciences and to help others who suffer from mental illness. He has a newfound faith which he now shares with his mother. The accused has a family who loves him deeply and has strongly rallied around him in his time of need, to whom he has opened up and drawn closer. Indeed, as the Prosecution stated at the hearing, it is important for the accused to continue with the rehabilitative journey in prison. Whether this story might be about recovery and redemption is up to the accused. After his release from prison, he has a long road ahead of him. With his insight into his mental health issues, and with his intelligence and abilities, he has what he needs to make his story one of redemption. With the help and support of his family, he should see to it that it happens. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 I turn to address the deceased’s loved ones. In reply to a letter of apology sent by the accused’s parents shortly after the tragedy, the deceased’s parents wrote, with what is a display of remarkable strength and fortitude, that they have forgiven the accused. As the deceased’s parents, together with other loved ones, continue to process the pain and sorrow brought about by his passing, it is hoped that with time, they will find a measure of healing and closure from this tragedy.  </div><table class="table table-sm table-borderless"><tbody><tr><td><div class="txt-body text-left">Hoo Sheau Peng<br/>Judge of the High Court</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-left"></div></td></tr></tbody></table><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Kumaresan Gohulabalan and Sean Teh (Attorney-General’s Chambers) for the Prosecution;</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Sunil Sudheesan, Ngiam Hian Theng Diana and Khoo Hui-Hui Joyce (Quahe Woo &amp; Palmer LLC) for the accused.</div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div><hr/><div class="row"><div class="col col-md-12 align-self-center"><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Annex A: Extracts from the Statement of Facts  </span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">III.

Sometime in April 2020, the Accused chanced upon a website hosting videos depicting actual scenes of human death (including murders and suicides), termed “snuff” videos. The Accused was initially disgusted by the snuff videos but grew curious about them. Eventually, the Accused began watching snuff videos from time to time, at inconsistent intervals. ….</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">6 Sometime in January 2021, the Accused felt overwhelmed during the new school term and entertained thoughts of suicide. The Accused’s mood was low, and he did not want to interact with people or deal with school responsibilities. Between January 2021 and March 2021, the Accused explored ways of committing suicide. As he had previously failed to commit suicide in February 2019, he perceived that the only way he could overcome the psychological barrier of taking his own life was by getting someone else to kill him. The Accused eventually decided to slash people in his school and commit “suicide by cop”, which involved killing more than one individual in a killing spree in order to give the police no choice but to shoot him to death. The Accused decided to kill people in RVHS as he felt that his chances of killing someone before he was subdued, which would have stopped him from dying, would be higher in the school as compared to carrying out the act in public.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">7 Sometime between February 2021 and March 2021, the Accused wrote two poems titled “Liberation” and “_Liberated_”, which alluded to mass killings conducted in a school. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">8 Between 8 March 2021 and 18 July 2021, the Accused also conducted online searches involving stabbings, school shootings / attacks, and suicide. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">B.

He left his classroom and headed to the toilet, where he found the caution tape hanging only on one side of the wall. There were students in the toilet. The Accused waited for them to leave. He then closed the toilet door and windows to prevent the prospective deceased’s screams of distress from being heard. Soon after, the Accused took out the black badminton bag he had hidden and brought it to the central cubicle of the toilet, where he locked the cubicle door. Inside the cubicle, the Accused took out the axe and the knife. …. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">20.

Upon noticing the Deceased enter, the Accused exited the toilet and pasted the caution tape across the corridor to prevent others from entering the toilet. He then re-entered the toilet and saw the Deceased urinating at a urinal. The Accused armed himself with the axe with his left hand on the upper grip of the axe and his right hand at the lower grip.

As she was contacting the school authorities, the Accused retrieved his handphone and called the police at 11.41am. The male teacher went to the toilet and saw the Deceased’s body. At about 11.42am, upon seeing the Deceased’s body, the male teacher called the police immediately.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">26. The Accused was escorted by staff of RVHS to the General Office of the school. Paramedics from the Singapore Civil Defence Force (“SCDF”) arrived at RVHS at about 11.53am, together with the police. The Deceased was pronounced dead by Sergeant Tan Wen Shi, a paramedic with the SCDF, at about 11.59am. The Accused was subsequently arrested.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">V.  Autopsy report</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">28. An autopsy was performed by A/Prof Teo Eng Swee on 20 July 2021 at about 9.50am at the Health Sciences Authority (“<span class="font-weight-bold">HSA</span>”) Mortuary. The Deceased’s cause of death was certified to be “<span class="font-weight-bold">Multiple Incised Wounds</span>”.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">29. According to the autopsy report, multiple incised wounds were found on the Deceased’s body, including wounds on his scalp, face and neck.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">30. In addition, fractures were found on the Deceased’s skull. Underlying one such fracture were multiple dural lacerations.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">VII. The Accused’s psychiatric condition</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">36.On 18 August 2021, Dr Kenji Gwee, the Principal Clinical Forensic Psychologist at the Institute of Mental Health, prepared a psychological report opining that, among others:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(a) There was insufficient evidence to support a diagnosis of Psychopathy. However, a high degree of callousness was present, which appeared to be a recent development rather than representative of the Accused’s underlying temperament.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(b) The Accused met the criteria for Major Depressive Disorder (“<span class="font-weight-bold">MDD</span>”) around the material time of the killing. Factors that contributed to the killing include:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(i) The Accused’s misguided curiosity to address existential angst;</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(ii)  The onset of depression, which accentuated the Accused’s fatalistic thinking, limited his perceived range of options when thinking about possible courses of actions, and hardened his otherwise empathic nature into a callous persona; and</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(iii) Consumption of snuff videos, which worsened this callousness, and additionally removed psychological obstacles to carrying out the alleged act by desensitising him to the physicality and gore when taking a life.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">37. On 19 August 2021, Dr Cai Yiming, a Psychiatrist at the Institute of Mental Health, prepared a psychiatric report opining that, among others:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(a) The Accused suffered from MDD of moderate severity for about six months leading to the killing. The Accused was not of unsound mind at the time of the offence, but his mental state amounted to an abnormality of mind as would have substantially impaired his criminal responsibility.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(b) There were three major and interacting factors of importance: (a) the Accused’s sensitive temperament with a tendency to keep things at heart and refusal to get external help, (b) his MDD, and (c) the harmful effects of his misguided exploration of the internet.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(c) The Accused is genetically predisposed to develop depression leading to a sense of hopelessness, where he felt that there was no way out of his life predicament other than committing suicide. His acts of killing appeared extraordinarily callous, which was out of his usual character.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(d) The Accused is fit to plead and stand trial in Court.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">38. On 26 September 2022, Dr Cai Yiming and Dr Kenji Gwee prepared the First Clarificatory Report, stating that, among others:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(a) The Accused’s response to treatment had been positive. …When assessed again on 19 September 2022, the Accused’s depression was also observed to be in remission.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">39. On 9 December 2022, Dr Cai Yiming and Dr Kenji Gwee prepared the Second Clarificatory Report, stating that, among others:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(a) The Accused was still able to comprehend and appreciate the physical damage required to increase the chances of death, and methodically prepared for the axe attack.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(b) The Accused’s MDD did hinder his ability to form a rational judgment as to whether an act was right or wrong. The Accused’s depression led to a serious consideration of suicide, as well as a limiting of alternative recourses. When he considered “suicide by cop” as a way to end his life, he knew that this was legally and morally wrong, and wrestled with some ambivalence over it for a few months. However, as his depression compromised his ability to make rational decisions, he ultimately resolved to proceed with his plan to commit “suicide by cop”. The Accused’s depression contributed to his irrationality in choice of suicide means and conviction towards completing his plan.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(c) The Accused’s choice of suicide means, as well as his conviction to carry out his plan, were distorted and irrational. However, his depression did not undermine his ability to wilfully control his physical acts to materialise his plan.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(d) If the Accused did not have MDD at the time of the killing, he would not have made the decision to attack the Deceased with the axe. His decision for a school slashing (culminating in the attack on the Deceased) was an irrational solution to his intention of suicide. This irrational choice and conviction in his suicide means, as well as his suicidality, arose because of his depression. Without depression, there were no other factors present that could sufficiently account for his killing of the Deceased with the axe.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(e) The Accused did not have any realistic moment of rationality and self-control that would have enabled him to pull back from his intention or plan to kill the Deceased. When he made up his mind to commit “suicide by cop”, the determination to carrying out the plan appeared to be intense. While he subsequently experienced some ambivalence and was also aware of the wrongfulness of using snuff videos in preparation for the murder, these did not override the initial conviction to completing his plan. The necessary stop that enabled him to pull back from his intention of a mass school slashing came only after he killed the Deceased and experienced a “psychological barrier” to continue [killing more people].</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">40. On 20 June 2023, Dr Cai Yiming and Dr Kenji Gwee prepared the Third Clarificatory Report, stating that, among others:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(a) The major domains in the Accused’s life that can affect the management of his MDD (currently in remission) continue to be addressed and remain stable when compared to the assessment in the First Clarificatory Report. Additionally, the Accused remains aware of, and is on the lookout for his symptoms of depression. The short-term prognosis is positive.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(b) A longer-term prognosis remains indeterminate due to unforeseeable, potential major life disruptions. Life and its stressors, and one’s response to them, can be dynamic. Nevertheless, potentially triggering events for the Accused can be identified: any decline in his grandparents’ <span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">heath (especially his maternal grandmother who is unable to visit him), comparing himself to peers who are perceived to be better than him, or difficulties integrating with the incarcerated population in prison.</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(c) The Accused’s depression remains in remission and there have not been any relapses.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(f) The Accused’s likelihood of re-offending remains low. There has been no change to his risk profile as previously described. The protective factors of being in an institutionalised setting, having limited access to tools for violence, availability of mental health services and the observations by wardens, as well as greater emotional connection with his family, remain present. As indicated earlier, the Accused’s depression is in remission, and <span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">he continues to be in the recovery phase – the major risk factor of mental illness thus remains absent.</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">41. By virtue of the psychiatric evidence presented by Dr Cai Yiming and Dr Kenji Gwee, the defence of diminished responsibility (under Exception 7 to section 300 of the Penal Code) is applicable to the Accused. At the time of the offence, the Accused was suffering from an abnormality of mind, <span class="font-italic">i.e.</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>MDD of moderate severity, as substantially impaired his capacity to know whether his acts were wrong.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"></div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
