<p class="Judg-Heading-1">INTRODUCTION</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       This is a partnership action brought by the
                    plaintiff in respect of alleged breaches by the defendant in discharging his
                    duties as a business partner from 1996 to 2006. The plaintiff is Ang Tin Gee
                    (also known as Julie Ang). The defendant is Pang Teck Guan (also known as Andy
                    Pang).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The plaintiff’s various complaints were
                    primarily about: (a) the conduct of the defendant as the working partner who
                    controlled and managed the day-to-day affairs of the business carried on in the
                    registered name and style of Japco TC International Enterprise
                    (“Japco”), and (b) the office consumables business carried on
                    through the entity known as Office Consumables Supplies (“OCS”), a
                    sole proprietorship registered in the defendant’s name. By seeking to
                    determine the true scope of the partnership businesses in this action, the
                    plaintiff is in effect asserting that the full scope of the businesses as
                    controlled and managed by the defendant as her partner had been concealed from
                    her. In other words, a breach of fiduciary duty by the defendant had occurred.
                    As such, the defendant is liable to, <em>inter alia</em>,
                    account for actual profits derived from the businesses undertaken respectively
                    by Japco and OCS. This relief will entail, <em>inter
                        alia</em>, an account of the benefits and/or gains which the defendant
                    derived from the use of Japco’s resources, funds and bank facilities to
                    finance the business operations of OCS, including payment of OCS’s
                    operating expenses.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       The defendant disputes the plaintiff’s
                    claims. The defences raised and relied upon by the defendant were primarily (a)
                    to deny the partnership <em>inter se</em>, or (b) to
                    maintain that OCS was his separate business and was never part of Japco’s
                    business.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       The question that lies at the heart of the
                    present case is the defendant’s duty to account for, <em>inter alia</em>, Japco’s moneys and OCS’s sales receipts
                    and his obligation to give a proper, complete and accurate account of all his
                    dealings and acts in respect of Japco’s moneys and OCS’s sales
                    receipts. The burden is on the defendant to show that at the relevant times, (a)
                    there was no loss to Japco arising from the use of Japco’s moneys for
                    OCS’s operating expenses, and (b) the profits of OCS had been earned
                    wholly or partly by means other than the use of Japco’s resources, moneys
                    and banking facilities.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">BACKGROUND OF THE DISPUTE</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The parties</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       The plaintiff and her husband, Tan Chor Koon
                    (“Chor Koon”), were introduced to the defendant by his then
                    fiancée (now wife), Dorothy Lee Soon Min (“Dorothy”). At the
                    material time, the plaintiff was working in Siemens and Dorothy was with a
                    travel agency. The plaintiff came to know Dorothy through the business dealings
                    of their respective employers, and they soon became friends. At some point in
                    the relationship, Dorothy introduced the defendant to the plaintiff and Chor
                    Koon. She and Dorothy had in fact discussed the possibility of setting up a
                    travel business together with the plaintiff investing the funds and Dorothy
                    running the business, but this did not materialise, and Dorothy therefore
                    introduced the plaintiff to the defendant instead to further explore the
                    plaintiff’s interest in going into business.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       According to the plaintiff, the defendant and
                    Dorothy represented to her that the defendant had considerable experience in the
                    import and export trading business of consumer electrical appliances. Indeed,
                    the defendant gave evidence that he had worked for United Overseas Bank
                    (“UOB”) for about four to five years as a front desk clerk and had
                    picked up some knowledge and know-how of trade operations and international
                    trade finance. He also gave evidence that he had worked for about two years as a
                    junior executive in a trading company which traded in electrical
                        goods.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> On the defendant’s part, he saw the
                    plaintiff as having funds to invest in a business. He himself had only been
                    working for six to seven years then and did not have any funds to start a
                        business.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The parties’ business relationship</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       Pursuant to their discussions, the defendant
                    prepared and handed to the plaintiff a three-page business proposal about going
                    into a partnership business trading in consumer electrical appliances overseas.
                    Later, the defendant submitted an amended three-page business proposal and a
                    further three pages, making it a six-page document. There was some dispute over
                    the sequence of the documentation provided to the plaintiff. Nothing turns of
                    this. Eventually, the parties signed a six-page document on 3 August 1996
                    (the “Partnership Agreement”).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       The parties strenuously dispute the terms of the
                    partnership. The plaintiff takes the position that the partnership was entered
                    into on the basis that they would be equal partners. As such, the parties were
                    to contribute equally to the capital and on an equal basis share the profits and
                    bear all losses sustained by the partnership. To the plaintiff, the parties
                    entered into an oral partnership agreement on or about 20 July 1996
                        (<em>ie</em>, before the parties signed the Partnership
                    Agreement) on the basis that they would be equal partners. The date 20 July
                    1996 is significant in that it was the same day the parties applied to register
                    the partnership business. The partnership was registered on 25 July 1996
                    under the trade name and style of Japco TG International Enterprise. The name
                    “Japco” is a combination and play on the parties’ names. The
                    letter “J” is for “Julie”. The second letter
                    “a” is for “Andy”. The first two letters
                    “Ja” are the initials of “Julia Ang”. The second and
                    third letters “ap” are the initials of “Andy Pang”.
                    Finally, the letters “TG” are the initials of the parties’
                    Chinese names, “Tin Gee” and “Teck Guan”. According
                    to the plaintiff, there were several discussions after the Partnership Agreement
                    was signed on 3 August 1996, and the discussions culminated in the
                    plaintiff accepting the defendant’s proposal that his salary be revised to
                    $3,362 with the defendant taking a profit share of 50%.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       In contrast, the defendant challenges the
                    existence of a partnership <em>inter se</em>. The defendant
                    denies the oral agreement on or about 20 July 1996<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span> and
                    maintains that the Partnership Agreement constitutes the entire agreement
                    between the parties.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_5" id="Ftn_5_1"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span> He also denies any supervening
                    oral agreement as described. As I will explain below at [49-66], I find these
                    factual disputes immaterial in any case since they do not affect the
                    construction of the Partnership Agreement and the real issues to be
                    resolved.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Japco’s bank facilities</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     About a week after the signing the Partnership
                    Agreement, the parties received a letter of offer dated 10 August 1996 from
                    UOB for the sum of $950,000 for Japco.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     The parties signed in acceptance of
                    UOB’s offer on 13 August 1996. The banking facilities were and are
                    secured by (1) an open mortgage over the plaintiff’s property at 44
                    Sunrise Terrace Sunrise Villa, Singapore and (2) fresh joint and several
                    guarantees by the plaintiff and defendant in favour of UOB for $950,000
                    (“the Guarantee”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     Under this Letter of Offer, UOB granted not
                    only trade facilities but also two overdraft facilities: (a) Account No
                    101-365-513-3 with an overdraft facility of $100,000 (“UOB Account No
                    1”); and (b) Account No 101-365-514-1 with an overdraft facility of
                    $200,000 (“UOB Account No 2”). These two accounts will be
                    collectively referred to as “the UOB accounts”). In May 1998, the
                    limit of the banking facilities was revised by UOB. For present purpose, I need
                    only mention UOB Account No 2 where the available overdraft facility was
                    increased from $200,000 to $250,000.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Japco’s business in consumer electrical goods and the
                Seychelles Debt </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     From both parties’ versions of the
                    story, the plaintiff had a full time job and that her role in the partnership
                    was to fund the business whereas the defendant would run it. To the plaintiff,
                    the defendant had something to bring to the partnership: he would contribute his
                    “expertise” and “experience” to the partnership.
                    From his business proposal, the plaintiff was given the impression that he had
                    the necessary customer base and supplier base and was thus confident to put down
                    on paper his estimate of a sales turnover of $250,000 for September to December
                    1996, and of $1 million for 1997. During cross-examination of the defendant, it
                    transpired that the defendant’s experience and knowledge was limited. He
                    had no supplier base and no customer base for consumer electrical appliances.
                    His estimates of the sales turnover were completely without bases and hence the
                    figures were misleading in a grossly exaggerated way. It was not surprising that
                    Japco’s business in consumer electrical appliances was not successful at
                    the best of times.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     Japco carried on its business in consumer
                    electrical appliances from about September 1996 to about September 2000 when OCS
                    started operations.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     Sometime in September 1997, Japco’s
                    business faced a major setback in the form of a customer, YL Electrics/Home
                    Electronics from the Seychelles (“YL Electronics”), defaulting in
                    payment in the sum of $146,462.95 (the “Seychelles Debt”).
                    According to the defendant, Stephen Pillay (“Stephen”) from YL
                    Electronics was an existing customer at the time and there had been previous
                    successful transactions with him. However, in this particular transaction,
                    Stephen wanted to order more goods but on credit. As the value of the goods was
                    high, the defendant sought the plaintiff’s consent and she then sent Chor
                    Koon to have a meeting with the defendant and Stephen in Singapore. In addition
                    to the meeting, the defendant also travelled to Seychelles with Chor Koon to
                    inspect Stephen’s assembly plant and wholesale centre. Unfortunately, YL
                    Electronics eventually defaulted in payment of one of the two shipments made,
                    and the total sum defaulted on was $146,462.95.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     According to the plaintiff, she only found out
                    when the defendant informed her about the default sometime in late 1997. The
                    plaintiff expressed her concern that this was a big sum of money, and the
                    defendant assured her that he would pursue YL Electronics for the repayment of
                    the debt. When his efforts failed, Japco took legal action against YL
                    Electronics in Seychelles.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     The plaintiff, the defendant and Dorothy went
                    to the Seychelles to attend court with regard to the Seychelles Debt, eventually
                    obtaining judgment in the sum of $146,462.95. The plaintiff alleges that she has
                    since then not seen the judgment sum despite chasing the defendant about it.
                    However, she had no reason at that point in time to suspect that the defendant
                    was not being honest with her.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     The parties’ positions are consistent
                    insofar as they both see the Seychelles Debt as a source of Japco’s
                    financial woes. According to the plaintiff, she enquired at regular intervals
                    about the financial health of Japco and on a few occasions asked for
                    Japco’s financial statement. The defendant always assured her that
                    Japco’s business was doing well and that the total loss came only from the
                    Seychelles Debt, and that he would chase YL Electronics for the judgment
                        debt.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_6" id="Ftn_6_1"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span> According to the defendant,
                    the Seychelles Debt was the turning point of the business in consumer electrical
                    appliances. Following that experience, the plaintiff was not willing to sell on
                    credit terms to overseas customers. It became clear to the defendant that
                    Japco’s business in consumer electrical appliances which involved trading
                    overseas was not sustainable and that was why he made the proposal in <a href="#p1_20">[20]</a> below to switch to trading in office
                    consumables for the domestic market.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     The defendant also claims that due to the
                    setback in business caused by the Seychelles Debt, he did not receive his full
                    salary since January 1999 despite having to work even harder, and furthermore he
                    was not paid the agreed AWS, share of profits and his unutilised leave. These
                    are the sources of the first head of his counterclaim set out at <a href="#p1_45">[45]</a> below.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Office Consumable Supplies</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     Sometime in late 1999 or early 2000, the
                    defendant verbally proposed to the plaintiff that Japco should go into the sale
                    of office consumable products in the domestic market. The plaintiff
                    agreed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     According to the plaintiff, OCS was formed in
                    March 2000 pursuant to the defendant’s representations to her that, in
                    order to gain an advantage in the domestic market for office consumable
                    products, it was necessary to form a new entity to be Japco’s
                    “selling arm”
                    <em>ie</em>, Japco would buy the office consumable products
                    and the new entity would sell them (“the business model”). It is
                    unclear from the plaintiff’s evidence what the rationale for the proposed
                    business model was. However, one purpose of interposing the new entity was to
                    ensure that the identity of the suppliers to Japco would not be apparent to
                    customers and competitors. Furthermore, the interposing of the new entity in the
                    retail side of the business was to be an “internal arrangement”
                    between Japco and the new entity.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     The plaintiff asserts that she and the
                    defendant agreed that the new entity (<em>ie</em>, OCS)
                    (see above at [21]) would be effectively “owned” by Japco as Japco
                    would fund all OCS’s start-up costs and operating expenses, and that OCS
                    would be registered in Dorothy’s name as sole proprietor to avoid giving
                    the impression to customers and competitors that Japco and OCS were operating
                    under the same management. Japco would procure, purchase and pay for goods
                    supplied to OCS at cost price, and OCS would then transfer back to Japco its
                    entire revenue from the sale of goods supplied by Japco.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     On the other hand, the defendant claims that
                    there is “absolutely no basis”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_7" id="Ftn_7_1"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span> for the plaintiff to
                    claim any legal interest in OCS. According to the defendant, he built the OCS
                    business completely by himself and, even though OCS could have bypassed Japco
                    completely in its business, he had chosen in his goodwill to help Japco receive
                    a steady income through OCS, in order to clear Japco’s overdrafts in its
                    two UOB accounts after the Seychelles Debt. Not only did he help Japco through
                    OCS out of his goodwill, he had even overpaid the sum of $130,080.19 to Japco
                    – this is the second head of the defendant’s counterclaim as
                    specified below at <a href="#p1_45">[45]</a>. The defendant
                    further alleges – somewhat inconsistently to my mind – that the only
                    reason why the plaintiff did not include her name as a partner of OCS was simply
                    because she wished to avoid liability.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_8" id="Ftn_8_1"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span> The defendant has also
                    taken the position that he was free to set up OCS as his own since he was a mere
                    employee of Japco.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     The provenance of OCS is one of the main
                    disputes between the parties. According to the plaintiff, it was only after she
                    decided in April 2006 to close Japco that the plaintiff made an ACRA search on
                    OCS on 7 June 2006, and it was then that she found out that OCS was not
                    registered in the name of the defendant’s wife but in the
                    defendant’s own name as sole proprietor.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Japco’s business in office consumable products</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     OCS was registered on 3 March 2000 and
                    commenced operations in September 2000, and it was the significant buyer of
                    office consumables from Japco<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_9" id="Ftn_9_1"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span>. The defendant saw himself
                    as the “OMO” (acronym for one-man operator) of Japco.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_10" id="Ftn_10_1"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span>
                    Furthermore, the defendant who was paid by Japco ran the whole show – that
                    is to say, the office consumables businesses of both Japco and OCS. There is no
                    dispute that at all times, OCS operated from the same premises as Japco,
                    wherever those premises happened to be at the moment as Japco moved premises a
                    few times.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     Japco’s overdrafts in the two UOB
                    accounts were the source of funds to finance the business operations of Japco
                    and OCS. This is consistent with the plaintiff’s position that their
                    agreement was that Japco would fund the start-up costs and the operating
                    expenses of OCS. The defendant did not refute this allegation. Interestingly,
                    the defendant admitted in cross-examination that Japco had funded OCS’s
                    start-up costs and operating expenses, and Japco paid the suppliers upfront.
                    However, he denied that the Japco’s purchases were passed to OCS to sell
                    at cost price. He maintained that OCS would buy from Japco with a mark
                        up.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_11" id="Ftn_11_1"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     Finally, it is common ground that
                    Japco’s Balance Sheet and Profit &amp; Loss Statement for each financial
                    year were prepared by the defendant and that he would give them to the plaintiff
                    for her tax returns.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     The plaintiff’s real objection, as I see
                    it, is to the manner in which the defendant ran OCS contrary to their
                    arrangement that OCS was to be part of the partnership business. If this were
                    true, there is no doubt that the plaintiff would be entitled to an account of
                    the defendant’s profits from OCS as a breach of his fiduciary duty to the
                    plaintiff. In his defence, the defendant asserts that OCS was an independent
                    business. I deal with this at <a href="#p1_69">[69]</a>-<a href="#p1_82">[82]</a> below. How the defendant’s admission
                    that Japco funded OCS’s start-up costs and operating expenses affects his
                    defence will also be discussed later.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">End of the business relationship</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     As expected, the plaintiff and the defendant
                    have diametrically opposing accounts of how the business relationship broke
                    down.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The plaintiff’s version</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     As stated, the defendant controlled and
                    managed the day-to-day affairs of Japco. The defendant said in his Closing
                    Submissions that after OCS was incorporated, the plaintiff and Chor Koon, ceased
                    to be actively involved in the business of Japco.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_12" id="Ftn_12_1"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span> The plaintiff gave
                    evidence that she had difficulty in assessing Japco’s true financial
                    status due to the high volume of transactions and purchases, invoices and other
                    business related documents, so she had to rely on the defendant to update her on
                    the business. According to the plaintiff, she made numerous requests through the
                    years for the defendant to disclose and render accounts of the business
                    operations of Japco and OCS, but the defendant had failed to do
                so.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     The plaintiff remained concerned that despite
                    the defendant’s promises that Japco’s overdrafts in the two UOB
                    accounts would be reduced from OCS’s sales revenues, the defendant was
                    still unable to reduce the overdrafts. She continued to ask the defendant about
                    Japco’s and OCS’s financial situation and he kept representing, as
                    above at <a href="#p1_18">[18]</a> that Japco’s total loss
                    was only about $150,000 (<em>ie</em>, the bulk of it came
                    from the Seychelles Debt).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     Sometime in early March 2006, <em>ie</em>, about six years after the registration of OCS, she
                    finally indicated to the defendant that she want to close Japco, and asked the
                    defendant for a full list of debtors, stocks, assets and creditors, on the basis
                    that they were going to end the business relationship.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     The defendant therefore prepared a business
                    spreadsheet as at 30 March 2006 for the plaintiff’s information
                    (“the 30 March 2006 Statement”).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_13" id="Ftn_13_1"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span> The plaintiff was shocked
                    to see from the 30 March 2006 Statement that the cumulative losses incurred
                    by Japco stood at $241,425.57 and not about $150,000 as the defendant had always
                    represented (see <a href="#p1_31">[31]</a> above). She demanded
                    an explanation and a full and complete account of the alleged loss, which she
                    avers that the defendant has to date not provided. She also asked for a plan to
                    recover the alleged loss of $241,425.57.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     The defendant then proposed an expansion plan.
                    The plan was to move Japco and OCS into a prime location at Chinatown and employ
                    more sales staff while keeping the existing office premises as a warehouse. The
                    plaintiff exhibited the defendant’s expansion plan in her Affidavit of
                    Evidence-in-Chief, and the exhibit itself was not disputed by the
                        defendant.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_14" id="Ftn_14_1"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span> The defendant
                    estimated that the expansion would require about $80,000 and asked the plaintiff
                    to inject that sum so that the expansion would increase sales turnover with
                    higher profit margins to help recover the loss of $241,425.57.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     Being suspicious, the plaintiff decided to
                    check Japco’s account with the Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore
                    (“IRAS”) and discovered that the defendant had different accounts
                    of what he had submitted to IRAS and what he had submitted to her. Based on
                    figures declared by the defendant to IRAS in Form P, the total loss incurred by
                    Japco from Year of Assessment (“YA”) 1997 to YA 2007 was
                    $209,551.00. However, a comparison of Profit and Loss Statements and Balance
                    Sheets submitted to IRAS and in the 30 March 2006 Statement were different
                    in the line items for YA 1997, 1998, 2002 and 2003.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_15" id="Ftn_15_1"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span> The plaintiff also exhibited
                    these figures in her Affidavit of Evidence-in-Chief.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     On or about 7 April 2006, the plaintiff
                    decided enough was enough and told the defendant that she wanted to discontinue
                    the businesses of Japco and OCS. The defendant told her that he would therefore
                    dissolve the partnership business within three months, and that he would reduce
                    the overdraft in UOB Account No 1 to zero within the next three months from the
                    sales receipts of OCS, and thereafter reduce the overdraft in UOB Account No
                    2.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     As late as July 2006, the plaintiff still did
                    not see progress in dissolving Japco and OCS. She had two other meetings with
                    the defendant with regards to dissolving the businesses, on or about
                    25 June 2006 and 2 September 2006. A summary prepared by the defendant
                    of these discussions was produced in evidence.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_16" id="Ftn_16_1"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span> This summary factors OCS into the
                    plan to dissolve Japco, specifically, that the dissolution plan included the
                    transfer of an account balance of $12,600.10 per the 30 March 2006
                    Statement from OCS to Japco. The plaintiff relies, <em>inter
                        alia</em>, upon this in her submissions that the defendant himself
                    clearly acknowledged that OCS was part of Japco.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     Despite factoring OCS into the plan to
                    dissolve Japco, the defendant did not dissolve OCS together with Japco but
                    merely changed its address.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     On 8 April 2006, Dorothy registered a
                    sole proprietorship firm called D’Imaging Solutions &amp; Services
                    (“DSS”). The plaintiff alleged that the defendant and Dorothy set
                    up DSS in respond to Japco’s exit from the business with OCS as the buying
                    arm for office consumable goods and DSS as the selling arm.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The defendant’s version</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     According to the defendant, although the
                    purchases by OCS “kept Japco afloat”, by the first quarter of 2006
                    he had expressed his intention to leave Japco because there were frequent
                    matrimonial disputes between the plaintiff and Chor Koon. He explained that
                    since Chor Koon was also involved in the running of the partnership business,
                    their disputes made it very difficult for him to continue with the business. It
                    was in this context that he shared with the plaintiff his expansion plan for OCS
                    referred to by the plaintiff at <a href="#p1_34">[34]</a> above.
                    His intention was to continue trading with Japco even after he left
                    Japco.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     According to the defendant, their relationship
                    only broke down because of a break-in. On 30 March 2006, the plaintiff
                    called him and informed him that Chor Koon was furious and wanted her to produce
                    a set of the partnership accounts. Since she sounded desperate, he
                    “agreed to help her as best [he] could”. That was how he prepared
                    the 30 March 2006 Statement and he therefore alleges that it was “a
                    very rough estimate and…not based on the full set of documents and
                        accounts”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_17" id="Ftn_17_1"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a></span> He even
                    claimed that it was on the plaintiff’s instructions that he should state
                    the overdraft in UOB Account No 2 as $250,000 when it was not.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_18" id="Ftn_18_1"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a></span> Eventually,
                    “things came to a head” when the plaintiff and Chor Koon broke
                    into Japco’s premises on 7 April 2006 and seized all the business
                    documents between that date and 9 April 2006. The defendant attributed the
                    breakdown of the business and the relationship to the plaintiff’s
                    “break-in” on 7 April 2006, even going so far as to say that
                    this suit “might not have commenced if not for the
                        break-in.”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_19" id="Ftn_19_1"><sup>[note: 19]</sup></a></span> He discovered later that
                    documents taken pertained not only to Japco but to OCS as well.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     The defendant next met the plaintiff on the
                    morning of 9 April 2006, where he informed the plaintiff that he would have
                    to lodge a police report if she did not restore the office to its original
                    condition or if he was not able to gain access to the office. Less than thirty
                    minutes later, the plaintiff called again and requested for another meeting. By
                    then he had already returned home and informed her that it was not necessary to
                    meet again. But the plaintiff breached the security of his apartment and came up
                    to his unit where she screamed and banged on his door, leading to his making a
                    police report (the “9 April Police Report”) and the arrival
                    of the police.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     On 10 April 2006 upon returning to the
                    office at about 10am, he found that it had been ransacked and he therefore made
                    a second police report (the “10 April Police Report”).
                    According to the defendant, had there been no break-in, the business
                    relationship with the plaintiff would have continued.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">COMMENCEMENT OF THIS ACTION</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     The plaintiff commenced this action against
                    the defendant on 23 March 2008. Although not precisely spelled out, it was
                    evident from the plaintiff’s arguments and remedies prayed for that the
                    causes of action were negligence and breach of fiduciary duty. She is
                    claiming:</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     The defendant has filed a counterclaim
                    for:</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id=""></a>The sum of $142,932 consisting of unpaid salary, AWS, 25%
                        share of profits and pay in lieu of unutilised leave;</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="-p3_b_1"></a>(b)       The sum of $130,080.19 which OCS
                            had allegedly overpaid to Japco.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     At the trial, the plaintiff was represented by
                    Mr Lai Kwok Seng (“Mr Lai”). The defendant was
                    represented by Mr Leslie Yeo (“Mr Yeo”). The plaintiff
                    and Chor Koon both testified at the trial. The defendant called his wife,
                    Dorothy, as his witness and they both testified in court.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">DISCUSSION AND DECISION</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     The plaintiff’s claims are, of course,
                    premised on the existence of a partnership between the parties, and in
                    particular that OCS and Japco were partnership businesses. The defendant makes
                    various arguments in denial of the plaintiff’s claims: he denies that
                    there was a partnership <em>inter se</em> in the first
                    place; in the alternative he denies that OCS and Japco were partnership
                    businesses. It is therefore logical for me to first consider whether there was
                    any partnership <em>inter se</em> and, if so, what the
                    terms of this partnership were, and in particular if OCS was part of the same
                    partnership business. In the event that I find the defendant’s claims to
                    be spurious, I will deal with the relief the plaintiff seeks in this action
                    under two main heads: first, for an account; and second, for an indemnity in
                    respect of any sums the plaintiff is liable to pay UOB in respect of the two UOB
                    accounts (see above at <a href="#p1_12">[12]</a>). I will then
                    deal with the defendant’s counterclaim. Finally, for the sake of
                    completeness, I will deal with the remaining arguments raised by the parties, in
                    particular to explain my dismissal of the plaintiff’s claim in
                    negligence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     At this juncture, it is worth noting that the
                    evidence to test the veracity of the defence that OCS’s business was
                    independent of Japco’s business overlaps with the evidence going to the
                    issue of the defendant’s fiduciary duty of good faith, so some repetition
                    of the evidence in discussions here and below is unavoidable.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">(1)   The Partnership</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">(a)   Was there a partnership inter se; and if so, in what
                shares?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     At first blush, the defendant’s denial
                    that there was a partnership at all seems hardly tenable given the background
                    facts: the idea of the plaintiff and the defendant teaming up, the choice of the
                    business name “Japco TC”, and the formality of registration of the
                    business name were all for the sole purpose of going into business together.
                    However, the defendant claimed in his pleadings that he was an employee of Japco
                    and that he would be paid a salary and commission. The implication of this plea
                    is clear. As an employee, he would not be liable for capital contributions, bank
                    borrowings and the losses of Japco. In his latest amendments to the Defence, the
                    defendant deleted the word “commission” and replaced it with the
                    word “profit-sharing”. However, he continued nevertheless to aver
                    in the pleadings that he was an employee of Japco.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_20" id="Ftn_20_1"><sup>[note: 20]</sup></a></span>
                    According to the defendant, in the Partnership Agreement, his basic salary was
                    $2,801 per month but this was subsequently revised to $3,362 and a share of 25%
                    of Japco’s profits. No details of this revision were documented or adduced
                    in oral testimony.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     At this stage, I should mention that this plea
                    – that the defendant was an employee of Japco - is not borne out anywhere
                    in his written and oral testimonies. The pleaded case is not supported by the
                    defendant’s Affidavit of Evidence-in-Chief. Not only was there no mention
                    in the Affidavit of Evidence-in-Chief that he was an employee of Japco, his
                    written testimony plainly recognised the existence of a partnership <em>inter se</em> between the parties: the written testimony was
                    replete with the use of the word “partnership”, a term the
                    defendant had frequently used to identify Japco and his role as the
                    “working partner”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_21" id="Ftn_21_1"><sup>[note: 21]</sup></a></span>. To illustrate, the
                    defendant described Japco as the “partnership
                        business”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_22" id="Ftn_22_1"><sup>[note: 22]</sup></a></span>, and as
                    the “working partner”, he was asked by the plaintiff to prepare
                    the accounts of the “partnership”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_23" id="Ftn_23_1"><sup>[note: 23]</sup></a></span>. The defendant identified
                    the UOB Accounts as the “2 main Singapore Dollar partnership
                        accounts”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_24" id="Ftn_24_1"><sup>[note: 24]</sup></a></span>, and the
                    UOB bank statements were the “bank statements of the
                        partnership”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_25" id="Ftn_25_1"><sup>[note: 25]</sup></a></span>.
                    Moreover, Japco’s accounts were referred to as the “partnership
                        accounts”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_26" id="Ftn_26_1"><sup>[note: 26]</sup></a></span>. He
                    accepted the documents pertaining to Japco as the “documents pertaining
                    to the partnership”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_27" id="Ftn_27_1"><sup>[note: 27]</sup></a></span> or “partnership
                        documents”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_28" id="Ftn_28_1"><sup>[note: 28]</sup></a></span>, and he referred to
                    Japco’s office as the “partnership premises”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_29" id="Ftn_29_1"><sup>[note: 29]</sup></a></span> or “partnership
                        office”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_30" id="Ftn_30_1"><sup>[note: 30]</sup></a></span>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     In direct contradiction to the pleaded case,
                    the defendant’s counsel, Mr Yeo, maintains in Closing Submissions
                    that the defendant was a “salaried partner”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_31" id="Ftn_31_1"><sup>[note: 31]</sup></a></span>. This
                    submission was inspired by the defendant’s unfounded claim made during
                    cross-examination on 16 March 2011:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_32" id="Ftn_32_1"><sup>[note: 32]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">A: ...we are saying that internally, you know, I’m just a salaried
                        partner, you know.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Q: ...You’re an equal partner from day one, what salary partner are
                        you talking about?</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">A: Can you repeat the question again?</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Q: ... you are telling this court you are a salary partner</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">A: No, I am saying that I am receiving the salary and I am the other
                        partner. Because I am drawing the salary, you know, and I am also a
                        partner.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Q: Now, we all know, Mr Pang, you’re working for Japco?</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">A:Yes.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Q: Yes, right, and you’re paid a salary?</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">A: Yes.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Q: And you’re paid an AWS and so on?</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">A: Yes.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Q: But that doesn’t, mean that you are not a partner, an equal
                        partner of Japco. Do you understand the difference or not?</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">A: Yes</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Q: OK. Good. So then is it your evidence then that you are, just to
                        confirm with this court you are the precedent partner and executive partner
                        of Japco?</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">A: Yes.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     In the premises and based on the overall
                    evidence before me, the partnership <em>inter se</em>
                    between the plaintiff and the defendant is indisputable, and I find that the
                    plaintiff and the defendant were partners of Japco.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     Given this finding, the next issue is the
                    defendant’s percentage share in the partnership. This is fiercely disputed
                    between the parties. The plaintiff’s position is that she and the
                    defendant were equal partners under the Partnership Agreement or by subsequent
                    agreement, and were therefore to contribute equally to the capital and to share
                    equally the partnership’s profits and losses. The defendant disagrees that
                    his interest in the partnership was equal. In particular, the defendant relies
                    on clause 3.0 of the Partnership Agreement, which reads:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Monthly Basic Salary to be commenced at S$2,801.00 from date of agreement
                        signed.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">1 month AWS at the end of the year based on Basic Salary with Profit
                        Sharing of 10% after Net P&amp;L.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Profit Sharing ceiling at 25%, thereafter subject to further
                        discussion.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     Notably, the defendant’s position on his
                    percentage share in the partnership was inconsistent. In his Closing
                    Submissions, Mr Yeo accepts that the Partnership Agreement spelled out a
                    profit-sharing arrangement between the defendant and the plaintiff. However, he
                    submits that the defendant’s share of the profits was only 10% with a cap
                    at 25%, and that there was never any discussion between the parties on a
                    percentage increase from 10% to 25%. From this profit-sharing arrangement,
                    Mr Yeo in further submissions (<em>vide</em> his Reply
                    of 3 May 2011) maintain that the defendant was a salaried partner.
                    Furthermore, Mr Yeo highlights that the Partnership Agreement did not
                    provide as to when and how this increase in percentage from 10% to 25% would
                    occur. It also did not provide that the defendant would eventually be entitled
                    to 50% share of the profits, noting that it was indefinitely left as a matter to
                    be further discussed between the parties. Having made these submissions, and in
                    apparent contradiction, Mr Yeo, without explaining the basis, filed a
                    Counterclaim to recover as due and unpaid the defendant’s 25% profit share
                    of Japco’s profits for the period 1996 to 2006. Mr Yeo then argues
                    that the Partnership Agreement did not provide in percentage terms the share of
                    the losses and the contribution of the capital which the defendant was to bear.
                    Therefore, in developing his argument, Mr Yeo claims that the losses and
                    the contribution of the capital were to be borne by the plaintiff. His fallback
                    argument in the alternative is that the losses and capital contributions were to
                    be calculated in the proportion of the defendant’s 10% profit. By his
                    fallback argument, the defendant is inexplicably reverting to a smaller
                    percentage thereby contradicting the higher percentage claim of 25% in the
                    Counterclaim.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     Insofar as the defendant claims that he was
                    only a salaried partner and therefore not liable for the finances and losses of
                    the business, I have already rejected this at <a href="#p1_50">[50]</a>-<a href="#p1_52">[52]</a> above. I therefore
                    will consider if any of his other positions, denying that he had an equal share
                    in the partnership, are borne out by the evidence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     As a preliminary point, I agree with the
                    defendant and reject the plaintiff’s argument that there was an oral
                    supervening agreement after the Partnership Agreement was signed. I also agree
                    with the defendant that the Guarantee furnished to UOB does not by itself
                    necessarily establish that the partnership was in fact equal. Whether the
                    partnership was one of equal shares must therefore be based on the terms of the
                    Partnership Agreement and the parties’ course of dealing, to which I now
                    turn. In construing the Partnership Agreement, the background facts as set out
                    in <a href="#p1_49">[49]</a> above are relevant. This will assist
                    the court in determining objectively the intention of the contracting parties as
                    expressed in the document. The court gives regard to the commercial purpose of
                    the Partnership Agreement and the circumstances in which the agreement was made
                    (see <em>Ang Tin Yong v Ang Boon Chye and Another</em>
                    [2011] SGCA 60 (“<em>Ang Ting
                    Yong</em>”) at <a href="#p1_11">[11]</a>)</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     Clause 2.1 under “Terms and
                    Conditions” in the Partnership Agreement explicitly provides:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Capital to be maintained at S$250,000 in 3 years time for <em>equal partnership purpose</em> [emphasis
                            added].<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_33" id="Ftn_33_1"><sup>[note: 33]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a>58     In my view, clause 2.1 is concerned with the
                    capital contribution and the capital account of each partner. A distinction
                    between the capital of a partnership and its assets was observed in <em>Reed (H.M. Inspector of Taxes) v Young</em> [1984] Tax Cases
                    196 at 215 as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The capital of a partnership is the aggregate of the contributions made by
                        the partners, either in cash or in kind, for the purpose of commencing or
                        carrying on the partnership business and intended to be risked by them
                        therein. Each contribution must be of a fixed amount. If it is in cash, it
                        speaks for itself. If it is in kind, it must be valued at a stated amount.
                            <em>It is important to distinguish between the capital of
                            a partnership, a fixed sum, on the one hand and its assets, which may
                            vary from day to day and include everything belonging to the firm having
                            any money value, on the other</em> (see generally Lindley on the
                        Law of Partnership, 14<sup>th</sup> ed (1979)

          <em>Reed v Young</em>
                    went to the House of Lords and the sentence highlighted in emphasis above was
                    expressly approved by Lord Oliver with whose speech the other Lordships agreed
                    (see [1986] 1 WLR 649 at 654). The reference to “Lindley on
                    Partnership” should now be to <em>Lindley &amp; Banks on
                        Partnership</em> (19<sup>th</sup> Ed (2010)
                        (“<em>Lindley</em>”) at
                573.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a>60     With this distinction in mind, I return to
                    clause 2.1 which provides that the capital is $250,000 and by agreement it is
                    fixed at $250,000 for “equal partnership purpose”. In other words,
                    the capital of this partnership is the aggregate of each partner’s
                    contribution of $125,000. Furthermore, by agreement, the capital of $250,000 is
                    frozen at this figure for three years. The three-year time frame is evidently
                    intended to accommodate the fact that the defendant would require more time to
                    contribute his share of the capital of the partnership (see further below at
                        <a href="#p1_63">[63]</a>). It is common ground that in 1996,
                    the defendant could not contribute towards the start-up costs (<em>ie</em>, the costs of acquiring the partnership assets).
                    There is no dispute that the plaintiff solely contributed the initial capital of
                    $39,041.88, and this initial sum is usually reflected in the plaintiff’s
                    capital account of the partnership. In reality, this three-year time frame was
                    not adhered to. The defendant never contributed to his share of the capital
                    whereas the plaintiff made four more capital contributions into Japco consisting
                    of:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_60-p2_a"></a>(a)     $30,000 on or about
                        26 September 2000;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_60-p2_b"></a>(b)     $20,000 on or about 31 October
                    2000;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_60-p2_c"></a>(c)     $15,000 on or
                        about 30 January 2001; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_60-p2_d"></a>(d)     $20,000 on or about 6 July
                2005.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a>61     I digress for a moment to comment on clause 2.
                    In this clause, the word “Capital” was improperly used to describe
                    the partnership’s bank overdrafts. The individual partners did not borrow
                    money on their own account to fund their capital contributions and to bring it
                    into the partnership <em>qua</em> capital. In this case,
                    bank overdrafts represented the working capital of the partnership. In
                    particular, UOB granted not only trade finance facilities but overdraft
                    facilities in the two UOB accounts. In May 1998, the limit of the banking
                    facilities was revised by UOB. For present purpose, I need only mention UOB
                    Account No 2 where the available overdraft facility was increased from $200,000
                    to $250,000.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_62"></a>62     As mentioned at <a href="#p1_53">[53]</a> above, the defendant relies on clause 3.0 of the
                    Partnership Agreement as evidence of an unequal partnership. I reject this
                    argument. Clause 3.0 must be read subject to the explicit provision in clause
                    2.1 above that the capital of $250,000 was for “<em>equal
                        partnership purpose</em>” [emphasis added]. In the Partnership
                    Agreement, the defendant agreed to provide his services on a full time basis at
                    a total remuneration package that comprised of three components: salary, AWS and
                    net profits of between 10-15%. It is quite clear from reference to “net
                    profits” that if the partnership business did not make money, there would
                    be no net profits available to pay the third component of the remuneration
                    package. In other words, the third component is contingent on the performance of
                    the business. Arguably, if the business made money, the defendant is entitled
                    contractually to payment of the third component of the remuneration package even
                    though, for instance, the partnership decides not to distribute the trading
                    profits for business or management reasons.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_63"></a>63     The plaintiff’s evidence is that the
                    25%-40% differential (depending on the share of profits agreed upon at the time)
                    represented the defendant’s cash contribution to Japco’s capital so
                    that within three years he would, at least, be able to ‘catch up’
                    with the plaintiff’s initial capital injection. What the plaintiff is
                    really saying is that the intention was to capitalise the defendant’s
                    share of declared profits amounting to 25-40% of net profits. This intention is
                    in harmony with clause 2.1, which as I have held, is quite plain in providing
                    that the partnership was to be equal. In contrast, the defendant’s
                    interpretation - that it was up to him to use the profit share he received under
                    clause 3.0 to contribute towards his share of the capital - is inconsistent with
                    clause 2.1.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_64"></a>64     Significantly, the defendant’s written
                    declaration of his interest in the partnership reinforces the terms of the
                    Partnership Agreement in evincing that the partnership was an equal one. In his
                    submissions of Form P to IRAS for the tax returns of 1996 to 2007 (<em>ie</em>, the lifespan of Japco), <em>the
                        defendant consistently reported under Section B on “Partnership
                        Allocation” that the basis for the distribution of profit and loss is
                        50:50</em>.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_34" id="Ftn_34_1"><sup>[note: 34]</sup></a></span> In
                    my view, Section B is effectively the defendant’s signed declaration of
                    the parties’ equal interest in the partnership. Again, this signed
                    declaration is consistent with my reading of an equal partnership in clause 2.1
                    of the Partnership Agreement.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_65"></a>65     Lastly, this pattern of reporting to IRAS is
                    buttressed by internal correspondence between the parties themselves. In an
                    email dated 1 April 1999, where the defendant provides the plaintiff
                    information for her “tax return purposes”, the defendant reports
                    to the plaintiff that the Partnership Allocation has been declared in Form P to
                    IRAS as 50:50.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_35" id="Ftn_35_1"><sup>[note: 35]</sup></a></span> The
                    suggestion is that the p<em>arties respectively filed their own
                        personal tax returns on the basis that their shares in Japco were
                        50:50</em>. This position is supported by letters from IRAS to the
                        plaintiff<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_36" id="Ftn_36_1"><sup>[note: 36]</sup></a></span> where her taxes from
                    Year of Assessment 1997 to Year of Assessment 2006 were consistently based on
                    50% share in Japco’s profits.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_66"></a>66     Therefore, there is compelling evidence of an
                    express agreement in the form of the Partnership Agreement, repeatedly
                    underscored by written declarations of equal partnership in Form P, that the
                    plaintiff and the defendant were equal partners in Japco. I therefore find that
                    the partners were equal partners and as such were to share equally in the
                    profits and losses in the partnership business (see s 24(1) of Partnership
                    Act (Cap 391, Rev Ed 1994).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_67"></a>67     The only remaining question is whether it
                    makes a difference that Japco made losses from the outset, so that the defendant
                    could never capitalise his share of the profits (see <a href="#p1_63">[63]</a> above). I do not think so. It is crucial to characterise
                    the arrangement accurately: it is not that the defendant was entitled to only
                    10% of the profits for the first three years and the plaintiff entitled to 90%,
                    but that he was always entitled to 50% of the profits (as against the
                    plaintiff’s 50%) with the qualification that 40% of the net profits was to
                    be capitalised as his cash contribution. Therefore, the fact that the defendant
                    never made any capital contributions as per the premise of the Partnership
                    Agreement, does not detract from the partnership being an equal one. However, it
                        <em>does</em> affect the division of capital between
                    the partners on a <em>final settlement of accounts</em>.
                        <em>Lindley’s</em> commentary on s 24(1) is
                    apposite and I gratefully adopt it (at para 17-07):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">If it be proved that the partners contributed the capital of the
                        partnership in unequal shares it is presumed that, in the absence of an
                        agreement to the contrary, <em>on a final settlement of
                            accounts</em>, the capital of the business remaining after the
                        payment of outside debts and liabilities, and of what is due to each partner
                        for advances, will, subject to all proper deductions, be divided amongst the
                        partners in the proportions in which they contributed it and not equally.
                        [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_68"></a>68     In other words, in the final settlement of
                    accounts between the partners the defendant’s nil contribution to the
                    capital of the partnership and the plaintiff’s capital contribution of
                    $124,041.86 would be taken into consideration.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">(b)   Was OCS part of the partnership business?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_69"></a>69     Having found that there was a partnership
                    between the plaintiff and defendant and that it was one of equal shares, I now
                    turn to the issue of whether OCS and Japco were partnership businesses. As I see
                    it, the manner in which the defendant ran OCS and his failure to share the
                    profits of OCS with the plaintiff was contrary to their arrangement that OCS and
                    Japco were partnership businesses. If this were true, there is no doubt that the
                    plaintiff would be entitled to an account of the defendant’s profits from
                    OCS as a result of the breach of his fiduciary duty to the plaintiff. The
                    defendant disagrees with the plaintiff’s assertions. His defence that OCS
                    was a separate business was founded on the defendant’s sole
                    proprietorship, but this fact alone is clearly not conclusive of the issue.
                    Neither is Mr Yeo’s point that if OCS was partnership business, the
                    plaintiff would have to but in fact had never filed any Form P in respect of
                    OCS’s business – whilst relevant, this argument must be weighed
                    against the totality of the evidence. In my judgment, this defence is
                    disingenuous. It is an attempt to blur the reality of the situation that for
                    close to six years the office consumer business conducted in OCS was a component
                    of the partnership business with Japco providing the funding. The unassailable
                    fact evidence that the defendant made used of Japco’s resources, funds and
                    bank overdrafts for the business of OCS without repaying those operating
                    expenses through OCS’s sales receipts which were retained by the
                    defendant. The upshot of this defence, if true, is that the defendant had
                    wrongfully misappropriated Japco’s moneys and that he would be liable to
                    the partnership for the moneys taken. Again, even if this defence is
                    sustainable, the only reasonable interpretation that one can put on the overall
                    evidence is that the defendant had not been completely open with the plaintiff
                    in the management and control of the business activities of both entities, and
                    that the defendant’s conduct in his dealings with the plaintiff was
                    calculated to put the plaintiff off the scent that OCS’s business
                    operations was entirely funded for free by Japco. It therefore stands to reason
                    that on any view of the defence the defendant would have to, <em>inter alia</em>, disgorge the profits of OCS that had been earned
                    wholly or partly by the use of Japco’s funds and banking
                    facilities.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_70"></a>70     I find that there is unassailable evidence
                    that the office consumables business conducted in OCS was a component of the
                    partnership business with Japco providing the funding for the following reasons:
                    first, Japco completely, funded OCS’s start-up costs and operations;
                    second, the manner in which capital was injected into OCS and in which its
                    purchases and stocks were financed; third, the state of documentation between
                    the parties. I now turn to expand on each of these points respectively. During
                    the course of analysis, I will also highlight certain aspects of the
                    defendant’s testimony under cross-examination to illustrate the veracity
                    of his evidence, his credibility and reliability as a witness.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_71"></a>71     On the first point, the defendant conceded
                    that Japco completely funded OCS’s start-up costs and <em>all</em> its operations, from rental expenses, season parking,
                    utilities bills, telephone and fax expenses, OCS’s business brochures and
                    calendars and name cards, to even the smallest expense such as the supply of
                    distilled water in OCS’s office.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_37" id="Ftn_37_1"><sup>[note: 37]</sup></a></span> Despite this
                    admission, there were times when the defendant tried to change his testimony. I
                    will highlight just two occasions.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_72"></a>72     The first occasion related to the question of
                    whether OCS paid Japco (who, as main tenant of the premises, paid the full rent
                    to the landlord and then collected the rent in turn from sub-tenants other than
                    OCS) for the use of its office premises. The defendant’s testimony under
                    cross-examination once again proved himself completely lacking in credibility as
                    a witness. He started out insisting that OCS paid Japco rental.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_38" id="Ftn_38_1"><sup>[note: 38]</sup></a></span> When questioned where the evidence was that
                    OCS had paid Japco the sums he alleged, he asserted a verbal agreement as to
                    some sort of very loose system of payment which is why the sums he alleged did
                    not correspond with the amounts in certain cheques.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_39" id="Ftn_39_1"><sup>[note: 39]</sup></a></span> Finally, he had to concede that OCS had not
                    paid any rental to Japco at all.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_40" id="Ftn_40_1"><sup>[note: 40]</sup></a></span> In
                    re-examination, the defendant tried to change this testimony, and his counsel
                    was cautioned by the court that question in re-examination designed to traverse
                    the defendant’s earlier evidence would not be wise unless the defendant
                    was able to show convincingly that the earlier admissions were a
                mistake.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_73"></a>73     The second occasion related to his evidence
                    that Japco and OCS shared the telephone and fax lines, and that these telephone
                    and fax numbers were reflected in both his and Dorothy’s name cards,
                    OCS’s corporate calendars, as well as fax messages from OCS to its
                    customers. In answer to Mr Lai’s questions that Japco and OCS were
                    partnership businesses, the defendant ran into difficulties:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Q:    I put it to you therefore people looking at [the
                            name cards] will mean [<em>sic</em>] that OCS and
                            Japco, same company?</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">A:    I disagree.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Q:    Okay. Because if OCS is a separate and distinct
                            company, I put it to you that any ordinary businessman would want to
                            have their own telephone number and to have their own fax?</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">A:    No because we are sharing the office, you know,
                            that’s why that we will use, you know, Japco’s line, you
                            know, just to reduce the cost. <span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_41" id="Ftn_41_1"><sup>[note: 41]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Q:    So you will give your calendar to all OCS customers
                            asking them to call OCS on Japco’s lines?</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">A:    Yes because we are sharing the office. <span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_42" id="Ftn_42_1"><sup>[note: 42]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Q:    … So any ordinary person ringing up this
                            line or using this fax would say, “Hello this is Japco, or is
                            this OCS?” What would your answer be? Let’s say you pick up
                            the call, Mr Pang, what would you be saying, Japco or
                        OCS?</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">A:    OCS</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Q:    Why not Japco?</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">A:    No, because it’s meant for customer to call
                            in.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Q:    How do you know a particular customer will call
                            you, that you say OCS and not Japco?</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">A:    Because, you know, 64554756 is the hotline, you
                            know, normally customer will just call this particular
                        line.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Q:    So?</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">A:    So it’s OCS customer.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Q:    So you will not be, “Hello this is
                            Japco’s office, I’m Mr [Andy] Pang from Japco?”
                            Or Dorothy would say, “Hello, I’m Dorothy Lee from
                            Japco?” You said, “I’m from
                        OCS?”</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">A:    No because Japco we are dealing with supplier,
                            normally that, you know, we are giving them, you know, handphone,
                            normally they would just call the handphone.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Court:    No, Mr Pang, please, counsel’s
                            question is very specific. How do you know if the caller is for Japco or
                            for OCS?</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">A:    I would not know unless, you know, the caller
                            identify that, you know, they are looking for who from which
                                company.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_43" id="Ftn_43_1"><sup>[note: 43]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_74"></a>74     The second point demonstrating that OCS and
                    Japco were partnership businesses relates to the plaintiff’s intermittent
                    capital contributions to Japco in order to finance the office consumables
                    operations. According to the plaintiff, the defendant and his wife asked her to
                    inject more capital as Japco’s two overdraft accounts had reached or were
                    reaching their credit limits. It was also pointed out by the plaintiff, whose
                    evidence was corroborated by documentary evidence, that Japco’s business
                    with its suppliers was conducted on a cash basis as well as on short credit
                    terms of 30 days whereas the payment term between Japco and OCS was longer (see
                    further below at <a href="#p1_75">[75]</a>). This mismatch in
                    trading terms meant that extra capital was required by Japco to continue to buy
                    office consumable products so that OCS could sell more to increase the sales
                    turnover. The defendant conceded under cross-examination that Japco financed
                    OCS’s purchases from Japco (which is separate from OCS’s operating
                        expenses):<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_44" id="Ftn_44_1"><sup>[note: 44]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Court:    … that’s why counsel’s
                            question is really essentially this: it would appear that Japco have to
                            pay the suppliers first using its own funds, right? The invoice between
                            Japco and OCS, it’s a longer payment term, the credit is
                            longer.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">A:    Yes, I agree, Your Honour.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Court:    So at least for 30 days, right?</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">A:    Yes</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Court:    It’s Japco’s money
                        right?</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">A:    Yes.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_75"></a>75     I should clarify the reference to the invoice
                    between Japco and OCS in the court’s question. The defendant had produced
                    some invoices from Japco to OCS that were purportedly issued in 2006, namely on
                    31 January 2006, 28 February 2006, 31 March 2006, and
                    28 April 2006.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_45" id="Ftn_45_1"><sup>[note: 45]</sup></a></span> Finally, there were several invoices dated
                    8 September 2006.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_46" id="Ftn_46_1"><sup>[note: 46]</sup></a></span> I will refer to these collectively as
                    “the 2006 invoices”. In these invoices, the payment term was 60
                    days. Mr Yeo agrees that for those years OCS was behind in the payment of
                    the purchases from Japco, Japco had financed OCS. However, he goes on to contend
                    that Japco did not ultimately finance OCS because OCS eventually not only paid
                    but in fact <em>overpaid</em> Japco, and this is one of the
                    defendant’s heads of counterclaim. As the basis of this head of the
                    counterclaim, the defendant adduced a table showing the figures allegedly
                    representing OCS’s purchases from Japco and the amount paid by OCS to
                    Japco over the period of six years from 2000 to 2006 (hereinafter the
                    “Defendant’s Table”)<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_47" id="Ftn_47_1"><sup>[note: 47]</sup></a></span>. I will explain below
                    at <a href="#p1_132">[132]</a>-<a href="#p1_136">[136]</a> why I reject this head of the counterclaim, but for
                    present purposes, the point is that Japco financed OCS’s purchases of
                    supplies from Japco out of its own pocket first and then awaited repayment from
                    OCS.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_76"></a>76     Adding to this picture is the fact that the
                    system of repayment by which OCS repaid Japco for its purchases of supplies was
                    an informal one. The only invoices the defendant produced were the 2006
                    invoices. As for the period between 2000 to 2006, the defendant’s evidence
                    in re-examination was that Japco did <em>not</em> invoice
                    OCS during that period. The context of the re-examination is important. It must
                    be remembered that it stemmed from the defendant’s evidence that there
                    were no invoices from 2000 to 2006 which then led to Mr Yeo questioning the
                    defendant on how he had derived the figures in the Defendant’s Table (see
                    above at <a href="#p1_75">[75]</a>). I will be commenting on the
                    reliability of the Defendant’s Table further below when I deal with the
                    defendant’s counterclaim, but for present purposes, even if the 2006
                    invoices were genuine, they were inadequate to prove the amount of OCS’s
                    purchases from Japco on a transaction-by-transaction basis<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_48" id="Ftn_48_1"><sup>[note: 48]</sup></a></span>. The point is that OCS’s alleged repayments
                    of purchases to Japco were <em>not on an invoice-by-invoice basis
                        but rather by lump sum rounded figures</em><span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_49" id="Ftn_49_1"><sup>[note: 49]</sup></a></span> . The reliability of the rounded figures
                    in the Defendant’s Table is unsatisfactory, as borne out by the
                    defendant’s evidence in re-examination:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_50" id="Ftn_50_1"><sup>[note: 50]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Q:    Just answer my question, do you have the invoices
                            from Japco to OCS for these years, 2000 to 2006?</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">A:    No</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Q:    ...I asked you where are the invoices you said
                            there are no invoices?</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">A:    Yes.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Q:    So my next question to you was, where did you get
                            these figures from? What is your answer, continuing from
                        there.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">A:    It is from the GST return.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Q:    And this GST return...whose GST returns are
                            these?</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">A:    OCS, OCS GST returns.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Q:    OCS GST returns, right? So when you say OCS GST
                            returns, what are you talking about? You have the GST amount, what is
                            the GST for?</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">A:    The GST, that means that purchases made from the
                            supplier for ...in this case it is from Japco.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Q:    ...You say it is taken from GST returns,
                            right?</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">A:    GST returns, that’s right.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Q:    Filed by OCS, right?</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">A:    Right</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_77"></a>77     Thus far, the defendant’s evidence is
                    that the figures representing the purchases from Japco were taken from the GST
                    returns which OCS submitted to the revenue because no invoices were issued by
                    Japco. The following answers from the defendant not only contradicted his
                    earlier testimony, it also did not make sense at all. Why would the defendant
                    bother to work backwards using the GST returns if invoices were really and
                    readily available? This is what he said in answer to Mr Yeo’s
                    questions: <span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_51" id="Ftn_51_1"><sup>[note: 51]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Q:    My question to you is: where do you get this amount
                            from?</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">A:    ...it is from the purchases, that means when Japco
                            bill to OCS, you know, these are the figures that we take into
                            consideration.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Q:    Yes.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">A:    Okay, so we will add up the figures and we will
                            submit the F5 to GST. We submit to GST.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Q:    What is the document you are talking
                        about?</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">A:    Purchases from the supplier.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Q:    What is the document? The document, you
                            know?</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">A:    Invoices.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Q:    Whose invoices?</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">A:    Japco bill to OCS.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Q:    So the GST in Japco’s invoices, is
                        it?</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">A:    Yes.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Q:    So from that GST in Japco’s invoices which
                            you are now telling us, how do you get this figure?</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">A:    That is the total of four quarters.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Q:    No. How do you get this figure, 53271, for example,
                            you prepared F5 by looking at the Japco invoices, so you only had the
                            GST, right? So how do you get this?</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">A:    This is that total figures from all the invoices.
                            These figures, okay, when we report to Inland Revenue, so that will be
                            our total figures. This is the total figures, total purchase, that OCS
                            buy from Japco.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Q:    I know, Mr Pang, but you are at GST, right, we
                            are now looking at the GST figure, right?</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">A:    Okay.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Q:    So from the GST figure you are telling us that you
                            got it from the GS[T] ..but how do you arrive then at this
                            figure?</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">A:    It is a sum, right, from the
                        purchases.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_78"></a>78     It is obvious that the defendant is an
                    unreliable witness. I am satisfied that no invoices were issued as he originally
                    testified. If there were invoices, he would have produced them for the trial. As
                    stated, the 2006 invoices were not explained and they have little or no
                    evidential weight save for the fact that the payment term of 60 days between
                    Japco and OCS was certainly longer than what Japco’s supplier gave to it
                    or what OCS gave to the end buyers, namely 30 days. At the end of all questions
                    on invoicing between Japco and OCS for the latter’s purchases, the
                    evidence showed that internally there was no proper system of invoicing between
                    Japco and OCS, and this absence of invoicing internally is a further sign that
                    the defendant had managed the office consumables business of both entities as
                    partnership businesses. There was no reason why Japco would fund OCS’s
                    purchases of supplies from Japco out of its own pocket first, and then rely only
                    upon an informal system of payment without documentation as to which particular
                    purchases were being set-off with each lump sum payment, if Japco and OCS were
                    not partnership businesses.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_79"></a>79     In addition to the two main points above
                        (<em>ie</em>, the arrangements by which Japco purchased
                    supplies and sold them on to OCS and the fact that Japco funded OCS in every
                    single aspect of its operations), there is plenty of other evidence that shows
                    that Japco and OCS operated as partnership businesses. This evidence includes
                    the fact that the defendant was paid by Japco and he claims to supervise
                    OCS’s business; Dorothy appears to double as the purchasing officer for
                    Japco despite officially being only an employee of OCS, as evidenced by tax
                    invoices from Japco’s suppliers<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_52" id="Ftn_52_1"><sup>[note: 52]</sup></a></span>; the plaintiff was named in
                    correspondence with third parties as OCS’s credit controller
                        officer<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_53" id="Ftn_53_1"><sup>[note: 53]</sup></a></span>;
                    and OCS collected rental from sub-tenants using OCS invoices stamped and signed
                    by Dorothy, when rental was due to Japco as the main tenant of the premises (see
                    above at <a href="#p1_72">[72]</a>). The Minutes of Meetings also
                    show Japco and OCS as partnership businesses. From the Minutes of Meetings held
                    on 26 January 2005 and 28 February 2005, 12 April 2005,
                    27 August 2005 and 21 November 2005, the plaintiff was updated on
                    matters pertaining to the staff strength, recruitment of marketing executives to
                    boost sales and profitability, and the performance of the sales executives. One
                    point to note is that Japco had no need for sales staff as it primarily sold to
                    OCS, and the defendant was the “OMO” of Japco. It stands to reason
                    that the defendant would not have had discussions with the plaintiff on this
                    particular topic of staff strength unless she had an interest in OCS’s
                    business. There was no challenge to these Minutes compiled by the
                        plaintiff.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_54" id="Ftn_54_1"><sup>[note: 54]</sup></a></span> I suppose there is no reason to do so since
                    the Minutes of Meeting of 21 November 2005 recorded by Dorothy also covered
                    discussions on the sales people and their performance.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_55" id="Ftn_55_1"><sup>[note: 55]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_80"></a>80     The plaintiff continued to be lulled into
                    believing that OCS and Japco were partnership businesses and evidence of this is
                    from the defendant’s expansion plan referred by the plaintiff at <a href="#p1_34">[34]</a> above. I am not persuaded by the
                    defendant’s testimony that the expansion plan was for OCS and that he was
                    sharing his vision for his company with the plaintiff. It is clear from the
                    documents disclosed in court that the defendant managed the affairs of both
                    businesses <em>(ie</em>, Japco’s and OCS’s) as
                    components of the partnership business. For example, the document in the
                    plaintiff’s bundle of documents (at vol 1, p154)(“the document in
                    PB vol 1, p154”) prepared by the defendant portrayed the combined
                    performance of both entities in the office consumables. The defendant admitted
                    that the figure of $50,149.53 in the document in PB vol 1, p 154 was the
                    combined 2005 net profit of both entities. The defendant’s
                    incomprehensible and gibberish explanation for presenting the combined net
                    profits in the document in PB vol 1, p 154 was nothing more than an
                    egregious attempt at hiding his lie<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_56" id="Ftn_56_1"><sup>[note: 56]</sup></a></span>:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Q:    Now, I want you to look at the last column there on
                            page 154, you put there net profit 2005, you look at the bottom there it
                            says 50,149.53.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">A:    Yes</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Q:    Now, you compare that with what I have told you
                            earlier in 1 PB31 and 2PB327, it is exactly the same sum, to the very
                            cent. So my question is for the net profit 2005, 50,149, this is the
                            combined profit of OCS and Japco, yes or no?</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">A:    Yes.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Q:    Right. So you’re treating OCS as part of

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">A:    No, this is a proposed plan, you know, it

                            You did it for fun?</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">A:    No, the expansion plan is for OCS.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Court: Right. But why are you including information that is exclusive to
                        Japco in you expansion plan?</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">A:    Because, you know, I include the particulars, you
                            know, it’s just that, you know, when we...I eventually, you know,
                            shifted out from this address that, you know, I will still continue to
                            buy from Japco. That means if I have to expand to the town location, any
                            of the town location, okay, OCS will actually move out from Japco
                            registered office and I will continue to do business with Japco. That is
                            my intention, Your Honour.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Mr Lai: That is not the answer to her Honour’s question as
                        well. Neither is that answer to my question. I’ll just repeat one more
                        time. If there’s no answer then I’ll move on. You are wasting a
                        lot of the court’s time and that will have a bearing on costs. All
                        right. Now, I’ll ask you one more time. Why did you include
                        Japco’s profits in you expansion plan?</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">A:    You know, as what I have explained earlier
                            on.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Q:    I put it to you, Mr Pang, that you included
                            Japco’s net profit into the net profit [of OCS] for your expansion
                            plan is because Japco owns OCS?</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">A:    I disagree.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_81"></a>81     Finally, I should comment on the evidence
                    relied upon in support of the defendant’s allegation that the plaintiff
                    consented to the setting up of OCS as his company. He referred me to OCS’s
                    application for a micro loan of $50,000 in September 2002 and that the plaintiff
                    stood as guarantor for that loan. The defendant attributes this to the plaintiff
                    being “supportive” of OCS as his initiative<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_57" id="Ftn_57_1"><sup>[note: 57]</sup></a></span>, which is in my view
                    hardly a convincing explanation. Moreover, not only is there no evidence that
                    the plaintiff actually acted as guarantor as the application for a micro loan
                    was not signed by the plaintiff, it is also not known if the micro loan was
                    indeed granted because there is no evidence of any interest payment in any of
                    OCS’s Profit and Loss Statements except for the financial year 2006 after
                    the relationship broke down.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_82"></a>82     In light of compelling evidence, I find that
                    the business of OCS was not a separate and independent business as the defendant
                    claims and wants this court to believe. Its business was clearly an integral
                    part of the partnership’s business just like Japco’s. What is also
                    clear is that the profits of OCS derived from the business of office consumables
                    were received by the defendant without properly and accurately accounting for
                    them to the plaintiff.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_58" id="Ftn_58_1"><sup>[note: 58]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">(2)   Liability to account</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">(a)   Based on breach of fiduciary duty </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_83"></a>83     It is trite law that a partnership is a
                    relationship that gives rise to fiduciary duties. <em>Lindley</em> at 16-01 states that a duty of good faith is a
                    fundamental obligation of partners. As Bacon V-C put it in <em>Helmore v Smith</em> (1886) 35 Ch D 436 at 444:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">If fiduciary relation means anything I cannot conceive a stronger case of
                        fiduciary relation than that which exists been partners. The mutual
                        confidence is the life blood of the concern. It is because they trust one
                        another that they are partners in the first instance; it is because they
                        continue to trust each other that the business goes on.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_84"></a>84     The duty of good faith encompasses the core
                    obligation of loyalty. A number of aspects of this core obligation of loyalty is
                    (a) the duty not to place himself in a position where his interest would or may
                    conflict with duties owed to his partner (“the non-conflict
                    duty”); and (b) the duty not to make a profit from his position
                    (“the not to profit duty”). In the case of partners, the fiduciary
                    duty is further spelt out in the Partnership Act. Sections 28 to 30 of the
                    Partnership Act read as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>Duty of partners to render accounts,
                        etc</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">28.    Partners are bound to render true accounts and
                            full information of all things affecting the partnership to any partner
                            or his legal representatives.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>Accountability of partners for private
                            profits</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">29.    (1) Every partner must account to the firm for any
                            benefit derived by him without the consent of the other partners from
                            any transaction concerning the partnership, or from any use by him of
                            the partnership property, name or business connection.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>Duty of partner not to compete with
                        firm</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">30.    If a partner, without the consent of the other
                            partner, carries on any business of the same nature as and competing
                            with that of the firm, he must account for and pay over to the firm all
                            profits made by him in that business.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_85"></a>85     Recently, the Court of Appeal in <em>Ang Tin Yong</em> at <a href="#p1_14">[14]</a>
                    stated:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The duty to disclose and render accounts of partnership transactions
                        arises out of the fiduciary relationship which exists between partners (see
                        Yeo Hwee Ying, <em>Partnership Law in Singapore</em>
                        (LexisNexis, 2000) at 174). This right is reflected in s 28 of the
                        Partnership Act (Cap 391, Rev Ed 1994). Partners can institute an
                        action against other partners to obtain an account of transactions
                        concerning the partnership. Also, in <em>Lindley &amp; Banks
                            on Partnership</em> (Sweet &amp; Maxwell,
                            17<sup>th</sup> Ed, 1995) at para 23-27, Lord
                        Lindley wrote: [t]he right of every partner to have an account from his
                        co-partners of their dealings and transaction is too obvious to require
                        comment.” Therefore an order for an account of partnership
                        transactions is a relief sought between <em>partners</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis in original]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_86"></a>86     From the passage quoted above, it is necessary
                    to bear in mind the distinction between two situations where an account is
                    sought: in a subsisting partnership, a partner is entitled to an account at any
                    time as of right; where an account is sought after the dissolution of a
                    partnership, however, the action as was the case here is based on a breach of
                    fiduciary duty. The present case falls in the latter situation where the
                    claimant seeks relief in equity such as an account of secret profits or
                    equitable compensation. The plaintiff’s case is that the defendant had
                    conducted himself as he did for his own benefit and she is suing him for breach
                    of fiduciary duty, and she seeks an account of the benefits and gains which the
                    defendant had received.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_87"></a>87     There is nothing in this particular
                    Partnership Agreement which either exclude the ordinary consequences of a
                    fiduciary relationship between partners, or the implication of the obligations
                    that are normally concomitant of such a fiduciary relationship. Neither could
                    informed consent on the part of the plaintiff be raised – indeed, the
                    defendant was right not to suggest this defence, because the element of informed
                    consent would have been entirely inconsistent with the defence he was
                    running.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_88"></a>88     In the circumstances of this case, the
                    defendant owed fiduciary duty to the plaintiff in the running of Japco. Given my
                    finding above that the business of OCS was the partnership’s business,
                    these fiduciary duties extended to the running of OCS. I now turn to examine in
                    more detail how and where the duty of good faith was breached by the defendant
                    both in relation to Japco in general as well as OCS in particular.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">(b)   Defendant’s breaches of his fiduciary duties</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_89"></a>89     In my judgment, the defendant has not
                    discharged the burden which is on him to show that at the relevant times, (a)
                    there was no loss to Japco arising from OCS’s failure to reimburse the
                    operating expenses of OCS paid by Japco, and (b) the profits of OCS had been
                    earned wholly or partly by means other than the use of Japco’s funds and
                    banking facilities.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_90"></a>90     It must be noted that regardless of whether
                    OCS was partnership business or the defendant’s own business, there should
                    rightly have been an inter-company account to record payments by Japco for
                    OCS’s operating expenses. From this inter-company account, the defendant
                    would be able to keep track of the amount owing to Japco for OCS’s
                    operating expenses. Put another way, there should be recognition and accounting
                    for OCS’s operating expenses that were paid for by Japco and remained
                    unpaid. Ordinarily if there was recognition and accounting as described, the
                    Balance Sheet would reflect the amount that was owed by OCS. However, in this
                    case the Balance Sheets for the relevant financial years did not reflect the
                    amount that was owed by OCS seeing that OCS did not repay or reimburse Japco.
                    Equally, OCS’s Profit and Loss Statements for the relevant periods showed
                    expenses that were funded by Japco and the absence of any balance owing to Japco
                    in OCS’s Balance Sheets cast doubt on the reliability and accuracy of the
                    financial statements presented by the defendant. In the circumstances, Japco is
                    out of pocket for OCS’s operating expenses and the defendant took
                    OCS’s profits without sharing the benefit of the business with the
                    plaintiff. In short, the defendant had conducted himself as he did for his own
                    benefit and gain contrary to his fiduciary duty of good faith. Therefore, the
                    defendant should account for the benefits and gains he received. This would be
                    for the period 2000 to 2006.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(i)   
        <u>Absence of proper and full
                    accounts</u>
</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_91"></a>91     In this section of the judgment, I set out how
                    the evidence shows that there are serious discrepancies in Japco’s
                    accounts, thereby pointing to the defendant’s failure to disclose and give
                    proper and full accounts to the plaintiff, which constitutes a breach of his
                    fiduciary duty of good faith.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_92"></a>92     At all material times, Japco’s accounts
                    and tax returns were prepared by the defendant. For the purposes of filing Form
                    P of Japco and the plaintiff’s personal income tax, the practice was that
                    the defendant prepared and submitted to the IRAS the Profit and Loss Statement
                    and Balance Sheet of Japco. The defendant did not give any impression, and I
                    accept that the plaintiff would not have known that the partnership’s
                    accounts – Profit and Loss Statements and Balance Sheets from 2000 to 2006
                    – were not an accurate reflection of the true state of affairs of the
                    partnership’s businesses. The defendant’s argument that the
                    plaintiff had approved them and never raised issues with the Profit and Loss
                    Statements previously is immaterial and inappropriate.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_93"></a>93     I refer to a related line entry for sales in
                    Japco’s Profit and Loss Statements. Again the sales figures are different
                    when compared to other documents disclosed. The defendant produced the
                    Defendant’s Table (see above at <a href="#p1_75">[75]</a>)
                    to show that over a period of six years, OCS had bought and paid to Japco a
                    significant amount of money for office consumable products. Produced below is an
                    extract of purchases and payments from the Defendant’s
                Table:</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_94"></a>94     To test the veracity of the information in the
                    Defendant’s Table above, it is necessary to compile the sales and
                    purchases of Japco and OCS respectively based on their Profit &amp; Loss
                    Statements for the period 2000 to 2006. This compilation is in Schedule 1 of
                    this judgment. It must be pointed out that as OCS commenced operations in
                    September 2000, the comparable sales of Japco to OCS are assumed to be the same
                    as OCS’s purchases for the year 2000. As for 2006, OCS’s purchases
                    were stated in the Defendant’s Table as up to 31 December 2006.
                    However, OCS’s 2006 Statement of Revenue &amp; Expenses<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_59" id="Ftn_59_1"><sup>[note: 59]</sup></a></span> is up to 7 April 2006
                    when the relationship had notionally ended.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_95"></a>95     I now compare Japco’s sales in the
                    Profit &amp; Loss Statements as set out in Schedule 1 with the Defendant’s
                    Table. OCS’s purchases (in the Defendant’s Table) in total should
                    equal to Japco’s total sales but they are not.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_60" id="Ftn_60_1"><sup>[note: 60]</sup></a></span>
                    The difference between Japco’s total sales and OCS’s total purchases
                    from Japco for the period September 2000 to 7 April 2006 is $166,045.26
                    ($5,204,739.07 minus $5,038,693.81). In addition, OCS’s total purchases
                    based on its Profit &amp; Loss Statements for the period September 2000 to
                        2005<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_61" id="Ftn_61_1"><sup>[note: 61]</sup></a></span> and Statement of Revenue &amp; Expenses
                    from 1 January 2006 to 7 April 2006<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_62" id="Ftn_62_1"><sup>[note: 62]</sup></a></span> as set out in Schedule 1 do not equal
                    to the above purchases in the Defendant’s Table and the difference is
                    $197,479.48 ($4,841,214.33 minus $5,038,693.81).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_96"></a>96     Again there are differences elsewhere when
                    comparing Japco’s sales figures as shown in the Profit &amp; Loss
                    Statements with OCS’s purchases in the Profit &amp; Loss Statements for
                    the same corresponding periods (see generally Schedule 1). In total, the
                    difference is $363,524.74 ($5,204,739.07 minus $4,841,214.33). The discrepancies
                    here are also not explained and they can only point to the defendant’s
                    failure to disclose and give proper and full accounts to the plaintiff, and I so
                    hold. Accordingly, the defendant’s breach of fiduciary duty of good faith
                    is made out.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_97"></a>97     The defendant relies on the Defendant’s
                    Table to show that OCS had paid to Japco a total of $5,205,860 made up of
                    OCS’s purchases amounting to $5,038,693.81 and rental amounting to $37,086
                    with the balance of $130,080.19 being overpayment by the defendant. I have
                    already noted that the rental payment had not been proven at the trial (see
                        <a href="#p1_72">[72]</a> above). This therefore brings the
                    total payment down to $5,168,774. In cross-examination of the defendant,
                    Mr Lai was able to demonstrate through a sample of payments in 2006 that
                    some of these cheques had nothing to do with payment of OCS’s purchases
                    from Japco. Furthermore, with the discrepancies highlighted above, it is not
                    possible to reconcile OCS’s purchases from Japco and what the defendant
                    claimed to have paid in the Defendant’s Table. This problem is compounded
                    by the absence of sales invoices from Japco to OCS, as explained above at
                        <a href="#p1_75">[75]</a>-<a href="#p1_78">[78]</a>, so that lump sum payments in round figures cannot be
                    matched to specific purchases.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(ii)   
        <u>Expenses and profits of OCS</u>
</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_98"></a>98     Having found in the previous section that the
                    defendant breached the fiduciary duty of good faith in relation to Japco in
                    general, I now turn to the evidence that he breached his fiduciary duties in
                    relation to OCS specifically.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_99"></a>99     To set the scene for discussion, it is helpful
                    to begin with some material background facts. First, the plaintiff explained
                    that she remained concerned that despite the defendant’s promises that
                    Japco’s overdrafts in the two UOB Accounts would be reduced from
                    OCS’s sales revenues, the defendant was still unable to reduce the
                    overdrafts and despite her further capital injections into Japco. Second, at
                    subsequent meetings between the parties, the plaintiff repeated her concerns
                    that the overdrafts were still not reduced and that some Minutes of Meetings
                    recorded the defendant’s response to the plaintiff’s concerns.
                    Dorothy’s record of the Minutes of Meeting held on 21 November 2005
                    between the plaintiff and the defendant stated<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_63" id="Ftn_63_1"><sup>[note: 63]</sup></a></span>:</p>

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[<em>sic</em>]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_101"></a>101    As stated earlier at <a href="#p1_75">[75]</a>, Mr Yeo for the defendant argues that
                    Japco did not finance OCS. To repeat, his reasoning is as follows: for those
                    years that OCS was behind in the payments, he agrees that Japco financed OCS;
                    however, at the end of the day, OCS had overpaid Japco (based on the
                    Defendant’s Table) and as such Japco did not finance OCS. I make two
                    comments here. Mr Yeo’s submissions do not address the
                    defendant’s admission that Japco paid for the start-up costs and operating
                    expenses of OCS (see above at <a href="#p1_71">[71]</a>). Second,
                    Mr Yeo’s submissions, at best, are directed at OCS’s purchases.
                    I have already commented on the unreliability of the Defendant’s Table on
                    the amount of purchases and the amount of payments.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_102"></a>102    As revealed by the evidence, the defendant
                    had not been completely open with the plaintiff. In any case, for there to be a
                    breach of duty of good faith, it is not necessary to establish that the
                    defendant acted in a clandestine manner in order to obtain a benefit or profit
                    for himself at the expense of the partnership. The liability arises from the
                    mere fact of a profit having in the circumstances been made, as was in the
                    present case. The High Court of Australia in <em>Chan v
                        Zacharia</em> (1984) 154 CLR 178 at 198 stated:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In terms of the personal liability to account, the principle of equity is
                        that a person who is under a fiduciary obligation must account to the person
                        to whom the obligation is owed for any benefit or gain (i) which has been
                        obtained or received in circumstances where a conflict or significant
                        possibility of conflict existed between his fiduciary duty and his personal
                        interest in the pursuit or possible receipt of such a benefit or gain or
                        (ii) which is obtained or received by use or by reason of his fiduciary
                        position or of opportunity or knowledge resulting from it. Any such benefit
                        or gain is held by the fiduciary as constructive trustee.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_103"></a>103    In the course of the trial, the defendant
                    was directed to advise the amount of profits which he had received from OCS. The
                    defendant produced at the trial OCS’s Profit and Loss Statements in a
                    bundle marked “4DB”. It is important to note that other than for
                    OCS’s payment of purchases (the exact quantum is not proven), the start-up
                    costs and yearly operating expenses of OCS were paid by Japco and <em>not</em> by OCS.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_65" id="Ftn_65_1"><sup>[note: 65]</sup></a></span> Yet, OCS disclosed in the Profit &amp;
                    Loss Statements for the period 2000 to 2006 operating expenses incurred by the
                    business such as salaries, CPF, rental and other miscellaneous expenses that
                    amounted to a sum of $394,012.74 (see Schedule 2 of this Judgment). To this end,
                    as between the plaintiff and the defendant, it is reasonable to conclude, since
                    the expenses were not paid by OCS, the entity’s profits were in reality,
                    the gross profits which he took for himself. I pause here to comment on the
                    gross profit for the period 1 January 2006 to 7 April 2006 which
                    showed a gross loss of $12,616 (see Schedule 2 of this Judgment). This is odd
                    for it would mean that OCS deliberately sold to third parties at a loss. Based
                    on OCS’s documents, the sum of $398,324.09 was the total gross profits
                    unaccounted to the plaintiff. It follows that the breach of fiduciary duty
                    against the defendant is made out.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_104"></a>104    Apart from operating expenses, I noted from
                    Japco’s Profit and Loss Statements for the same period that Japco carried
                    a substantial amount of stocks in its books when the only customer was OCS. By
                    comparison, OCS sold to third parties but carried minimal stocks in its books,
                    when logically it should hold more stocks for the volume of business it was
                    doing. What this tells the court is that OCS benefitted from Japco’s
                    financing and shouldering of the holding costs for maintaining OCS’s stock
                    requirements.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_105"></a>105    OCS’s Profit and Loss Statements
                    included a line entry for rentals. By this entry, the defendant gave the
                    impression that OCS had paid rental and other operating expenses in its Profit
                    and Loss Statements for 2000 to 2006 (see Schedule 2 of this Judgment) without
                    recognition and accounting that the expenses had been paid for by Japco, the
                    intention is probably to reduce OCS’s taxable profit.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_106"></a>106    The defendant also admitted that profits of
                    OCS went into his pocket.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_66" id="Ftn_66_1"><sup>[note: 66]</sup></a></span> Since the defendant
                    operated the business of OCS on credit terms, obtained supplies on favourable
                    credit terms from Japco, and used some of the receipts from sales to pay on an
                    irregular basis for supplies from Japco, it is a reasonable inference in the
                    absence of reliable countervailing evidence that profits attributable to OCS
                    were from the unutilised sales receipts (see <a href="#p1_103">[103]</a> above). It seems to me that the defendant held the
                    OCS’s sales receipts as constructive trustee for Japco. As stated, the
                    defendant’s duty to account was not dependent on fraud or bad faith, but
                    merely on whether a profit had been made.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_107"></a>107    A related point is the date of dissolution
                    of the partnership. Mr Yeo refutes the plaintiff’s claim that the
                    partnership was dissolved on 7 April 2006. He claims that the plaintiff has
                    not shown that the partnership was dissolved in the manner prescribed by the
                    Partnership Act. Mr Yeo appears to be suggesting an alternative date,
                    namely 2 September 2006 when the parties met to talk about Japco’s
                    stock which Mr Yeo said were transferred to OCS on 14 September 2006
                    as the date of dissolution. On any view, the outcome is the same in that the
                    duty of good faith continues between partners of a dissolved partnership until
                    such time as its affairs are finally wound up and settled (see <em>Lindley</em> at p 557, para 16-06).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_108"></a>108    It is envisaged by s 32 that a
                    partnership can be dissolved by agreement. It can also be dissolved under
                    s 32(1)(c) by a partner giving notice of his intention to dissolve the
                    partnership. In the event, by virtue of s 32(2), the partnership is
                    dissolved as from the date notice was communicated to the partnership. According
                    to the plaintiff, she informed the defendant of her decision to close Japco on
                    7 April 2006. As far as I can tell, the defendant has admitted in
                    cross-examination that Japco stopped doing business on 7 April
                        2006.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_67" id="Ftn_67_1"><sup>[note: 67]</sup></a></span> During cross-examination, Dorothy confirmed
                    that she was aware of the decision to close Japco on 7 April
                        2006:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_68" id="Ftn_68_1"><sup>[note: 68]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Q:    But the fact is you know for a fact at 7 April
                            2006 there was this intention to close down Japco?</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">A:    Obviously, I’m aware.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_109"></a>109    The defendant does not deny preparing the
                    plaintiff’s Statement of Revenue &amp; Expenses for the period
                    1 January 2006 to 7 April 2006.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_69" id="Ftn_69_1"><sup>[note: 69]</sup></a></span> Thereafter, the parties met in
                    September 2006 purportedly to start the process to wind up the affairs of Japco
                    including terminating the OCS’s bank account and the partnership gave up
                    the tenancy of the premises in October 2006. In addition, the parties made
                    monthly contributions of $1,000 each towards the overdraft interest of UOB
                    Account No 2. The monthly contributions started from 15 September 2006 and
                    it continued for several months. In the case of the defendant, he paid a total
                    of $8,000 whereas the plaintiff paid $9,000.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_110"></a>110    Precisely what the profits after
                    7 April 2006 are should be the subject of further account by the defendant
                    trading as OCS until end of 31 December 2006. This is because the
                    defendant’s duty of good faith continues after dissolution of partnership
                    until the completion of the winding up of the affairs of the partnership. The
                    Defendant’s Table suggests that winding up of the affairs of the
                    partnership was not completed and settled until the defendant’s alleged
                    payment as at 23 March 2007 to Japco. But I am prepared to accept that
                    winding up was completed by 31 December 2006 save for the payments in
                    2007.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_111"></a>111    I pause here to comment on the
                    plaintiff’s claim for an account in respect of DSS (see above at <a href="#p1_39">[39]</a>) on the basis that it was set up to step into
                    Japco’s shoes. I find that there is insufficient evidence to find that an
                    account should be taken of DSS as an asset of Japco. Although the
                    plaintiff’s Closing Submissions<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_70" id="Ftn_70_1"><sup>[note: 70]</sup></a></span> conclude that true and proper accounts
                    must be rendered for OCS and DSS, this is a conflation of DSS with OCS without
                    any support based on evidence adduced at trial – the plaintiff’s
                    arguments preceding this conclusion relate <em>only</em> to
                    OCS. The plaintiff has not adduced any evidence to support her assertion that
                    DSS took away the clients and goodwill of Japco and OCS. Indeed, the plaintiff
                    conceded under cross-examination that her position that DSS took away the
                    clients and goodwill of Japco and OCS is just her
                        “belief”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_71" id="Ftn_71_1"><sup>[note: 71]</sup></a></span> I
                    accordingly find that, unlike with OCS, there is no evidence that DSS is
                    partnership property in respect of which the defendant is liable to account to
                    the plaintiff.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">(c)   Limitation </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_112"></a>112    Having found that the plaintiff is entitled
                    to an account in respect of the profits of OCS, it is necessary to consider
                    whether the relief <em>soug</em>ht is time barred. The
                    defendant has pleaded time bar in his Defence relying on s 6(1) and
                    s 6(2) of the Limitation Act (Cap 163, Rev Ed 1996)
                    (“Limitation Act”). Mr Yeo repeats s 6(1) and
                    s 6(2) but does not develop the defence in his submissions.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_113"></a>113    Be that as it may, it appears that the
                    plaintiff is entitled to an account only in respect of OCS’s business from
                    26 March 2002 because of s 6(2) of the Limitation Act which provides
                    that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">An action for an account shall not <em>be
                        b</em>rought in respect of any matter which arose more than 6 years
                        before the commencement of the action.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_114"></a>114    In <em>Ang Toon Teck v Ang
                        Poon Sin</em> [1998] SGHC 67, the High Court held that
                    the plaintiff’s claim for an account for moneys received in 1982 was time
                    barred because the action was commenced only in 1995. In reaching this
                    conclusion, the High Court specifically rejected the plaintiff’s argument
                    that the limitation period ran only from the point when the beneficiaries
                    demanded that the defendant render them accounts, not from the point when the
                    liability to account arose. The High Court cited <em>Preston
                        &amp; Newsom's Limitation of
                        Actions </em>(3<sup>rd</sup> ed) at
                    p 56:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The cause of action for an account arises <em>when the
                            defendant has assets of the plaintiff in his hands in respect of which
                            he is liable to account</em>. Normally, he is so liable, if at
                        all, at the moment he receives them; but there may be circumstances in which
                        the express agreement between them is that he is only to be accountable at
                        some later date or where the court can infer such an arrangement [emphasis
                        added].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_115"></a>115    The Plaintiff took out the Writ of Summons
                    on 25 March 2008 in the Subordinate Courts, the short title of which was DC
                    Suit No 941/2008/K. By Order of Court dated 9 September 2010, the DC Suit
                    was transferred to the High Court. Although OCS was registered on 3 March
                    2000, it started operations in September 2000 which precedes the cut-off point
                    of 25 March 2002. Therefore, the limitation period for an action for
                    account in respect of OCS began running at 26 March 2002, not later when
                    the Plaintiff began demanding accounts.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_116"></a>116    As for the exceptions of the Limitation Act,
                    none would apply here. In particular s 29 would not apply because the
                    plaintiff’s action is not “based upon the fraud of the defendant or
                    his agent” or “the right of action is concealed by fraud”
                    or “for relief from the consequences of a mistake”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_117"></a>117    Furthermore, s 22(1)(a) and(b) do not
                    assist the plaintiff. There is no express trust here. Neither does there seem to
                    be constructive trust of the kind that falls within s 22(1). The
                    plaintiff’s cause of action against the defendant is on his own personal
                    liability for breach of fiduciary duty as a partner. This is therefore not a
                    constructive trust in the proprietary sense of the word but rather a personal
                    liability to account <em>as if</em> he were a trustee (see
                        <em>Halsbury’s Laws of Singapore</em>, vol 9(2)
                    (Lexis Nexis, Singapore 2003) at para 110.571). In other words, this case
                    involves a “class 2” trust within Millett LJ’s
                    classification in <em>Paragon Finance v DB Thakeral &amp;
                        Co</em> [1999] 1 AER 400, which Millett LJ doubted fell within the
                    scope of England’s equivalent of s 22, (see also <em>Gwembe Valley Development Co Ltd and Another v Thomas Koshy &amp;
                        Others</em> [2004] 1 BCLC 131 and <em>Halton
                        International Inc v Guernroy Ltd</em> [2006] EWCA Civ 801 per Carnwath
                    LJ). A limitation defence to a claim might be available by analogy with common
                    law claims such as breach of contract as may be the case with breach of
                    fiduciary duty.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_118"></a>118    In the circumstances, the plaintiff is
                    entitled to an account of the profits from OCS within six years prior to the
                    commencement of proceedings. In other words, from 26 March 2002 and not
                    since OCS commenced business in September 2000.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">(3)   Indemnity against liability to UOB </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_119"></a>119    As explained at <a href="#p1_12">[12]</a> above, UOB Account No 1 and UOB Account No 2 are secured by
                    a mortgage on the plaintiff’s home and by the Guarantee from the plaintiff
                    and the defendant. The plaintiff, of course, is concerned that UOB may pursue
                    solely her in respect of the overdrafts in the two UOB accounts, on the basis of
                    her mortgage and Guarantee. She therefore prays for an order that the defendant
                    indemnify her for all sums which she may be liable to pay UOB.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_120"></a>120    It is not the plaintiff’s case that
                    the bank has demanded payment of the overdrafts and/or had only sued and
                    obtained judgment against her, and that the plaintiff has satisfied the
                    judgment. It seems to me premature to pray for an indemnity order which
                    incidentally cannot be for all sums which the plaintiff may be liable to pay
                    UOB. If anything, the plaintiff has not made out any basis in law for the
                    defendant to indemnify her against her entire liability to UOB. Speaking
                    hypothetically, in the event UOB chooses to only sue the plaintiff, she is
                    entitled to claim against the defendant for a half-share of any liability to UOB
                    under the Guarantee. This is either in her capacity as co-surety under the
                    Guarantee or as a partner under the Partnership Agreement. As I have established
                    above, the Partnership Agreement provides for the plaintiff and defendant to be
                    equal partners – they therefore share the Japco’s losses equally.
                    According to <em>Lindley</em> (in relation to s 24(1)
                    of England’s Partnership Act 1890 on which s 24(1) of our Partnership
                    Act is based) at 20-04:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">“[W]here there is no agreement to the contrary, it is clear that if
                        execution for a partnership debt contracted by all the partners…is
                        levied on any one partner, who is compelled to pay the whole debt, he is
                        entitled to contribution from his co-partners.”</p>
<p class="Judg-1">In conclusion, the plaintiff is, in principle, entitled both as
                    co-surety as well as partner to a contribution from the Defendant of a
                    half-share of any liability owed to UOB.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">(4)   The Counterclaim</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">(a)   The first head: $142,932 in unpaid salaries etc </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_121"></a>121    The defendant’s first head of
                    counterclaim is the sum of $142,932 consisting of:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_121-p2_a"></a>(a)     $28,344 of unpaid salary for
                        1999;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_121-p2_b"></a>(b)     $22,344
                        of unpaid salary for 2000;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_121-p2_c"></a>(c)     $33,620 being one month’s AWS from 1996 to
                        2006;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_121-p2_d"></a>(d)     $14,005
                        being 110 days of unutilised annual leave from 1996 to
                    2006;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_121-p2_e"></a>(e)     $26,689
                        being 25% of the profits due from 1996 to 2006; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_121-p2_f"></a>(f)     $17,930.66 being unpaid salary from
                        May 2006 to 10 October 2006.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_122"></a>122    The defendant was compelled to drop claim
                    (e) under cross-examination when confronted with the fact that Japco has always
                    been making losses, so a claim for 25% of its profits was absurd. I therefore do
                    not purport to deal with claim (e). I dismiss the rest of this counterclaim in
                    its entirety, for the following reasons.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">
<u>Claims (a) and (b): Back pay</u>
</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_123"></a>123    The defendant makes these claims on the
                    basis that his monthly salary was agreed to be $3,362 but he was paid less than
                    that in 1999 and 2000: $28,344 in claim (a) and $22,344 in claim (b) therefore
                    represent the total difference between what he should have been paid in that
                    particular year (<em>ie</em>, $3,362 x 12) and what he was
                    actually paid in 1999 and 2000 respectively.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_124"></a>124    The plaintiff does not dispute that the
                    defendant’s monthly salary was initially agreed to be $3,362. However, she
                    avers that, when the defendant proposed that they change Japco’s line of
                    business from consumer electrical goods to office consumables as a result of the
                    Seychelles Debt <em>ie</em>, around the period of 1999-2000
                    (see above at <a href="#p1_20">[20]</a>), he offered to accept a
                    reduced salary as a start because of the losses from the Seychelles
                        Debt.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_72" id="Ftn_72_1"><sup>[note: 72]</sup></a></span> Indeed, the defendant
                    did not dispute under cross-examination that the objective evidence shows that
                    his salary fell below $3,362 a month for many years, not just in 1999 and
                        2000.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_73" id="Ftn_73_1"><sup>[note: 73]</sup></a></span> Rather, he claimed that he had a verbal
                    agreement with the plaintiff that whatever salary fell short of $3,362 a month
                    would be compensated for in future (“Verbal Agreement for Back
                    Pay”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_125"></a>125    Leaving aside the fact that the
                    defendant’s claims are in the first place time barred under s 6(1) of
                    the Limitation Act, his evidence on the alleged Verbal Agreement for Back Pay
                    (which was pleaded not in the Counterclaim but in the Rejoinder) was utterly
                    unconvincing. When asked the very basic question of when this Verbal Agreement
                    for Back Pay was entered into, he first replied 1999<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_74" id="Ftn_74_1"><sup>[note: 74]</sup></a></span> and
                    then changed his testimony to 26 June 2006<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_75" id="Ftn_75_1"><sup>[note: 75]</sup></a></span>. Furthermore,
                    when asked why, if there were indeed this Verbal Agreement for Back Pay, he only
                    claimed back pay for 1999 and 2000 when he was paid below $3,362 a month in many
                    other years as well, his answers were utterly unconvincing:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Court: You were not getting 3362, you were getting less, so what
                        discrepancy are you talking about?</p>

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Court: You could claim the difference?</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">A:    That’s why I only put 1999 and 2000 and I

                            years. Where it could be, you know, I’ve slipped out of the mind

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Q:    So my question to you is: why didn’t you make

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">A:    It could be that, you know, I’ve slipped off

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Q:    Mr Pang, there is no memory. It is staring you
                            in the face.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">A:    Yes, I’m aware that there are
                                discrepancies.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_76" id="Ftn_76_1"><sup>[note: 76]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_126"></a>126    Furthermore, the defendant accepted that
                    there was no record of any accrual of back salary in Japco’s
                        accounts.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_77" id="Ftn_77_1"><sup>[note: 77]</sup></a></span> The defendant therefore failed to
                    make out a case for this component of his first counterclaim.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">
<u>Claim (c): AWS</u>
</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_127"></a>127    As with claims (a) and (b), the defendant
                    admitted that his claim for AWS was never documented in any of the annual
                    financial statements or even any minutes of meeting from 1996 to
                        2006.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_78" id="Ftn_78_1"><sup>[note: 78]</sup></a></span> I find it highly unlikely that, had he been owed
                    this not insignificant sum, that he would never have documented it or at least
                    raised it with the plaintiff in any meetings. Once again, he alleged that AWS
                    payment was “verbally agreed”, but could not satisfactorily
                    explain this. His credibility with regard to this claim was further damaged
                    when, confronted under cross-examination with the fact that he had only worked
                    for a quarter of 1996 and had actually been paid pro-rated AWS for that year, he
                    first gave the feeble reply that “it could be an error in the
                    figures” and then had to drop his claim for a full year’s of AWS in
                        1996.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_79" id="Ftn_79_1"><sup>[note: 79]</sup></a></span> He was also forced on similar grounds to drop
                    his claim for AWS for the whole year of 2006.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_80" id="Ftn_80_1"><sup>[note: 80]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_128"></a>128    Leaving aside the evidential difficulties,
                    the defendant’s AWS claims for 1997 to 2001 are in the first place time
                    barred under s 6(1) of the Limitation Act.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">
<u>Claim (d): 110 days of unutilised
                    leave</u>
</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_129"></a>129    The defendant’s evidence with regard
                    to this claim was particularly non-existent. If anything, time bar would also
                    apply to this claim. Under cross-examination, he conceded <em>inter alia</em> that (i) there was no provision or agreement for
                    accumulated leave in the Partnership Agreement; (ii) there was no provision or
                    agreement for payment of money in lieu of any unutilised leave in the
                    Partnership Agreement; (iii) indeed, there was no evidence at all before the
                    Court as to any agreement for payment of money in lieu of leave; and (iv) there
                    were no leave records to support his alleged 110 days of unutilised
                        leave.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_81" id="Ftn_81_1"><sup>[note: 81]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">
<u>Claim (f): Unpaid salary from May 2006 to
                    10 October 2006</u>
</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_130"></a>130    I completely failed to see the basis for
                    this claim given that Japco was dissolved on 7 April 2006. Furthermore, in
                    the last meeting on 2 September 2006 to wind up Japco’s affairs, the
                    defendant wrote in the minutes<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_82" id="Ftn_82_1"><sup>[note: 82]</sup></a></span> that he agreed not to be paid his
                    salary for May to September 2006. Even if there was some basis for him to claim
                    salaries after April 2006, he did not explain his entitlement to do
                so.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">
<u>Conclusion</u>
</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_131"></a>131    For the above reasons, I dismiss the
                    defendant’s first counterclaim. I also note that, in his testimony under
                    cross-examination, the defendant frequently had resort to alleged oral
                    agreements whenever confronted with documentary evidence that undermined his
                    case with regard to the respective components of this counterclaim – aside
                    from the fact that he never pleaded these oral agreements (save for the claim
                    for back salary in the Rejoinder) and frequently could not even provide the
                    dates on which these agreements were entered into. I note that these oral
                    agreements are clearly inconsistent with his express position that the
                    Partnership Agreement contains the entire agreement between the parties (see
                    above at <a href="#p1_9">[9]</a>).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">(b)   The second head: $130,080.19 in alleged overpayments from
                OCS to Japco </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_132"></a>132    As stated above at <a href="#p1_75">[75]</a>, the Defendant’s Table documented these alleged
                    overpayments from OCS to Japco between 1996 and 2006. I have already commented
                    on the discrepancies in the figures presented in the Defendant’s Table.
                    Significantly, these claims for overpayment were never reflected anywhere, for
                    example, in (i) the 30 March 2006 Statement; or (ii) subsequent meetings
                    held to discuss Japco’s winding up of its business.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_83" id="Ftn_83_1"><sup>[note: 83]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_133"></a>133    More crucially, as established above at
                        <a href="#p1_76">[76]</a>-<a href="#p1_78">[78]</a>, there are no invoices pertaining to OCS’s purchases
                    from Japco, so the purchase figures in the Defendant’s Table are
                    completely without support. When asked in re-examination how he arrived at these
                    figures, the defendant’s explanation was incomprehensible, even to his own
                    counsel. <span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_84" id="Ftn_84_1"><sup>[note: 84]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_134"></a>134    The defendant therefore had no evidence at
                    all that he or OCS had made overpayments for goods bought from Japco. Indeed, as
                    held above at <a href="#p1_76">[76]</a>-<a href="#p1_78">[78]</a> in relation to the plaintiff’s action for an account,
                    it is not even clear whether OCS paid Japco for all the goods Japco purchased on
                    its behalf.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_135"></a>135    Even more egregiously, it was demonstrated
                    at several points during cross-examination that several cheques referred to by
                    the defendant as evidence of OCS’s overpayment to Japco were <em>not even OCS cheques but cheques from third parties.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_85" id="Ftn_85_1"><sup>[note: 85]</sup></a></span></em></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_136"></a>136    I therefore dismiss this counterclaim as
                    well.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">(5)   Other Matters</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_137"></a>137    For completeness, I now deal with the
                    remaining arguments raised by the parties.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">(a)   Defendant’s negligence and the Seychelles Debt </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_138"></a>138    I do not consider the claim against the
                    defendant in negligence tenable for the following reasons.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_139"></a>139    The plaintiff characterises the
                    defendant’s alleged negligence on two levels. First, on the specific
                    level, with regard to the trade losses suffered by Japco in relation to the
                    Seychelles Debt (“the specific claim”).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_86" id="Ftn_86_1"><sup>[note: 86]</sup></a></span> Second,
                    and more problematically, the plaintiff also argues more generally that the
                    defendant is liable for all losses suffered by the plaintiff or Japco “as
                    a result of [the defendant’s] negligence and/or failure to discharge his
                    duties, responsibilities and obligations” (“the general
                        claim”).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_87" id="Ftn_87_1"><sup>[note: 87]</sup></a></span>
                    The general claim is based on the submission that the defendant was negligent
                    from the outset in even making the three-page partnership proposal to the
                    plaintiff (see above at <a href="#p1_7">[7]</a>) <em>ie</em>, the proposal had contained certain representations
                    with regard to the intended customer base, supplier base and sales turnover
                    which, as it turned out, the defendant had no basis to make.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_88" id="Ftn_88_1"><sup>[note: 88]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_140"></a>140    The scope of the general claim is
                    problematic. The negligence alleged by the plaintiff here is that the defendant
                    had no basis to make the claims he did in his business proposal to the
                        plaintiff.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_89" id="Ftn_89_1"><sup>[note: 89]</sup></a></span> It is unclear which
                    losses the plaintiff pinpoints as flowing from the negligent act so
                    characterised. If the plaintiff is saying that the very basis on which the
                    parties entered into the partnership constitutes a negligent act by the
                    defendant, the implication seems to be that the defendant is liable for all
                    Japco’s losses from the outset. However, the plaintiff is clearly not
                    making this claim as she accepts, in principle, her liability for half of
                    Japco’s losses. I therefore find that the general claim is too expansive
                    and cannot stand – the negligence must be traced to specific proven losses
                    before a partner can be liable for the entire loss or for me to order any other
                    relief in respect of it.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_141"></a>141    If anything, the specific claim is the
                    Seychelles Debt which is in essence a business loss. This alleged breach is of a
                    non-fiduciary nature and as such usually sounds in damages. Furthermore, the
                    Seychelles Debt is a business loss that is typically borne by all the partners
                    even where responsibility for this loss or liability can be attributed primarily
                    to a particular partner as long as the partner has acted bona fide with a view
                    to the benefit of the firm (<em>Lindley</em> at 20-08;
                        <em>Halsbury’s Laws of Singapore</em> vol 15,
                    (Lexis Nexis, Singapore, 2006 Reissue) at [180.090] citing <em>Cragg v Ford</em> (1842) 1 Y &amp; C Ch Cas 280; Yeo Hwee
                    Ying, <em>Partnership Law in Singapore</em> (LexisNexis,
                    2000)(“Yeo Hwee Ying”) at p 184). I am not persuaded that the
                    plaintiff has established that the business loss was a result of the
                    defendant’s fraud, culpable negligence or wilful default (<em>Ong Keng Huat v Hong Kong United Co Ltd</em> (1961)
                    27 MLJ 36 cited in Yeo Hwee Ying at p 193; <em>Lindley</em> at 20-08). In other words, the sales to Stephen Pillai
                    were not shown to be motivated by a collateral and improper purpose. There is no
                    evidence prior to the inception of OCS that the defendant was hiding anything
                    from the plaintiff in relation to the unsatisfied Seychelles judgment. The
                    plaintiff has not adduced evidence to show that the defendant’s
                    representations that Japco’s loss was a result of the Seychelles Debt were
                    false. Even if it were true that the Seychelles Debt were incurred due to some
                    negligence on the defendant’s part, this is not a basis for an action to
                    account. An account of profits is available only for breaches of a fiduciary
                    nature.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">(b)   Factual disputes: break-ins etc</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_142"></a>142    There are factual disputes over events that
                    transpired after the plaintiff indicated she wanted to dissolve the partnership
                    (see above at <a href="#p1_30">[30]</a>-<a href="#p1_39">[39]</a>). As described above at <a href="#p1_40">[40]</a>-<a href="#p1_43">[43]</a>, the
                    defendant’s account of events revolved around two alleged break-ins into
                    Japco’s premises by the plaintiff and Chor Koon on 7 April and
                    10 April 2006 respectively. The defendant made a police report in respect
                    of them (the 10 April Police Report above at <a href="#p1_43">[43]</a>), as well as the 9 April Police Report alleging that
                    the plaintiff and her maid had trespassed into his premises and harassed
                    him.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_143"></a>143    Unsurprisingly, the plaintiff disputed the
                    defendant’s version of events. In particular, in addition to her claims
                    set out at <a href="#p1_44">[44]</a> above, the plaintiff in her
                    Closing Submissions urged this Court to “take judicial notice”
                    that the defendant was guilty of the criminal conduct of making two false police
                    reports, or alternatively to direct the plaintiff to make reports to the police
                    so that the appropriate action can be taken against the defendant. The plaintiff
                    relied <em>inter alia</em> on the fact that, during
                    cross-examination, when asked to produce the 9 April Police Report and the
                    10 April Police Report respectively, the defendant alleged that he did not
                    know where they were.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_90" id="Ftn_90_1"><sup>[note: 90]</sup></a></span> The plaintiff submitted that the
                    defendant did not want to produce the police reports because they would prove to
                    be false insofar as he had alleged that he did not know the plaintiff and that
                    she was a trespasser and was harassing him.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_91" id="Ftn_91_1"><sup>[note: 91]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_144"></a>144    Given that finding the defendant guilty of
                    making a false police report requires a criminal standard of proof, it is
                    clearly not appropriate for me to make such findings in this action. Neither is
                    it appropriate or necessary for me to direct the plaintiff to make police
                    reports in respect of the defendant’s two allegedly false police reports
                    – the plaintiff can do this on her own should she be advised by her
                    lawyers to do so.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_145"></a>145    Nevertheless, I find the defendant’s
                    version of events highly incredible. In particular, I set out my findings on the
                    alleged break-ins of 7 and 10 April 2006 because the defendant relied on
                    these break-ins as an explanation for his complete lack of documentary evidence
                    with regard to various facts he was alleging – the defendant alleged that
                    the plaintiff had during the break-ins removed all the partnership documents. I
                    reject the defendant’s allegations for various reasons. First, I find it
                    strange that the defendant could not (or did not want to) produce the
                    10 April Police Report when requested to during cross-examination (see
                        <a href="#p1_143">[143]</a> above). Second, the plaintiff
                    maintained under cross-examination – and convincingly in my view –
                    that she did not need to break into the premises, given that she was also a
                    tenant and co-owner of Japco and had the keys to the premises.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_92" id="Ftn_92_1"><sup>[note: 92]</sup></a></span> The
                    defendant had no reply to this. Third, the defendant admitted under
                    cross-examination that he did not take any photographs or make an inventory of
                    the documents that were allegedly seized or removed by the plaintiff during the
                    alleged break-in.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_93" id="Ftn_93_1"><sup>[note: 93]</sup></a></span> He also conceded during
                    cross-examination that he did nothing to retrieve the documents besides
                    “talk[ing]” to the plaintiff.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_94" id="Ftn_94_1"><sup>[note: 94]</sup></a></span> I find it quite
                    simply incredible that he would have acted in this manner had the plaintiff
                    truly broken into the premises and seized all the partnership documents, as he
                    alleges. Fourth, it is not disputed that the plaintiff and the defendant had a
                    meeting at Japco’s premises between 10.30am to 12pm on 10 April 2006,
                    during which no mention was made of the alleged break-in which, according to the
                    defendant, he had discovered at about 10am that morning and made a police
                        report.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_95" id="Ftn_95_1"><sup>[note: 95]</sup></a></span> I find
                    it unbelievable that, had the defendant truly discovered such a drastic break-in
                    and seizure of documents, that he would have not mentioned a word of it to the
                    plaintiff at a meeting that took place a mere half an hour later.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_146"></a>146    I therefore reject the defendant’s
                    account of the alleged break-ins on 7 and 10 April 2006 insofar as he
                    relies on it as an excuse for his failure to produce any documentary evidence to
                    support various aspects of his case. However, as clarified above, it is not
                    appropriate in this civil action to make findings that the defendant is guilty
                    of criminal conduct or for me to direct the plaintiff to make a police report
                    against the defendant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_147"></a>147    The plaintiff also urged me to make a
                    finding of the defendant’s criminal conduct with regard to one other
                    matter. The plaintiff alleges that on the morning of 8 April 2006 <em>ie</em>, one day after the plaintiff had indicated that she
                    wanted to dissolve the partnership, the defendant withdrew $50,000 in cash from
                    Japco’s account.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_96" id="Ftn_96_1"><sup>[note: 96]</sup></a></span> He returned the same on 10 April 2006.
                    Significantly, the defendant does not deny withdrawing this sum. Instead, his
                    explanation for this is that he was supposed to be on a business trip to Hong
                    Kong and China to purchase goods and this sum went towards his travel expenses,
                    and also that the office had been broken into.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_97" id="Ftn_97_1"><sup>[note: 97]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_148"></a>148    I agree with the plaintiff that such an
                    explanation was incredible. I fail to see why the defendant would need the sum
                    of $50,000 by way of travel expenses for a trip to Hong Kong and China. However,
                    for the same reasons as <a href="#p1_144">[144]</a> above, I
                    declined to make a finding that the defendant was guilty of a misappropriation
                    of $50,000 or to direct the plaintiff to make a police report to the Commercial
                    Affairs Department for further investigation.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_149"></a>149    Nevertheless, needless to say, the sheer
                    incredulity of the defendant’s account of events with regard to all the
                    events above greatly diminished his credibility even with regard to the main
                    issues in this action. Above all, his testimony in the witness box was more
                    critical.</p>
