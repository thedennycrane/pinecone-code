Central to this family feud was a private landed residence worth between $7.5m and $7.8m (“the Property”) by one estimation, with two factions of the same family having competing claims in respect of the Property. The overarching tenor of the plaintiff’s case was that she had transferred the title of the Property by way of a purported gift to the second defendant in objectionable circumstances, an allegation which the defendants unsurprisingly denied. Yet, given the way family arrangements are conducted, not much in the way of contemporaneous documentary evidence was available in the present case. Indeed, this case turned in large part on the credibility of the testimonies of the persons connected with the dispute.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 Having considered the evidence, I concluded that the transfer of the Property should be set aside as the plaintiff was operating under a mistake when she executed the transfer.

The defendants disputed this and argued that the plaintiff freely intended to make an <span class="font-italic">inter vivos </span>gift to the second defendant.

</div> According to Dr Kua Ee Hock (“Dr Kua”), SGH nurses would be trained to recognise signs of cognitive impairment and to call for a specialist if there was any cause for concern. No concerns were raised in that regard. Accordingly, the proper inference to draw was that the plaintiff was not suffering from any mental impairment at the time of the Transfer, which was close in time to her hospitalisation from 25 August 2016 to 1 September 2016, and her subsequent review at SGH on 21 December 2016.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 Second, I gave some, albeit limited, weight to the cognitive tests administered on the plaintiff by doctors in 2020 and 2021. While these tests were administered close to four years after the Transfer was executed, I found them to be of relevance to the plausibility of the plaintiff suffering from a mental impairment at the time of the Transfer. It was not in dispute that the plaintiff had mental capacity by the time of the trial. In this regard, five cognitive tests were administered on her between 2020 and 2021. Four of these tests indicated that the plaintiff was cognitively normal.

</div> While one test, the Mini-Mental State Examination, administered by Dr Lim Yun Chin (“Dr Lim YC”) on 2 November 2020 led Dr Lim YC to opine that the plaintiff had “mild cognitive impairment”, he nevertheless concluded that the plaintiff had mental capacity in respect of her personal welfare, property, and affairs to make a Lasting Power of Attorney and a Power of Attorney, and that she had testamentary capacity and capacity to litigate.

If the plaintiff truly suffered from significant mental impairment at the time when she executed the Transfer in 2016, it was inexplicable that her condition would have improved to such an extent by 2022. Indeed, the plaintiff had provided no explanation for why this would have been a plausible turn of events. Accordingly, I was not persuaded that the plaintiff had lacked mental capacity when she signed the Transfer.

These doubts were raised by the lack of clarity in Mr Liew’s answers during cross-examination. When asked to describe in court how he had explained the effect of the Transfer to the plaintiff, Mr Liew first said that he had explained to the plaintiff that “it doesn’t mean that once [the plaintiff had] signed the transfer form, automatically the property is gifted away or transferred away from [the plaintiff’s] ownership [<span class="font-italic">sic</span>]”.

</div> To a layperson such as the plaintiff, it was not unlikely that these statements cemented an incorrect perception that the Property would not be gifted to the second defendant while the plaintiff was still alive.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 Indeed, it was evident during cross-examination that Mr Liew had difficulty clearly articulating his responses to answer the real issue at hand. When asked whether the plaintiff knew that the Transfer had the effect of an <span class="font-italic">inter vivos </span>gift, his answers with respect to the timing of the gift appeared to be made in the context of the assessment of stamp duty. In other words, when Mr Liew mentioned that the transfer of ownership was not immediate, he meant that the Transfer could not be registered until the stamp duty had been paid, which was besides the point. Indeed, the exchanges between Mr Singh, counsel for the plaintiff, and Mr Liew illustrated this:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Q  So on this occasion, she’s being asked to sign documents which is one is a testamentary gift, and another one which is a lifetime gift.

</div> was, in my view, an expression of her intention to make arrangements before her passing so that the second defendant would own the Property <span class="font-italic">after </span>she had passed on. This would have explained why she executed the 2016 Will expressly stating that upon the plaintiff’s death, the Property would be given to the second defendant. It was more plausible that the plaintiff, untrained in legal technicalities, simply accepted without question that both instruments were necessary to ensure that the second defendant would inherit the Property after her death. Considered together, the Transfer and the 2016 Will reflected the plaintiff’s attempt during her lifetime to make provision for how her assets would be distributed after her death. Therefore, I found on a balance of probabilities that when the plaintiff said that she wanted to transfer the Property to the second defendant during her lifetime, she did not understand it to mean that she would lose ownership of the Property during her lifetime.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 Against this conclusion, the defendants submitted that the plaintiff’s account should not be believed as it contained inconsistencies.

</div> They relied on Dr Kua’s testimony that the plaintiff’s inconsistent answers were due to the fact that her memory was affected by the emotional trauma which she experienced by her knowledge that she had triggered a schism between her brother’s and her sister’s families. Dr Kua further explained that the plaintiff had in fact intended to make the Transfer but repressed this memory because to reveal this to HTS’s Family (with whom she was living) would upset them. Her memory was hence repressed, and she experienced emotional turmoil when trying to recall the events of the day, causing her to give conflicting answers.

The trial was heard in 2022, more than five years after the events of 2 December 2016. Given the plaintiff’s advanced age, it was reasonable that she could not fully remember the details of what had happened. What was important, in my view, was that she stuck to the consistent position that she did not intend to make an <span class="font-italic">inter vivos</span> gift of the Property to the second defendant. The inconsistencies about where she had signed the Transfer, who else was present, and who handed her the Instrument of Transfer did not contradict the consistent position in her account that she had no intention of making an <span class="font-italic">inter vivos </span>gift. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 Lastly, as for the defendants’ contention that the plaintiff’s evidence should not be regarded as being independently given as the Attorneys were the masterminds behind this litigation,

</div> However, I found that there was no basis for the assertion that the plaintiff believed the Property to be held on trust for the benefit of HTN’s Family or that she intended to make an <span class="font-italic">inter vivos </span>gift through the Transfer pursuant to the alleged trust arrangement.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 The evidence relied upon by the defendants fell short: there was inadequate evidence to show any acceptance or recognition by the plaintiff that she held the Property on trust for HTN’s Family. To the contrary, the purported effect of the Transfer and the 2016 Will contradicted the trust that was pleaded by the defendants. The Transfer and the 2016 Will would have only benefitted the second defendant. However, as the plaintiff correctly pointed out, assuming that she was holding the Property on trust for HTN’s Family, then it was inexplicable that the plaintiff did not also transfer the ownership of the Property to the other members of HTN’s Family.

</div> and there was no evidence that she had reached an agreement with the defendants, or the rest of HTN’s Family, that she would be indemnified or reimbursed by the latter in respect of the stamp duty payable. Accordingly, I did not find that it would have been likely that the plaintiff understood that she was making an <span class="font-italic">inter vivos </span>gift when she signed the Transfer pursuant to any alleged trust arrangement.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 The defendants also submitted that the fact that the plaintiff never stayed in the Property, that various members of HTN’s Family stayed in the Property instead, HTN’s Family had been paying for the outgoings of the Property, and that the certificate of title of the Property was kept not with the plaintiff but in the Property itself, showed that the Property was held on trust by the plaintiff for HTN’s Family.

</div> However, I did not think that those were strongly probative of the defendants’ assertions. It could very well be that the plaintiff was simply content with permitting HTN’s Family to stay in the Property as long as they paid for the outgoings of the Property. It did not follow from these that the plaintiff was holding the Property on trust, or that she was willing to cede ownership of the Property during her lifetime to HTN’s Family. These facts only went as far as to show that the plaintiff was not active in managing the affairs of the Property, and nothing more.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 The defendant also made much of the relationship between the plaintiff and HTN’s Family.

</div> However, I did not think that was a strong factor pointing towards the plaintiff’s intention to make an <span class="font-italic">inter vivos </span>gift to the second defendant in light of the other evidence suggesting otherwise.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 For the reasons expressed above, I found that the plaintiff did not hold, nor did she regard herself as holding the Property on trust for HTN’s Family.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The legal effect of the plaintiff’s mistake</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 The legal effect of the plaintiff’s mistake was that the Transfer was set aside. In this regard, the applicable test was set out by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">BOM v BOK </span><span class="font-italic">and another appeal </span>[2019] 1 SLR 349 (“<span class="font-italic">BOM</span>”) at [90]. The court’s equitable jurisdiction to set aside voluntary dispositions on the ground of mistake is exercisable when there was (a) a causative mistake, as to either the legal character of the transaction or a matter of fact or law that was basic to the transaction (b) that was of such gravity that it would be unconscionable to refuse relief. In this regard, the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">BOM </span>endorsed the principles expressed in the judgment of Lord Walker of Gestingthorpe in <span class="font-italic">Pitt v Holt </span>[2013] 2 AC 108 (“<span class="font-italic">Pitt</span>”), which can be summarised as follows:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) a causative mistake is to be distinguished from mere ignorance, inadvertence, and misprediction of a future event. That notwithstanding, forgetfulness, inadvertence or ignorance may <span class="font-italic">lead</span> to a false belief or assumption that constitutes a mistake upon which a voluntary disposition could be set aside. The mistake can also arise from carelessness, unless it is shown that the person making the voluntary disposition deliberately ran the risk of being wrong, or the facts are such that he must be taken to have run the risk of being wrong. Additionally, there is no requirement that the beneficiary of the disposition must have been aware of the mistake (<span class="font-italic">Pitt</span> at [104]–[105] and [114]); and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) the mistake must be sufficiently grave such that it would be unjust, unfair or unconscionable for the court to refuse relief. To that end, the court must closely examine the facts, determine the circumstances of the mistake, consider its centrality to the transaction in question, and evaluate the seriousness of its consequences to the person who made the voluntary disposition (<span class="font-italic">Pitt </span>at [126] and [128]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 The first element of a causative mistake was made out: as explained above (at [28]–[38]), the plaintiff was under a mistaken belief as to the legal effect of the Transfer. She did not understand that she was making an <span class="font-italic">inter vivos </span>gift to the second defendant; indeed, the circumstances suggested that she had intended to make a testamentary gift instead. For completeness, I found that the plaintiff was positively under a mistaken belief and that this case was distinguishable from the cases of mere ignorance, inadvertence, and misprediction of a future event. I also did not find, nor was there any allegation that the plaintiff deliberately ran the risk of being wrong, or the facts were as such that she must have been taken to run the risk of being wrong.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 As for the question of whether the mistake was of such gravity that it would be unconscionable to refuse relief, I was readily satisfied that this was so. The plaintiff was not highly educated, elderly, and while the Instrument of Transfer was supposedly explained to her in Cantonese and Mandarin, there were serious doubts about whether she could meaningfully understand the legal technicalities associated with such a document. This mistake was central to the Transfer as it went towards the very nature of the transaction. The mistake resulted in the plaintiff losing ownership of the Property, which was her only major asset and which was worth $7.5m to $7.8m. In this respect, the present case is analogous to <span class="font-italic">BOM</span>, where the Court of Appeal granted relief under this stage. The court regarded it relevant that the deed of trust that the husband in that case executed had a completely different legal effect from what the husband thought it had, and the result was that he was completely divested of his assets because of his mistake. It was therefore clear to the Court of Appeal that the centrality of the husband’s mistake to the execution of the deed of trust and the seriousness of its consequences rendered the mistake sufficiently grave to warrant the setting aside of the deed of trust. Similarly, in the present case, it was unconscionable to refuse relief, and I so ordered the Transfer to be set aside.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Rectification of the land-register was ordered</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 In light of my finding that the Transfer should be set aside, I ordered the rectification of the land-register pursuant to ss 160(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) and 160(2) of the LTA. Those provisions state:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Rectification of land-register by court</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">160.</span>—(1)  Subject to subsection (2), the court may order rectification of the land-register by directing that any registration be cancelled or amended in any of the following cases:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) where the court is satisfied that any registration or notification of an instrument has been obtained through fraud, omission or mistake;</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(2)  The land-register must not be rectified so as to affect the registered estate or interest of a proprietor who is in possession unless that proprietor is a party or privy to the omission, fraud or mistake in consequence of which the rectification is sought, or has caused that omission, fraud or mistake or substantially contributed thereto by that proprietor’s act, neglect or default.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 From these provisions, there are two cumulative requirements for the rectification of the land-register under ss 160(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) and 160(2) of the LTA. First, the registration or notification of any instrument must have been obtained through fraud, omission, or mistake. Second, the proprietor who is in possession must be a party or privy to the omission, fraud, or mistake in consequence of which the rectification is sought, or has caused that omission, fraud or mistake or substantially contributed thereto by that proprietor’s act, neglect, or default.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 Since it had been established that the plaintiff executed the Transfer upon the mistaken belief that she was not making an <span class="font-italic">inter vivos </span>gift but a testamentary one, the question was whether the second defendant, who became the sole proprietor after the Transfer, fell within the ambit of the second requirement. In my judgment, this was the case. The second defendant was privy to the plaintiff’s mistake as she, together with the first defendant, would have been apprised as to the legal effect of the Transfer, on their own case that they had discussions with the plaintiff about the Transfer.

</div>
</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 Accordingly, I found that the requirements of ss 160(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) and 160(2) of the LTA were met, and I ordered the cancellation of the registration of the Transfer and the rectification of the land-register to reflect the plaintiff’s ownership of the Property.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The other vitiating factors which the plaintiff relied on were not made out</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 Given that the Transfer was set aside on the ground of mistake, it was unnecessary for me to consider whether the other grounds relied upon by the plaintiff to set aside the Transfer were made out. Nevertheless, I will briefly explain why these grounds were not made out.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 First, the plaintiff’s contention that the Transfer should be set aside as it was made without consideration fell away in light of my earlier finding that the plaintiff did not lack donative intent; instead, she was simply under a misunderstanding as to the timing of the Transfer. Thus, she still intended to make a <span class="font-italic">gift</span> (albeit a testamentary one), and the requirement of consideration was therefore irrelevant.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 Second, the plaintiff could not successfully rely on the doctrine of undue influence as there was insufficient proof that there was such actual or presumed influence by the defendants on the plaintiff that would have triggered the application of this doctrine, following the two categories set out by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">BOM</span> [101]. There was no evidence of actual influence by the defendants, and it is worth noting in this regard that the plaintiff only provided a bare assertion that she had signed many documents provided to her by the first defendant and Mr Alan Wong without knowing their contents.

</div> Even if it were taken as true, on the plaintiff’s contentions, that the first defendant had assisted the plaintiff with the preparation of the plaintiff’s 2016 Will and with her application for a replacement certificate of title in respect of the Property, mere assistance alone without more cannot constitute undue influence. More must be provided in evidence to show that the person’s free will was impaired in some manner (see <span class="font-italic">BOM </span>at [106]). It was also clear that presumed undue influence could not be established as the plaintiff’s relationship with the defendants was not such as to give rise to that presumption.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 Lastly, as against the plaintiff’s submission, unconscionability was not made out as a ground that would vitiate the Transfer. As the Court of Appeal held in <span class="font-italic">BOM</span>, the plaintiff had to show that she was suffering from an infirmity that the other party exploited in procuring the transaction (at [142]). However, as I had found (at [22]), while I accepted that the plaintiff was suffering from various ailments and conditions, she did not display such weakness from these that she was helpless in her dealings. She was still very much capable of making her own decisions. Accordingly, there was no need to require the defendants to show that the Transfer was fair, just, and reasonable (see <span class="font-italic">BOM </span>at [142]).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The other claims by the plaintiff </span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The Bank Account claim</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 I turn now to the other claims made by the plaintiff.

</div> I therefore awarded the sum of $13,411 to the plaintiff, being the amount claimed rounded down the nearest whole number. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Conspiracy</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 However, I found that the plaintiff’s other claims were not made out. Beginning with the plaintiff’s claim for both unlawful means and lawful means conspiracy, the relevant elements were expressed in the Court of Appeal decisions of <span class="font-italic">EFT Holdings, Inc and another v </span><span class="font-italic">Marinteknik Shipbuilders (S) Pte Ltd and another</span> [2014] 1 SLR 860 (“<span class="font-italic">EFT Holdings</span>”) at [112] and <span class="font-italic">Gimpex</span><span class="font-italic"> Ltd v Unity Holdings Business Ltd and others and another appeal </span>[2015] 2 SLR 686 at [187]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 To establish a claim for unlawful means conspiracy, the following must be proved: (a) two or more persons combined to do certain acts; (b) the conspirators intended to cause damage or injury to the plaintiff by those acts; (c) the acts were unlawful (including intentional acts that are tortious); (d) the acts were performed in furtherance of the agreement; and (e) the acts caused loss. These elements largely apply to a claim for lawful means conspiracy as well, save that a plaintiff must prove that the defendant(s) had a higher requisite mental state – that the predominant purpose of the alleged conspirators must be to cause damage or injury to the plaintiff (see the High Court decision of <span class="font-italic">Axis </span><span class="font-italic">Megalink Sdn Bhd v Far East Mining Pte Ltd </span>[2023] SGHC 243 (“<span class="font-italic">Axis </span><span class="font-italic">Megalink</span>”)<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [137]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 First, as regards the claim in unlawful means conspiracy, central to the present case was the question of whether the defendants even intended to cause damage or injury to the plaintiff. In this respect, the plaintiff had to show that the unlawful means and the conspiracy were “targeted or directed” at the plaintiff. This meant that damage or injury to the plaintiff had been intended as either a means to an end or an end in itself. It was not sufficient that harm to the plaintiff would be a likely, or probably or even inevitable consequence of the defendants’ alleged conduct. Lesser states of mind, such as an appreciation that a course of conduct would inevitably harm the plaintiff, would “not amount to an intention to injure, although it may be a factor supporting an inference of intention on the factual circumstances of the case” (see <span class="font-italic">EFT Holdings </span>at [101] and <span class="font-italic">Axis </span><span class="font-italic">Megalink </span>at [135]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 In my judgment, this element was not made out. The plaintiff simply asserted that “[t]he predominant purpose of both the defendants was to cause harm to the plaintiff by procuring her to make an <span class="font-italic">inter vivos </span>gift of [the Property] to the second defendant”.

</div> However, nothing was argued as to whether damage or injury to the plaintiff had been intended as a means to an end or an end in itself. From the sole fact of the Transfer, it could at best be proved that the intention of the defendants in procuring the Transfer was to benefit the second defendant, even as it was appreciated that this would inevitably harm the plaintiff. As a result, I did not find that the requisite mental element of unlawful means conspiracy was made out.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 Given this conclusion, it also followed that lawful means conspiracy, which requires a higher requisite mental state, was not made out.

</div> However, even if the second defendant was a resulting and/or constructive trustee, such declaration would have been unnecessary, and I accordingly declined to grant it.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 As the High Court observed in <span class="font-italic">Kok Zhen Yen </span><span class="font-italic">and another v Beth Candice Wu</span> [2023] SGHC 126 (“<span class="font-italic">Kok Zhen Yen</span>”), a declaration is a remedy by which a court simply pronounces on the rights or even the remedies of the parties, even if such declaration is implicit in all remedies. They may aid in the resolution of a dispute or prevent one from arising, especially if parties in a dispute know what their legal positions are (at [77]). While the High Court has the power to grant all reliefs and remedies at law or in equity (see paragraph 14 of the First Schedule to the SCJA), including a declaration, “the power to grant a declaration should be exercised with a proper sense of responsibility and a full realisation that judicial pronouncements ought not to be issued unless there are circumstances that call for their making” (see <span class="font-italic">Kok Zhen Yen </span>at [78], citing the Privy Council decision of <span class="font-italic">Ikebife</span><span class="font-italic"> Ibeneweka v Peter Egbuna </span>[1964] 1 WLR 219 at 225, <span class="font-italic">per </span>Viscount Radcliffe). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 It was unnecessary to grant a declaration in the present case as I had held that the Transfer could be set aside and that the land-register would be rectified.

</div> This evinced the plaintiff’s understanding of “restitution” as being a proprietary remedy that would “revers[e]” the Transfer.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 However, this claim was misconceived in as much as it was premised on the availability of proprietary remedies in a claim for unjust enrichment. It is clear from the Court of Appeal decision of <span class="font-italic">Esben</span><span class="font-italic"> Finance Ltd and others v Wong Hou-Lianq Neil </span>[2022] 1 SLR 136 (“<span class="font-italic">Esben</span>”)<span class="font-italic"> </span>that a proprietary claim is separate and distinct from a claim in unjust enrichment, which is a personal claim giving rise to the remedy of restitution in monetary terms. Indeed, an important question that the Court of Appeal commented on in <span class="font-italic">Esben</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>was whether the availability of a proprietary claim <span class="font-italic">precluded</span> a claim in unjust enrichment in cases where lack of consent is relied upon as an unjust factor, the concern being the need to prevent unjust enrichment from encroaching on or making otiose established areas of the law or denuding them of much of their legal significance (see <span class="font-italic">Esben</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [251(c)(iii)]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">71 The distinction between a proprietary claim and a personal claim in unjust enrichment was also explicitly endorsed in <span class="font-italic">Alwie</span><span class="font-italic"> Handoyo v Tjong Very Sumito and another and another appeal</span> [2013] 4 SLR 308 (“<span class="font-italic">Alwie</span>”), where the Court of Appeal, disagreeing with argument that the seminal House of Lords decision of <span class="font-italic">Lipkin Gorman v </span><span class="font-italic">Karpnale Ltd </span>[1991] 2 AC 548 (“<span class="font-italic">Lipkin Gorman</span>”) was concerned with a proprietary restitutionary claim and not a claim in unjust enrichment, observed that Lord Goff in <span class="font-italic">Lipkin Gorman </span>was “evidently alive to the distinction between proprietary restitutionary claims and personal claims for unjust enrichment” (see <span class="font-italic">Alwie</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [119]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">72 I pause to observe that this issue has been subject to considerable debate elsewhere. On one view, it has been argued that it is more appropriate to classify proprietary claims under the law of wrongs, rather than the law of unjust enrichment (see David Salmons, “The Availability of Proprietary Restitution in Cases of Mistaken Payments” (2015) 74(3) CLJ 534). On the other side of the debate, the Supreme Court of Canada in <span class="font-italic">Kerr v </span><span class="font-italic">Baranow </span>[2011] 1 SCR 269 has taken the position that proprietary remedies are available to claims in unjust enrichment. This aligns with the view advanced by the late Professor Peter Birks in “Restitution and Resulting Trusts” in <span class="font-italic">Equity and Contemporary Legal Developments </span>(S Goldstein ed) (Hebrew University, 1992) at p 368, who argued that the resulting trust should play a wider role in an unjust enrichment claim, particularly in cases of mistake and failure of consideration. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">73 Professor Birks’s view was however rejected by Lord Browne-Wilkinson in <span class="font-italic">Westdeutsche</span><span class="font-italic"> Landesbank Girozentrale v Islington London Borough Council </span>[1996] AC 669, who opined that such a position would involve “a distortion of trust principles” (at 709). It would also result in commercial uncertainty as third parties might be negatively impacted if the original recipient becomes insolvent, for the trust assets in question would not be available to the general body of creditors; instead, the plaintiff who has a proprietary claim for unjust enrichment in those trust assets would be able to obtain restitution over third parties who have themselves not been enriched at the expense of such a plaintiff, and indeed have no dealings with him. Moreover, if the assets were transferred pursuant to a valid contract, such a plaintiff would only have personal rights against the original recipient of the assets. There is no reason why he should be better off when an unjust enrichment claim is available when the contract is instead void (at 703–705).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">74 Despite the ongoing debate, it is nevertheless clear, from the statements of the Court of Appeal, that the legal position in Singapore leans strongly towards the non-recognition of proprietary remedies for claims in unjust enrichment. The plaintiff’s claim in unjust enrichment was therefore a non-starter.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The defendants’ counterclaim was not made out</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">75 I turn now to the defendants’ counterclaim, which I did not find were made out.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">76 The defendants argued that in the event I found that the plaintiff was entitled to her claim, the defendant ought to be entitled to their counterclaim, on the basis of proprietary estoppel, for expenses that they had incurred based on their reasonable expectation and/or belief that they are the true beneficial owners of the Property.

Here, it did not follow that HTN’s Family’s occupancy of the Property amounted to a representation that they were the beneficial owners of it. Indeed, people may live in a property for various reasons, including out of the owner’s goodwill and beneficence. It cannot be that the mere fact of living in a property, even for a long period, is always evidence of beneficial ownership. Accordingly, I did not on the evidence find that there was a representation by the plaintiff in the substance of what the defendants suggested.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">80 The lack of a representation was sufficient for me to dismiss the defendants’ counterclaim.

Against this conclusion, the defendants argued, relying on <span class="font-italic">CCM Industrial Pte Ltd v </span><span class="font-italic">Uniquetech Pte Ltd</span> [2009] 2 SLR(R) 20, that the defendants had made the plaintiff an Offer to Settle (“OTS”), and that the judgment entered in her favour was not more favourable than the OTS.

Although the sum offered to the plaintiff in the OTS was $13,411.41, I agreed with the plaintiff that it was more favourable for her to obtain the judgment sum as compared to the OTS. To begin with, O 22A r 9(4)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the Rules of Court (2014 Rev Ed) (“ROC 2014”) provides that “[a]ny interest awarded in respect of the period before service of the offer to settle is to be considered by the Court in determining whether the plaintiff’s judgment is more favourable than the terms of the offer to settle”. In this regard, the only term of the OTS offered by the first defendant was the sum of $13,411.41, with the OTS being made three months before the trial. No interest was offered in the OTS. Even if the plaintiff had accepted the OTS, the prevailing interest rate at that time was low and ranged from 0.35% to 1.74% <span class="font-italic">per annum</span>.

</div> In light of these considerations, I awarded $162,000 to the plaintiff as pre-trial costs.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">88 Nevertheless, given the moderate to high complexity of this matter, with much evidence going towards the mental capacity of the plaintiff, I was of the view that the party-to-party costs claimed by the plaintiff in respect of trial and post-trial work were reasonable, which were $168,000 and $30,000, and allowed it accordingly. This gave rise to a global figure of $360,000 in respect of party-to-party costs.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">89 In this regard, the defendants submitted that the plaintiff should not be awarded more than half her costs.

</div> I also did not think that the principles in<span class="font-italic"> </span><span class="font-italic">Comfort Management Pte Ltd v OGSP Engineering Pte Ltd and another </span>[2022] 5 SLR 525 that were relied upon by the defendants<span class="font-italic"> </span>were applicable in the present case. In this regard, the High Court had held that a “Type I Order”, which deprives the successful party of the right to recover all or part of his costs from the unsuccessful party, would be justified under O 59 r 6A of the ROC 2014 when (a) the successful party failed to establish a discrete claim or issue which he raised in the litigation; and (b) he thereby unnecessarily or unreasonably protracted or added to the costs or complexity of the litigation. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">90 While the defendants contended that the plaintiff’s other arguments on undue influence and unconscionability failed, I did not think that these were discrete issues from the issue of mistake on which the plaintiff succeeded. Indeed, while the facts required to establish these issues did not fully overlap with the issue of mistake, there was nevertheless still some overlap, and all these issues could be said to broadly arise from the same factual background. Specifically, I agreed with the plaintiff that the lack of intention on the plaintiff’s part to make an <span class="font-italic">inter vivos </span>gift to the second defendant would have been a relevant consideration to the issues of undue influence and unconscionability, notwithstanding that these vitiating factors were not made out. Furthermore, I did not agree with the defendants that these issues were unnecessarily or unreasonably protracted or added to the costs or complexity of the litigation. In the course of the proceedings, the evidence mainly centred on the mental capacity, and indeed mental state, of the plaintiff when she executed the Transfer and the 2016 Will on 2 December 2016. These were questions that would have to be canvassed in any event to establish the ground of mistake. Accordingly, I did not find any reason to make a “Type I Order” to reduce the costs awarded to the plaintiff.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Reasonable disbursements</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">91 I turn now to the quantum of reasonable disbursements that were awarded to the plaintiff.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">92 I was not persuaded by the defendants’ submission that the costs of the medical reports should be deducted from the disbursements awarded. In my view, the medical reports were still tangentially relevant to the issue of mistake on which the plaintiff succeeded. It was helpful, in my view, that the mental state of the plaintiff – including her mental capacity – was ascertained for the purposes of these proceedings. While I ultimately did not go as far as to find that the plaintiff lacked mental capacity, the finding of mistake was still tangentially relevant to the issue of mental capacity. If the plaintiff lacked mental capacity when she executed the Transfer, then the issue of mistake would not have arisen. It was only after it was found that the plaintiff had mental capacity that I could conclude that the plaintiff was under a mistaken belief when she executed the Transfer. It was for this reason that I regarded the medical reports as being relevant and of assistance to some extent.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">93 I was however persuaded by the defendants that certain items of medical expenses claimed by the plaintiff amounting to $9,316.09 should not be awarded.

</div> it suffices for me to say that I agreed with their objections that the medical expenses claimed were irrelevant to the medical reports relied upon in the evidence or that they were incurred for purposes unrelated to the proceedings. There was therefore no basis to award those expenses in the form of disbursements.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">94 Accordingly, deducting $9,316.09 from the sum of $132,335.26 originally claimed, I awarded $123,019.17 to the plaintiff as reasonable disbursements.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The applicable rate of interest and GST</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">95 Finally, I turn to the rate of GST that is applicable to both the party-to-party costs and reasonable disbursements awarded in the present case. I disagreed with the defendants that the applicable rate for some of the items should be 7% and not the prevailing rate of 8% at the time of the costs order dated 12 May 2023. The defendants’ argument in this regard was that all the work would have been done before 1 January 2023, when the rate of GST was increased from 7% to 8%. However, the date on which the work underlying the claim for reasonable disbursements was actually supplied was irrelevant. What mattered for the purposes of GST was the date on which the costs order was made. This was after 1 January 2023 and hence fell within the higher GST rate of 8% (see, for <span class="font-italic">eg</span>, the Court of Appeal’s observation in <span class="font-italic">Lock Han Chng Jonathan (Jonathan Luo </span><span class="font-italic">Hancheng) v Goh Jessiline</span> [2008] 2 SLR(R) 455 at [19]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">96 I also awarded the interest at the usual rate of 5.33% <span class="font-italic">per annum</span> as there was no reason to depart from the norm.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">97 In conclusion, having found that the Transfer was made under a mistake, I ordered the cancellation of the registration of the Transfer as well as the rectification of the land-register to reflect the plaintiff’s continued ownership over the Property. I also ordered that the sum of $13,411 be returned to the plaintiff, with interest at 5.33% <span class="font-italic">per annum</span> from the date of the writ (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, 30 November 2020) to the date of judgment (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, 30 January 2023). I also ordered the defendants to pay the plaintiff party-to-party costs in the sum of $360,000 and reasonable disbursements in the sum of $123,019.17, with GST at the rate of 8% and the usual interest of 5.33% <span class="font-italic">per annum</span>.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">98 I further gave liberty to apply in terms of effecting the court’s decision in case any further issues were to arise with respect to the land-register.</div><table class="table table-sm table-borderless"><tbody><tr><td><div class="txt-body text-left">Aedit Abdullah<br/>Judge of the High Court</div></td></tr></tbody></table><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Ranvir Kumar Singh (UniLegal LLC) and Ong Eng Tuan Eben (Loh Eben Ong LLP) for the plaintiff;</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Ng Hui Min and Mok Zi Cong (Dentons Rodyk &amp; Davidson LLP) for the defendants.</div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
