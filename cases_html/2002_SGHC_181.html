<font color="#000080" size="4">Judgment</font>
</strong>
</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><u><font color="#800000"><strong>GROUNDS OF DECISION</strong></font></u></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">1.        This was an application by

the plaintiffs for an interim mareva injunction against the defendants. The plaintiffs are

licensees of the "Virgin Mobile" mark, the "Virgin" signature, and the

"Virgin Mobile" logo. They are the suppliers of mobile telephones, accessories

and mobile airtime services. The parties have referred to these collectively as "VMS

Products". The defendants are the franchisees of the business name "Virgin

Store" in Singapore, and were obliged by various agreements to operate what the

parties describe as "life-style concept stores". Generally, it means that the

defendant will operate stores selling Virgin Mobile products such as the VMS Products, as

well as running a caf and providing other ancillary services to its customers. The

agreement in dispute presently is the Authorised Retailer Agreement which the defendants

signed with the plaintiffs. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">2.        By the terms of the said

agreement, the plaintiffs would supply mobile telephones to the defendants for retail sale

by them (the defendants). The defendants were obliged to submit regular six-monthly

rolling forecasts of sales. The plaintiffs alleged that in breach of the agreement, the

defendants had not done so. More importantly, the plaintiffs aver that the defendants had

not paid the plaintiffs' invoices since December 2001. The amount outstanding is

$2,746,399.64. The defendants deny that they were in breach of agreement and say that they

have a counter-claim based on misrepresentation and estoppel. The facts and circumstances

relating to the breach and counter-claim are not straightforward. However, it is not

necessary to deal with them in this application save on the point as to whether the claims

are spurious. That point cannot be determined until full arguments are heard.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">3.        When the application was

first heard before me, it was by way of an <i>ex parte</i> application, but it was served

on the defendants' solicitors who attended the hearing. The ground advanced at that time

by Mrs. Thio on behalf of the plaintiffs was that the amount owing cannot be disputed

because they are money subject to a trust created by contract, and that unless restrained,

the defendants may dissipate the money in their bank accounts. However, I could see

nothing in the affidavits of Ross Anthony Cormack, Lim Teck Liang and Cheong Aik Hock,

filed in support of the mareva application that indicates what the danger of dissipation

was, or why an urgent order ought to be made. It transpired at the hearing that the

defendants had not separated the income they received from sales of the plaintiffs'

products into a trust account. On this basis, I directions for the filing of affidavits

for the purpose of the <i>inter parte</i> hearing. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">4.        In the meantime, Mrs. Thio

filed an application for a order for an injunction pending the <i>inter parte </i>hearing.

The basis of her application was that the money that was supposed to be in the trust

account cannot be taken by the defendants in any event, and that since the money can be

identified, an order for the injunction ought to be made. I need only make two points

briefly. First, Mr. Quahe argued on behalf of the defendants that there is no trust

account or money because of the unlawful termination of contract by the plaintiffs.

Secondly, even if there were money due to the plaintiffs, the fact that no trust account

actually had been created means that there is no identifiable trust money for the

injunction to apply. I dismissed the application without prejudice, of course, to hearing

full arguments at the <i>inter parte</i> stage. On the basis of the situation at present,

I dismissed the plaintiffs' application for an injunction pending the <i>inter parte</i>

hearing. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">5.        Mrs. Thio asked for leave

to present further argument on this point on the basis of various authorities,

principally, <i>Re Stehelin &amp; Stahlknecht Ex Parte The Central Agency Glasgow </i>[1893] 1 SSLR 78, <i>Re Hallet's Estate</i> L.R. 13 Ch D 696, and <i>Geh Cheng Hooi v Equipment

Dynamics Sdn Bhd</i> <a class="remove" href1="/scripts/lp/dll/prospect.dll?GetHTML_lpqs&amp;type=1&amp;CaseID=31309&amp;freetext=" target="LWBMainFrame">[1991] 1 MLJ 293</a>. The point made in these cases is that even though

trust property has been mixed with the defendants' own property, the law will allow

tracing to be done in order to extract the trust property from the mixed lot. Initially, I

had indicated that had the trust fund been clearly established I would have granted the

injunction sought. However, subsequently, in reviewing the case when Mrs. Thio made her

second application before me, I formed the view that in the overall circumstances, an

injunction pending the <i>inter parte</i> hearing would not be justified. The case is

complicated in fact and law. What does appear clear at the moment is that there is no

sufficient evidence of dissipation other than the use of the defendants' money in the

ordinary course of business. Mr. Quahe submitted that if the defendants accounts are

frozen their business will collapse because they would not be able to pay rent and staff

salary. Furthermore, he re-emphasized the submission that the obligation to maintain the

trust is being challenged by the defendants. In the circumstances, I am of the view that

the balance of convenience lay in not granting the injunction until the case may be more

fully argued. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">6.        For the reasons above, the

plaintiffs' application for an injunction order pending the hearing of the <i>inter parte</i>

application was dismissed.</p>
