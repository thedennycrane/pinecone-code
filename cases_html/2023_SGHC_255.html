Therefore, Sundaresh Menon JC (as the Chief Justice then was) allowed an application by the defendants to strike out the action on the ground that the plaintiff had no title to maintain the action (<span class="font-italic">Alliance Entertainment </span>at [68]). </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The law on standing to claim copyright infringement </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">18 The <span class="font-italic">locus standi </span>requirements for an action for copyright infringement are set out in s 153(1) of the Copyright Act 2021: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Action for copyright infringement</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">153.—(1)  Subject to the provisions of this Act, an action against a person for an infringement of copyright may be brought in the Court by —</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) the copyright owner; or</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) if an exclusive licence of the copyright is in force at the time of the infringement — the exclusive licensee.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(2)  The exclusive licensee’s right of action under subsection (1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) is concurrent with the copyright owner’s right of action under subsection (1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>).</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(3)  This section does not —</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) give an exclusive licensee any right against a copyright owner; or</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) affect any right that an exclusive licensee has against a copyright owner.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">19 In short, a claim for copyright infringement can only be made by the copyright owner or the exclusive licensee of the copyright.

Therefore, in order for the claimant to have standing to sue, it must have been an exclusive licensee of the copyright in “Moon Man” at the time of the alleged infringing acts, <span class="font-italic">ie</span><span class="font-italic">, </span>from 15 September 2022 to 26 October 2022 (<span class="font-italic">per</span> s 103(1) of the Copyright Act 2021). As elaborated above (at [12]), the defendant claimed that the claimant was no longer an exclusive licensee at the material time, as it had granted an exclusive licence to HK Tiger via the 20 August Agreement. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">22 In my view, the main difficulty in the defendant’s case was that s 103(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the Copyright Act 2021 requires that the exclusive licence be “granted by the owner or prospective owner of the copyright”. Pursuant to the 20 August Agreement, HK Tiger’s licence was granted by the claimant, and not the owner of the copyright, <span class="font-italic">ie</span><span class="font-italic">, </span>Kaixin. Therefore, this begged the question of <span class="font-italic">how</span> HK Tiger satisfied the statutory requirements of being an exclusive licensee and why the claimant was no longer the statutory exclusive licensee. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">23 In the case of <span class="font-italic">Alliance Entertainment</span>, the High Court considered the interpretation of the term “exclusive licence” in the earlier Copyright Act 2006. For context, in <span class="font-italic">Alliance Entertainment</span>, the plaintiff contended that by virtue of a chain of contractual arrangements it was the exclusive licensee in Singapore of copyright in various television series and films (<span class="font-italic">Alliance Entertainment </span>at [2]). Before the commencement of the trial, the defendants filed an application to strike out proceedings contending that the plaintiff did not have title to maintain the action because it was not an exclusive licensee within the meaning of the Copyright Act 2006 (<span class="font-italic">Alliance Entertainment </span>at [7]). The definition of an “exclusive licence” was set out in s 7 of the Copyright Act 2006: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">“exclusive licence” means a licence in writing, signed by or on behalf of the owner or prospective owner of copyright, authorising the licensee, to the exclusion of all other persons, to do an act that, by virtue of this Act, the owner of the copyright would, but for the licence, have the exclusive right to do, and “exclusive licensee” shall have a corresponding meaning;</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 The Copyright Act 2021, which replaced the Copyright Act 2006, adopts a definition of an exclusive licence that is the same in substance as s 7 of the Copyright Act 2006, except that the formality requirements have been set out separately in s 142 of the Copyright Act 2021. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 In response to the contention of the defendants in <span class="font-italic">Alliance Entertainment</span>, one of the plaintiff’s submissions was initially that the phrase “on behalf of the [copyright] owner” in the definition of an “exclusive licensee” found in s 7 of the Copyright Act 2006 ought to be given a robust interpretation and so encompass the plaintiff. This argument was based on the parliamentary intention behind the statutory amendment that enacted s 124 of the Copyright Act 2006 (<span class="font-italic">Alliance Entertainment </span>at [7(b)]. Similar to the present case, there was no dispute that the instruments relied on by the plaintiff had <span class="font-italic">not</span> been issued by the copyright owners to the plaintiff. Upon further reflection, the plaintiff dropped this argument and conceded that it was not an exclusive licensee within the meaning of the Copyright Act 2006 (<span class="font-italic">Alliance Entertainment </span>at [7] and [10]). Menon JC agreed with this concession by the plaintiff, describing it as well-advised (<span class="font-italic">Alliance Entertainment </span>at [11]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 Menon JC also set out some detailed observations on this issue (<span class="font-italic">Alliance Entertainment </span>at [10]–[11]). He began by citing an extract from<span class="font-italic"> </span><span class="font-italic">Copinger and Skone James on Copyright</span>, vol 1 (Kevin Garnett <span class="font-italic">et al</span> eds) (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 15th Ed, 2005), which is now reproduced in its latest edition, <span class="font-italic">Copinger</span><span class="font-italic"> and Skone James on Copyright</span>, vol 1 (Gwilym Harbottle <span class="font-italic">et al</span> eds) (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 18th Ed, 2021) at para 5-247: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Two matters … follow from the requirement that the licence be signed “by or on behalf of the copyright owner” – first, that <span class="font-italic">a statutory exclusive licensee cannot himself grant a statutory exclusive licence by way of sub-licence. </span>If such a grant is permitted by the terms of the head licence, it will of course create a valid contractual sub-licence, giving the sub-licensee protection in an infringement action brought by the copyright owner and contractual rights against his own licensor.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 Menon JC stated that these statements were correct (<span class="font-italic">Alliance Entertainment </span>at [11]). In my judgment, this passage continues to reflect the position under Singapore law, notwithstanding that the formality requirements for an exclusive licence are now set out in a separate provision in s 142 of the Copyright Act 2021. A statutory exclusive licensee cannot himself grant a statutory exclusive licence by way of sub-licence. Instead, as Menon JC rightly commented, “[w]hen an exclusive licensee grants a sub-licence, he is acting on his own behalf and not as agent or on behalf of the copyright owner” (<span class="font-italic">Alliance Entertainment </span>at [11]).  In this case, the claimant, as the statutory exclusive licensee, had the right to sub-licence its rights in “Moon Man”, pursuant to cl 2.6 of the 19 August Agreement. However, the claimant could not grant a statutory exclusive licence to HK Tiger by way of sub-licensing its rights in “Moon Man” pursuant to the 20 August Agreement. At best, the licence granted to HK Tiger was a contractual sub-licence. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 Menon JC also considered whether in granting the sub-licence, the plaintiff’s sub-licensors had been acting on behalf of the copyright owners, rather than on their own behalf. He held that there was no indication of this, because<span class="font-italic"> </span>“there [was] no suggestion at all that the consideration paid or payable by [the plaintiff] under the instrument pursuant to which it claims its licence is payable to the copyright owners” (<span class="font-italic">Alliance Entertainment</span> at [11]). Similarly, in this case, there was no suggestion that any consideration paid by HK Tiger to the claimant was payable to Kaixin. There was nothing else before me to show that the claimant had acted <span class="font-italic">on behalf of</span> Kaixin to grant the licence to HK Tiger. Menon JC further observed (<span class="font-italic">Alliance Entertainment </span>at [11]): </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… Indeed, it would be illogical for them to be acting on behalf of the copyright owners rather than on their own behalf. This is because there would then be more than one licensee with rights in Singapore unless the rights granted to the sub-licensor had been revoked and there is no suggestion of this being the case at all. This was also the effect of the judgment of Booysen AJ in <span class="font-italic">Kinekor</span><span class="font-italic"> Films (Pty) Ltd v Movie Time</span> [1976] 1 SA 649, where it was held that a licence granted by a prior licensee rather than by the copyright owner was not an exclusive licence within the meaning of the equivalent South African statutory provision, but only a contractual licensee. Faced with these arguments by Mr Tan Teng Muan, who appeared for the defendants, [counsel for the plaintiff’s] concession on this issue seemed well-advised.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 Applying s 103 of the Copyright Act 2021, in light of the observations in <span class="font-italic">Alliance Entertainment</span>, the claimant could not have granted HK Tiger an exclusive licence through the execution of the 20 August Agreement. Therefore, there was nothing to suggest that the claimant lost its status as the statutory exclusive licensee.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Dendron is inapplicable </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 In order to overcome the difficulty in interpreting s 103 of the Copyright Act 2021, the defendant simply relied on the outcome in <span class="font-italic">Dendron, </span>a patent case. In <span class="font-italic">Dendron, </span>the High Court of England and Wales held that the sub-licensee supplanted the exclusive licensee as the statutory exclusive licensee. The case appears to lay down the principle that a licensee with power to grant sub-licences has the power to consent on behalf of the proprietor and act as a duly authorised agent to grant a statutory exclusive licence (<span class="font-italic">Dendron</span> at [21] and [22]). However, on closer scrutiny of the judgment in <span class="font-italic">Dendron</span>, I found it did not assist the defendant. The reasoning was simply not relevant to the present case. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 I first set out the facts of <span class="font-italic">Dendron</span>. The case concerned a counterclaim for patent infringement brought by the Regents of the University of California (“UC”), the proprietor of the patent in dispute, as well as Boston Scientific Ltd (“Boston”). Boston claimed to be entitled to sue for infringement as exclusive licensee under the patent (<span class="font-italic">Dendron </span>at [1]). The defendants to the counterclaim, Dendron, claimed that another company, Target Therapeutics, Inc (“Target”), was the exclusive licensee. Dendron therefore sought to dismiss Boston’s claim and join Target as a claimant. On 30 June 1990, UC had conferred upon Target an exclusive licence under the patent to make, use and sell the licensed product and to practise the licenced method (<span class="font-italic">Dendron</span> at [13]). The exclusive licence granted Target a power to grant sub-licences (<span class="font-italic">Dendron</span> at [14]). Subsequently, on 2 April 2003, UC, Target and Boston entered into a further agreement in relation to the patent. By the recital to that agreement, Target, as the “existing exclusive licensee” granted and agreed, with the consent of UC, to appoint Boston as the exclusive licensee (<span class="font-italic">Dendron</span> at [17]).  By virtue of the subsequent agreement, Pumfrey J decided that Target had been supplanted by Boston as the exclusive licensee (<span class="font-italic">Dendron </span>at [26]): </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">26. In my judgment, the preliminary issue is to be decided in favour of Boston. It seems to me to be clear from clause 1 of the Boston licence that Target described as “existing exclusive licensee” in the recitals, has been supplanted as the recital suggests by Boston. Thus, Target cease entirely to be exclusive licensee in respect of the patent. For the reasons that I have given, this is a permissible manner of making Boston the exclusive licensee under the patent.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">Therefore, Boston had legal standing to initiate infringement proceedings against Dendron. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 The applicable statutory regime in <span class="font-italic">Dendron </span>was the Patents Act 1977 (c 37) (UK) (the “UK Patents Act”). Under s 67 of the UK Patents Act, “the holder of an exclusive licence under a patent [was to] have the same right as the proprietor of the patent to bring proceedings in respect of any infringement of the patent committed after the date of the licence”. Section 130(1) of the UK Patents Act defines the term “exclusive licence” as:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">a licence from the proprietor of or applicant for a patent conferring on the licensee,<span class="font-italic"> or on him and persons authorised by him</span>, to the exclusion of all other persons (including the proprietor or applicant), any right in respect of the invention to which the patent or application relates, and “exclusive license” and “non-exclusive licence” shall be construed accordingly.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 In my judgment, Pumfrey J’s reasoning for concluding that Boston supplanted Target as the exclusive licensee was not applicable to the present dispute. This was because the reasoning was based on the specific language in s 130(1) the UK Patents Act, whereas the present dispute was governed by an entirely different statutory regime, <span class="font-italic">ie</span><span class="font-italic">, </span>the Copyright Act 2021. The definitions of an “exclusive licence” in s 130(1) of the UK Patents Act and s 103(1) of the Copyright Act 2021 are materially different. In particular, under s 130(1) of the UK Patents Act, an exclusive licence is a licence “from the proprietor … conferring on the licensee, or <span class="font-italic">on him and persons authorised by him</span>, … any right in respect of the invention … and ‘exclusive licence’ and ‘non-exclusive licence’ shall be construed accordingly” [emphasis added]. The phrase, “or on him and persons authorised by him”, is noticeably absent in s 103(1) of the Copyright Act 2021. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 In <span class="font-italic">Dendron</span>, Pumfrey J considered the argument that Boston had not been granted an exclusive licence within the meaning of s 130(1) of the UK Patents Act because Boston was a sub-licensee of Target. It was contended that s 130(1) of the UK Patents Act required the licence to be “from the proprietor of a patent”, and the licence granted to Boston was not such a licence (<span class="font-italic">Dendron</span> at [20]). He held that “as a matter of construction of the definition the words 'from the proprietor of or the applicant for a patent' mean[t] 'granted by the proprietor <span class="font-italic">or by a person duly authorised by the proprietor for that purpose'</span>” [emphasis added] (<span class="font-italic">Dendron</span> at [22]). Pumfrey J reasoned that the words “from the proprietor of or the applicant for the patent” in s 130(1) of the UK Patents Act “[o]bviously … [could not mean] a licence <span class="font-italic">signed</span> <span class="font-italic">by</span> the patentee”. Further, “[i]t [could not] have been the intention of the draughtsman to exclude the possibility that the licence might be granted by an agent of the patentee duly authorised for the purpose or of the patentee's attorney”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 Crucially, however, these holdings were premised on the presence of the words “or on him and persons authorised by him” in s 130(1) of the UK Patents Act. When this phrase is read in context, s 130(1) of the UK Patents Act essentially states that a licence from the patent proprietor conferring on the licensee and <span class="font-italic">persons authorised by the licensee</span> any right in respect of the invention to the exclusion of all other persons is regarded as an exclusive licence. In <span class="font-italic">Dendron</span> (at [11]), the High Court of England and Wales made the observation that “[t]he words ‘or on him and persons authorised by him' seem … to contemplate a licence which confers upon the exclusive licensee a power to sub-licence”. Applying this observation, s<span class="font-weight-bold"> </span>130(1) of the UK Patents Act appears to contemplate that a patent proprietor is able to confer a statutory exclusive licence on a licensee who is then entitled to confer a statutory exclusive licence on a sub-licensee. To get around the problem of the definition which required a licence to only be granted by the proprietor, Pumfrey J held that an exclusive licence need not be <span class="font-italic">signed </span>by the patentee. Instead, another party could act as a duly authorised agent on behalf of the patentee to grant a statutory exclusive licence in accordance with s 130(1) of the UK Patents Act. Further, it was held that “a licensee with power to grant sub-licenses is a licensee who has the power to consent <span class="font-italic">on behalf of</span> the patentee” (<span class="font-italic">Dendron </span>at [21]). Therefore, by virtue of the wording “or on him and persons authorised by him” in s 130(1) of the UK Patents Act, Pumfrey J was able to conclude that Target, who had the power to grant sub-licences, could be duly authorised by UC to grant a statutory exclusive licence to Boston. In contrast, as the phrase “or on him and persons authorised by him” does not appear in s 103(1) of the Copyright Act 2021, the reasoning in <span class="font-italic">Dendron</span> is simply not relevant to our local copyright regime. The phrase “granted by the owner or prospective owner of the copyright” cannot be reasonably interpreted in a manner that allowed the licence granted to HK Tiger to be brought within the concept of the statutory exclusive licence in Singapore. This is because even though Kaixin had granted its licensee, via the 19 August Agreement, the right to grant sub-licenses, these sub-licenses were <span class="font-italic">not </span>licences “granted by the owner or prospective owner of the copyright” (see s 103(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the Copyright Act 2021). Additionally, as elaborated above, interpreting s 103(1) of the Copyright Act 2021 this way would be inconsistent with the observations made by Menon JC in <span class="font-italic">Alliance Entertainment</span>.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 The authors of Adrian Speck <span class="font-italic">et al</span>,<span class="font-italic"> Laddie, Prescott and Vitoria: </span><span class="font-italic">The Modern Law of Copyright</span> vol 1 (LexisNexis Butterworths, 5th Ed, 2018) (“<span class="font-italic">The Modern Law of Copyright</span>”) adopt a similar viewpoint when comparing the definition of an “exclusive licensee” of rights in copyright works in s 92(1) of the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988 (c 48) (UK) with the definition of an “exclusive licensee” in the UK Patents Act (<span class="font-italic">The Modern Law of Copyright </span>at p 1173 footnote no 1). The learned authors observe that the definition of an “exclusive licensee” in s 92(1) “appears to exclude the possibility of exclusive sub-licences being regarded as exclusive licences for the purposes of this legislation”. The authors directly contrast this with the position under s 130(1) of the UK Patents Act, citing <span class="font-italic">Dendron </span>as the relevant legal authority. I reproduce s 92(1) of the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988 in full:  </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">92 Exclusive licences.</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">In this Part an “exclusive licence” means a licence in writing signed by or on behalf of the copyright owner authorising the licensee to the exclusion of all other persons, including the person granting the licence, to exercise a right which would otherwise be exercisable exclusively by the copyright owner.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 The definitions of an “exclusive licence” set out in s 92(1) of the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988 and s 103(1) of the Copyright Act 2021 are similar in substance. In any event, like s 103(1) of the Copyright Act 2021, the definition of an exclusive licence in s 92(1) of the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988 omits the phrase “or on him and persons authorised by him”. Therefore, s 103(1) of the Copyright Act 2021 cannot be interpreted by importing the wording of s 130(1) of the UK Patents Act and applying the reasoning in <span class="font-italic">Dendron. </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 In my view, there was nothing before me to suggest that HK Tiger had supplanted the claimant as the statutory exclusive licensee and that the claimant was no longer the statutory exclusive licensee at the material time. The 20 August Agreement only granted a sub-license to HK Tiger, and the claimant retained its status as the exclusive licensee. Therefore, the claimant satisfied the standing requirement set out in s 153 of the Copyright Act 2021.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 For all the foregoing reasons, I dismissed the defendant’s striking out application in Summons 2172.
