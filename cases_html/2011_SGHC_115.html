<p class="Judg-Author">
        Kan Ting Chiu J:</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       These matters originated from an application by
                    a wife (“the wife”) against her husband (“the
                    husband”) for maintenance for herself and two children. The application
                    was filed on its own, without any divorce proceedings.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The husband and wife were married in 1999. It
                    was the second marriage for both of them. The husband had two sons from a
                    previous marriage, and the wife had one son <em>B</em>,
                    from a previous marriage. Out of the current marriage, the couple has one son
                        <em>C</em>. <em>B</em> was 16
                    years old and <em>C</em> was 9 years old at the time
                    of the hearing before me. The husband was 53 years old and the wife 47 years
                    old.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       The application was heard in the Family Court.
                    At the end of a 4-day hearing, a District Judge (“DJ”) ordered
                    that the husband:</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(a)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">pay the wife monthly maintenance of $6,500 for
                            the maintenance of the wife and <em>B</em> and
                                <em>C</em>; and</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(b)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">make further payments for household expenses,
                            expenses for <em>B</em> and <em>C</em>, car expenses, maid expenses, housing loan, fixed loan
                            and property tax payments totalling $9,655.55 per month. These
                            additional payments were to be made by the husband directly to the
                            receiving parties, or to the wife on proof of payment by the
                            wife.</div>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       Both parties appealed against the DJ’s
                    orders. The wife appealed against:</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(a)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">the amount of maintenance awarded by the
                            DJ;</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(b)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">the DJ’s decision not to order that the
                            maintenance be backdated to June 2008;</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(c)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">the DJ’s order that the husband make some
                            payments directly; and</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(d)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">the DJ’s decision not to award costs of the
                            application to the wife.</div>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       The husband, on the other hand, appealed
                    against:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_5-p2_a"></a>(a)     the award of maintenance for
                            <em>B</em>; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_5-p2_b"></a>(b)     the amount of maintenance awarded to the
                        wife.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       I shall deal with both appeals together and
                    address the issues in this order:</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(a)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">whether the husband is liable to maintain
                                <em>B</em>;</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(b)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">whether the maintenance awarded to the wife
                            should be varied;</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(c)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">whether the maintenance payments should be
                            backdated;</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(d)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">whether the order for direct payments should have
                            been made; and</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(e)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">whether the wife should be awarded the costs of
                            the application.</div>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Whether the husband is liable to maintain <em>B</em></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       This issue was not brought up in the court below
                    where the arguments were centred on the quantum of maintenance. However, in an
                    application for maintenance, it is essential that there be a duty to maintain;
                    if there is no duty to maintain, then the application for maintenance must
                    fail.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       The claim for maintenance for <em>B</em> was founded on s 70(1) of the Women’s Charter (Cap
                    353, 2009 Rev Ed) (all references to sections hereinafter shall be references to
                    the Women’s Charter unless otherwise stated). Section 70(1), (2) and (3)
                    state:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">70. —(1) Where a person has accepted a child who is not his child as
                        a member of his family, it shall be his duty to maintain that child while he
                        remains a child, so far as the father or the mother of the child fails to do
                        so, and the court may make such orders as may be necessary to ensure the
                        welfare of the child.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(2) The duty imposed by subsection (1) shall cease if the child is taken
                        away by his father or mother.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(3) Any sums expended by a person maintaining that child shall be
                        recoverable as a debt from the father or mother of the child.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       The husband argued that s 70 has no
                    application to him because:</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(a)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">the wife has been receiving maintenance of $350
                            per month for <em>B</em> from his biological
                            father;</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(b)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">
<em>B</em> is no longer
                            living with the husband, and the husband has no legal right of access to
                            him; and</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(c)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">under s 70(3) the husband is entitled to
                            claim from the wife any maintenance he paid for <em>B</em>, and “[i]t would therefore make no sense for
                            the Court to order the Husband to pay the Wife maintenance for <em>B</em>, only for the Husband to be able to claim the
                            money back from the Wife”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span></div>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     The wife’s response was that:</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(a)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">the husband was aware that <em>B</em>’s biological father was paying maintenance for
                                <em>B</em>;</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(b)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">the husband has acknowledged that he had been
                            paying for <em>B</em>’s tuition fees, school
                            fees, pocket money, meals and expenses, and had affirmed that he had
                            been maintaining <em>B</em>; and</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(c)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">the husband’s interpretation of
                            s 70(3) should not be adopted.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span></div>
<p class="Judg-1">It is to be noted that the husband did not dispute that <em>B</em> was accepted by him as a member of his family, and did
                    not say that he had been denied access to <em>B</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     On the point that <em>B</em> was receiving maintenance from his own father, the
                    husband’s argument relied on the words “so far as the father or
                    mother of the child fails to [maintain the child]” in s 70(1). The
                    phrase could have been made clearer. As it stands, it could be construed as
                    “failing to maintain <em>at all</em>”, or
                    “failing to maintain <em>adequately</em>”,
                    and the husband has adopted the former construction.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     It is useful to read the phrase in the proper
                    context. Section 70(1) provides that a person who accepts a child as a member of
                    his family has a duty to maintain the child so far as the parents fail to
                    maintain the child. The words “so far as” must be understood
                    properly. They have the same meaning as “to the extent that”. In
                    other words, the duty only starts upon the parents’ failure to maintain
                    the child adequately. If the child is already adequately maintained by his or
                    her parents, there is no duty on the non-parent to provide further maintenance
                    for the child. However, if the child receives <em>some</em>
                    maintenance from the parents, which is insufficient for his requirements, then
                    the non-parent who has accepted the child as a member of his family has the duty
                    to provide the child with such additional maintenance within his means as is
                    reasonable for the child.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     As it was not contended or established that
                    the $350 per month from <em>B</em>’s father was
                    sufficient for <em>B’s</em> upkeep, <em>B</em>’s receipt of maintenance from his father did not
                    release the husband from his duty to provide maintenance for <em>B</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     On the husband’s second ground that
                        <em>B</em> is no longer living with him, that was
                    because the husband moved out of the matrimonial home and not that <em>B</em> was taken away by his father or mother as contemplated
                    in s 70(2). The husband had not said that he no longer accepted <em>B</em> as a member of his family, or that <em>B</em> does not want to be accepted as a member of the
                family.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     Section 70(1) states that when a person
                        “<em>has accepted</em> a child ... as a member
                    of his family, it shall be his duty to maintain” the child. It also
                    states that the person shall have a duty to continue to maintain the child
                    “while he remains a child” and not while the child continues to be
                    accepted as a member of the family. Following from that, once the person
                        <em>has accepted</em> the child as a member of his
                    family, the duty arises, and only ceases when the child ceases to be a child.
                    There is one express limitation to the scope of the duty. Section 70(2)
                    provides that the duty shall cease if the child is taken away by his father or
                    mother. The person has no right to opt out of the duty – s 70 does
                    not state that after a person has accepted the child as a member of his family,
                    he can change his mind and stop maintaining the child. Since family acceptance
                    is the basis for the duty, it can be argued that the duty ends only when, by
                    circumstances not of the person’s making, the quasi-familial relationship
                    between the person and the child ends, <em>eg</em>, when
                    the child renounces the relationship, or he is taken away by his
                parent.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     On the husband’s third point that any
                    maintenance he pays to <em>B</em> is recoverable from the
                    wife as a debt under s 70(3), the provision raises difficult
                    questions:</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(a)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">as the maintenance is paid in the discharge of
                            duty imposed by law on the non-parent, why is it recoverable as a debt
                            from the father or mother of the child?</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(b)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">why should the person who had voluntarily
                            accepted a child as a member of his family have recourse against the
                            child’s parents for expenditure he incurs on the
                        child?</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(c)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">as the amount of maintenance to be paid is
                            dependent on the means of the non-parent, why should the father or
                            mother repay to the non-parent the amount he paid based on his means and
                            without regard to their means?</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(d)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">is the liability of the father or mother to repay
                            a joint or several liability?</div>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     The husband is relying on s 70(3) because
                    it is there, and he may not be able to, and in any event, he is not the best
                    party to answer the questions. It suffices, however, to note that on any reading
                    of s 70 as a whole, s 70(3) cannot cancel s 70(1).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Whether the maintenance for the wife should be varied</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     The wife is seeking an upward revision, and
                    the husband wants a reduction of the maintenance.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     The husband is a successful businessman. He is
                    the managing director of a reputable construction services company, and has
                    annual income of $600,000, or $50,000 a month. The wife is not working. She
                    holds a diploma from an Australian insurance institute and had worked for 10
                    years as an insurance agent before her marriage to the husband, and continues to
                    receive $10,000 a year from a former employer.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     The wife claimed $15,000 for maintenance,
                    excluding payments of housing loans, hospital insurance for herself and the
                    children and expenses incurred on her child.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span> The husband, on the other
                    hand, asserted that he had been paying $10,976.67 for the maintenance of the
                    wife, <em>B</em> and <em>C</em> and
                    that sum is greater than their needs.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span> (That included maintenance
                    for <em>B</em> as the issues under s 70 were not
                    raised at that stage.) In the event, the DJ ordered maintenance for the wife,
                        <em>B</em> and <em>C</em>
                    totalling to $16,155.55, including maintenance for <em>B</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     The husband’s appeal raised the legal
                    issue under s 70, which I have dealt with. Besides that issue he did not
                    question the DJ’s quantification of the maintenance for <em>B</em> and <em>C</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     The DJ made his award after he heard the
                    husband and wife, and he was satisfied that “the husband had cut back the
                    wife’s access to some of the funds to which she had almost unrestrained
                    access previously.”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_5" id="Ftn_5_1"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     In arriving at the quantum of the award, the
                    DJ took into account:</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(a)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">the husband’s earnings of $50,000 a
                            month;</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(b)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">the wife’s failure to disclose her
                            financial resources; and</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(c)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">the fact that the wife suffered from depression
                            which led to her lavish expenditure.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_6" id="Ftn_6_1"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span></div>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     Having reviewed the evidence and arguments of
                    both parties, I find that neither party has presented a case for the DJ’s
                    quantification of maintenance to be disturbed.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Whether the maintenance payments should be backdated</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     The maintenance order was made on 20 May
                    2010 to take effect from 1 June 2010. The wife had applied for maintenance
                    to be backdated to June 2008 on the ground that the husband had neglected
                    or refused to provide reasonable maintenance since that time.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_7" id="Ftn_7_1"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     When a maintenance order is made, the
                    operative date of the order is provided. It is usually one of the
                    following:</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(a)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">the date from which the defendant had failed to
                            pay proper maintenance;</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(b)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">the date of the filing of the maintenance
                            application;</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(c)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">the date of the order;</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(d)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">the month following the date of the
                        order.</div>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     The determination of the operative date is
                    governed by the facts of each case. If the applicant had to incur debts or sell
                    possessions to make up for the shortfall in maintenance, that would be a strong
                    ground for backdating the maintenance. On the other hand, if the applicant had
                    been able to manage with the pre-order maintenance, back-payment would be a
                    windfall, and the case for backdating would be weaker.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     In the present case, the DJ explained in
                        [10] of his grounds of decision that
                    he did not backdate his order because:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The court did not find it necessary to backdate the award as there was no
                        credible evidence before it of the assets of the wife. The husband in his
                        evidence had made the point that he believed the wife had considerable
                        assets and could save up to $40,000 to $50,000 a year. The court agreed that
                        this had to be given due weight particularly in the absence of any
                        meaningful disclosure by the wife of her own savings and assets.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     The DJ found that “[t]he court had no
                    evidence ... of the wife’s own financial resources as they were not
                    disclosed by her”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_8" id="Ftn_8_1"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span> and decided not to backdate the maintenance.
                    As the wife’s financial circumstances is a factor to be taken into
                    consideration in deciding whether to backdate maintenance, it cannot be said
                    that the DJ’s decision was wrong or unreasonable.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Whether the order for direct payments should have been made</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     The wife’s complaint was
                        that<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_9" id="Ftn_9_1"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span>:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">To allow the Respondent to continue to yield such control over the sum due
                        to the Wife (as the Lower Court ordered in this case), accords the Husband
                        unnecessary and undesirable “control” over the Wife and
                        children.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     The DJ’s order for the husband to make
                    direct payments for some items of the maintenance order, <em>eg</em>, conservancy charges for the matrimonial home, car loan
                    instalments, road tax and insurance, housing loans, fixed loans, property tax,
                    and to pay other items upon production of proof of payment by the wife, is not
                    the normal order.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     The DJ did not make this order arbitrarily. He
                    had noted in the grounds of decision that the wife had withdrawn $18,500 from a
                    joint bank account with the husband without his knowledge or consent, and that
                    she was disposed to lavish spending when she was depressed. The DJ had doubts
                    over her ability to manage money responsibly after having seen and heard both
                    parties. In any event, those payment terms were not oppressive or unreasonable,
                    and they should be retained.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Whether the wife should be awarded the costs for the
                application</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     The DJ did not address the question of costs
                    at all in his grounds of decision. The wife had applied for maintenance and
                    obtained payments which she would not have received otherwise. I am unable to
                    see why she should be deprived of her costs entirely. However, taking into
                    account her excessive claim and her failure to disclose her assets, she should
                    not have full costs. I order that she get half the costs of the
                    application.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Costs for the appeals</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     The wife had succeeded partially in the claim
                    for the costs of the application, but had failed in the other parts of her
                    appeal. Each party is to bear its own costs in her appeal. The husband appealed
                    over the quantum of maintenance for the wife and his liability to maintain
                        <em>B</em>, and he had failed on both issues. The wife
                    will have the costs of his appeal.</p>
