Under Singapore law, liability for the collision is apportioned in accordance with s 1 of the Maritime Conventions Act 1911 (Cap IA3, 2004 Rev Ed) (“<span class="font-weight-bold">MCA 1911</span>”). The general rule is that liability is apportioned according to the degree to which each vessel was at fault. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 Depending on the apportionment of liability and the recoverable quantum of each shipowner’s loss and damage based on that liability apportionment, one shipowner may be either the net payor (<span class="font-italic">ie,</span> net paying party) or the net payee (<span class="font-italic">ie,</span> net receiving party). This is because in practice, the quantum of the smaller recoverable claim is deducted from the quantum of the larger recoverable claim, leaving only one net balance to be paid by the net payor to the net payee. This outcome is the result of applying what is known as the “single liability principle”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">3 The application of the single liability principle as summarised above is a straightforward one in cases where the claims of both shipowners against each other are not time-barred. However, what happens in a case where the claim of one of the shipowners against the other <span class="font-italic">is</span> time-barred? Can that shipowner, as the net payor, still avail itself of the single liability principle in order to reduce its liability to the net payee? These questions lie at the centre of the application before me. I am given to understand by counsel that this is the first case in which these questions have squarely arisen for determination in Singapore whereas they have been considered once in the English High Court (see [18] below).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold"> Background </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">4 In HC/SUM 2585/2020 (“<span class="font-weight-bold">SUM 2585</span>”), the defendant sought an order for the court to determine a preliminary question of law or issue pursuant to O 33 r 2 of the Rules of Court (Cap 332, R5, 2014 Rev Ed) (“<span class="font-weight-bold">ROC</span>”) and/or the inherent powers of the court.

In <span class="font-italic">Sea Echo</span>, the court had already determined the apportionment of liability for the collision after a full trial. The plaintiffs did not raise any objection to the defendant’s counterclaim on the basis of it being time-barred at any point during the trial on liability – certainly, no time-bar had ever been pleaded. The issue of the counterclaim being time-barred was only raised by the plaintiffs when Teare J had to decide on the appropriate orders for the costs of determining liability. It was only at that point that the plaintiffs contended that the defendant was not entitled to costs because it had no existing counterclaim, on the basis that the defendant’s counterclaim was by then time-barred. Teare J found on the facts that it was much too late for the plaintiffs to raise a time-bar point on the defendant’s counterclaim and they were accordingly estopped from doing so. On this ground alone, Teare J found and held that there was a valid and existing counterclaim that he could take into account for the purposes of assessing the legal costs for determining the apportionment of liability for the collision and consequently, what the appropriate cost order should be. It is also pertinent to note that unlike the defendant in this case who did not pursue its application for an extension of time to maintain its counterclaim any further following the dismissal of the application by the AR, the defendant in <span class="font-italic">Sea Echo</span> actively sought, as an alternative, an extension of time to maintain its counterclaim. Indeed, Teare J concluded that, if necessary for his decision, he would have been prepared to grant the defendant in <span class="font-italic">Sea Echo</span> the requisite extension of time to maintain its counterclaim (see [63]). Therefore, strictly speaking, the decision in <span class="font-italic">Sea Echo</span> did not turn on the application of the single liability principle to a time-barred counterclaim, unlike the situation in SUM 2585.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">22 Second, it is also important to understand the nature and effect of the time bar under s 8 MCA 1911. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">23 Section 8 MCA 1911 prescribes a two-year time bar in respect of, among others, collision claims and states as follows: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Limitation of Actions</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">8.—(1)  No action shall be maintainable to enforce any claim or lien against a ship or her owners in respect of —</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(a) any damage or loss to another ship, her cargo or freight, or any property on board her, or damages for loss of life or personal injuries suffered by any person on board her, caused by the fault of the former ship, whether such ship be wholly or partly in fault; or</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">unless proceedings therein are commenced within 2 years from the date when the damage, loss or injury was caused or the salvage services were rendered.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(2)  An action shall not be maintainable under this Act to enforce any contribution in respect of an overpaid proportion of any damages for loss of life or personal injuries unless proceedings therein are commenced within one year from the date of payment.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(3)  Notwithstanding subsections (1) and (2), any court having jurisdiction to deal with an action to which this section relates —</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(a) may, in accordance with the Rules of Court, extend any such period, to such extent and on such conditions as it thinks fit; and</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(b) shall, if satisfied that there has not during such period been any reasonable opportunity of arresting the defendant ship within the jurisdiction of the court, or within the territorial waters of the country to which the plaintiff’s ship belongs or in which the plaintiff resides or has his principal place of business, extend any such period to an extent sufficient to give such reasonable opportunity.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 Time bars may take effect by either: (a) barring the remedy sought by the party whose claim is not brought in time; or (b) extinguishing altogether the substantive rights underlying one’s claim (Toh Kian Sing, <span class="font-italic">Admiralty Law and Practice</span> (3rd Ed, 2017) (“<span class="font-italic">T</span><span class="font-italic">oh Kian Sing</span>”) at p 428). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 It is well established that the time bar under s 8 MCA 1911 is procedural in nature and falls into the former category. Thus, a plaintiff’s failure to bring its claim within the time-limit prescribed by s 8 MCA 1911 merely bars the remedy sought by the plaintiff (<span class="font-italic">The Aries Tanker Corporation v Total Transport Limited </span>[1977] 1 Lloyd’s Rep 334 at 402c). In other words, s 8 MCA 1911 bars the “maintainability” of proceedings by a plaintiff (<span class="font-italic">Sea Echo</span> at [36] and [78]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 It is also accepted that s 8 MCA 1911 applies equally to counterclaims (<span class="font-italic">The El Arish </span>[1994] 1 SLR(R) 141 in the context of s 8 MCA 1911 and <span class="font-italic">The Pearl of Jebel Ali </span>[2009] 2 Lloyd’s Rep 484 at [32] and [34] in relation to s 190 of the UK Merchant Shipping Act 1995). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 Thus, the fact that the defendant’s counterclaim is time-barred prevents the defendant from seeking any remedy for its counterclaim but does not extinguish the underlying rights which gave rise to the counterclaim. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 Reverting to the case at hand, the issue before me pivots on whether the single liability principle is applicable even when the defendant’s counterclaim is time-barred, and whether the counterclaim may be raised, not as a remedy in the sense of a cause of action seeking substantive relief (since the remedy is time-barred), but simply as a way to reduce the defendant’s liability to the plaintiffs. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The single liability principle </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 In my judgment, the resolution of the Question very much turns on the true nature and operation of the single liability principle. Annex B of the Order states that: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The ‘single liability principle’ is a reference to the principle as applied in <span class="font-italic">The Khedive </span>(1882) 7 App Cas 795. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 Thus, it is critical to first understand what principle was decided and applied in <span class="font-italic">The Khedive</span>, and the reasons and context underpinning the decision.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 At its core, the single liability principle may be summarised as follows. Where two vessels are involved in a collision for which both vessels are to blame, there does not exist two cross-liabilities in damages (<span class="font-italic">ie, </span>a separate liability on the part of one vessel to the owner of the other vessel for the proportion of his loss and <span class="font-italic">vice versa</span>). Instead, there is only a single liability for the difference between the moiety (<span class="font-italic">ie, </span>a portion) of the larger claim and a moiety of the smaller claim (see <span class="font-italic">The Khedive </span>at 801 – 807, especially at 801 where the central issue in <span class="font-italic">The Khedive </span>is framed). That difference is then payable by the net payor to the net payee. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 <span class="font-italic">The Khedive </span>was a case involving a collision between two vessels, the <span class="font-italic">Voorwaarts </span>and the <span class="font-italic">Khedive. </span>The actual circumstances leading up to the collision are not relevant for the present purposes. It suffices to say that the collision caused damage to both vessels and to the cargo onboard. The damage to the <span class="font-italic">Voorwaarts </span>was more extensive than the damage to the <span class="font-italic">Khedive</span><span class="font-italic">. </span>The owners of the <span class="font-italic">Voorwaarts </span>brought an action against the owners of the <span class="font-italic">Khedive </span>and the owners of the <span class="font-italic">Khedive</span> counterclaimed in respect of their own loss and damage.  Both vessels were subsequently held equally to blame for the collision. The owners of the <span class="font-italic">Khedive </span>then commenced a limitation action and set up a limitation fund. The fund in court was insufficient to satisfy all the claims for which the owners of the <span class="font-italic">Khedive </span>were answerable in damages. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 The owners of the <span class="font-italic">Khedive</span> submitted that the limitation fund ought to be apportioned rateably between the owners of the <span class="font-italic">Voorwaarts </span>and the other claimants. The owners of the <span class="font-italic">Khedive</span> also contended that the <span class="font-italic">in rem</span> action brought by the owners of the <span class="font-italic">Voorwaarts</span> should be stayed except as regards to the counterclaim of the <span class="font-italic">Khedive</span><span class="font-italic">’s</span> owners which they sought to continue. On the other hand, the owners of the <span class="font-italic">Voorwaarts </span>argued that their claim against the limitation fund was for a moiety of the damage that the <span class="font-italic">Voorwaarts </span>had suffered <span class="font-italic">less</span><span class="font-weight-bold"> </span>a moiety of the damage sustained by the owners of the <span class="font-italic">Khedive</span>, thereby wiping out the smaller claim of the owners of the <span class="font-italic">Khedive</span>. The owners of the <span class="font-italic">Voorwaarts</span> contended that once the respective damages had been ascertained and the net balance in favour of <span class="font-italic">Voorwaarts</span> established, both the claim and counterclaim should be stayed, leaving the owners of <span class="font-italic">Voorwaarts</span> to prove their rateable claim against the limitation fund of the <span class="font-italic">Khedive</span><span class="font-italic">. </span>In short, the issue before the House of Lords in <span class="font-italic">The Khedive </span>was whether the tonnage limit of liability of the <span class="font-italic">Khedive</span> applied only after each shipowner’s proportionate claim had been taken into account and a single liability had been determined. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 The House of Lords reversed the English Court of Appeal’s decision and answered the question in the affirmative in favour of the owners of the <span class="font-italic">Voorwaarts</span>. It held that the owners of the <span class="font-italic">Voorwaarts </span>were entitled to prove against the limitation fund of the <span class="font-italic">Khedive</span> for a moiety of their damage, less a moiety of the damage suffered by the owners of the <span class="font-italic">Khedive,</span> and to be paid, in respect of the net balance due to them, <span class="font-italic">pari passu </span>with the other claimants out of the limitation fund of the <span class="font-italic">Khedive</span>. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 It is not easy to discern the true <span class="font-italic">ratio decidendi</span> in <span class="font-italic">The Khedive</span> which requires a close reading of the leading opinion of the House of Lords delivered by Lord Selborne L.C. The core inquiry was framed as follows (at 801): </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">The question</span> <span class="font-weight-bold">is w</span><span class="font-weight-bold">hether there are, in these cases [</span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">ie, </span><span class="font-weight-bold">both-to-blame collision cases], two cross liabilities in damages, o</span><span class="font-weight-bold">f each shipowner to the other for half the loss which that other has sustained, or only one liability, for a moiety of the difference of the aggregate loss beyond the point of equality. </span>If both parties were solvent, and <span class="font-italic">if there were no statutory limit of liability</span>, the result, either way, would practically be the same; because, up to the point of equality, the loss would be borne (in the one view) by the owner who suffered it, and (in the other view) the one liability would be compensated by, or set off against the other, according to an equity which would most certainly have been enforced in the Court of Admiralty. If, however, by the effect of a supervening bankruptcy before judgment or of the statutory limitation of liability, the position of the two parties were rendered unequal, so that a claim by the one would only be to receive a dividend out of a fund, while a claim by the other would be payable in full, the distinction may become important. But a consequence arising out of circumstances foreign to the rule itself ought not to be regarded in the determination of this question, whether it may tend, practically, to disturb or to maintain that equality of participation in the loss arising from a common fault, which is the principle of the Admiralty rule. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added in italics and bold italics]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 Crucially, Lord Selborne L.C. thought that the “solution of this question”, depended “upon the <span class="font-italic">true effect of the procedure</span>, and the <span class="font-italic">forms of decrees</span>, of the Admiralty Court, in this class of cases” [emphasis added] involving both-to-blame collisions (<span class="font-italic">The Khedive </span>at 801).  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 Lord Selborne L.C. then embarked upon an examination of the historical procedure of the English Court of Admiralty in collision actions, and stated that when a suit was brought following a collision, it was always by one party, alleging the other party to be at fault. There would also generally be a cross-suit by the other party, with a like allegation of fault against his opponent in cases where both parties were ultimately found to be at fault and both vessels had sustained damage (<span class="font-italic">T</span><span class="font-italic">he Khedive </span>at 802). Thereafter Lord Selborne L.C. summarised the genesis and workings of the single liability principle as follows (at 802 - 803): </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… At the hearing, whether of one such suit only, or of two such suits, heard separately, or conjoined, the Court, <span class="font-weight-bold">when it determined that bo</span><span class="font-weight-bold">th ships were to blame, usually pronounced in each suit a separate decree.</span>  It cannot be denied that the more common and recent form of such decree seems (prima facie, at all events) favourable to the contention of the respondents.  In each suit there was (as I have said) a separate decree, declaring that both ships were in fault; “and that the damage arising therefrom ought to  be borne equally” by the owners of both ships; and afterwards proceeding to “condemn” the defendants and their bail in a moiety of the damages proceeded for by the plaintiffs; and referring it to the Registrar, assisted by merchants, to assess the amount of such damages (with or without costs, as the Court might think fit).  <span class="font-weight-bold">Under every such decree, the Registrar made a report, finding that a moiety of the damages sustained by the plaintiffs amounted to so much, and (ordinarily) computing interest thereon from the date of the decree.  A moiety of the damages sustained by the other party (if plaintiff in a cross suit) was in like manner found (also with interest) sometimes by the same, and sometimes by a separate report.  It does not appear that, on the face of the reports made under this form of decree, any balance was ever struck</span> ; but, unless the parties, by a voluntary settlement, rendered further resort to the Court unnecessary, <span class="font-weight-bold">the proper course would have been for that plaintiff, to whom a balance was due, to apply to the Court for a monition requiring the other party to pay it.</span> <span class="font-weight-bold">A monition was seldom issued in practice ; indeed, Mr. Butt, in his argument for the respondents, stated that he had been unable to find one on the records of the Court.  </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-underline">But there cannot, I think, be any doubt, that, if issued, it would have been in favour of one plaintiff only and that for the balance representing one moiety of the excess of the aggregate loss beyond equality</span><span class="font-weight-bold">, and the interest thereon, and the costs (if any) to which the plaintiff might be entitled. </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">[emphasis added in bold, added emphasis in bold underline]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 Based on Lord Selborne L.C.’s summary above of the history behind the single liability principle and how it operated, the critical points to note are that the single liability principle was, first, borne out of the <span class="font-italic">procedure</span> applied in the English Court of Admiralty dating back to at least the 1800s. Second and more importantly, the application of the single liability principle clearly presupposed that both ships were at fault, both ships suffered damage and <span class="font-italic">both</span> shipowners advanced claims and counterclaims or cross-claims against each other that were valid (<span class="font-italic">ie,</span> <span class="font-italic">that were </span><span class="font-italic">not time-barred</span>), be it in one suit or separate but conjoined suits. It was in this context that separate decrees on liability were issued in favour of each shipowner and, if a “monition” was issued by the Admiralty Registrar, it would be issued in favour of one party only “for the balance representing one moiety of the excess of the aggregate beyond equality.” </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 In my judgment, this is the true essence of the single liability principle. It is in reality, a rule of procedure that has its origins in the “ancient rule of the Admiralty” (<span class="font-italic">per</span> Lord Selborne L.C. at 804). The key point is that the single liability principle as decided and applied in <span class="font-italic">The Khedive</span> presupposes the existence of valid or maintainable claims <span class="font-italic">and</span> cross-claims or counterclaims. This is so that the court could then, following the procedure in the Court of Admiralty, pronounce a single judgment (or “monition”) in favour of the net receiving party for a moiety of its damage beyond the point of equality. It should be noted that on the facts of <span class="font-italic">The Khedive</span>, neither the claim of the <span class="font-italic">Voorwaarts</span> nor the counterclaim of the <span class="font-italic">Khedive</span> was time-barred.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 My conclusion above is further supported by Lord Selborne L.C.’s speech at 806 – 807:  </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">These authorities are, I think, sufficient to prove that the course of the Court of Admiralty has been to use <span class="font-weight-bold">its powers over its own procedure</span>, so as, <span class="font-weight-bold font-underline">either at the hearing of a cross suit after decree and report in the original suit, or at the hearing </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-underline">of two conjoined suits,</span> or in that later stage at which a monition might be applied for, <span class="font-weight-bold">to bring about the same result as if the whole controversy between the owners of the two ships had been, from the first dealt with in one proceeding</span>; and this, not by way of set-off, but in a manner which can only be explained as resulting from the view which that Court took of the principle, and the just consequences, of its own rule. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added in bold and bold underline]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 In my view, the logical corollary of the passage quoted above is that the single liability principle as applied in <span class="font-italic">The Khedive </span>requires that both the claim and the cross-claim (or counterclaim) are maintainable and not time-barred. This being the case, with respect, I do not think that a shipowner who expects to be the net payor can instead of issuing proceedings in time, sit back, do nothing and rely on the single liability principle to defend himself simply because “[h]e is not bringing proceedings” (<span class="font-italic">Sea Echo </span>at [78] – [79] as reproduced above at [18]). The single liability principle, as a procedural rule, does not, in my view, apply or operate in a case where s 8 MCA 1911 is applicable to prevent the defendant from bringing or maintaining proceedings (including a counterclaim) in the first place. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 I note that in arriving at his view (see [18] above), Teare J derived support from the decision of Dr Lushington in <span class="font-italic">The Seringapatam </span>(1848) 3 Wm Rob 38 (“<span class="font-italic">The Seringapatam</span>”), a decision which was also cited by Lord Selborne L.C. and Lord Blackburn in <span class="font-italic">The Khedive</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at 806 and 821 respectively. Mr Govin also relied on <span class="font-italic">The Seringapatam </span>to support his argument that the application of the single liability principle did not require a valid or subsisting counterclaim.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 With respect, I do not think <span class="font-italic">The Seringapatam </span>furthers the analysis. It is also a case that is distinguishable on its facts. The decision itself appears to have involved a scenario where there were, in fact, valid and maintainable claims and cross-claims although the latter was subsequently discontinued.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 <span class="font-italic">The Seringapatam</span> involved somewhat peculiar circumstances. A collision occurred in England between a foreign owned vessel, the <span class="font-italic">Harriet </span>and a British ship, the <span class="font-italic">Seringapatam. </span>The owners of the <span class="font-italic">Harriet </span>brought an action for damage in the English Admiralty Court and the owners of the <span class="font-italic">Seringapatam </span>brought a cross-action against them. As the <span class="font-italic">Harriet</span> had sunk following the collision and its owners were foreigners, the owners of the <span class="font-italic">Seringapatam</span> could not serve the writ in their cross-action. The owners of the <span class="font-italic">Seringapatam</span> thus applied to stay the action brought by the owners of the <span class="font-italic">Harriet</span> until the latter furnished bail in the cross-action brought by the <span class="font-italic">Seringapatam</span> against the <span class="font-italic">Harriet</span> (an application not dissimilar to that permitted under O 70 r 27 of the ROC). The application to stay the <span class="font-italic">Harriet</span>’s action was dismissed by Dr Lushington. Subsequently, the owners of the <span class="font-italic">Seringapatam</span> discontinued their cross-action against the owners of the <span class="font-italic">Harriet </span>because the former were unable to compel the latter to enter an appearance in the cross-action and had no security for their claim. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 It was in those unusual circumstances that the court was faced with a motion by the owners of the <span class="font-italic">Seringapatam</span> for an order that the court, in assessing the amount of damage due to the owners of the <span class="font-italic">Harriet</span>, deduct a moiety of the damage sustained by the <span class="font-italic">Seringapatam</span>. Dr Lushington dismissed the motion holding that, the cross-action having been discontinued, the owner of the <span class="font-italic">Seringapatam</span> could not have the benefit of a decree which, in point of fact, had never been pronounced in their favour. However, to prevent injustice, the court did not permit the owners of the <span class="font-italic">Harriet</span> to recover its damages <span class="font-italic">unless</span> they <span class="font-italic">submitted</span> to the deduction of a moiety of the damage sustained by the owners of the <span class="font-italic">Seringapatam</span>.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 It is clear from the facts summarised above that the court’s sympathy was with the owners of the<span class="font-italic"> Seringapatam</span> (even though the application by its owners was disallowed). It remained true that the owners of the <span class="font-italic">Seringapatam </span>had been compelled to abandon their cross-action. However, leaving that aside, it is material to note from the case report that the owners of the <span class="font-italic">Seringapatam</span> <span class="font-italic">had</span> commenced their cross-action before any time-bar had set in. There is also no suggestion in the case report that the cross-claim of the <span class="font-italic">Seringapatam</span> was time-barred, even at the time of Dr Lushington’s decision on their application. <span class="font-italic">The Seringapatam</span> is thus not an authority that supports the defendant’s argument that the single liability principle would apply even when the claim, cross-claim and/or counterclaim of one of the shipowners is barred by the limitation of time.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 As I have explained above at [21], <span class="font-italic">Sea Echo</span> was also not, strictly speaking, a case that involved a time-barred counterclaim.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 Mr Govin also contended that the essence of the single liability principle is based on equity and fairness in that one party should not be made to pay more than it should when the other party was also partly to blame for the collision.

As explained above at [39], the single liability principle was borne out of a procedure that was applied in the English Court of Admiralty, which procedure in turn operates on the premise that both shipowners’ claims and counterclaims or cross-claims are not time-barred. If the defendant’s argument on fairness and equity was correct, it would, as Ms Ang submitted, effectively render s 8 MCA 1911 otiose or nugatory in a great many cases where a net paying defendant fails to mount its counterclaim in time.

In <span class="font-italic">The Khedive, </span>Lord Selborne L.C. made this explicit when he stated as follows (at 806 – 807): </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">These authorities are, I think, sufficient to prove that the course of the Court of Admiralty has been to use its powers over its own procedure, so as, either at the hearing of a cross suit after decree and report in the original suit, or at the hearing of two conjoined suits, or in that later stage at which a monition might be applied for, to bring about the same result as if the whole controversy between the owners of the two ships had been, from the first dealt with in one proceeding; and this, <span class="font-weight-bold">not by way of set-off,</span> but in a manner which can only be explained as resulting from the view which that Court took of the principle, and the just consequences, of its own rule. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 <span class="font-italic">The</span> <span class="font-italic">Tojo Maru </span>[1970] P. 21, a case decided almost a century later, involved a claim in the context of a salvage operation carried out negligently. In gist, salvors, in the course of their attempts to salvage the <span class="font-italic">Tojo Maru, </span>negligently caused a fire and explosion onboard the <span class="font-italic">Tojo Maru</span> which resulted in considerable damage to the ship. The salvors commenced arbitration proceedings against the owners for their claim for salvage remuneration. The owners of the <span class="font-italic">Tojo Maru</span> sought to (a) counterclaim against the salvors for causing damage to their ship, and (b) deny the salvors their salvage remuneration by setting it off against the damage suffered by the ship. Amongst others, the owners stated that if the salvors were liable in damages on the owners’ counterclaim, there should be a set-off in respect of the owners’ damages and the salvage reward prior to the salvors limiting their liability. The owners cited the single liability principle in <span class="font-italic">The Khedive</span> in support of their contention. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 At first instance, Wilmer LJ (at 48C – 48D) concluded that if a “cross-claim for damages is statute barred under the Limitation Acts, <span class="font-italic">there would be nothing to set-</span><span class="font-italic">off</span>” and later (at 49A) “[i]t will be seen, therefore, that <span class="font-italic">The Khedive …</span><span class="font-italic"> was not a case of true set-off at all</span>, as was made abundantly clear in the speech of Lord Selborne L.C.” [emphasis added]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 While the English Court of Appeal subsequently reversed Wilmer LJ’s decision and remitted the case back to the arbitrator, this was on unrelated grounds. On the question of whether the single liability principle applied in respect of a claim for salvage remuneration and a claim for damage to a ship, the court agreed, <span class="font-italic">obiter</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>with Wilmer LJ. Salmon LJ echoed Wilmer LJ’s comments and noted that <span class="font-italic">The Khedive</span> “had nothing to do with true set-off but depended upon the old practice in the Admiralty Division relating only to collision cases” (at 75H).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 Second, while the application of the single liability principle might in most cases have the same practical <span class="font-italic">effect</span> as applying set-off, the principle in its true unadorned form is, as explained at [39], a procedural mechanism based on a rule of some antiquity originating in the English Court of Admiralty. It thus has nothing to do with set-off. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 In light of the foregoing, I disagree with Teare J’s view that “the principle in <span class="font-italic">The Khedive </span>is a form of set-off long recognised in Admiralty law” (<span class="font-italic">Sea Echo </span>at [81]). </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 In the final analysis, I respectfully disagree with the reasoning in <span class="font-italic">Sea Echo </span>(at [78]). Nonetheless, I find myself, somewhat curiously, in agreement with Teare J’s ultimate conclusion<span class="font-italic"> </span>(at [79]) that the application of the single liability principle is not affected by the operation of s 190 of the UK Merchant Shipping Act 1995 (or in the case of Singapore, s 8 MCA 1911).  However, I arrive at this conclusion for quite different reasons. In my judgment, the single liability principle as laid down in <span class="font-italic">The Khedive </span>already presupposes that both the claim and cross-claim or counterclaim are not time-barred. Thus, a defendant shipowner who is a net payor would only be able to rely on the single liability principle to reduce its liability <span class="font-italic">if</span> its counterclaim is not otherwise time-barred (<span class="font-italic">ie,</span> the counterclaim is “maintainable” under s 8 MCA 1911).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 To that extent and in that context, s 8 MCA 1911 does not add anything to the single liability principle or modify it in any way. If the defendant’s counterclaim is time-barred under s 8 MCA 1911, the single liability principle, quite simply, does not apply.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 SUM 2585 requires me to determine the Question (see [4] above). For the foregoing reasons, I determine the Question by answering it in the negative. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 I will hear the parties on costs separately. </div><table class="table table-sm table-borderless"><tbody><tr><td><div class="txt-body text-left">S Mohan <br/>Judicial Commissioner </div></td></tr></tbody></table><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Vivian Ang Hui Ming, Ho Pey Yan and Douglas Lok Bao Guang (Allen &amp; Gledhill LLP) for the first and second plaintiffs;</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">R Govin and Tan Hui Tsing (Gurbani &amp; Co LLC) for the defendant.</div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
