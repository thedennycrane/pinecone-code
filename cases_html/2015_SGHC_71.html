<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       On
12 January 2015, the plaintiff, Tan Poh Chung (“Tan”), filed an application
to wind up the defendant, Polylectric Engineering Pte Ltd (“the Company”),
on the just and equitable ground and to appoint Mr Leow Quek Shiong
(“Mr Leow”) of BDO LLP as the liquidator of the Company. Tan holds
50% of the shares in the Company. He is also one of four directors
of the Company.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The
application was resisted by Toong Chuen Piew (“Toong”) and Litemax
Pte Ltd (“Litemax”). Toong holds the other 50% of the shares in the
Company and is also one of the four directors of the Company. Litemax is
Toong’s company. It is a judgment creditor of the Company.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       The
other two directors of the Company are the wives of Tan and Toong.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       On
6 February 2015, I made an order to wind up the Company and to appoint
Mr Leow as liquidator of the Company. Toong has filed an appeal against
my decision to the Court of Appeal. I set out below the reasons
for my decision.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Issue</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       The
main issue was whether the court should have ordered the Company
to be wound up.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Background</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       According
to Tan, the relationship between Toong and him had deteriorated
in recent years. Accordingly, both Toong and he agreed to wind up
the business of the Company as a practical measure and to distribute
its assets. They did so by entering into an agreement called the “Agreement
for closing of Polylectric Engineering Pte Ltd” dated 11 February
2014 (“the Closing Agreement”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       Under
the Closing Agreement, it was agreed that the Company would cease
operations and transfer existing and new jobs to other companies, <em>ie</em>, Pohlect Pte Ltd (“Pohlect”) owned
by Tan and Litemax owned by Toong. I need not elaborate on the other
terms of the Closing Agreement for the time being.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       On
or around 23 July 2014, Litemax commenced legal proceedings in Suit
No 781 of 2014 (“Suit 781/2014”) to claim a debt of $1,001,983.16 arising
from two unpaid invoices issued by Litemax to the Company for work
done by Litemax for the Company.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       On
31 July 2014, Tan filed Originating Summons No 743 of 2014 (“OS
743/2014”) for various reliefs, including the resolution of the
issue of appointment of solicitors to act on behalf of the Company
in Suit 781/2014, for Tan to be joined as a defendant in that suit,
and for a stay of that suit pending the resolution of OS 743/2014.
According to Toong, OS 743/2014 was dismissed by Vinodh Coomaraswamy
J on 2 October 2014 on the basis that it was procedurally flawed
and that the appropriate procedure was for Tan to file an application
under the Companies Act in Suit 781/2014 itself.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     On
3 October 2014, Litemax obtained judgment in default of appearance
against the Company in Suit 781/2014 (“the Litemax Judgment”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     On
9 October 2014, Tan applied by way of Summons No 5047 of 2014 (“Summons
5047/2014”) for various reliefs including an order for Tan to be added
as a defendant in Suit 781/2014. However, his application was dismissed
on 8 January 2015 by an Assistant Registrar (“AR”). According to Toong,
the decision was based on procedural missteps by Tan.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     In
the meantime, Litemax filed Summons No 5139 of 2014 on 14 October
2014 to garnish money held by a bank for the Company. The garnishee
proceedings have not been completed yet.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     After
Summons 5047/2014 was dismissed on 8 January 2015, Tan filed the
present application to wind up the Company on 12 January 2015.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The arguments and the court’s
decision</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     Tan’s
submission was that while Litemax did perform services for the Company,
he did not accept that the sum owing to Litemax was as much as that
claimed by Litemax. He was of the view that the garnishee proceedings were
an attempt by Litemax to gain an unfair advantage and that the Company
should defend the claim.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     Tan
alleged that the Company had been dormant for a year and had lost
the substratum of its business. He also alleged that in view of
the impasse between Toong and him, there was no assurance that the
affairs of the Company were being managed in an honest and diligent
manner.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     I
come now to the submissions for Toong and Litemax. I will refer
to them as one since Toong owns Litemax.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     Toong
did not dispute that the Company had been dormant for a year. Neither
did he dispute that Tan and he had wanted to wind up the business
of the Company as a practical measure and to distribute its assets. It
was not disputed that in such circumstances, a court could, and
should, order a winding up of a company under the just and equitable
ground. However, Toong’s position was that the present winding up
proceedings were used for collateral purposes.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     Toong
submitted that the real reason for Tan bringing the winding up application
was to deny Litemax the fruits of its garnishee proceedings. He mentioned
how previous attempts by Tan to contest the Litemax Judgment had
failed. I have mentioned these attempts above. Toong also submitted that
instead of appealing against the AR’s decision of 8 January 2015
(see <a href="#p1_11">[11]</a> above),
which counsel for Tan had said he would do, Tan had instead filed
the winding up application. I should mention that Tan’s counsel alleged
that what he said on 8 January 2015 was that he would take instructions
about an appeal. The new solicitors of Tan had only come into the
picture recently.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     In
my view, it is not uncommon or illegitimate for a shareholder or another
creditor or the debtor itself to try and deny a creditor the fruits
of execution proceedings by filing winding up proceedings. Just
as a creditor is entitled to take such steps as it thinks fit to
obtain full payment, someone else is equally entitled to take such
steps as it thinks fit to thwart such a purpose (see <em>Re Projector SA</em> [2009] 2 SLR(R) 151 at <a href="#p1_23">[23]</a>–<a href="#p1_25">[25]</a>). Therefore, the
filing of winding up proceedings to thwart a creditor from gaining
an advantage is not in itself an abuse of the process of the court.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     Furthermore,
since Tan was disputing the amount owing by the Company to Litemax,
it made sense for an independent and neutral party like the liquidator
to be appointed to look into Litemax’s claim. If the liquidator
was of the view that the amount claimed was valid, that would put
an end to Tan’s dispute on the amount. If the liquidator took the opposite
view, he would be entitled to take such steps as he thought fit
to challenge the Litemax Judgment. Since Toong’s position was that
Tan’s dispute was unreasonable, Toong should welcome the appointment
of the liquidator but for the fact that the order to wind up the
Company would thwart the garnishee proceedings. As stated above,
each side is entitled to advance his own interest.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     Toong
also had another reason to claim that the winding up application
was for a collateral purpose. He submitted that Tan was trying to
relieve himself from his obligations under the Closing Agreement
by presenting the winding up application. This was to the detriment
of the Company, its shareholders and its creditors (see para 35
of Toong’s opposing affidavit of 29 January 2015).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     However,
Toong did not elaborate in his opposing affidavit as to which aspect
of Tan’s obligations under the Closing Agreement that he thought
Tan was trying to renege on. Toong’s counsel said that under clause 5
of that agreement, it was agreed that one of the Company’s properties
at Woodlands Link would be sold to Tan at a certain value and another
at Woodlands Industrial Park E5 (“WIP E5”) to Litemax at another value.
However, even if the stated values meant the intended sale prices, Toong’s
counsel was unable to say that the price for the intended sale of
the property at WIP E5 to Litemax was lower than the market value
or that the intended sale of the property at Woodlands Link to Tan
was at a price higher than the market price, such that the Closing
Agreement should still be performed. Indeed, no such assertion was
made in Toong’s affidavit. Neither did Toong assert in his affidavit
that Litemax had a special need or interest for the WIP E5 property
such that Litemax should in any event have a right of first refusal
for that property. Therefore, the liquidator could still sell either
property in the open market and Litemax or any other interested
person could attempt to purchase it.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     Toong
also submitted that the Company needs to exist to complete existing
orders of its customers. He also alleged that the orders have not been
completed and the Company needs to exist to collect payment from the
customers (see para 25 of Toong’s submissions).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     There
were two separate points to this submission. First, I asked whether
any of the Company’s customers would take issue with the liquidation
of the Company since orders received by the Company were already
being performed by third parties like Pohlect and Litemax. Toong had
not identified any customer who would object.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     Secondly,
the allegation that the Company needs to exist to collect payment
did not paint an accurate picture. The Company was not being dissolved.
It was being liquidated. The liquidator would take over the collection
of payment.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     It
seemed to me that Toong himself had no good reason to oppose the winding
up beyond the fact that Litemax’s garnishee proceedings would be thwarted.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     In
the circumstances, I ordered the Company to be wound up with consequential
orders.</p>
