Two charges were brought in relation to the first incident and one charge each was brought in relation to the second and third incidents. Her evidence was largely corroborated by three other witnesses. The accused person, whose submission of no case to answer was dismissed, elected not to take the stand to give his evidence. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 Nonetheless, pointing to certain purported inconsistencies and omissions by the Complainant, such as her failure to scream for help during the incidents, the district judge (“DJ”) found that her evidence was not unusually convincing. As only the second of the three incidents was in his view corroborated by the other witnesses, the DJ only convicted the accused person for the charge pertaining to the second incident, and acquitted him of the remaining charges. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">3 Having thoroughly considered the evidence, I agree with the Prosecution that the DJ erred in arriving at his decision to acquit the accused person of the three charges. On a careful and holistic analysis of the facts, the Complainant’s evidence was not only internally and externally consistent, but it was also corroborated by witnesses. No contradictory evidence was proffered to cast doubt on the Complainant’s corroborated account, in the main because the accused person elected not to take the stand notwithstanding the mounting evidence against him. Accordingly, I convict the accused person of the charges that he was, in my judgment, wrongfully acquitted of. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">4 These are the detailed reasons for my decision.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Background facts</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">5 In 2018, the Complainant was employed as an administrative staff at [B] Pte Ltd (“the Company”). The Company was managed by two active directors, namely the accused person, Mr Tan Chee Beng (also known as “Sam” or “Samuel”, and referred to hereinafter as “the Accused”) and PW3, who each held a 10% share in the Company. The remaining 80% of the shares were held by PW4, who acted more “like an investor”.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">15 The DJ’s reasons for his decision on conviction may be found in <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v Tan Chee Beng </span>[2021] SGMC 61 (“GD”). Briefly, while the DJ found, pursuant to the testimonies of the Complainant and the other Prosecution witnesses, that there was a <span class="font-italic">prima facie </span>case made out for each charge (GD at [14]–[24]), he took the view that the Complainant’s evidence was not unusually convincing (GD at [25]). This was for the following reasons:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) First, the Complainant’s evidence was non-specific as to the dates of the alleged incidents, save for the Second Incident (GD at [27]–[29]).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Second, there was an inconsistency between the Complainant’s and PW4’s evidence. The Complainant testified that PW4 called to inform her that the Accused had mentioned that he was having an affair with her. In contrast, PW4’s evidence was that the Complainant had told him that the Accused had asked her to lie and to say that she was having an affair with the Accused (GD at [30]).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Third, the Complainant’s evidence was “unsatisfactory” as she omitted to mention that she had worked for PW4 for a period of time after she left the Company. This fact was only revealed when PW3 and PW4 confirmed that she had worked at PW4’s office after her employment was terminated by the Company (GD at [31]).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) Fourth, there were inconsistencies between the Complainant’s and PW2’s evidence as regards the location of the Third Incident. While the Complainant testified that she had pushed the Accused’s hand away when PW2 entered the cold room, PW2’s evidence was that he did not see the Complainant with the Accused in the cold room, nor did he see the Complainant exiting the cold room (GD at [32]). Further, the temperature in the cold room was about four-degree centigrade which would “require one to wear a jacket and a pair of gloves when going inside”. Yet, there was no evidence that the Complainant was wearing such attire, and thus “there could be a possibility that the [Complainant] was not in the cold room at the material time” (GD at [33]).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) Fifth, the Complainant had continued to accept car rides from the Accused after the occurrence of the First and Second Incidents. Although she explained that she had access to her phone to call for the police if the Accused “tried to be funny with her”, the DJ “did not think this was a reasonable explanation” as “given the alleged incidents, a reasonable person would not take the risk of being alone with the Accused” (GD at [34]).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(f) Sixth, while the DJ accepted that “victims of sexual crimes cannot be straightjacketed in the expectation that they must act or react in a certain manner”, he found that “there was no explanation given as to why the [Complainant] did not scream for help”. In his view, “as a mature adult, there was no reason for her not to shout for help” (GD at [36]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">16 The DJ came to the conclusion that the Complainant’s evidence was not unusually convincing even though he made certain key findings against the Accused. First, the DJ accepted that the Complainant’s failure to report the incidents immediately ought not to be considered adversely against her because “one cannot expect the [Complainant] to behave in a particular way”. In any case, the Complainant had “offered a reasonable explanation for the delay in reporting”, namely that “she believed [that] the Accused would stop the sexual harassment as he had apologi[s]ed” and “[s]he was also afraid of losing her job” (GD at [35]). Second, the DJ dismissed the submission that the Complainant had conspired with PW4 to frame the Accused as this was “not borne out in evidence” (GD at [37]). Third, the DJ concluded that the submission that “the [Complainant] had work related issue[s] with the Accused was a bare allegation without any substance” (GD at [38]). Ultimately, without benefit of the Accused’s testimony, the DJ held that the burden on him had not been discharged in respect of the allegations of conspiracy and motive.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">17 Having found that the Complainant’s evidence was not unusually convincing, the DJ proceeded to consider the corroborative evidence. In his view, only the Second Incident was corroborated by the evidence of PW2, PW3, PW4 and other contemporaneous and independent evidence (GD at [41]–[47]), and accordingly, he found that the Prosecution had proven its case for the Third Charge (relating to the Second Incident) beyond a reasonable doubt (GD at [47]). However, given that the “evidence in support of the rest of the charges was not sufficiently corroborated” and as the Complainant’s evidence was not unusually convincing, the Prosecution fell short of meeting its burden as regards the remaining three charges, and the Accused was thus acquitted of those charges (GD at [48]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">18 The Third Charge was for the offence of outrage of modesty under s 354(1) of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed) (“Penal Code”). Applying the framework in <span class="font-italic">Kunasekaran</span><span class="font-italic"> s/o Kalimuthu Somasundara v Public Prosecutor </span>[2018] 4 SLR 580, the DJ found that the Accused’s offence fell at the lower end of Band 2, and he sentenced the Accused to five months’ imprisonment: see <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v Tan Chee Beng </span>[2021] SGMC 89 (“GD (Sentencing)”) at [19] and [26].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">19 In HC/MA 9146/2021, the Prosecution appeals against the Accused’s acquittal on the three charges. In HC/MA 9236/2021, the Accused appeals against his conviction on the Third Charge and his sentence of five months’ imprisonment. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">20 In considering whether the conviction and acquittals were properly arrived at, I am mindful that an appellate court will generally be slow to disturb a trial judge’s finding of fact, especially where such findings hinge on the assessment of the credibility and veracity of witnesses: <span class="font-italic">Jagatheesan</span><span class="font-italic"> s/o Krishnasamy</span> <span class="font-italic">v Public Prosecutor </span>[2006] 4 SLR(R) 45 (“<span class="font-italic">Jagatheesan</span>”) at [34], citing <span class="font-italic">Yau</span><span class="font-italic"> Giau Beng Terence v Public Prosecutor </span>[1998] 2 SLR(R) 855 at [24]. Nonetheless, “an appellate court is in as good a position to assess the internal and external consistency of the witnesses’ evidence”: <span class="font-italic">Pram Nair v Public Prosecutor </span>[2017] 2 SLR 1015 at [55(c)]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">My decision</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Was the Complainant’s testimony “unusually convincing”? </span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The “unusually convincing” standard</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">21 I begin my assessment by focusing on the Complainant’s testimony. Such testimony <span class="font-italic">may </span>be sufficient to prove the charges against the Accused beyond a reasonable doubt. As observed by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">AOF v Public Prosecutor </span>[2012] 3 SLR 34 (“<span class="font-italic">AOF</span>”) at [111], “where no other evidence is available, a complainant’s testimony can constitute proof beyond reasonable doubt … but only when it is so ‘unusually convincing’ as to overcome any doubts that might arise from the lack of corroboration”. This “unusually convincing” standard “applies to the <span class="font-italic">uncorroborated </span>evidence of a witness in all offences (and not just sexual offences), where such evidence forms the <span class="font-italic">sole </span><span class="font-italic">basis </span>for a conviction” [emphasis added]: <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v GCK and another matter </span>[2020] 1 SLR 486 (“<span class="font-italic">GCK</span>”)<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [104].  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">22 The “unusually convincing” standard is thus applicable in <span class="font-italic">all </span>offences where the <span class="font-italic">sole </span>basis relied upon for conviction is the evidence of a witness whose evidence is uncorroborated. This frequently, but does not always, arise in the context where a sexual offence is committed behind closed doors and without the presence of other persons. In assessing whether the witness’ testimony is “unusually convincing”, the court weighs the demeanour of the witness alongside the internal and external consistencies in the witness’ testimony: <span class="font-italic">AOF </span>at [115]. In this regard, “reliance on the demeanour of witnesses <span class="font-italic">alone </span>will often be insufficient to establish an accused’s guilt beyond reasonable doubt” [emphasis in original]: <span class="font-italic">Jagatheesan</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [42]. This is because there is “the possibility of judges being deceived by adroit or plausible knaves or by apparent innocence”: <span class="font-italic">Sakthivel </span><span class="font-italic">Punithavathi v Public Prosecutor </span>[2007] 2 SLR(R) 983<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [72], citing <span class="font-italic">Ah </span><span class="font-italic">Mee v Public Prosecutor </span>[1967] 1 MLJ 220 at 223. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">23 The focus must therefore be on “an assessment of the internal consistency within the <span class="font-italic">content </span>of a witness’s testimony” and “an assessment of the external consistency between a witness’s evidence and the <span class="font-italic">extrinsic </span>evidence, which includes testing the former against the inherent probabilities and uncontroverted facts” [emphasis in original]: <span class="font-italic">GCK </span>at [137]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 This exercise of assessing whether a sole witness’s evidence is “unusually convincing” is thus a holistic one which is considered against the entire body of evidence, and in particular with regard to the conflicting evidence raised by the Prosecution and the Defence in support of their respective cases (<span class="font-italic">GCK </span>at [149(k)]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Whether an eyewitness’s uncorroborated evidence is unusually convincing (and therefore capable of discharging the Prosecution’s burden of proving the case against the accused person beyond a reasonable doubt) <span class="font-italic">requires an assessment of the internal and external</span><span class="font-italic"> consistencies of the eyewitness’s account, and of any other evidence that the court is bound to consider, which includes the Defence’s case and the evidence adduced by the accused person (or the lack thereof).</span> A finding must be made as to the relevant facts before the court directs itself to the ultimate inquiry of whether the Prosecution’s case has been proved beyond a reasonable doubt. [emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 With these principles in mind, I turn to consider the Complainant’s evidence in greater detail.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The Complainant’s testimony</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The First Incident</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 According to the Complainant, the Accused “started to be very touchy” in August 2018.

The Accused asked if the Complainant had told PW4 “about this”, to which the Complainant denied, and the Accused thus theorised that it was Rizal who had told PW4 what had happened.

She recounted how the incidents occurred and gave detailed particulars. She also adequately accounted for the gap in time between the Second and Third Incident, which she explained was because she had confronted the Accused by way of the Message after the Second Incident following the advice of her colleagues, PW2 and Rizal. In addition, she also explained why she did not lodge a police report at that point in time, namely, because she was afraid of losing her job and the Accused had apologised after he was confronted. She only decided to report the Accused after the Third Incident in January 2019 because of a combination of factors, namely: (a) the fact that he had repeated his errant conduct; (b) PW4’s (unexpected) urging and support; and (c) her anger when the Accused informed her that he had denied to PW4 that anything was going on and because he had allegedly told PW4 that they were having an affair. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 As the Prosecution submitted, the Complainant was able to accurately describe the environment within which each incident took place. She was able to describe where the Accused and herself were positioned in relation to each other during each of the three incidents. Crucially, she was also able to describe the Accused’s actions during each incident. She recounted clearly and consistently how the Accused had engaged with her and touched her across the various incidents.

Indeed, she made concessions, such as her inability to remember when exactly the First Incident occurred, and readily explained the precise degree of intrusion, even if doing so minimised the Accused’s culpability.

</div> The timing and location of the report is entirely consistent with the Complainant’s evidence that she finally resolved to make the report after the Third Incident in January 2019, and that she had made her police report at night, after dinner with PW4, at a police station in Jurong. The details in her brief report also cohere with her testimony of the incidents, <span class="font-italic">ie</span><span class="font-italic">, </span>that the First and Second Incidents occurred sometime between August and September 2018, while the Third Incident occurred in January 2019. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 Having combed through the entirety of the Complainant’s testimony, I am satisfied that her testimony was both internally and externally consistent with the contemporaneous documentary evidence available. In addition, I note that while the DJ expressed that he had “considered the demeanour of [the Complainant]”, no express findings were made; had such a finding been made, I would have been slow to overturn it because as an appellate court which has neither seen nor heard the witness, I am in a less advantageous position as compared to the DJ who had the benefit of hearing the evidence of the Complainant and observing her demeanour: <span class="font-italic">GBR v Public Prosecutor and another appeal </span>[2018] 3 SLR 1048 (“<span class="font-italic">GBR</span>”) at [18].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 Furthermore, as I will explore in greater detail below, the Complainant’s testimony was also materially consistent with the evidence given by the other Prosecution witnesses, PW2, PW3 and PW4 (see [67]–[105] below). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 Absent any adverse findings pertaining to her demeanour and given the internal and external consistency of the Complainant’s testimony, I am satisfied that her testimony was unusually convincing, in the sense that it is sufficient to establish the charges against the Accused beyond a reasonable doubt. Nonetheless, I am cognisant of the fact that “[t]he finding that a complainant’s testimony is unusually convincing does not automatically entail a guilty verdict.

Like the Complainant:</div><div class="mb-3"><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(a) he said that he had learned of the incidents from Rizal; </div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(b) he confirmed that he had asked her about the incidents during the dinner, although they did not go into the specifics of what the Accused had done; </div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(c) he explained that the police report had been made at a police station in the Jurong area after the Complainant finished work, and that they had dinner before making the report; and</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(d) he testified that he had told her to take two weeks’ unpaid leave, and this was precisely the period of absence that she took.</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">85 Aside from the material consistency lending further credibility to the Complainant’s version of events, PW4’s evidence also bolstered her evidence as he added to the body of evidence through his recounting of the Important Conversation which I have set out in full at [79] above. Read as a whole, the Important Conversation reads like a partial confession by the Accused. While they did not delve into the details of the incidents, the Accused did not reject PW4’s assertion that he had touched the Complainant. Instead, he sought to trivialise his behaviour as a “joke”. He also attempted to justify it by placing the blame on the Complainant, suggesting that it was her fault for having dressed “so sex[il]y and seducing[ly]”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">86 The messages detailed at [81]–[83] above are also wholly consistent with the reason that PW3 had given for her termination, namely that she had taken two weeks’ unpaid leave which was not approved by the Company. This also accorded with the Complainant’s understanding that she had been terminated for her two-week absence. This can be seen from her testimony both during her examination-in-chief and under cross-examination:

In her evidence, PW3 had told her that Friday would be her last day, meaning that her employment with the Company likely ended on 15 February 2019. A few days later, and as per the messages sent by PW4, she then reached out to PW4 to inform him of her termination, and this was then reflected in his messages to the Accused and PW3 on 21 February 2019 (see [81]–[83] above). As such, aside from being consistent with the reasons provided by the Complainant for her termination, PW4’s messages further corroborate the timeframe pertaining to the termination of her employment, as his messages were indeed sent shortly <span class="font-italic">after </span>she had been terminated by the Company.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Inconsistencies in evidence</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">88 However, the Defence pointed to various inconsistencies between the Complainant’s evidence and that of the Prosecution witnesses.

Both the Complainant and PW4 were clear that the topic of the Accused and the Complainant allegedly having an affair had come up in a conversation between them. Either one of them might have forgotten the exact details of what had transpired during their conversation, but both were aware that an alleged “affair” was used to deflect any blame on the Accused’s part for his misconduct. Also, <span class="font-italic">a</span><span class="font-italic">fter </span>discussions about this alleged affair, the Complainant proceeded to make the report against the Accused, raising doubts as to the possibility of any such alleged affair. Importantly, what is clear is that neither considered such an “affair” to be legitimate, and this much was shown by PW4 through his incendiary messages to PW3 and the Accused after the Complainant’s employment was terminated, during which he described her as a victim of a “molest case”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">91 Second, the Complainant’s evidence was that the dinner with PW4 and Rizal had taken place after the Third Incident, and one or two days before she made the police report.

</div> PW2’s evidence, on the other hand, was that that she had told him that the Accused “had started his nonsense again” at the smoking area of the workplace. He also testified that on the day she told him about the Third Incident, he never saw her in the cold room with the Accused, nor did he see her coming out of the cold room.

Both had testified that <span class="font-italic">after</span> the Company moved premises to [D] Road in early 2019, the Complainant had informed PW2 that the Accused “start[ed] his nonsense again”.

</div> Viewed as such, it is clear that PW2 understood the incident of the Accused “starting his nonsense again” as following a sequence of events whereby the Accused had attempted to make previous inappropriate contact with the Complainant. This is the material fact, and whether or not the Complainant had informed him of such “nonsense” in the cold room or in the smoking area is immaterial to the elements of the charge relating to the Third Incident. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">96 Indeed, due regard must be given to the passage of time, which could have affected PW2’s recollection of how he came to learn of the Third Incident. As PW2 explained, he was in the cold room “[m]ost of the time”, and he had also seen the Complainant and the Accused in the cold room together before.

</div> As such, it was entirely plausible for the Complainant to have relayed the incident to PW2 in the cold room, where he was most of the time, although by the time of trial, PW2 could not remember seeing her go into the cold room. Strikingly, both the Complainant and PW2 described the incident as the Accused “starting his nonsense again”, and in such circumstances, I do not see how any inconsistencies as regards the exact location in which such information was relayed goes towards impugning the Complainant’s credibility.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">97 In all, excessive weight was placed by the DJ and the Defence on these inconsistencies, which were immaterial details that the witnesses could not have been expected to recite with exactitude years after the incidents had taken place. Fundamentally, none of the above inconsistencies related to any elements of the four charges, and the evidence of the witnesses on material aspects remained the same. It bears remembering at this juncture that the Complainant had given a largely internally consistent testimony that was externally consistent and corroborated in material ways by PW2, PW3, and PW4. In this light, the above inconsistencies do little to discredit the corroborated version of events presented by the Prosecution’s witness, and I do not accept that such inconsistencies are sufficient to cast a reasonable doubt on the Prosecution’s case. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Summary of corroborative evidence</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">98  In summary, the testimonies and evidence of PW2, PW3, and PW4 were consistent with the Complainant’s account of the incidents. In particular, PW2’s version of events was corroborative as regards the three separate incidents, which accorded with the Complainant’s account that she had relayed all three incidents to PW2. The timeframe of events provided by PW2, namely that the First Incident occurred before the Second Incident, and that the Third Incident occurred in January 2019, is also consistent with the Complainant’s account of the events. Additional credit should also be given to PW2’s account because the Complainant relayed each incident to him shortly or immediately after each incident. The First and Second Incidents were relayed to him after she ran out of the office crying immediately following the Second Incident (the First Incident having occurred within a month prior), while the Third Incident was relayed to him on the day it happened.

</div> With respect, I was unable to agree with the DJ’s assessment that PW2’s account as to the sequence of the incidents was inconsistent (see GD at [28]–[29]). The DJ noted that during cross-examination, PW2 had answered that the Complainant did not tell him about the First Incident on the day that it had happened but on a later day. However, during re-examination, when asked whether the Complainant had informed him about the First Incident “on the same day it happened or some other day”, PW2 replied that “[i]t was on the same day that she came out of the office”. Based on these two exchanges, the DJ assessed that PW2 had been unsure of the First Incident and the sequence of the incidents. In my view, PW2’s evidence given during cross-examination and re-examination was consistent. Read in the context of PW2’s evidence as a whole, the “later day” which he referred to during cross-examination on which the Complainant had informed him about the First Incident was the day that he had seen her come out of the office crying following the Second Incident.

Indeed, as per PW2’s and the Complainant’s evidence, the Complainant had approached PW3 at PW2’s and Rizal’s suggestion. In PW2’s words, after he had heard about the Second Incident, he “just advised her to tell [PW3] to make the report”.

It was also entirely consistent with the objective evidence, namely PW4’s stern messages to PW3 and the Accused shortly after he found out that the Complainant had been terminated, wherein PW4 reflected the injustice that he felt for the Complainant, who he described as a “victim” of a “molest issue” by one of the Company’s directors. It is undisputed that there were only three directors in the Company, namely PW4, PW3, and the Accused.

</div> No complaint has been made by the Complainant against PW3 and PW4, and so PW4’s messages were clearly directed at the Accused’s actions. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">101 Furthermore, while PW4 did not know about the specificities of the incidents as he considered them to be too sensitive to ask, what is clear is that he had learned of the incidents from Rizal. This too was the Complainant’s evidence. Both were also aligned as they relayed that it was at the dinner where PW4 first expressed support for the Complainant and told her he would accompany her to make a report if she decided to do so. Also, both testified that it was PW4 who accompanied the Complainant to make the police report against the Accused, and that PW4 asked her to take two weeks’ unpaid leave thereafter. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">102 To add, PW4’s evidence is that sometime after he had dinner with the Complainant and Rizal, he confronted the Accused, and this culminated in the Important Conversation. Crucially, at the time of the confrontation, the Complainant had <span class="font-italic">not </span>made the police report against the Accused. Aside from the contents of that Important Conversation, it is also relevant to note that the Complainant had herself testified that sometime after her dinner with PW4, but <span class="font-italic">before </span>she made her report, the Accused had asked to speak to her. The contents of the conversation are set out at [45]–[46] above. In brief, during the conversation, the Accused had asked the Complainant if she had spoken to PW4, because PW4 had spoken to the Accused. The Complainant denied, and subsequently asked the Accused what he had told PW4; the Accused relayed that he denied that anything had occurred between himself and the Complainant, and this was one of the factors that contributed to the Complainant’s eventual decision to make the report against the Accused, which she did shortly thereafter. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">103 Their accounts of their <span class="font-italic">separate </span>confrontations with the Accused add weight to the version of events provided by the Complainant. Both confrontations happened shortly <span class="font-italic">before </span>the making of the police report, but <span class="font-italic">after </span>the dinner between PW4, the Complainant and Rizal. It would, in my view, have required a significant degree of co-ordination and pre-planning for the Complainant and PW4 to have concocted their version of events such that while they spoke of separate confrontations <span class="font-italic">vis-à-vis </span>the Accused, such events nonetheless cohered with the timeframe furnished by the Complainant, and with the objective evidence that cannot be shifted, such as the date that the police report was made. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">104 Viewed holistically, the Complainant’s version of events and account of the incidents were well corroborated by the witnesses, and they go towards buttressing her credibility by showing that her testimony in court was consistent with her previous statements, in particular her account of the events that were relayed to PW2 shortly after each incident. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">105 Seen alongside the Complainant’s unusually convincing testimony, I am satisfied that the evidence presented by the Prosecution is sufficient on its own to meet the standard of proof beyond a reasonable doubt for each of the four charges against the Accused.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">“Issues” with the Prosecution’s case</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">106 Faced with the entire gamut of evidence that presented a coherent and consistent story by a Complainant who had given an unusually convincing account that was also consistent with and well corroborated by other witnesses, the Accused elected to remain silent. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">107 Instead, he resorted to pointing out alleged issues with the Prosecution’s case to support his acquittal. Apart from the purported inconsistencies in evidence between the Complainant and the Prosecution witnesses’ testimonies discussed above at [88]–[97], the DJ identified some further issues with the Prosecution’s case before coming to the conclusion that the Complainant’s evidence was not “unusually convincing”. Having found as such, he only convicted the Accused on the Third Charge (pertaining to the Second Incident) because in his view, only the Second Incident was corroborated. I have explained in my judgment why, on a careful assessment of the evidence and testimonies proffered, the Complainant’s testimony was not only unusually convincing, but also well corroborated. Nonetheless, I proceed to consider whether any of the alleged issues suffice to cast a reasonable doubt on the Prosecution’s case.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Belated amendments to the charges </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">108 First, the Defence submits that the Complainant’s evidence was “rife with omissions and both internal and external consistencies”.

</div>
</div>
</div> This was allegedly because the Third Charge had been amended a few days before trial, while the First, Second and Fourth Charges were amended after the Prosecution’s witnesses had each given their evidence. The insinuation was that the Complainant’s testimony at trial differed from her evidence provided to the authorities before trial, which would have formed the basis of original pre-amendment charges. As such, the Complainant’s evidence ought not to be regarded as credible.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">109 As a preliminary point, I observe that the amendment of charges at the close of the Prosecution’s case does not <span class="font-italic">per se </span>undermine a complainant’s testimony. As the Court of Appeal observed in <span class="font-italic">Tay Wee </span><span class="font-italic">Kiat and another v Public Prosecutor and another appeal </span>[2018] 4 SLR 1315 (“<span class="font-italic">Tay Wee </span><span class="font-italic">Kiat</span>”)<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [21], “[t]he fact that the amendments were made to the dates in the charges and the precise formulation of how the alleged incidents occurred does not by itself undermine the veracity or reliability of the victim’s evidence”. Indeed, there is often nothing insidious about the making of amendments to charges. As Kan Ting Chiu SJ observed in <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v Mohd </span><span class="font-italic">Ariffan bin Mohd Hassan </span>[2017] SGHC 81 at [4], “[c]harges are usually revised to contain better particulars as more information become available”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">110 This is demonstrated in the case of <span class="font-italic">Lee Kwang Peng</span>. There, the offender, a taekwondo instructor, was alleged to have outraged the modesty of three of his male teenage students. However, the original charges were amended at the close of the Prosecution’s case as “it was apparent that the charges framed against the appellant … did not correspond with evidence given by the Prosecution’s witness” (at [2]). For instance, one of the dates in the charges concerning the first complainant was amended from February 1995 to June 1995, as it emerged during trial that he did not meet the offender before May 1995. The amended charge also amended the words “<span class="font-italic">touching</span> his penis” to “<span class="font-italic">fondling</span> his penis”. Nonetheless, the district judge convicted the offender of all six amended charges, which conviction was upheld on appeal as the complainants’ evidence had been found to be unusually convincing (at [75]–[76]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">111 Similarly, in <span class="font-italic">Tay Wee </span><span class="font-italic">Kiat, </span>the Prosecution amended the charges before and during trial, but at the latest during the close of the Prosecution’s case and before the Defence was called. The majority of such amendments involved replacing precise dates and times with a range of dates as well as amendments to the particulars of the assault, <span class="font-italic">eg</span><span class="font-italic">, </span>from hitting the victim on the head with a cane to slapping her face. Notwithstanding the amendments, the court gave due regard to the passage of time and the fallibility of human memory and emphasised that the “critical issue is whether the totality of the evidence suggests that [the witnesses’] evidence in respect of the material elements of the charges is untrue or unreliable” (at [21]–[22]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">112 Here, the dates and venue of the incidents were left unamended, and the only amendments pertained to the precise words used or nature of the touching (or lack thereof) by the Accused:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The First Charge was amended so that the words allegedly uttered by the Accused to the Complainant changed from “<span class="font-italic">you see </span><span class="font-italic">lah, I’m hard</span>” to saying that he had a “<span class="font-italic">hard-on</span>”. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The Second Charge was amended so that the words “by using your hand to pull her hand <span class="font-italic">to touch </span>your erected penis” were changed to “by using your hand to pull her <span class="font-italic">right </span>hand <span class="font-italic">towards </span>your erect penis”. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) The original Third Charge stated that the Accused had used his “hand to <span class="font-italic">touch [the </span><span class="font-italic">Complainant] </span>on her groin area<span class="font-italic"> </span>twice”, while the amended Third Charge stated that he had <span class="font-italic">swiped his hand </span>on her groin area twice.

Inconsistencies are inevitable since the victim … would not be able to pinpoint with exactitude the precise dates and times of the abuse, which occurred about four years before the trial”. The same applies here – the incidents occurred for brief moments and took place about two years before the trial began in November 2020. There was no contemporaneous record of what had occurred during these occasions, save that the Complainant had messaged the Accused after the Second Incident. Even then, the Message did not detail the particulars of what had transpired. In the circumstances, it is only reasonable to expect that there would be certain differences between the Complainant’s evidence before trial and on the stand. This notwithstanding, the timelines stated in the police report were entirely consistent with her testimony in court, even if she could not pinpoint precisely when the First and Third Incidents occurred. Also, regardless of whether the original or amended charges are referred to, it is clear that her evidence on matters of importance was clear and consistent – for example, while she clarified on the stand that her hand did not make contact with the Accused’s penis during the First Incident, her evidence was that he insinuated that he was having an erection, and he followed this by pulling her hand in the direction of his erect penis. This is consistent with both the original and amended charges in respect of the First Incident. I do not see how the immaterial changes to her description of the incidents serve to undermine her credibility or the consistency of her evidence – as held in <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v Singh </span><span class="font-italic">Kalpanath </span>[1995] 3 SLR(R) 158 at [60], “[n]o one can describe the same thing exactly in the same way over and over again”.

Considering her evidence that she needed a job, which was supported by PW4’s incendiary messages to PW3 and the Accused about her plight after she was terminated from her employment, I accept that the Complainant had no reason to falsely implicate the Accused.

During re-examination, she attempted to explain that in her view, being “jobless” meant that she was receiving a lesser salary compared to her salary at the Company. Aside from being at odds with the plain meaning of being “jobless”, she also admitted that she was “receiving the same amount” while she was in PW4’s employ.

</div> In other words, even going by her definition, she was not “jobless” while working for PW4.

This, the DJ surmised, was at odds with the First and Second Incidents having occurred, as “a reasonable person would not take the risk of being alone with the Accused” (GD at [34]). Yet, in the same judgment, he then concluded that the Second Incident was corroborated, and convicted the Accused of the Third Charge pertaining to that incident. Aside from these inconsistent findings, it is worth reiterating, as the DJ himself observed, that “victims of sexual crimes cannot be straightjacketed in the expectation that they must act or react in a certain manner”: <span class="font-italic">GBR </span>at [20]. It is well within the realm of possibilities that the Complainant, having confronted her superior (the Accused) about the earlier incidents and received an apology, would continue to accept car rides from him, especially since she wished to retain her job and to return to a normal working relationship with him. Indeed, to reject his offers for a car ride could have soured relations under circumstances where it was nigh impossible to avoid him as the Company was a small setup with few employees. Crucially, after the First Incident, the Complainant told the Accused to stop, and he apparently ceased his inappropriate behaviour. Accordingly, she would have had reason to believe that he knew that she did not consent to him behaving in such a manner towards her and it would therefore be alright for her to continue accepting car rides from him. For the car rides that occurred after the Second Incident, she testified that the Accused had apologised and as such she assumed that he would not do anything to her again. Thus, with the intention that things would “go back to normal”, she continued to accept car rides from him. Indeed, the Accused had desisted from any inappropriate behaviour for a relatively long period of time between the Second and Third Incidents. Importantly, the Complainant did not accept any car rides <span class="font-italic">after</span> the Third Incident in January 2019, when she knew for certain that the Accused had not changed his ways. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">131 It was only at this juncture, some months later after the Third Incident which showed that the Accused’s apology was a hollow one and he would not cease his offending conduct, that the Complainant decided to make the report with the encouragement of PW4. Seen alongside her lack of motive to falsely implicate the Accused, I see no reason to disbelieve her account. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">132 For completeness, I note that there is some doubt about whether the Complainant was a single mother at the material time. Certain text messages sent by the Complainant to the Accused in January 2019 show that she was referring to an unidentified person as her “husband”.

</div> Yet, no question was put to her pertaining to her having a “husband”, as suggested by Exhibit P3. The Defence also declined to recall her after the charges were amended. Without having had an opportunity to address this point, and absent further information about this “husband”, it is not possible to view this inconsistency, raised only in submissions, as being sufficient to discredit her corroborated testimony. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">133 For the same reason, I do not give regard to the Accused’s submission that the Complainant’s failure to confide with her family and close friends somehow discredits her. This was a point of such importance that it ought to have been put to her pursuant to the rule in <span class="font-italic">Browne v Dunn </span>before it was raised in submissions: <span class="font-italic">Muhammad </span><span class="font-italic">Nabill </span>at [134].</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The Complainant’s failure to scream</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">134 I turn finally to the DJ’s finding that her failure to scream during any of the incidents impugned her credibility. As the DJ explained in his GD at [36]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… there was no explanation given as to why the [Complainant] did not scream for help. Moreover, as a mature adult, there was no reason for her not to shout for help.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">135 With respect, this was an improper finding to make, especially given the DJ’s own recognition that victims of sexual crimes cannot be straightjacketed into reacting or behaving a certain way. Indeed, in <span class="font-italic">GCK </span>at [111], the court observed that academic literature shows that at the moment of sexual assault, “a substantial number of victims may experience ‘tonic immobility’, which is an involuntary temporary state of inhibition”. It was simply not a question of whether the Complainant was “a mature adult” or not. The fact of the matter is that victims to sexual assault <span class="font-italic">regardless </span>of age, level of maturity or even gender cannot be expected to react in a uniform way. Moreover, this point about her alleged failure to scream was never raised during the course of the Complainant’s cross-examination, and hence no reason could have been given by her for why she failed to “shout for help”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">136 Furthermore, as the Prosecution submits, a scream in the circumstances of the brief contact between the Accused and Complainant would have achieved little since the Accused could have simply retracted his hand during each incident, leaving no trace of his intrusion.

</div>
</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">137 For all of the reasons given in this section, I find the alleged gaps raised by the Defence to be insufficient to cast a reasonable doubt on the Prosecution’s case. My finding of the Accused’s guilt is strengthened by his election to remain silent, which is a point to which I now turn.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The Accused’s election to remain silent</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">138 The following propositions on adverse inferences were distilled in <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v Kong </span><span class="font-italic">Hoo (Pte) Ltd and another appeal </span>[2017] 4 SLR 421 at [53]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(a) An adverse inference would properly be drawn where the “facts clearly call for an explanation which the accused ought to be in a position to give” …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(b) An adverse inference may justifiably be drawn where the circumstantial evidence is such as to demand that the accused proffer some explanation, even if the objective evidence does not itself establish guilt …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(c) In appropriate cases, the proper inference to be drawn is that of guilt itself (see the decision of the Singapore Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Took</span><span class="font-italic"> Leng How v PP </span>[2006] 2 SLR(R) 70 (“<span class="font-italic">Took Leng How</span>”) at [42]). In other cases, an adverse inference is an “additional factor to consider in assessing whether the appellant’s guilt had been established beyond reasonable doubt” which can lend weight to an assessment of the accused’s culpability and, when considered cumulatively with the other evidence, be sufficient to establish guilt (see <span class="font-italic">Oh </span><span class="font-italic">Laye Koh </span>at [17]).</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(d) An adverse inference cannot be drawn solely for the purpose of bolstering a weak case; there must be basis for a drawing of an inference and it “cannot fill in any gaps in the prosecution’s case; it cannot be used as a make-weight (see <span class="font-italic">Took Leng How </span>at [43], citing the decision of the High Court of Australia in <span class="font-italic">Weissensteiner</span><span class="font-italic"> v R </span>(1993) 178 CLR 217).</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">139 To add, the Court of Appeal has observed that “[w]here evidence which has been given calls for an explanation which the accused alone can give, then silence on his part may lead to an inference that none is available and that the evidence is probably true”: <span class="font-italic">Took Leng How </span><span class="font-italic">v Public Prosecutor </span>[2006] 2 SLR(R) 70 at [43], citing <span class="font-italic">Weissensteiner</span><span class="font-italic"> v R </span>(1993) 178 CLR 217.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">140 As I have explained in detail above, the Accused was faced with an internally and externally consistent testimony by the Complainant which detailed all aspects of the three incidents. This testimony was corroborated by the three other witnesses called by the Prosecution, although none of them were present to witness any of the incidents first-hand. Such mounting evidence spoke with one voice, <span class="font-italic">ie</span><span class="font-italic">, </span>that the incidents occurred in the way the Complainant described, as recounted to several other persons, most importantly PW2. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">141 Such an account plainly called for an explanation from the Accused, who was the only other person aside from the Complainant who could have been present during the incidents. Thus, <span class="font-italic">only the Accused could</span><span class="font-italic"> give an alternate account of what transpired</span>, or if his evidence was that nothing occurred, to give evidence as such. He elected instead to not give his evidence. In fact, the Accused also failed to respond to any of PW4’s incendiary messages wherein PW4 had described him as having molested the Complainant. Also, during the Important Conversation, the Accused did not outrightly deny having touched the Complainant even though PW4 had suggested as such (see [79] above). There is thus <span class="font-italic">no </span>evidence from the Accused or otherwise that contradicts the corroborated account of the Complainant, which lends to the inference that the Complainant accurately accounted for all material aspects of the incidents. Put simply, his election to remain silent against the weight of the evidence strengthens the finding of guilt against him.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">142 Given all of the above, I find that the DJ erred in acquitting the Accused of three of the four charges. Instead, I find that the Prosecution has proven its case in respect of each of the four charges beyond a reasonable doubt. Faced with the unusually convincing and corroborated testimony of the Complainant, the Accused’s election to remain silent fortifies such a finding of guilt. Accordingly, I set aside the acquittal on the three charges, while upholding the conviction on the Third Charge. The Accused is thus convicted of all four charges set out at [9] above.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">143 I now turn to consider the appropriate sentence for the four charges.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Sentencing considerations for the Second, Third and Fourth Charges</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">144 I begin by analysing the sentencing considerations for the Second, Third and Fourth Charges which all concern offences under s 354(1) of the Penal Code. It is undisputed that the applicable sentencing framework is that laid down in <span class="font-italic">Kunasekaran</span><span class="font-italic"> s/o Kalimuthu Somasundara v Public Prosecutor</span> [2018] 4 SLR 580 (“<span class="font-italic">Kunasekaran</span>”), which involves the following stages: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) First, the court should consider the following offence-specific factors (at [45(a)]): </div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(i) The degree of sexual exploitation. This includes considerations of the part of the victim’s body the accused touched, how the accused touched the victim, and the duration of the outrage of modesty.</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(ii) The circumstances of the offence. These include considerations of: </div><div class="Judg-4 mb-3 text-justify">(A) the presence of premeditation; </div><div class="Judg-4 mb-3 text-justify">(B) the use of force or violence;</div><div class="Judg-4 mb-3 text-justify">(C) the abuse of a position of trust;</div><div class="Judg-4 mb-3 text-justify">(D) the use of deception;</div><div class="Judg-4 mb-3 text-justify">(E) the presence of other aggravating acts accompanying the outrage of modesty; and </div><div class="Judg-4 mb-3 text-justify">(F) the exploitation of a vulnerable victim.</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(iii) The harm caused to the victim, whether physical or psychological, which would usually be set out in a victim impact statement.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Second, after considering the factors above, the court should ascertain the gravity of the offence and then place it within the appropriate band of imprisonment (at [45(b)] and [49]):</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(i) Band 1: This includes cases that do not present any, or at most one, of the offence-specific factors, and typically involves cases that involve a fleeting touch or no skin-to-skin contact, and no intrusion into the victim’s private parts. This would attract a sentence of less than five months’ imprisonment.</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(ii) Band 2: This includes cases where two or more of the offence-specific factors present themselves. The lower end of the band involves cases where the private parts of the victim are intruded, but there is no skin-to-skin contact. The higher end of the band involves cases where there is skin-to-skin contact with the victim’s private parts. It would also involve cases where there was the use of deception. This would attract a sentence of five to 15 months’ imprisonment.</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(iii) Band 3: This includes cases where numerous offence-specific factors present themselves, especially factors such as the exploitation of a particularly vulnerable victim, a serious abuse of a position of trust, and/or the use of violence or force on the victim. This would attract a sentence of 15 to 24 months’ imprisonment.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Finally, the court should consider the offender-specific aggravating and mitigating factors, such as the number of charges taken into consideration, the lack of remorse, relevant antecedents demonstrating recalcitrance, a timeous plea of guilt, or the presence of a mental disorder or intellectual disability on the part of the accused that relates to the offence (at [45(c)]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">145 As there are a number of common offence-specific and offender-specific aggravating factors applicable to the Second, Third and Fourth Charges, I will begin by discussing them.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Abuse of position of trust  </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">146 Both parties are in agreement that the main common aggravating factor amongst the charges is the Accused’s abuse of position as the Complainant’s superior at work, having committed the offences in the workplace environment during office hours.

</div> I make two observations. First, in my view, <span class="font-italic">Mohd </span><span class="font-italic">Taufik</span> did not go so far as to establish that this factor would be particularly aggravating where the victim in question has little mobility and choice in his or her workplace and superiors. The High Court merely highlighted that deterrence was particularly apposite in such situations contributing to the reason for finding that the offender’s abuse of position was an aggravating factor. Second, while not a national serviceman like the victim in <span class="font-italic">Mohd </span><span class="font-italic">Taufik</span>, the Complainant was financially dependent on her job as a source of income and understandably fearful of losing it. Indeed, the Complainant did in fact delay lodging a police report against the Accused for this very reason (see [129]–[130] above).

</div>
</div>
</div> In <span class="font-italic">Mohd </span><span class="font-italic">Taufik</span>, the High Court observed that the abuse of the offender’s position of trust should be regarded as an aggravating factor given the “difficulty of detection of such offences committed in the workplace, where the subordinates may be wary of speaking out against such untoward conduct of their superior” (at [101]). This reason is similarly apposite in the present case. I thus agree with the Prosecution that this attracted considerations of deterrence.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Psychological harm </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">148 Another common offence-specific aggravating factor is the harm suffered by the Complainant arising out of the offences. As identified at [125], in assessing the extent of harm suffered by the Complainant, the weight to be attributed to the Complainant’s VIS needs to be determined. In particular, the Complainant highlighted in her VIS that the offences had taken an emotional and psychological toll on her. She was still able to “vividly recall the way [the Accused spoke to her] in disgusting manner [<span class="font-italic">sic</span>] and [when] it progressed to inappropriate touches”.

There is also doubt as to whether the Complainant was a single mother at the material time (see [132] above). Unlike in <span class="font-italic">Kunasekaran</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [59], the Complainant’s evidence in her VIS was not substantially corroborated by other witnesses. I thus find that the VIS is not helpful in relation to the impact on the Complainant’s financial situation. I nevertheless accept that there was some psychological and emotional harm suffered by the Complainant as reflected in the VIS. Such harm was consistent with the evidence given by the Complainant in court that she was “really scared” and “very upset” such that she started crying after the Second Incident.

</div>
</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">154 In my judgment, while these assertions were not ultimately backed up by evidence, such submissions do not rise to the level of being exceptional contempt for the proceedings at trial: <span class="font-italic">Zeng </span><span class="font-italic">Guoyuan v Public Prosecutor </span>[1997] 2 SLR(R) 556 (“<span class="font-italic">Zeng </span><span class="font-italic">Guoyuan</span>”) at [37]. In <span class="font-italic">Terence Ng</span>, the Court of Appeal observed at [64(c)] that an evident lack of remorse could be drawn where the offender had conducted his defence in an extravagant and unnecessary manner, and particularly where scandalous allegations are made in respect of the victim. I accept the Accused’s submission that the present proceedings could be distinguished from <span class="font-italic">Zeng </span><span class="font-italic">Guoyuan </span>and the situation contemplated by the court in <span class="font-italic">Terence Ng</span>. In <span class="font-italic">Zeng </span><span class="font-italic">Guoyuan</span>, the court found that the appellant seemed “almost tenacious in his determination to humiliate the complainant”. For instance, he had badgered the complainant so relentlessly that she cried on two occasions. Such egregious conduct was not present in this case. Further, it is necessary for the Accused to be given some degree of latitude in the manner in which he wishes to conduct his defence: <span class="font-italic">Zeng </span><span class="font-italic">Guoyuan </span>at [37]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">155 Nonetheless, a distinct consideration from the conduct of the Accused’s defence is the lack of remorse showed by the Accused when confronted by the Complainant and PW4. As noted above, after the Second Incident, the Complainant sent the Message to the Accused to tell him that she did not feel comfortable with what he was doing, and that he should stop. The Accused then called her to tell her that he was sorry. He also asked her to delete the Message (see [33]–[34] above). This demonstrated both a lack of remorse by the Accused and an intention to conceal evidence of his wrongdoing (which he would later repeat). Further, as highlighted at [79], when confronted by PW4 after the Third Incident, the Accused sought to downplay his actions as him “just joking”, and implied that it was the Complainant’s fault for dressing in a “sexy and seducing” way. He later alleged an affair between him and the Complainant to deflect any blame for his misconduct (see [90] above). This victim-blaming and manipulative behaviour shows that the Accused consistently demonstrated no remorse for his offending. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The sentence for the Second Charge</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">156 For the Second Charge, the Prosecution submits that a sentence of three months’ imprisonment should be imposed. On the other hand, the Accused submits that a sentence of not more than three weeks’ imprisonment is appropriate. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">157 In applying the first stage of the <span class="font-italic">Kunasekaran</span> framework in relation to the Second Charge, I consider first the degree of sexual exploitation. I accept the Prosecution’s submission that the Accused’s act of pulling a hand towards his erect penis, particularly in the context of the remarks made by him, was clearly sexually exploitative in nature. However, the degree of sexual exploitation is not high, given the lack of direct contact between the Complainant’s hand and the Accused’s private part. The Complainant also testified that the Accused did not use much force when he grabbed her wrist.

</div>
</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">164 I do not agree that there is any such ambiguity as to the content of the Complainant’s testimony. In convicting the Accused on the Third Charge, I accepted that the Accused had swiped his hand on the Complainant’s groin area twice albeit without making skin-to-skin contact (see [30] above).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">165 Nevertheless, it is relevant in determining the degree of sexual exploitation to consider where exactly the Complainant had been touched. I agree with the Defence that it was not clear that the Complainant’s private parts had been touched by the Accused. The evidence led by the Prosecution merely showed that contact had been made with her groin area, as stated in the charge. As set out in <span class="font-italic">Kunasekaran</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [55], the finding that a victim’s groin area was touched does not in itself mean that her private parts have been intruded upon. This was recognised in the finding of the DJ, who considered that the Complainant had been molested in “an area proximate to the private parts” (GD (Sentencing) at [26]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">166 Looking to the circumstances of the offence, the same aggravating factors of abuse of a position of trust and a persistent pattern of offending apply equally to the Third Charge. The psychological and emotional harm caused to the Complainant was similarly a relevant consideration, as evidenced by her leaving the office and crying immediately after the commission of the offence.

</div>
</div>
</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">167 Yet another aggravating factor specific to the Third Charge was the presence of other acts committed by the Accused accompanying his act of molestation. Immediately before swiping her groin area, the Accused had gone up to the Complainant and remarked that she was wearing a dress that was “so short”. Seen in the context of the Accused’s actions, these comments were clearly intended to sexualise the Complainant. Contrary to the Accused’s submissions, this is in my view is a relevant consideration to the extent that it would have affected the level of psychological trauma experienced by the Complainant by making her feel singled out, sexualised and objectified, quite apart from the harm caused by the offence itself.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">168 Having regard to the degree of sexual exploitation, abuse of position of trust, persistent nature of the Accused’s offending and the aggravating acts accompanying the commission of the offence, I find it appropriate to place the Third Charge at the lower end of Band 2 of the <span class="font-italic">Kunasekaran</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>framework. Similar to the facts of <span class="font-italic">Kunasekaran</span>, the degree of sexual exploitation was not the most egregious due to the lack of skin-to-skin contact with the Complainant’s groan area. This lends itself to an indicative starting point of five to six months’ imprisonment. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">169 As above, the Accused’s lack of remorse is a relevant offender-specific aggravating factor. As mentioned at [155], specifically in relation to the Third Charge, the Accused had asked the Complainant to delete the Message in an attempt to conceal his offending. This attempt at evading detection was clear evidence of a lack of remorse. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">170 Finally, there are no significant mitigating factors. In the circumstances, the imprisonment term of five months imposed by the DJ was not manifestly excessive. This is also consistent with the sentence in <span class="font-italic">Kunasekaran</span>. In <span class="font-italic">Kunasekaran</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>the victim was a 14-year-old schoolgirl, who had been touched in the groin area by the offender while on a public bus. The offender was sentenced to eight months’ imprisonment. The greater vulnerability of the young victim, coupled with the offence taking place on public transport, warranted a higher imprisonment term than for the Third Charge.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">171 For completeness, I do not consider the case of <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v Goh Eng Chin</span> [2018] SGMC 17 (“<span class="font-italic">Goh Eng Chin</span>”) cited by the Prosecution to be particularly helpful. In <span class="font-italic">Goh Eng Chin</span>, the offender was convicted on four counts of outrage of modesty under s 354(1) of the Penal Code and one count of insulting the modesty of a woman under s 509 of the Penal Code. All these offences were committed by the offender against his tenant, a 24-year-old Korean student. In particular, the Prosecution highlighted the facts pertaining to one of the s 354(1) of the Penal Code charges, where the offender removed all his clothing except for his underwear and touched her thigh, hugged her, and used his head to touch her pubic region and sniffed that region of her body. For this charge, the offender was sentenced to 11 months’ imprisonment and three strokes of the cane. In my view, this set of facts was far more aggravated than the Third Charge and is not useful in calibrating the sentence in the present case.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The sentence for the Fourth Charge </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">172 For the Fourth Charge, the Prosecution submits that a sentence of nine months’ imprisonment should be imposed. Against this, the Accused submits that a sentence of not more than five months’ imprisonment is appropriate.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">173 The degree of sexual exploitation for the Fourth Charge was the highest of all the charges. The Accused had used his right hand to rub the middle of the Complainant’s back, then in one continuous motion, he moved his hand towards her right breast area, moving it up and down. It was not contested by the Accused that there was contact with the private parts of the Complainant. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">174 As to the persistence of the offending by the Accused, I find that it is aggravating that the Accused committed this offence not long after he had previously outraged the modesty of the very same victim and had apologised to her for this. I also consider that there was emotional and psychological harm to the Complainant. Coupled with the abuse of his position of trust, this would point towards the offence falling within the lower end of Band 2.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">175 The post-<span class="font-italic">Kunasekaran</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>case of <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v Thompson, Matthew </span>[2018] 5 SLR 1108 (“<span class="font-italic">Matthew Thompson</span>”) cited by the Accused is instructive. In that case, the offender was a passenger on a commercial flight. He was charged for using his left hand to touch the victim, an air stewardess, at her right hip over her stomach until her lower breast in one motion. On appeal, the offender was sentenced to six months’ imprisonment. Similar to the present case, there was no skin-to-skin contact, the psychological harm suffered by the victim was not inconsequential, and the offender was untraced. See Kee Oon J found that the most significant aggravating factor in relation to the circumstances of the offence was that it had been committed onboard an aircraft, against an air transportation worker. He noted that the offence being committed on board an aircraft would be more aggravating than if committed on other types of public transport: <span class="font-italic">Matthew Thompson</span> at [45]. Based on these facts, See J determined that the starting point ought to be pegged at eight months’ imprisonment.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">176 The Accused submits that in view of the absence of such a factor, <span class="font-italic">Matthew Thompson</span> supports the imposition of a sentence of not more than five months’ imprisonment for the Accused for the Fourth Charge.

</div> I do not accept this submission. First, despite the present case not involving an offence against an air transportation worker in the course of duty, there were several other offence-specific aggravating factors present, including the abuse of the Accused’s position of trust and the persistence of his offending conduct. Second, in arriving at a final sentence of six months’ imprisonment in <span class="font-italic">Matthew Thompson</span>, See J had accorded some mitigating weight to the offender’s good character and work credentials as supporting a high potential for rehabilitation and a lesser need for specific deterrence (at [73]). No such mitigating factors are relevant in the present case such as to warrant a departure from a sentence in the lower end of Band 2. In my judgment, the offence-specific aggravating factors point towards a starting point of eight months’ imprisonment, if not more. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">177 As above, there are no significant mitigating factors. Conversely, the main offender-specific sentencing consideration is the lack of remorse of the Accused, which was aggravating. Having considered the factors in the round, I consider a sentence of nine months’ imprisonment to be appropriate. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The sentence for the First Charge</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">178 I now turn to consider the appropriate sentence in respect of the First Charge. The maximum sentence for an offence under s 509 of the Penal Code is one year’s imprisonment and/or a fine. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">179 The Accused submits that the starting point for such an offence should be a fine of between $1,000 to $2,000, relying on commentary in <span class="font-italic">Sentencing Practice in the Subordinate Courts </span>(LexisNexis, 3rd Ed, 2013) at p 606. Given the varied ways in which offences under s 509 PC can manifest, I am not convinced that this should necessarily apply in the present case. In particular, I note the data from the Sentencing Information and Research Repository adduced by the Prosecution.

</div> It shows that out of 2,876 charges from 22 October 2001 to 12 December 2022, 2,460 resulted in a term of imprisonment. Only 94 of the remaining cases resulted in fines. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">180 I do not find the cases of <span class="font-italic">GCO v Public Prosecutor</span> [2019] 3 SLR 1402 (“<span class="font-italic">GCO</span>”), <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v Mohammed </span><span class="font-italic">Liton Mohammed Syeed Mallik </span>[2008] 1 SLR(R) 601 (“<span class="font-italic">Liton</span>”) and <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v</span> <span class="font-italic">Chong Hou </span><span class="font-italic">En </span>[2015] 3 SLR 222 (“<span class="font-italic">Chong Hou </span><span class="font-italic">En</span>”) cited by the Accused to be helpful.

</div>
</div> I am unable to agree. Even if I were to assume that the context of the remark could potentially be sexual, this remark in itself does not significantly add to the provocative character of the Accused’s comment about his “hard-on” which is the subject matter of the charge. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">183 There is good reason for the custodial threshold to be crossed given the abuse of position of trust of the Accused, the non-negligible psychological harm caused to the Complainant, and the lack of remorse shown by the Accused. Further, there are no mitigating factors present which warrant my consideration. I thus impose a sentence of one week’s imprisonment in respect of the First Charge.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The appropriate global sentence</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">184 The framework for sentencing where there are multiple offences is set out in <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v </span><span class="font-italic">Raveen Balakrishnan </span>[2018] 5 SLR 799 (“<span class="font-italic">Raveen</span><span class="font-italic"> Balakrishnan</span>”)<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [98], which I summarise as follows:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The first stage of the sentencing analysis is for the court to consider the appropriate sentence for each offence.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The second stage of the sentencing analysis is to determine how the individual sentences should run. As a general rule, sentences for unrelated offences should run consecutively, while sentences for offences that form part of a single transaction should run concurrently, subject to the requirement in s 307(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code 2010 (2020 Rev Ed) (“CPC”). If there is a mix of related and unrelated offences, the sentences for those offences that are unrelated should generally run consecutively with one of the sentences for the related offences. The general rule may be departed from if appropriate, and the sentencing court should explain its reasons for doing so.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) The third stage of the sentencing analysis is to apply the totality principle and take a “last look” at all the facts and circumstances to ensure that the aggregate sentence is sufficient and proportionate to the offender’s overall criminality. The court should consider both: (i) whether the aggregate sentence is substantially above the normal level of sentences for the most serious of the individual offences committed; and (ii) whether the effect of the sentence on the offender is crushing and not in keeping with his past record and future prospects. While it is within the court’s power to select sentences other than the longest individual sentence to run consecutively, the aggregate of such sentences must exceed the longest individual sentence.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) Across all stages of the analysis, the sentencing court should be careful not to offend the rule against double counting. The central concern of this rule is that a sentencing factor should be given only its due weight in the sentencing analysis and nothing more.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">185 Having landed on the individual sentences for the charges, I consider how the individual sentences should run. This in turn hinges on the determination of whether the different charges the Accused faces involve “related” offences. As discussed in <span class="font-italic">Raveen</span><span class="font-italic"> Balakrishnan </span>at [69], this is a similar inquiry to whether the offences are part of a single transaction. The inquiry flows from a rule of fairness resting on the notion that an offender should not be doubly punished for what is essentially the same conduct, even though that conduct might disclose several distinct offences at law. This judgment should also be arrived at with due sensitivity to the facts, and a healthy dose of common sense, taking into account indicators such as proximity of time, purpose, and the location of the offences, as well as continuity of design and unity: <span class="font-italic">Raveen</span><span class="font-italic"> Balakrishnan</span> at [70].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">186 Applying the above logic, I find that the First and Second Charges are related and form part of a single transaction, having happened in quick succession during the First Incident. The Third and Fourth Charges, however, are not proximate in time to each other, nor to the First Incident. They should thus be conceptualised as separate transactions from the charges during the First Incident, even though they involve the invasion of the same legal interest against the same victim. It would thus be appropriate to run at least two of the sentences for the charges forming each of the three separate transactions consecutively with each other. This would also accord with the requirement in s 307(1) of the CPC. As to which sentences should be run consecutively, I find that the sentences for the Second and Fourth Charges should run consecutively, as these represent the first and last offences of outrage of modesty committed by the Accused and are thus the furthest apart in time. Doing so would also give a more accurate picture of the overall pattern and time period of offending, reflecting the totality of the appellant’s conduct.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">187 To my mind, the resulting sentence of 12 months’ imprisonment would not be crushing on the Accused and is not substantially above the normal level of sentences for offences under s 354 of the Penal Code.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">188 I thus affirm the Accused’s conviction in respect of the Third Charge and find that the sentence of five months’ imprisonment imposed by the DJ was not manifestly excessive. Further, I convict the Accused on the First, Second, and Fourth Charges, and sentence the Accused to imprisonment sentences of one week, three months, and nine months respectively. The imprisonment terms for the Second and Fourth Charges are to run consecutively resulting in a global sentence of 12 months’ imprisonment. </div><div class="txt-body text-left"></div><div class="Judg-Sign text-left">Vincent Hoong  <br/>Judge of the High Court</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Christopher Ong Siu Jin and Phang Tze En Joshua (Attorney-General’s Chambers) for the appellant in HC/MA 9146/2021 and the respondent in HC/MA 9236/2021;<br/>Chooi Jing Yen (Eugene Thuraisingam LLP)<br/>for the respondent in HC/MA 9146/2021 and the appellant in HC/MA 9236/2021.</div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>

These charges stemmed from three separate incidents, namely: (a) telling her that he had a “hard-on” and pulling her hand towards his penis (“the First Incident” - the First and Second Charges); (b) swiping her groin area with his hand twice (“the Second Incident” - the 3rd Charge); and (c) sliding his hand along her back to the side of her breast (“the Third Incident”, constituting the Fourth Charge). </div><div class="txt-body text-left">2 In the District Court below, the Accused was convicted on the Third Charge and sentenced to five months’ imprisonment. He was acquitted on the remaining three charges. </div><div class="txt-body text-left">3 The Prosecution appealed against the acquittals while the Accused appealed against his conviction and sentence on the Second charge. The High Court allowed the Prosecution’s appeal and convicted the Accused on the 1st, 3rd and 4th charges and affirmed the conviction on the Second charge. </div><div class="txt-body text-left">4 Today’s hearing was for the Prosecution and the Accused to submit on the appropriate sentences for the four charges.</div><div class="txt-body text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Decision</span></div><div class="txt-body text-left"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Abuse of position of trust</span></div><div class="txt-body text-left">5 The main common aggravating factor amongst the charges was the Accused’s abuse of position as the Victim’s superior at work, having committed the offences in the workplace environment during office hours. This attracted considerations of deterrence: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[</span><span class="font-weight-bold">146]–[147]</span>.</div><div class="txt-body text-left"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Psychological harm</span></div><div class="txt-body text-left">6 Another common offence-specific aggravating factor is the harm suffered by the Victim arising out of the offences. The Court accepted that there was some psychological and emotional harm suffered by the Victim as reflected in the Victim Impact Statement. Such harm was consistent with the evidence given by the Victim in court that she was “really scared” and “very upset” such that she started crying after the Second Incident. This was also corroborated by PW’s evidence: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[</span><span class="font-weight-bold">150]</span>.</div><div class="txt-body text-left"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Persistence of offending conduct</span></div><div class="txt-body text-left">7 The Accused’s persistent course of sexual misconduct against the Victim was also an offence-specific aggravating factor underlying all the charges. His conduct demonstrated a clear pattern of workplace sexual harassment displayed through his repeated predatory actions towards his subordinate. In addition, his persistence was also evident when considering the circumstances surrounding some of the charges: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[</span><span class="font-weight-bold">151]</span>.</div><div class="txt-body text-left"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Lack of remorse </span></div><div class="txt-body text-left">8 The Accused’s lack of remorse was an aggravating factor, in particular  when he was confronted by the Victim and PW4. After the Second Incident, the Victim sent a message to the Accused to tell him that she did not feel comfortable with what he was doing, and that he should stop. The Accused then called her and asked her to delete the Message. This demonstrated an intention to conceal evidence of his wrongdoing (which he would later repeat). Further, when confronted by PW4 after the Third Incident, the Accused sought to downplay his actions as him “just joking”, and implied that it was the Victim’s fault for dressing in a “sexy and seducing” way. He later alleged an affair between him and the Victim to deflect any blame for his misconduct. This victim-blaming and manipulative behaviour showed that the Accused consistently demonstrated no remorse for his offending. </div><div class="txt-body text-left"><span class="font-weight-bold">The individual sentences </span></div><div class="txt-body text-left">9 Having considered the above factors, the High Court arrived at the following sentences:</div><table class="table table-sm d-flex justify-content-center table-bordered"><tbody><tr><td><div class="txt-body text-left">First charge</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-left">One week’s imprisonment</div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="txt-body text-left">Second charge</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-left">Three months’ imprisonment (consecutive)</div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="txt-body text-left">Third charge</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-left">Five months’ imprisonment</div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="txt-body text-left">Fourth charge</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-left">Nine months’ imprisonment</div><div class="txt-body text-left">(consecutive)</div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="txt-body text-left">Total sentence</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-left">12 months’ imprisonment</div></td></tr></tbody></table><div class="txt-body text-left"></div><div class="txt-body text-left"><span class="font-weight-bold">The appropriate aggregate sentence</span></div><div class="txt-body text-left">10 The Court decided that it would be appropriate for the Second and Fourth Charges to run consecutively, as these represented the first and last offences of outrage of modesty committed by the Accused and were thus the furthest apart in time.
