        Tay Yong Kwang J:</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The accused persons</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       The accused persons were former colleagues in
                    the Singapore Land Authority (“SLA”). At the material time, Koh
                    Seah Wee (“Koh”), now 41 years old, was the deputy director of the
                    SLA’s Technology and Infrastructure (“TI”) department while
                    Lim Chai Meng (“Lim”), now aged 38, was the said
                    department’s manager, a position subordinate to that of
                    Koh’s.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       Between 11 February 1997 and 20 July
                    2004, Koh was a consultant in the information technology department of the
                    Supreme Court. From 21 July 2004 to 11 March 2007, he worked as a
                    consultant in the information technology department of the Intellectual Property
                    Office of Singapore (“IPOS”). He then moved to the SLA’s TI
                    department and worked there until 31 March 2010. For the next two months,
                    he worked in the Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority of
                    Singapore.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       Lim was employed as a manager in the TI
                    department of SLA from 1 July 2006 to 30 April 2010. He resigned from
                    SLA on 30 April 2010 and remained unemployed thereafter, not bothering to
                    look for a job as (according to his defence counsel) he knew it was a matter of
                    time that the law would close in on him.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The charges</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       Koh faced a total of 372 charges. He pleaded
                    guilty to 55 charges of which 46 concerned the offences of cheating (s 420 Penal
                    Code Cap 224) or conspiracy to cheat (s 420 read with s 109 Penal
                    Code). Nine charges related to concealment or conversion of properties
                    representing his benefits from criminal conduct punishable under s 47(6) of
                    the Corruption, Drug Trafficking and Other Serious Crimes (Confiscation of
                    Benefits) Act (Cap 65A) (“Confiscation of Benefits Act”). The
                    two categories of offences will be referred to hereafter as the cheating and the
                    money laundering offences. In addition, Koh admitted and consented to the
                    remaining 317 charges involving cheating and money laundering offences to be
                    taken into consideration for the purpose of sentencing.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       Lim face a total of 309 charges. He pleaded
                    guilty to 49 charges. Out of these, 40 charges concerned the offence of
                    conspiracy to cheat SLA and one charge involved a conspiracy to cheat a finance
                    company, Sing Investments &amp; Finance Limited (“Sing
                    Investments”). The other 8 charges were for money laundering offences.
                    Lim also admitted and consented to the remaining 260 charges of cheating and
                    money laundering offences to be taken into consideration for the purpose of
                    sentencing.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The factual background</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Koh and Lim</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       On 15 June 2010 (after both Koh and Lim
                    were no longer working in SLA), SLA lodged a police report alleging that goods
                    and services procured through some purchase orders put up by Lim and
                    subsequently approved by Koh were fictitious. The Commercial Affairs Department
                    (“CAD”) commenced investigations which led to the discovery of
                    more offences committed by Koh during his earlier employment in the Supreme
                    Court and IPOS. The investigations also revealed that there were seven
                    accomplices who aided Koh and Lim in the cheating offences, the most notable of
                    whom was a man named Ho Yen Teck (“Ho”), aged 31, the owner of
                    seven sole proprietorships and a full-time sales executive of a local company at
                    the material time.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       Lim was the procurement/verifying officer
                    responsible for the requisition of goods and services required by SLA’s TI
                    department. The procurement procedure to be followed depended on the value of
                    the goods and services in question. For values of up to $3,000, Lim, the vendors
                    or an in-house third party vendor would submit the invoices directly to
                    SLA’s finance department. For values of between $3,001 and $80,000, Lim
                    would create an Invitation-to-Quote (“ITQ”) in the government
                    procurement portal known as GeBiz.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       Part of Lim’s scope of work was to
                    identify the business needs of the TI department and to justify those needs to
                    Koh. Once Koh gave the permission to send out an ITQ, Lim would put up the
                    requirements and specifications on GeBiz. When the quotations were received, Lim
                    would make recommendations to Koh on whom to award the contract to. Koh could
                    approve contracts of up to $60,000 in value.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       Once Koh approved the contract, a purchase order
                    would be generated and sent to the successful vendor. The vendor would send an
                    invoice to SLA which would forward the invoice to the TI department for Lim to
                    verify and for Koh to approve for payment. Upon Koh’s approval,
                    SLA’s finance department would pay the money to the vendor.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     Koh and Lim would rig the quotation results by
                    arranging for their own “vendors” (the accomplices) to offer the
                    lowest quotations which Lim would recommend and Koh would approve. Lim would
                    also assist in preparing fictitious invoices for some of the
                    “vendors” for submission to SLA’s finance
                department.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     For contracts not exceeding $3,000 in value,
                    Lim would ask for quotations directly from the vendor if the price of the item
                    in question was known and was reasonable. If the price was not known, Lim had
                    the discretion to ask other vendors to submit quotations. The successful vendor
                    would submit an invoice to Lim who would pass it on to the finance department.
                    Alternatively, the vendor would submit an invoice directly to the finance
                    department. The finance department would then send a system-generated email to
                    Lim to verify that delivery of goods had been made or the service rendered. Upon
                    Lim’s verification, an email alert would be sent to Koh for his approval
                    to make payment to the vendor. For such lower value contracts, Lim would provide
                    the descriptions and the amounts to the “vendor” for submission of
                    invoice for payment.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     All the specifications listed in GeBiz and the
                    lower value contracts were not required by SLA and were fictitious in one or
                    more of the following ways in that they were for:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_12-p2_a"></a>(a)     maintenance of equipment which SLA
                        did not have;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_12-p2_b"></a>(b)     maintenance of equipment for which SLA already had existing agreements with
                        other vendors;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_12-p2_c"></a>(c)     goods and services which SLA did not need;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_12-p2_d"></a>(d)     duplicated specifications;
                    and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_12-p2_e"></a>(e)     no goods or
                        services were actually supplied.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Through this fraudulent
                    scheme, contracts were awarded to the “vendors” which had no
                    intention of fulfilling them and which were not able to in any case. 282 such
                    contracts were awarded to 11 “vendors” which were merely façades
                    operated by the seven accomplices. As a consequence, SLA was dishonestly induced
                    to pay the “vendors” a sum of more than $12.1m. Once payment was
                    made by SLA, the money would be withdrawn from the respective vendors’
                    accounts and the cash would then be handed over to Koh. The accomplices would be
                    given a share of the money but the bulk of it would go to Koh and Lim. The
                    prosecution was not able to state the proportions of the loot as between Koh and
                    Lim.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Koh</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     The investigations conducted by CAD uncovered
                    earlier wrongdoing by Koh when he was working at IPOS and the Supreme Court. He
                    committed fraud at these organizations by dishonestly concealing his financial
                    interests in the vendors submitting quotations which were evaluated by him and
                    submitted for approval by his superiors. Further, in most of the 15 contracts in
                    question at IPOS, the quotations by his accomplice were submitted after the
                    close of ITQ when all other quotations were already known to Koh, thus enabling
                    his accomplice to submit the lowest bids. More than half of the contracts were
                    for goods and services not required by IPOS and were fictitious in one or more
                    of the ways set out at <a href="#p1_12">[12]</a>(b), (c) and (d)
                    above. A total of $254,142 was paid out in these contracts.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     Koh, who is married and has a young daughter,
                    used the fraudulently obtained money to buy private properties in his or in his
                    wife’s name, to open bank accounts in the names of family members,
                    withdrawing the cash soon after that, to invest in unit trusts and shares, to
                    buy luxury goods with high retention values and to indulge in expensive cars
                    such as a limited edition of a Lamborghini LP 670 SV (with number plate SDP
                    88R), a Mercedes Benz E350 Coupe (registered as SJH 8T) and a Mercedes Benz E200
                    (registered as SDP 40C). The first two cars were registered in his wife’s
                    name while the third was registered in his mother’s name. All three cars
                    were seized and subsequently sold as they were depreciating
                assets.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     The CAD managed to seize properties and cash
                    from Koh and his family worth some $7.54m (not including a number of luxury
                    watches, luxury bags and jewellery which have not been valued). Out of this
                    amount, some $1.5m is the subject of adverse claims, the merits of which have
                    not yet been determined.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Lim</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     Lim is married and has four children (two of
                    whom were from his wife’s previous marriage). He used the illegally
                    obtained money in much the same ways as Koh did. In fact, both accused persons
                    went together to visit the showroom of the condominium called Optima@Tanah Merah
                    where Koh purchased unit 08-14 in his wife’s name and Lim booked unit
                    09-14. This turned out to be a fairly good investment as 09-14 was resold at a
                    modest profit. Lim also bought another private property with his
                wife.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     Lim deposited some of his criminal proceeds
                    into the bank accounts of his family members and withdrew the cash soon
                    thereafter. He also opened a bank account in his own name for the purpose of
                    depositing cash obtained from cheating SLA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     Like Koh, Lim also bought expensive cars.
                    However, unlike Koh, Lim traded in one car for another and did not have three at
                    the same time. The series of cars included an Audi TT Coupe 2.0, a Porsche
                    Cayman S Tip and a second-hand Ferrari F430 F1 (bearing the registration plate
                    SJV 82D). It was in the process of buying the Ferrari that the cheating offence
                    against Sing Investments was committed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     The Ferrari cost some $721,000 and Lim needed
                    a loan of $350,000 loan from Sing Investments. Based on the salary stated in his
                    official payslip, he would not have qualified for such an amount in loan. The
                    owner of the car dealer company selling the Ferrari helped Lim to create a false
                    document stating that Lim was a consultant of an existing company earning
                    $20,000 per month, an income level that qualified Lim for the $350,000 loan. The
                    use of this false document deceived Sing Investments into granting Lim the loan
                    and he bought the Ferrari. Unfortunately, Lim crashed the Ferrari in an accident
                    along Nicoll Highway in December 2009 and the car has since been scrapped and
                    sold for $10,800. Some $210,000 were also received by way of road tax refund and
                    registration fee and certificate of entitlement rebates.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     The CAD seized properties and cash from Lim
                    and his family worth some $1.43m (not including some luxury watches and luxury
                    bags which have not been valued). Out of this amount, some $38,000 is the
                    subject of adverse claims, the merits of which have not yet been
                    determined.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The prosecution’s submissions on sentence</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     Both Koh and Lim have no criminal record.
                    However, the prosecution submitted that “a heavy deterrent sentence is
                    called for in view of the unprecedented scale and magnitude of fraud” in
                    this case, highlighting the following matters:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_21-p2_a"></a>(a)     The cheating offences were against a
                        public institution (and against three such institutions in the case of Koh)
                        over a substantial period of time (more than 10 years for Koh and more than
                        2 years for Lim), resulting in loss of an astronomically large sum of public
                        funds. Offences against public institutions impinge on larger national and
                        public interests;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_21-p2_b"></a>(b)     There was an egregious abuse of trust and position by public servants
                        in the discharge of official duties;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_21-p2_c"></a>(c)     Such collusive fraud was often hard to
                    detect;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_21-p2_d"></a>(d)     The accused
                        persons’ roles as coordinating masterminds of an elaborate and
                        organized fraud;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_21-p2_e"></a>(e)     The offences seriously undermined public confidence in the integrity
                        of our country’s public procurement processes; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_21-p2_f"></a>(f)     The accused persons were sophisticated
                        offenders who engaged in systematic and elaborate laundering of criminal
                        proceeds.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     Due to the circumstances here, the accused
                    persons should each receive in total more than the maximum imprisonment period
                    of 14 years that the district court may impose in any one case under the
                    provisions of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 1985 Rev Ed) (it
                    was not in dispute that the Criminal Procedure Code in force before 2011 applies
                    to this case).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     The prosecution argued that the guilty pleas
                    were not motivated by genuine remorse and should therefore be accorded little
                    mitigating weight. The accused persons here knew that their game was up when CAD
                    came into the picture and “their guilty pleas stem from a pragmatic
                    realization that there is no point in delaying the inevitable”.
                    “It is all too easy for an offender to say he is sorry when the strong
                    arm of the law has caught up with him” (<em>Chen Weixiong
                        </em><em>Jerrick v Public Prosecutor</em> [2003]
                    2 SLR(R) 334 at [23]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     The prosecution also contended that there was
                    no real restitution as most of the assets recovered were seized by the CAD in
                    the course of its investigations. While the recovered assets would reduce the
                    overall financial loss caused to SLA, they should not be viewed as evidence of
                    remorse.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     The “one transaction rule”
                    should not apply to this case as there was no proximity in time in the multiple
                    offences. Consecutive imprisonment terms should be imposed on the accused
                    persons “for a significant number of charges so that the court may show
                    its abhorrence of the nefarious conduct” in this case. The prosecution
                    cited the Court of Appeal’s decision in <em>ADF v
                        PP</em> [2010] 1 SLR 874 for the proposition that more than
                    two consecutive imprisonment sentences ought to be given serious consideration
                    in dealing with distinct offences when one or more of the following factors are
                    present:</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     The sentences on the charges that the
                    prosecution has proceeded on should also be enhanced in view of the substantial
                    number of charges taken into consideration. The prosecution referred to three
                    cases involving large scale fraud heard by the High Court for comparison. They
                    are:</p>

<p class="Judg-3"><a id=""></a>The accused there was the finance manager of Asia Pacific Brewery

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     The accomplice Ho has been sentenced by the

                    charges with 174 similar charges taken into consideration. His assistance in the
                    criminal acts caused SLA to disburse more than $9.7m to the seven sole
                    proprietorships in his name. His share of the criminal proceeds was about
                    $200,000 only.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     The prosecution submitted that Koh should be
                    sentenced to an aggregate imprisonment term of between 20 and 24 years while Lim
                    should be given a total of between 16 and 20 years.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Mitigation for Koh</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     Koh’s early guilty plea and full
                    cooperation with CAD indicated that he was sincerely remorseful over his
                    actions. He has saved time and effort on the investigators’ part by
                    admitting his wrongdoing and cooperating with them during investigations and
                    helping in the tracing of the assets. A protracted trial has also been
                    obviated.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     Koh was on holiday in the United States of
                    America when he was informed that the CAD was looking for him. He chose to
                    return to Singapore to surrender himself after meeting his counsel in Malaysia
                    and reflecting on the matter for a few days. The CAD was duly informed of the
                    time and place of Koh’s return to Singapore. He was arrested on
                    23 June 2010 and charged in court on 25 June 2010 after which he has
                    remained in remand. He made it clear from the outset that he would be pleading
                    guilty at the earliest available opportunity. It was argued that a wrong message
                    would be sent if a heavy sentence were imposed as that would be telling
                    offenders that if they came back, they would be hammered to a
                pulp.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     Koh’s wife used to be a home-maker but
                    has been forced by the circumstances to work part time to support herself and
                    their 9 year old daughter. They are now living in rented premises. They were
                    shocked by the revelations as Koh had merely informed his wife that he had made
                    some good investments in information technology businesses.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     Koh served our nation as a field engineer
                    officer during his national service. He graduated in electrical engineering with
                    first class honours from the Queensland University of Technology and was granted
                    membership in the Golden Key National Honour Society in the said university. He
                    could have been a very successful person but for the wrongdoing.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     Koh acknowledged that as he was Lim’s
                    superior officer in SLA, more trust was reposed in him and he was therefore the
                    more culpable offender between them. He denied however that he instigated Lim to
                    commit the cheating offences (see Lim’s version at <a href="#p1_40">[40]</a> and <a href="#p1_41">[41]</a>
                    below). They simply had discussions and both agreed to cheat SLA together. He
                    maintained that the criminal proceeds between him and Lim were shared equally
                    while some of the money was given to the accomplices. That was also the case
                    with the final round of cheating offences in March 2010 against SLA involving
                    more than $3m (Lim denied this – see <a href="#p1_45">[45]</a> below).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     Koh also denied Lim’s allegation (see
                        <a href="#p1_46">[46]</a> below) that he had telephoned Lim
                    to ask him to bear responsibility for all the offences in exchange for $1.5m.
                    While he did call Lim, he was merely suggesting that they tell CAD that they had
                    shares in the “vendors” involved and were therefore entitled to
                    some money paid to the “vendors”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     SLA has commenced civil proceedings against
                    Koh, Lim, their family members and the accomplices. It was therefore likely that
                    the loss occasioned to SLA would be minimal or fully recovered.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     The three High Court cases cited by the
                    prosecution at <a href="#p1_26">[26]</a> above were
                    distinguishable on the facts. Apart from the fact that some of them concerned
                    criminal breach of trust rather than cheating, the amounts taken and lost were
                    much higher in those cases. The sentence imposed on the accomplice, Ho, by the
                    district court does not constrain the High Court in any way where Koh was
                    concerned.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     It was suggested that an aggregate
                    imprisonment term of 16 years, backdated to his date of remand, would suffice
                    for Koh.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Mitigation for Lim</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     Lim has an external degree in computer science
                    from University College London. His wife is 7 years his senior and has two
                    children from her previous marriage, one of whom is autistic and studying in a
                    special needs school. They have two other children of their own. His wife has
                    been unemployed since 2008. She takes care of their four children. Lim’s
                    mother is 64 and unemployed while his father is 62 and earns a meagre salary as
                    a security guard. While his family is extremely supportive of Lim, as seen in
                    their many letters attesting to Lim’s good general character and pleading
                    for leniency, Lim did not want them to be in court so as to avoid the
                    media.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     The following information came from a report
                    dated 26 May 2011 by Dr Stephen Phang, a psychiatrist in the Institute
                    of Mental Health (tendered as part of the mitigation plea). Lim’s
                    incarceration led to him developing and suffering from a major depressive
                    disorder of mild to moderate severity. Prior to the offences, he experienced an
                    adjustment disorder, possibly with depressed mood, which was ameliorated while
                    the offences were being committed primarily because of the ill-gotten gains he
                    received from the offences. His background history is suggestive that he is not,
                    by any perception, a habitual offender. He is currently on antidepressant
                    medication.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     Lim stated that when Koh joined SLA in March
                    2007, Koh became his immediate superior and was in charge of all of Lim’s
                    work appraisals. Koh made efforts to know Lim and learnt that Lim was in
                    financial difficulties because his wife was retrenched in 2004 and he had to
                    support two step-children and two children of his own. Lim was then struggling
                    with his mortgage payments and his credit card bills. A few months later, Koh
                    sent Lim an innocuous email stating that he had a scheme to make money and if
                    Lim was interested, he was to approach Koh to discuss (Koh gave a different
                    version of the inception of the scheme to defraud – see <a href="#p1_33">[33]</a> above)..</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     Lim did approach Koh who told him about a flaw
                    in the GeBiz procurement portal which could be exploited. Koh told Lim to take
                    care of the purchase orders and other documentation while he would enlist the
                    help of external vendors. Due to Lim’s adjustment disorder and sense of
                    desperation, he was enticed into the cheating scheme. He was told that he would
                    receive about one-third of the criminal proceeds but his eventual share was much
                    less than that. Koh wanted to do “a few big ones” and then
                    stop.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     Out of the 11 vendors brought into the
                    cheating scheme, Lim never met anyone from the eight of them responsible for
                    cheating SLA of almost $11.5m. Most of them were brought in through Ho,
                    Koh’s friend, whom Lim has never met. Lim was responsible for bringing in
                    three vendors which were involved in cheating SLA of about
                $685,000.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     Lim profited by about $1.87m from the criminal
                    proceeds. His debts were more than taken care of. Koh advised him not to keep
                    too much money in the bank to avoid trouble and suggested that Lim invest in
                    property and luxury goods which would retain their value. Koh also introduced
                    the contact person for the second-hand Ferrari. He reckoned that Koh took more
                    than 70% of the criminal proceeds from cheating SLA while he received between
                    20% and 25% thereof.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     As the adverse claims to the assets recovered
                    involved about $38,000 only, SLA would be able to recover at least $1.35m
                    together with another $100,000 or so from the luxury goods. Lim was making no
                    claim to the assets and there would therefore be savings in legal costs for
                    SLA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     In 2010, Lim began to have misgivings about
                    the cheating scheme and tried to persuade Koh to stop. He told Koh that he
                    wanted out and would not help him with the transactions in the second half of
                    March 2010. However, Koh told him that he would be responsible for the last
                    batch of about 53 transactions. Feeling beholden to Koh, Lim complied with
                    Koh’s instructions “one last time”. Lim did not take a share
                    of the proceeds from these transactions while Koh kept the entire amount of $3m
                    or so (this was disputed by Koh – see <a href="#p1_33">[33]</a> above). Lim argued that he could not have had a share of
                    this amount looking at the value of the assets recovered from him and his
                    family.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     Lim assisted CAD fully with the
                    investigations. While he was being interviewed by the CAD officers, Koh called
                    him from abroad without knowing where Lim was at that time. Koh asked Lim to
                    take the entire blame for the offences in exchange for $1.5m. Lim refused the
                    offer and persuaded Koh to return to Singapore. Although the CAD officers could
                    not hear the conversation, Lim told them about it immediately after ending the
                    call. Koh’s version about this telephone call is at <a href="#p1_34">[34]</a> above.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     Lim is extremely remorseful and makes no
                    excuse for his actions. He accepted that “his role as Koh’s runner
                    was essential in carrying out the scheme”. He apologises to all adversely
                    affected by his foolish actions and finds solace in religion now. He was charged
                    in court on 6 October 2010 and remanded thereafter. Before that, he was
                    granted bail by CAD.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     Lim contended that Koh was the one controlling
                    the whole scheme from beginning to end. While he acknowledged that he was
                    “not a pawn, he certainly was not the chess master that Koh was”.
                    He likened his role to that of a knight, “one who was controllable and
                    whose path was limited in scope but yet important enough in the scheme to ensure
                    maximum benefit for the chess master who knew how to wield him”. Lim
                    submitted that his culpability was similar to that of Ho, whom he has never met.
                    Both of them had been manipulated by Koh.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     “Deterrence must always be tempered by
                    proportionality in relation to the severity of the offence committed as well as
                    by the moral and legal culpability of the offender” (<em>Tan Kay Beng v PP</em> [2006] 4 SLR(R) 10). It was
                    suggested that compassion could still be shown in a deterrent sentence and that
                    a total custodial sentence of 10 to 12 years would suffice to meet the ends of
                    justice here. The precedents cited by the prosecution (at <a href="#p1_26">[26]</a> above) were inapplicable as s 409 and
                    s 467 of the old Penal Code provided for even life imprisonment. Moreover,
                    the amount defrauded and lost in this case was nowhere near the astronomical
                    sums in those three cases.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     Sing Investments has sued Lim for the $350,000
                    loan taken out for the ill-fated Ferrari. I was informed by counsel on watching
                    brief for SLA that the insurers for the Ferrari have repudiated liability on the
                    ground that the policy was purchased with proceeds from fraud.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The decision of the court</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     The Penal Code was amended on 1 February
                    2008. As some of the cheating offences were committed before 1 February
                    2008, the Penal Code (1985 Rev Ed) (“old Penal Code”) applies
                    to those. The punishment prescribed under 420 of the old Penal Code was a
                    maximum imprisonment term of 7 years with a liability to a fine. For the
                    cheating offences committed on or after 1 February 2008, the Penal Code
                    (2008 Rev Ed) (“new Penal Code”) applies. The punishment
                    provided under s 420 of the new Penal Code is 10 years imprisonment and a
                    liability to a fine. Section 109 in the new Penal Code remains the same as its
                    predecessor and provides that an abettor of an offence shall be punished with
                    the punishment provided for the offence abetted if there is no express provision
                    for the punishment of such abetment. There is no such express provision and,
                    accordingly, s 420 is the governing provision and imprisonment is mandatory
                    for the cheating offences.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     Section 47(6)(a) of the Confiscation of
                    Benefits Act provides that an individual who commits an offence under s 47
                    shall be liable to a fine not exceeding $500,000 or to imprisonment of up to 7
                    years or to both.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     The precedents cited by the prosecution at
                        <a href="#p1_26">[26]</a> above have a basic common theme
                    with the present case. They all concern accused persons defrauding others of
                    millions of dollars and spending their illegally obtained fortunes on
                    themselves, their families or friends. There are of course differences in the
                    cases, some of which have been pointed out above. Nevertheless, they serve as
                    useful comparisons for what the total imprisonment terms ought to be for Koh and
                    Lim in the present case. As all involved in this case (and similar ones before)
                    have pragmatically noted, the significance of the sentencing process in such
                    cases is not what each of the offences deserves but what the aggregate sentence
                    comprising the consecutive imprisonment terms would be.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     The strongest points in both accused
                    persons’ favour are that they have pleaded guilty at the first available
                    opportunity and have rendered assistance to the CAD in the investigations and in
                    the recovery of the money and assets wholly obtained or tainted by their fraud.
                    More than $12m were taken by them collectively and some $9m (in money and
                    assets) were recovered. There are still a number of luxury goods which have not
                    been valued. Out of the recovered sum, slightly more than $1.5m is the subject
                    of adverse claims. The total recovery will therefore be between 62.5 and 75%. In
                    absolute terms, the loss will be between $3m and $4.5m.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     None of the parties in this case could come up
                    with accurate computations as to what the respective shares of Koh and Lim were
                    as between themselves since everything was transacted in cash, leaving no
                    financial trail. Even the accused persons disagreed on what their shares were.
                    Koh maintained it was 50-50 (see [33])
                    while Lim surmised it was in the region of 70-30 (at [43]). However, we could fairly say that Koh
                    gave himself a larger share if we consider the assets seized, bearing in mind
                    that Lim had admitted he was in a financial mire and therefore would have used
                    some of the funds to clear his debts and to support his family (his parents, his
                    wife and their four children), causing him to be less asset-rich than Koh who
                    did not appear to have any money problems.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     First offenders in the position of Koh and Lim
                    do not deserve the kind of sympathy reserved for those who transgress for the
                    first time on an isolated occasion and often out of line with their general
                    character. A clear distinction has to be drawn between those who break the law
                    for the first time and those who have been flouting the law with impunity for
                    years and are finally caught and charged for the first time. The latter class
                    can hardly be called novices in crime. It would be much more apt to describe
                    them as seasoned criminals skilled at avoiding detection. This is particularly
                    true for Koh whose fraudulent acts in his previous workplaces came to light only
                    fortuitously years after the events.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     Offences involving public funds committed
                    against public institutions have to be dealt with sternly as they amount to an
                    assault on the common weal and undermine good administration. It is worse when
                    such assaults come from within the organization and are initiated by people
                    trusted to handle public funds and to ensure fair play in commercial dealings
                    with the organization. Fraud which is carefully planned and coolly played out is
                    often difficult to uncover even with good checks and balances. It becomes even
                    more elusive when there is collaboration and collusion from within the
                    organization defrauded.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a>58     Koh defrauded three public bodies
                    consecutively while working within them. Lim cheated only one but, like Koh, in
                    a big way. Koh and Lim siphoned off SLA’s funds stealthily and
                    systematically over a number of years. They were the safety checks put in place
                    to administer the technology infrastructure and to prevent financial leakage but
                    they transformed themselves into surreptitious sluices letting out torrents of
                    public funds illegally. Koh as the more senior officer between the two of them
                    naturally bears more culpability but it would diminish Lim’s role
                    unjustifiably if we forget that the duet of deception could not have been
                    performed with such virtuosity unless both of them were in complete harmony. Koh
                    needed Lim and Lim needed Koh.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a>59     Their duty as conscientious employees should
                    have been to rectify flaws in the system should they come across any. Instead,
                    they decided to manipulate the system then existing in order to enrich
                    themselves at public expense. Their brashness and sheer confidence were
                    evidenced by the fact that they frequently authorised huge payments without even
                    receiving any of the purported goods and services contracted for. While owners
                    of property may be expected to exercise some care in protecting their
                    possessions, our courts do not entertain pleas by cheaters and thieves that they
                    were tempted by any perceived lack of security or alertness on the
                    victims’ part, particularly when the defrauders took pains to disguise
                    themselves and their activities. Organizations large and small, public and
                    private, may put in place the best systems but if those entrusted with operating
                    the systems (especially at the higher levels) choose to be dishonest, fraud can
                    still occur. For this reason, as mentioned in <a href="#p1_57">[57]</a> above, fraud from within must be deterred and decisively
                    punished when it is committed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a>60     Financial crimes like these often have
                    repercussions beyond the immediate facts of the case. New and more stringent
                    checks may have to be introduced to try to prevent a repeat of the cheating.
                    More levels of authorisation and authentication may have to be put in place. The
                    result is increased costs in time, manpower and possibly infrastructure which
                    would have been quite unnecessary if honesty prevails. There is the added
                    dimension of creating disputes and litigation among those deceived. One example
                    here is the potential dispute relating to the Ferrari involving the insurers,
                    Sing Investments and SLA. We also witnessed in recent court history how the
                    criminal activities in <em>PP v Chia Teck Leng</em>
                    (mentioned at <a href="#p1_26">[26]</a> above) generated costly
                    litigation among the victim organizations.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a>61     Where the money laundering offences were
                    concerned, the prosecution described Koh and Lim as “highly sophisticated
                    criminals” capable of “systematic and elaborate laundering of
                    criminal proceeds”. With respect, I do not quite agree with this
                    description. They had the commonsense not to leave an audit trail and therefore
                    transacted in cash only among the accomplices. They did try to camouflage their
                    huge cash reserves by their various means of investments. However, the
                    investments were all in Singapore and were readily traceable to them because the
                    purported owners were not persons of apparent financial means and stature who
                    could easily explain the source of their wealth. Their rather egoistic acts in
                    purchasing super cars, especially the attention-grabbing Lamborghini and
                    Ferrari, in our small island indicated inane vanity rather than sophistication.
                    They were carelessly inviting questions about their new found wealth,
                    particularly for Lim, whose recent financial woes must have been known to those
                    who knew him. They were indeed seasoned in cheating but were hardly
                    sophisticated money launderers.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_62"></a>62     Koh apparently had reservations about
                    returning to Singapore when he became aware of the investigations by the CAD.
                    Whatever the true context of that telephone call that he made to Lim, it was at
                    the very least an attempt to deceive the investigators and to downplay the
                    enormity of their criminal acts. In any event, he made the correct and
                    honourable decision to return home to admit to the wrongdoings and to face the
                    consequences. Belated repentance is still better than total lack of remorse and
                    blatant refusal to acknowledge guilt.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_63"></a>63     Nothing was said about Koh’s motivation
                    for his criminal activities. He did not appear to have been in debt. Therefore I
                    can only surmise from the way he spent the criminal proceeds that he craved
                    luxury but was unwilling to work hard for it.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_64"></a>64     Lim’s depression while in custody was
                    largely induced by his own criminal acts. Further, his pre-existing adjustment
                    disorder, as noted by Dr Stephen Phang, did not deprive him of the mental
                    capacity to differentiate between right and wrong. The psychiatrist went on to
                    opine that “[i]n fact, he would conceivably have required a nimble state
                    of mind to have successfully engaged in the illicit activities for which he is
                    presently charged with committing, over an extended period of approximately 3
                    years”. His mental state therefore carries practically no mitigating
                    value.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_65"></a>65     While I had some sympathy for Lim’s
                    previous predicament in view of his family commitments, which spurred him to
                    partner Koh in this criminal enterprise, that unfortunately dissipated quickly
                    when his needs evolved rapidly into greed. This was particularly the case
                    concerning the charge involving Sing Investments. There could have been no
                    justification whatsoever for cheating in order to upgrade from an already
                    expensive car to a super car, albeit a second hand one.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_66"></a>66     Although Lim claimed to have had misgivings
                    about the cheating scheme in 2010, he nonetheless agreed to help Koh cheat SLA
                    out of more than $3m in over 50 false transactions within the month of March
                    2010. As pointed out by the prosecution, that worked out to an average of more
                    than two fraudulent transactions per working day during that month. The
                    “one last time” of cheating was truly a grand finale. It certainly
                    fits into the original plan to do “a few big ones” (see <a href="#p1_41">[41]</a> above). Even if Lim did not take any share of
                    this money, he had again knowingly assisted Koh in cheating a public body in
                    spectacular fashion.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_67"></a>67     Lim’s family members and friends have
                    written to the court to attest to his general good character and to plead for
                    leniency for him. I shall mention a sampling of the testimonials here. His wife
                    wrote to say that he is “a dutiful husband and loving father to our four
                    children … My family condemned his crime but not him”. His
                    biological daughter described him as “a good man” and stated that
                    she “really really miss him very much”. His step-daughter wrote to
                    say that “he is a kind hearted man, a loving husband and yet a stern
                    father” and that after her biological father left her, her mother and her
                    autistic younger brother, Lim’s presence “made a great impact in my
                    life”. Lim’s former school mate described him as “a very
                    loyal friend” and “obsessed with cars”. His father also
                    touched on this issue when he wrote (in Chinese) that Lim’s
                    “weakness is the love for cars, so in a moment of folly and overcome by
                    greed, he treaded on the wrong path”. Two of his friends wrote that Lim
                    was a very responsible man who “has not only taken the responsibility of
                    a husband but also a father to two kids not of his own as his. This is a very
                    huge responsibility for anyone what more a young man with no prior parental
                    experience. Added to this was the fact that one child needed special care for
                    his autism”. Others stated that Lim has found meaning and solace in his
                    religion.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_68"></a>68     I acknowledge all the testimonials written for
                    Lim and wish to assure the writers that due consideration has been given to
                    them. Should the sentence that I am about to pronounce not meet the wishes of
                    the writers, especially the two daughters, it will not be due to my disbelief or
                    disregard of their statements and sentiments. To Lim’s children, your
                    father will return to you one day. Do not forget him, do not stop loving
                    him.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_69"></a>69     In view of the enormity of the criminal
                    activities in this case, deterrence and retribution have to be clearly reflected
                    in the sentences to be imposed, tempered by proportionality in relation to the
                    severity of the offences committed as well as by the moral and legal culpability
                    of the accused persons here (see <a href="#p1_49">[49]</a>
                    above). Although the new Penal Code provides for a higher maximum imprisonment
                    term for cheating, I decided not to draw a distinction in sentence between the
                    cheating offences committed under the old Penal Code and those under the new
                    Penal Code as the substance of the offences committed was essentially the
                    same.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_70"></a>70     I now pronounce the following
                    sentences.</p>
