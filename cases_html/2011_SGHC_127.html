<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       The parties were married on 24 June 1979. I
                    shall refer to them individually as “the husband” and “the
                    wife”. Some 29 years later, in 2008, divorce proceedings were commenced
                    by the husband. The wife lodged a counterclaim. On 20 June 2008, an interim
                    judgment dissolving the marriage was granted by the Family Court on the ground
                    of unreasonable behaviour on the part of both parties. The interim judgment was
                    made final on 2 December 2008. The ancillary matters were transferred to the
                    High Court and were dealt with by me on 28 June 2010 (“the first
                    hearing”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The husband is now 57years old while the wife is
                    now 56 years old. Both are Hong Kong citizens with permanent resident status in
                    Singapore. The husband is a medical professional working in a Singapore hospital
                    and he resides here. The wife is the president of a technology institute in Hong
                    Kong and a well known newspaper columnist and television and radio talk show
                    host there. She resides in Hong Kong but travels frequently between Hong Kong
                    and Singapore.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       There were three children born during the
                    marriage. The eldest son (first son”) was born in 1988 and was already an
                    adult at the time of the first hearing. There was therefore no custody, care and
                    control issue where he was concerned. He is studying abroad. The second son
                    (“second son”) was born in 1993 and is now 17 years old. The
                    youngest son (“third son”) born in 1997, now 13, was subsequently
                    proved (during the course of the hearing of the ancillary matters) to be the
                    offspring of the wife and another man living in Hong Kong, and the husband is
                    therefore not his biological father. The second son and the third son reside
                    with the husband in a private property in Singapore.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The first hearing on 28 June 2010</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       At the first hearing, I made the following
                    orders pertaining to the sons and to the matrimonial properties (with
                    “plaintiff” referring to the husband and “defendant”
                    referring to the wife):</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       As is evident from their occupations and the
                    list of matrimonial properties, both parties are capable professionals and are
                    financially secure. I granted custody of the third son to the husband despite
                    the revelation that he is not the biological father as the third son was
                    embraced by the husband and his half-brothers as part of the family and their
                    relationship was good. The third son had also grown up for about a decade with
                    the knowledge that this was his family and it would be unwise, in my view, to
                    split up the family now as a result of the wife’s belated confession and
                    revelation. Moreover, the third son appeared to harbour hostility and fear
                    towards his mother for breaking up the family (as revealed in a Custody
                    Evaluation Report). That is understandable in the circumstances. The same report
                    dated 6 January 2010 in fact recommended that “the current access
                    between (the wife) and (the second son and the third son) be suspended
                    indefinitely” and that “it may resume when (the second son) and/or
                    (the third son) wish(es) to resume face-to-face contact with (the wife)”.
                    The wife, who was represented by senior counsel during the first hearing, filed
                    notice of appeal to the Court of Appeal against the orders made at the first
                    hearing.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Events after the first hearing</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       On 30 July 2010, at the request of the
                    wife’s former solicitors, I heard further submissions relating to the
                    implementation of order no. 9 set out above at <a href="#p1_4">[4]</a> relating to the third son’s Hong Kong citizenship. The
                    wife had alleged that the husband could not return to Hong Kong as he would be
                    subject to some investigations by the police there. He was therefore unable to
                    bring the third son to Hong Kong to renew his citizenship upon the latter
                    attaining 11 years of age. She wanted to be the parent to bring the third son to
                    Hong Kong to do that. This allegation was denied by the husband.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       Having perused the relevant documents from the
                    Hong Kong Immigration Department, I was of the view that the third son’s
                    citizenship was intact and no renewal was needed. As the third son was not in
                    Hong Kong on his 11<sup>th</sup> birthday, he only needed to
                    apply for a new identity card within 30 days of his return to Hong Kong but
                    there was no time limit under Hong Kong law for him to return there after
                    turning 11. In any event, that did not affect his citizenship. When I made the
                    said order no. 9 above, I was given to understand that some step had to be taken
                    to renew the third son’s citizenship but it became apparent from the Hong
                    Kong Immigration Department’s documents that there was no such
                    requirement. The wife suggested that the law might change in time to come but
                    the court proceeds on what Hong Kong law is at the relevant date, not what it
                    might possibly be in the future.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       Soon after the hearing of 30 July 2010, the
                    wife’s former solicitors filed notice of withdrawal of the appeal against
                    the orders made at the first hearing. She then engaged her present
                    solicitors.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       On 29 October 2010, the wife’s present
                    solicitors wrote to the court to request that access to the third son “be
                    arranged freely between (the third son) and herself, whenever and wherever it is
                    comfortable for (the third son)”. They also stated that the wife was
                    prepared to bring the third son to Hong Kong for the renewal of his citizenship.
                    The husband’s solicitors objected to a further hearing to go over issues
                    which had already been argued and determined. I did not accede to the
                    wife’s request for a further hearing.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Summons No 5814 of 2010</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     On 14 December 2010, the wife applied under
                    Summons No 5814 of 2010 for the following orders:</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(1)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">that arrangements be put in place for the wife

<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(4)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">that leave be granted to the wife to travel with
                            the third son to Hong Kong to enable the third son to take the necessary
                            steps to renew his Hong Kong ID;</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(5)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">that pursuant to paragraph 6(b) of the Order of
                            Court dated 28 June 2010, leave be granted to the wife to pay into Court
                            the husband’s 50% share of the monies (as at June 2008) in the RBC
                            Dominion Securities account and for the necessary consequential orders
                            to be made for the said monies to be paid out to the husband
                            accordingly;</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(6)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">that the wife’s costs of and incidental to
                            this application be provided for; and</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(7)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">that the wife be granted such further and/or
                            other relief/s as this Honourable Court deems fit.</div>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     In support of her application, the wife filed
                    an affidavit which, in essence, repeated much of what was said in her earlier
                    affidavits filed for the first hearing. In addition, she claimed that the third
                    son had posted on his Facebook page “that he is forming a club with the
                    clear indication that he was beaten by his brothers” and that the husband
                    had stopped him from joining the drama club, a popular activity of the school.
                    She also claimed that a friend of the third son had posted on Facebook that the
                    third son would not like to spend his birthday with his family. She also alleged
                    that his academic results, particularly in mathematics, were declining,
                    indicating the level of care that he was receiving. As the wife was trained as
                    an engineer and is proficient in mathematics, she would be in a good position to
                    help with his school work.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     The wife also claimed that her work now
                    enables her to remain in Singapore for longer periods and not just during the
                    weekends as in the past and that the third son’s natural father in Hong
                    Kong adores him.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     In relation to the RBC Dominion Securities
                    account, the wife expressed her concerns again about paying the 50% share to the
                    husband as ordered by the court at the first hearing because of the alleged
                    ongoing investigations in Hong Kong concerning the husband. She said she had
                    been advised by her Hong Kong solicitors that in order to protect herself from
                    any indirect link with the commercial crime investigations, the husband’s
                    50% share should be paid into court here or any relevant Singapore authority and
                    that it be released to the husband only upon satisfactory written confirmation
                    from the Hong Kong police that the investigations were completed and closed.
                    Alternatively, she was prepared to furnish a bank guarantee pending the
                    completion of the said investigations. In her solicitors’ submissions, the
                    wife wanted the husband to get a “Good Citizen Certificate” from
                    the Hong Kong police to prove that he is not undergoing investigations and that
                    there are no pending charges against him since he denied her allegations.
                    Alternatively, she proposed that payment of the 50% share be made to the
                    children.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     About a week before the hearing of the
                    wife’s application, the court received a letter from [D], former principal
                    of [E School], and his wife volunteering themselves as mediators for the wife
                    and the third son to meet and communicate with each other. It was subsequently
                    confirmed by both parties’ solicitors that a copy of the letter was also
                    sent to them.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     The husband objected to the wife’s
                    application on the grounds of <em>res judicata</em> and
                    abuse of process. He claimed that she was merely rehashing the same events and
                    attempting to re-argue matters which had already been determined by the court.
                    He also alleged that her application was no more than a backdoor appeal against
                    the orders made at the first hearing when she had already abandoned her appeal
                    to the Court of Appeal and that her continuous correspondence with the court
                    coupled with the present application amounted to unjust
                harassment.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     On the merits of the wife’s contentions,
                    the husband said that the exhibits produced by her did not support what she was
                    alleging concerning the third son. He claimed that her attempts to create
                    discord in his family had caused a lot of distress to the third son. In relation
                    to the orders concerning the matrimonial assets, the husband said that the wife
                    “had demonstrated blatant disregard and contumacy against the orders of
                    court” and that the RBC Dominion Securities account issue was another
                    illustration of her inability and unwillingness to comply with the said
                    orders.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     It would be quite apparent from what has been
                    set out earlier that the subject matters raised in the wife’s application
                    have been canvassed and decided by me at the first hearing. In my opinion, she
                    was seeking every excuse to try to re-argue or to make further submissions in
                    the hope that the court would eventually make an order acceptable to her. The
                    third son had also written to rebuff her attempts to make him feel insecure and
                    unwanted in his family. In his email of 31 December 2010 to the husband’s
                    solicitors, he complained that the wife (whom he referred to by name and not as
                    “mother”) had been sending him email that he found “very
                    offensive” as she kept mentioning that he was an “orphan
                    child” and a “tool for revenge” and that he was not loved
                    by his family. He stated that he “would like her to understand that not
                    everyone is as twisted as her”. The wife alleged constantly that the
                    third son was being pressured by the family to behave in a hostile manner
                    towards her. However, her allegations were not borne out by the Custody
                    Evaluation Report (referred to at <a href="#p1_5">[5]</a> above).
                    Her constant harping on the renewal of the third son’s Hong Kong identity
                    card could only strengthen the suspicion that all she wanted was to gain access
                    to him despite his wishes and current feelings.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     Where the RBC Dominion Securities account was
                    concerned, the same issue was also repeated by her. She was effectively making
                    an accusation against the husband and then asking him to prove his innocence. If
                    the Hong Kong police wanted to contact the husband for any purpose or to place
                    some form of injunction against his properties, they would surely know where he
                    was and what properties he possessed. If they did not, I am quite certain the
                    wife would have assisted them. There were also ample assets in Hong Kong for
                    them to seize. Even if the husband is subsequently proved to have been involved
                    in illegal activities in Hong Kong, I was of the view that the wife could not be
                    faulted in any way for complying with a lawful order of a foreign court of
                    competent jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     In the circumstances, I was compelled to
                    dismiss her application with costs fixed at $1,500. I reiterated, as I did at
                    the conclusion of the first hearing, that the order suspending access for one
                    year was not to punish her for her past conduct but to allow everyone,
                    especially the sons, some breathing space and not to be caught in constant
                    conflict between the husband and the wife.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     The wife has lodged an appeal to the Court of
                    Appeal in Civil Appeal No. 23 of 2011 against the dismissal of her
                    application.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Events subsequent to Summons No 5814 of 2010</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     On 9 May 2011, I heard three applications by
                    the parties. The first was taken out by the wife for enforcement of the orders
                    made at the first hearing concerning two of the Hong Kong immovable properties
                    (Summons No. 1455 of 2011). The second was taken out by the husband for
                    enforcement of the orders concerning the three Singapore immovable properties
                    and the RBC Dominion Securities account (Summons No. 1630 of 2011). The final
                    application was by the wife for a stay of execution of the orders relating to
                    the RBC Dominion Securities account pending the outcome of the wife’s
                    appeal to the Court of Appeal mentioned in <a href="#p1_20">[20]</a> above (Summons No. 1934 of 2011).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     I made the following orders in respect of
                    these three applications:</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(1)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">The wife is to proceed to transfer the two Hong
                            Kong immovable properties to her sole name as the husband has done all
                            that is necessary on his part.</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(2)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">The wife is to sign all relevant transfer
                            documents for the three Singapore immovable properties and to instruct
                            her Singapore conveyancing solicitors (who are not the solicitors in the
                            current applications) to transfer all the documents to the
                            husband’s Singapore solicitors within two weeks.</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(3)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">The wife’s Hong Kong solicitors are to
                            furnish a bill regarding the transfer of the Hong Kong immovable
                            properties to the wife’s sole name.</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(4)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">The husband’s Singapore solicitors are to

                            husband’s sole name.</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(5)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">The conversion rate for Singapore and Hong Kong
                            dollars is to be the rate as at 9 May 2011.</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(6)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">The parties will thereafter set off their
                            respective bills and make the payment accordingly.</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(7)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">The wife is to pay the husband’s 50% share
                            in the RBC Dominion Securities account into court in Singapore within
                            two weeks and to notify the husband’s solicitors immediately of
                            such payment in.</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(8)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">Thereafter, there be payment out of court of the

<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(9)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">The wife is to pay the husband $1,500 costs for
                            these three applications.</div>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     I finally decided to order payment into court
                    of the husband’s 50% share in the RBC Dominion Securities account so as to
                    stop the wife from repeating the same story over and over again about her fears
                    of being implicated in the alleged questionable past financial activities of the
                    husband. In her affidavit in support of this application, she said:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I had on 11 February 2011 written to the Commercial Crime Bureau of the
                        Hong Kong Police informing them that I was required by an Order made by the
                        Singapore Courts to pay to the Plaintiff a certain amount of monies. I had
                        enquired if I could forward the money to the Plaintiff despite the ongoing
                        investigations. Before the Hong Kong Police replied, the
                        Inspector-in-Charge, Senior Inspector Lau Chi Chung (Telephone No. 28604828)
                        called me and confirmed that the investigations were still ongoing and
                        investigations have been forwarded to the Legal Department pending the
                        return of the Plaintiff. I tried to ask the police to include this fact of
                        the ongoing investigations in the reply but this was refused by the Hong
                        Kong Police as this concern a criminal case investigation and I am not
                        officially authorized by the Plaintiff to represent him in any aspect. As a
                        gesture of goodwill, I had also asked the police whether the police would
                        consider a settlement of the issue. The police indicated that since the case
                        was in the hands of the Legal Department, this would be a decision to be
                        made by the Legal Department. <em>The police also asked for a
                            full set of the Divorce documents which I refused to provide. I was not
                            sure whether the police would use the documents to force the Plaintiff
                            to return to Hong Kong</em>. The Hong Kong Police replied on 1
                        March 2011 but they did not give instructions that I could forward the
                        monies to the Plaintiff. I would assume if there were no ongoing
                        investigations by the Hong Kong Police as to the Plaintiff’s
                        questionable activities, they would have given a clear answer for the
                        payment to process as the government will not interfere in any
                        citizen’s private money transaction issues.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     The wife exhibited her letter dated 11
                    February 2011 (wrongly stated as 11 February 2010) to the Hong Kong Police which
                    reads as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I am [name and identity number].</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I was told by a Mr Kwok (Tel 28607803) of Hong Kong Police that my former
                        husband, [name and identity number] was located by the Commercial Crime
                        Bureau of Hong Kong Police, and for this purpose a written letter was
                        forwarded to the Singapore Police for their reference.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Recently there is a Singapore court order providing that I should forward
                        around HK$7 million to [husband’s name] from one of the Hong Kong
                        account, under my sole name as settlement of the divorce case with
                        [husband’s name].</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I indicated to the Singapore Government the situation of
                        [husband’s name]. As I am afraid that the release of money may
                        constitute money laundry, I had suggested to the Singapore court:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">1.    To maintain the money in the Hong Kong account
                                (with bank undertaking) upon the return of [husband’s name] to
                                Hong Kong and the settlement of the case with the Commercial Crime
                                Bureau, Hong Kong Police.</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">2.    To forward the money either to the Singapore or
                                Hong Kong Government.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I was advised by the Singapore court that clarification should be made
                        with the Commercial Crime Bureau.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">If it is advised by the Hong Kong Police that I should forward the money
                        to [husband’s name] despite the unsettled case, I would follow the
                        instruction accordingly.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Please do not hesitate to contact me if any further information is
                        required.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[Address and telephone numbers]</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Thank you for your attention.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     The Hong Kong Police’s reply dated
                    1 March 2011 to the wife reads:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Thank you for your letter dated 11<sup>th</sup> February
                        2011 and your further information provided on
                            21<sup>st</sup> February 2011.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Based upon the documents you provided, there is insufficient information
                        for us to verify your assertion on the details of court order.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Please be informed that since the case is only a civil matter in a foreign
                        jurisdiction, we are not in a position to provide you with any
                        comment/advice in this respect.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Should you have any query, please contact the Officer-in-charge Senior
                        Inspector LAU Chi-chung of FS 2D CCB 28604828.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     It is not clear what documents the wife had
                    given to the Hong Kong Police. It is also hard to understand why the wife said
                    in [23]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The police also asked for a full set of the Divorce documents which I
                        refused to provide. I was not sure whether the police would use the
                        documents to force the Plaintiff to return to Hong Kong.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Why was she concerned about any forced repatriation of the husband?
                    Further, even if there were ongoing investigations, that did not mean that the
                    husband had committed some crime. I repeat here my opinion stated in <a href="#p1_18">[18]</a> above.</p>
