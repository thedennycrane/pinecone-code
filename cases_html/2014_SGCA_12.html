<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       The present proceedings involve a
                    child, [B], his Singaporean mother and his German father. This appeal was
                    brought by the mother (“the Appellant”) against the High Court’s affirmation of
                    the District Court’s decision allowing the application of the father (“the
                    Respondent”) under s 8(1) of the International Child Abduction Act (Cap 143C,
                    2011 Rev Ed) (“the Act”) for the return of [B] to Germany on the basis that he
                    ([B]) had been wrongfully retained in Singapore by the Appellant. The Appellant
                    resisted the application under, <em>inter alia</em>,
                        Art 13(<em>b</em>) of the Hague Convention on the Civil
                    Aspects of International Child Abduction (“the Hague Convention”) (which is
                    given effect to in Singapore by the Act), which gives the court the discretion
                    not to order the return of the child if there is a grave risk that the return
                    would expose the child to physical or psychological harm or otherwise place the
                    child in an intolerable situation. This is, in fact, the first case under the
                    Act and the Hague Convention to be litigated in Singapore.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       In the present appeal, the
                    Appellant contended that an order for [B]’s return to Germany should be refused
                    under Art 13(<em>b</em>) of the Hague Convention as [B]
                    would be at grave risk of psychological harm or would otherwise be placed in an
                    intolerable situation due to the separation of [B] from the Appellant, his
                    mother. This impending separation was purportedly due to the Appellant’s
                    inability, on medical (specifically, psychological) reasons, to return to
                    Germany with [B] should a return order be made. We made a return order in
                    respect of [B], albeit subject to both parties providing certain specific
                    undertakings. We now set out the detailed grounds for our
                decision.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Facts</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Background to the dispute</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       The brief facts of the case are as
                    follows. The Appellant and the Respondent got to know each other over the
                    Internet in 2007, and met in person only in 2009 when the Appellant travelled to
                    Germany to meet the Respondent. The Appellant became pregnant during the visit
                    and the parties then married in Denmark on 30 October 2009, after which the
                    couple set up home in Germany. [B] was born in Germany on 16 April
                2010.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       The Respondent lives with his
                    parents in a three-storey apartment in the village of [S] in Germany and works
                    as a registered nurse in the nearby town of [M]. The Appellant did not work
                    during the marriage, and she and the child were supported by the Respondent.
                    Initially the couple lived by themselves but they subsequently moved in with the
                    Respondent’s parents. The Appellant found life difficult in Germany partly
                    because she could not speak the language and partly because the family was
                    living in a very small town. There were quarrels and differences between the
                    Appellant and the Respondent, and between the Appellant and her
                    mother-in-law.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       On 1 November 2010, the Appellant
                    and [B] visited Singapore. The visit was supposed to have lasted five weeks but
                    the Appellant extended it to February 2011 so that she could spend Chinese New
                    Year with her family. On 30 January 2011, the Respondent came to Singapore to
                    persuade the Appellant to return home, and eventually the family returned to
                    Germany on 7 February 2011. Before coming to Singapore, the Respondent had made
                    an application to a German court as a result of which, on 15 February 2011, the
                    German court made an interim order that the Respondent was to have the sole
                    right to determine [B]’s place of abode. On 14 July 2011, on an application by
                    the Respondent to restore the Appellant’s right to decide the place of abode of
                    the child, the German court ordered that the parties should jointly exercise the
                    right of determination of [B]’s abode.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       On 18 January 2012, the Appellant,
                    the Respondent and [B] travelled to Singapore to celebrate Chinese New Year with
                    the Appellant’s relatives. They were scheduled to return to Germany on
                    17 February 2012, but in the event only the Respondent returned. The Appellant
                    and [B] remained behind and have not left Singapore since. The Appellant was
                    then pregnant again with the parties’ second child, [J], who was born in
                    Singapore on 21 August 2012.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       On 2 March 2012, upon the
                    application of the Respondent, the German court made an interim order that the
                    exercise of “paternal authority” over [B] was to be transferred to the
                    Respondent alone, and that the Appellant was to hand [B] over to the Respondent
                    who was entitled to bring him back to Germany. Subsequently, the Respondent
                    applied to the German Central Authority for a “Request for Return” pursuant to
                    the Hague Convention. He also applied to the Singapore Central Authority for its
                    assistance to help effect the voluntary return of [B].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       The Singapore Central Authority
                    contacted the Appellant on 4 April 2012 and, on 7 April 2012, the Respondent and
                    the Respondent’s father arrived in Singapore to retrieve [B]. The Appellant
                    refused to hand over [B] and, on 24 April 2012, commenced proceedings for the
                    sole custody and care and control of [B]. The Appellant’s application was stayed
                    pursuant to s 13 of the Act when, on 31 May 2012, the Respondent brought an
                    application under the Act for a return order to Germany in respect of [B]. This
                    is the application which gave rise to the proceedings culminating in the present
                    appeal. It is to be noted that the application concerned [B] alone (who was
                    about two years of age at the time of the application). It did not involve the
                    parties’ second child, [J].</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The proceedings below</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The District Court proceedings</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       The present proceedings were
                    commenced in the District Court in accordance with the Transfer Order made by
                    the Chief Justice on 1 March 2011 specifying that any proceedings under the Act
                    are to be heard and determined by the District Court at first instance. The
                    District Court judge (“the DJ”) heard the parties over several days in July and
                    August 2012.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     On 21 August 2012, the DJ
                    ordered the return of [B] to Germany. She also made certain orders regarding the
                    arrangements pursuant to which [B]’s return would take place. In particular, the
                    Appellant was to hand over [B] and his travel documents to the Respondent who
                    would bring the child back to Germany. The child would thereafter reside with
                    the Respondent in Germany pending resolution of custody proceedings by the
                    German court, subject to the Appellant having access to [B] twice a week for a
                    period of four hours each. Additionally, the Respondent undertook, <em>inter alia</em>, to pay for rental accommodation in Germany
                    for the Appellant and the second child, [J], as well as to provide interim
                    monthly maintenance in the sum of €491 for both the Appellant and
                [J].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     Before the DJ, the Appellant had
                    argued that returning to Germany with [B] would expose her to physical and
                    psychological harm and [B] to psychological harm or would otherwise place [B] in
                    an intolerable position. The Appellant alleged that she had been psychologically
                    abused by the Respondent’s parents and physically abused by the Respondent. The
                    DJ considered these allegations in detail in her Grounds of Decision (see
                        <em>BDT v BDU</em> [2012] SGDC 363 (“the DC
                    Judgment”)). Whilst accepting that there had been problems between the Appellant
                    and her mother-in-law, the DJ held that this did not constitute grave harm and
                    did not have an impact on [B] (see the DC Judgment at [76]). The DJ found that
                    the evidence demonstrated that the Appellant did not regard the alleged domestic
                    violence by the Respondent to be so serious as to affect the marriage or her
                    ability to care for [B] (see the DC Judgment at [78]). She also noted that there
                    was no allegation of any child abuse or mistreatment with regard to [B] himself
                    (see the DC Judgment at [81]). The DJ concluded that the alleged harm from
                    domestic violence could not be so grave or intolerable to the Appellant as to
                    enable her to use it as a basis for a defence under Art 13(<em>b</em>).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     The DJ made her decision on the
                    basis of, <em>inter alia</em>, a report on [B] dated
                    13 July 2012 by Dr Lim Yun Chin (“Dr Lim”), a psychologist engaged by the
                    Appellant. In the report (“Dr Lim’s First Report”), Dr Lim noted that [B]’s
                    feelings of security and well-being were contingent on the Appellant’s physical
                    presence, such that it would not be in [B]’s psychological and social interests
                    to separate him from his mother. He opined that the Appellant could not return
                    to Germany and to require her to do so would be to court disaster because of the
                    absence of the support of the Respondent and her in-laws’ hostility towards
                    her.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     The DJ accorded little weight to
                    Dr Lim’s First Report as it was based solely on information provided by the
                    Appellant as well as three sessions of observation of interaction only between
                    the Appellant and the child (see the DC Judgment at [83]). In the round, the DJ
                    found that there was no compelling evidence that [B] would be placed in an
                    intolerable situation if he were to be returned to Germany, or that the German
                    authorities would not be able to protect him.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The High Court proceedings</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     The Appellant filed an appeal
                    against the decision of the DJ on 31 August 2012. However, the appeal thereafter
                    took over half a year to reach the High Court. This was partly because the
                    Appellant’s lawyers discharged themselves as the Appellant was unable to afford
                    private representation and the Appellant then had to apply for legal aid. On
                    1 February 2013, the Appellant commenced divorce proceedings in the Family Court
                    on the basis of the Respondent’s alleged unreasonable behaviour. On 25 March
                    2013, the appeal against the DJ’s decision was finally heard by the High Court
                    judge (“the Judge”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     Before the Judge, the Appellant
                    relied greatly on a further report from Dr Lim dated 1 February 2013 (“Dr Lim’s
                    Further Report”) as evidence of the deterioration in her mental health since the
                    hearing before the DJ. In this report, Dr Lim expressed the view that the
                    Appellant had been routinely abused both physically and emotionally. Dr Lim
                    diagnosed the Appellant with a major depressive disorder and opined that the
                    possibility of losing [B] would push her towards a situation of risk in which
                    she could endanger herself and [J]. Dr Lim opined that it was doubtful if the
                    Appellant could cope with life in Germany and that there was a real risk of
                    suicide for the Appellant if she was forced to move there or if either child was
                    removed from her. Dr Lim further opined that to separate [B] from his mother and
                    brother, [J], would lead to severe emotional upheaval as well as long term harm
                    to [B].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     In her judgment dated 15 May
                    2013 in <em>BDU v BDT</em> [2013] 3 SLR 535 (“the
                    Judgment”), the Judge dismissed the appeal on the ground that the Appellant had
                    not discharged the requisite burden under Art 13(<em>b</em>). In particular:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_16-p2_a"></a>(a)     
            <em>In
                            relation to the Appellant’s allegations of domestic violence</em>,
                        the Judge found that the DJ was entitled to find, on the evidence before
                        her, that violence was not a serious issue in the marriage. The Judge
                        observed (at [95] of the Judgment) that “[t]here may have been some violence
                        in the marriage but the circumstances in which such violence occurred have
                        not been established and therefore it is impossible to decide whether the
                        aggressor was the mother or the father” and that “[t]he mother was not
                        consistent in her reactions to the abuse”. The Judge accordingly found that
                        the alleged presence of violence in the marriage would not provide a
                        legitimate reason for the Appellant not to return to Germany with
                        [B].</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_16-p2_b"></a>(b)     
            <em>In relation to the alleged risk of harm to
                            [B]</em>, the Judge noted that such risk was alleged by the
                        Appellant to arise from:</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_16-p2_b-p3_i"></a>(i)       any separation of [B] from his mother and brother,
                        and</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_16-p2_b-p3_ii"></a>(ii)       the impact on [B] if the Appellant harms
                    herself.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_16-p2_ii"></a>(ii)     In this regard, the Judge noted that the child’s separation distress would
                        be ameliorated somewhat if [B] had a reasonable relationship with a loving
                        father and if the Appellant returned to Germany with [B] and had frequent
                        contact with [B] (see the Judgment at [96]). She observed that the risk of
                        separation of [B] from his mother arose mainly from the possibility that the
                        Appellant would not return to Germany with him.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_16-p2_c"></a>(c)     Whilst the Appellant maintained
                        that she was unable (as opposed to unwilling) to return to Germany with [B],
                        the Judge was not convinced by this. The Judge was primarily of the view
                        that she could not overturn the findings of the DJ unless they were against
                        the weight of evidence. The Judge observed that whilst the practical living
                        situation facing the Appellant in Germany would not be an easy one, there
                        were support facilities available to her and she would also have access to
                        legal advice (see the Judgment at [97]). Further, the undertakings given by
                        the Respondent (with respect to, <em>inter alia</em>,
                        the Appellant’s and [J]’s maintenance and accommodation) (see above at [10])
                        were intended to alleviate her difficulties. Whilst the Appellant had
                        criticised these undertakings as being inadequate, she had not made any
                        concrete suggestions as to what undertakings would satisfy her. Finally,
                        whilst it remained a concern that the Appellant expressed suicidal thoughts,
                        the Judge noted that these had <em>not</em> been made
                        known to Dr Lim until <em>after</em> the DJ’s decision
                        ordering the return of [B]. The Judge also considered it noteworthy that the
                        Appellant had continuously refused the recommended course of antidepressant
                        medication on account of her breastfeeding her second child, [J],
                        notwithstanding that other suitable methods were available for feeding the
                        child. In the words of the Judge, “[t]he mother has not helped herself very
                        much” (see the Judgment at [106]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The Judge therefore concluded that the Appellant had not discharged her burden
                    under Art 13(<em>b</em>), and affirmed the return order in
                    respect of [B]. However, noting the Appellant’s argument that it would be highly
                    stressful for [B] to see her only twice a week for four hours each time, the
                    Judge required a further undertaking from the Respondent that as long as the
                    Appellant was in Germany, she would be able to have daily access to [B] (see the
                    Judgment at [107]).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The parties’ respective cases</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     On appeal, the Appellant argued
                    that an order for [B]’s return to Germany should be refused under
                        Art 13(<em>b</em>) of the Hague Convention as [B] would
                    be at grave risk of psychological harm or would otherwise be placed in an
                    intolerable situation if the return order was made. This grave risk or
                    intolerable situation was said to emanate from the separation of [B] from his
                    mother and his brother, [J], owing to the Appellant’s <em>inability due to medical (and in particular, psychological)
                        reasons</em> to return to Germany with [B] should a return order for
                    [B] be made. The Appellant cited various reasons to justify her alleged
                    inability to return to Germany, namely:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_17-p2_a"></a>(a)     the alleged physical
                        and emotional violence inflicted on her by the Respondent during the
                        marriage;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_17-p2_b"></a>(b)     her difficulties in adapting to life in Germany and her
                        difficult relations with the Respondent’s family, and in particular, his
                        mother; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_17-p2_c"></a>(c)     the alleged risk that she will commit suicide in Germany if
                        she returns with [B].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     In response, the Respondent
                    disputed the Appellant’s allegations of physical and emotional violence, and
                    alleged that she was the aggressor during these incidents. The Respondent
                    contended that Dr Lim’s assessment of the Appellant’s mental state and her
                    account of her alleged abuse should be disregarded as Dr Lim did not have the
                    benefit of the Respondent’s account of the relevant matters. The Respondent also
                    contended that there was no increased risk of suicide to the Appellant if she
                    returned to Germany, and that the Appellant was in fact <em>unwilling as opposed to unable</em> to return to
                Germany.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The present appeal</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     The present appeal was heard
                    before us on 22 July 2013. Given that a central question in the proceedings was
                    the Appellant’s alleged inability for medical reasons to return to Germany with
                    [B], we appointed an independent court expert, Dr Rathi Mahendran
                    (“Dr Mahendran”), to assess the risk of physical and psychological harm to the
                    Appellant (including any risk of suicide and/or self-harm) should an order be
                    made returning [B] to Germany in the company of the Appellant pending the
                    determination of custody issues by the German courts. We adjourned the matter to
                    allow Dr Mahendran to examine and provide a psychiatric report on the
                    Appellant.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Dr Mahendran’s report</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     Based on interviews with the
                    Appellant and, <em>inter alia</em>, the Respondent, his
                    parents and the Appellant’s mother and brother, as well as the relevant court
                    and medical documentation, Dr Mahendran prepared a psychiatric report on the
                    Appellant dated 16 September 2013 (“Dr Mahendran’s Report”). Her findings are
                    summarised as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_20-p2_a"></a>(a)     
            <em>Diagnosis</em>
</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_20-p2_a-p3_i"></a>(i)       Dr Mahendran diagnosed the Appellant with “<em>Delusion
                                Disorder (Jealous and Persecutory types)</em>”. In particular,
                            Dr Mahendran noted that the Appellant had delusional beliefs about the
                            Respondent’s infidelity as well as unwarranted suspicions and hostility
                            towards her in-laws.</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_20-p2_a-p3_ii"></a>(ii)       Dr Mahendran noted that the Appellant did <em>not</em> have a <em>depressive
                                disorder</em>. However, she had poor insight into her illness
                            and her judgment was affected by the illness.</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_20-p2_a-p3_iii"></a>(iii)       Whilst the Appellant had made verbal threats of suicide and threats to
                            harm her children, these were not in relation to a depressed mood but
                            were threats intended to frighten the Respondent and were possibly made
                            out of desperation.</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_20-p2_a-p3_iv"></a>(iv)       The Appellant’s ability to provide physical care for her children was
                            not impaired in any way. However, the decisions she might have to make
                            for them may be affected by poor judgment and delusional
                        beliefs.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_20-p2_b"></a>(b)     
            <em>Prognosis</em>
</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_20-p2_b-p3_i"></a>(i)       According to Dr Mahendran (at para 4.2 of her report), “[w]ithout
                            treatment for the Delusional Disorder [the Appellant] will continue to
                            act on her delusions and create problems for her husband whether she is
                            in Singapore or Germany”. Dr Mahendran also noted the Appellant is more
                            likely to become disruptive and grow worse in Germany, and may become
                            functionally impaired and incapable of managing herself or [J]. All in
                            all, Dr Mahendran opined that the “prognosis [was]
                        poor”.</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_20-p2_b-p3_ii"></a>(ii)       Whilst an accurate prediction of suicide risk was difficult,
                            Dr Mahendran stated that the general indicators showed that the risk of
                            suicide was low.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_20-p2_c"></a>(c)     
            <em>Recommendation</em>
</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_20-p2_c-p3_i"></a>(i)       In the circumstances, Dr Mahendran recommended that the Appellant
                            start treatment in Singapore in order to minimise the risk of
                            non-adherence to treatment and achieve some symptom control before (and
                            if) she leaves for Germany.</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_20-p2_c-p3_ii"></a>(ii)       Dr Mahendran then opined (at para 5.1 of her report) that “[h]er care
                            can then be transferred to Germany with clear management plans
                            formulated for continuity of care” and that “[h]er symptoms would be
                            better controlled and hopefully this would increase treatment compliance
                            and her ability to cope in Germany”.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The order and undertakings</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     On 18 October 2013, the court
                    convened to hear the submissions of the parties on the appropriate course of
                    action, given the findings in Dr Mahendran’s Report. After hearing both parties,
                    we indicated that we intended to make a return order of the child to Germany
                    subject to the Respondent giving satisfactory undertakings. However, having
                    regard to Dr Mahendran’s Report and the views expressed therein, we were
                    prepared to defer the return order for a specified period (possibly a period of
                    up to three months) if the Appellant undertook to immediately undergo treatment
                    in accordance with the recommendations set out in Dr Mahendran’s Report. Whilst
                    we could have taken the view that the Appellant had failed unreasonably to avail
                    herself of treatment thus far, we were prepared to put this to one side if the
                    Appellant fulfilled the aforesaid undertaking.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     Over three hearing dates on 28
                    and 29 November and 3 December 2013, and with the input of both counsel, we
                    convened to finalise the respective undertakings to be given by the parties.
                    These undertakings were different from (and more detailed than) those in the
                    courts below, and were intended to take into account the Appellant’s
                    psychological condition as well as to ensure that the substantive proceedings in
                    the German court with regard to the custody and/or care and control of [B]
                    proceed on a level playing field in all respects. We were happy to note that the
                    Appellant indicated that she would return to Germany together with her other
                    child, [J], when the return order in respect of [B] takes effect. In these
                    circumstances, we considered it more appropriate for [B] to reside with the
                    Appellant and [J] in Germany, with reasonable access being granted to the
                    Respondent (the details with respect to such access being set out in the
                    parties’ undertakings). The parties’ undertakings were eventually incorporated
                    into the return order.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     In summary, we ordered the
                    return of [B] to Germany before the expiry of 2.5 months from 1 December 2013
                    subject to the parties providing, <em>inter alia</em>, the

                    judgment (“the Annex”) and will be discussed further in our section dealing with
                    the reasons for our decision (below at [78]–[85]). In the meantime, we turn to
                    the relevant legal principles which informed our decision.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The applicable legal principles</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     The relevant Convention which
                    constitutes the legal focus of the present appeal is the Hague Convention, which
                    is now given effect to in the Singapore context pursuant to the
                Act.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The general rule and the rationale of jurisdiction
                selection</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     It is of the first importance to
                    note right at the outset what the Hague Convention covers and (perhaps more
                    importantly) what it does <em>not</em>. An excellent
                    starting-point in this regard is the following summary by Prof Leong Wai Kum
                    (see Leong Wai Kum, <em>Elements of Family Law in
                        Singapore</em> (2nd ed, LexisNexis, 2013) at p 270):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It follows from the above that these objectives [of the Hague Convention]
                        are fairly limited. The [Hague] Convention may be understood, particularly
                        by a conflicts lawyer, as <b><em>an agreement among nations on
                            ‘jurisdiction selection’ in matters relating to custody and care of a

                            select </em><em>the courts of the country of
                            habitual residence of the child to be the courts to decide all issues of
                            custody and care. Every other court will thus seek only to, as quickly
                            as possible, return the child to the court of her habitual residence. In
                            particular, every other court will not seek to investigate for itself
                            what might be the best possible order regarding the custody and care of
                            the child.</em><sup></sup>This, as agreed, should be left to the court of her habitual
                        residence.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It is, therefore, not a valid criticism that, in ordering the return of
                        the child to her habitual residence, the court has overlooked some argument
                        relating to her welfare. <em>Every court other than the court
                            of her habitual residence has agreed to desist from investigating into
                            the substantive issues relating to her welfare to defer to the court of
                            her habitual residence</em>. Put another way, the understanding of
                        the child’s welfare under the [Hague] Convention is not the substantive
                        understanding (as under the domestic law of guardianship and custody) but
                        rather the more limited understanding, that where she has been unlawfully
                        removed from her habitual residence, her welfare is best served by swiftly
                        returning her to her habitual residence. There the courts will look into the
                        substantive issues.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added in italics and bold italics]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     Put simply, the court of the
                    country to which the child has been brought (in this case, Singapore) is –
                    pursuant to the Hague Convention – concerned <em>only</em>
                    with the return of the child concerned to his or her country of habitual
                    residence from which he or she was first abducted, subject only to the limited
                    exceptions set out in, <em>inter alia</em>, Art 13 of that
                    Convention. It is <em>not</em> concerned with the
                    substantive merits relating to the relevant issues of custody and/or care and
                    control between the parents concerned (still less is it a Convention for the
                    reciprocal recognition and enforcement of foreign custody orders (see David
                    McClean, <em>The Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of

                        Documentation prepared for Commonwealth Jurisdictions</em>
                    (Commonwealth Secretariat, London, 1997) (“<em>McClean</em>”) at p 6). Indeed, this point is made clear beyond
                    peradventure by Art 19 of the Hague Convention, which reads as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">A decision under this Convention concerning the return of the child shall

<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Compromise, balance and Art 13(b)</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     It is important to note that the
                    concept of jurisdiction selection embodied in Art 13 of the Hague Convention
                    represents <em>a compromise</em> which is intended to
                    ensure that the Convention is practical and workable across the various
                    jurisdictions (indeed, this has been described as “a fragile compromise” (see
                    Elisa Pérez-Vera, <em>Explanatory Report on the 1980 Hague Child
                        Abduction Convention</em> (HCCH Publications, 1982) (“<em>Pérez-Vera</em>”) at para 116); reference may also be made to
                    the New Zealand High Court decision of <em>El Sayed v Secretary
                        for Justice</em> [2003] 1 NZLR 349 (“<em>El
                        Sayed</em>”) at [53]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     Conceptually, it is not
                    difficult to understand why a compromise was needed. There appear (see below at
                    [34]) to be two extreme ends of the legal spectrum. On the one end was the need
                    to have regard on an <em>individual</em> level to the
                    paramount interests of the child concerned. On the other end, there was the need
                    on a <em>more general policy</em> level to ensure that
                    abducted children were returned swiftly to their respective countries of
                    habitual residence. It is easy to see how the former might in fact impede the
                    latter. Given that the entire <em>raison d’être</em> of the
                    Hague Convention is to ensure the latter (see Art 1 of the Convention), it comes
                    as no surprise that the Convention focuses instead on the <em>general</em> concept of jurisdiction selection.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     However, there are
                    understandable concerns that, in ensuring the swift return of abducted children
                    to their respective countries of habitual residence, this more general aim could
                    simultaneously result (in some instances at least) in detrimental effects on
                    those children such that exceptions to their return are justified. As observed
                    by A E Anton, who in fact chaired the Commission which drafted the Hague
                    Convention (see A E Anton, “The Hague Convention on International Child
                    Abduction” (1981) 30 ICLQ 537 (“<em>Anton</em>”) at
                    542):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It was decided … to draft a Convention which would concern itself with
                        custody <em>rights</em> rather than with custody
                            <em>decisions</em> and which would concentrate upon
                        securing the prompt return of a child who had been removed in breach of
                        custody rights effectively exercised under the law of his habitual residence
                        [emphasis in original]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     This reflects – once again – the
                    perennial tensions in the law between the universal and the particular; between
                    the need for certainty and predictability on the one hand and the need for
                    flexibility and fairness on the other. In the circumstances, efforts were made
                    to ensure that the more general policy underlying the Hague Convention did not
                    override (at least wholly) the paramount interests of the children. It is in
                    this context that the resulting compromise in the Hague Convention arose, in the
                    form of <em>exceptions</em> to the general policy
                    (embodied, <em>inter alia</em>, within Art 13 of the Hague
                    Convention). It is not surprising, though, that these exceptions are of a very
                        <em>limited</em> nature. Indeed, if such exceptions
                    were broader, they would “swallow up” the general policy and (to utilise the
                    very apt turn of phrase in the judgment of Butler-Sloss LJ in the English Court
                    of Appeal decision of <em>C v C (Abduction: Rights of
                        Custody)</em> [1989] 1 WLR 654 (“<em>C v C</em>”)
                    at 661), “would drive a coach and four horses through the [Hague]
                    Convention”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     Any country which adopts the
                    very broad approach referred to at the end of the preceding paragraph would, in
                    the words of Kirby J in <em>De L</em> at 685, “undermine
                    the reciprocity upon which the [Hague] Convention rests” (see also <em>per</em> Lord Donaldson of Lymington MR in <em>C v C</em> at 663). This would be very unfortunate, not least because
                    the decision taken by a country to be a signatory to the Hague Convention is not
                    one to be taken lightly. For example, the Singapore Parliament wanted to be very
                    certain before it ultimately adopted the Hague Convention (see <em>Singapore Parliamentary Debates</em>, <em>Official Report</em> (16 September 2010) vol 87 at col 1267,
                        <em>per</em> Dr Vivian Balakrishnan, the Minister for
                    Community Development, Youth and Sports during the Second Reading of the
                    International Child Abduction Bill (Bill No 22 of 2010) (“the <em>Debates</em>”)), despite the many calls for it to do so (see, for
                    example, Leong Wai Kum, “International Co-operation in Child Abduction Across
                    Borders” (1999) 11 SAcLJ 409 (“<em>Leong</em>”); Leong Wai
                    Kum, “The Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction – A
                    Case for Singapore to be a Member State” <em>The Singapore Law
                        Gazette</em>, July 2005, pp 19–26; Debbie S L Ong, “Parental Child

                        Convention</em>” [2007] Sing JLS 216 (“<em>Lowe &amp; Ong</em>”)).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     That having been said, the
                    paramount interests of the individual child <em>will</em>
                    be considered and given effect to in <em>exceptional
                        situations</em> by the court in the country to which the child was
                        abducted<em>.</em> What these situations are will
                    depend, of course, on the precise fact situation concerned. Whilst this might
                    not sound satisfactory, it is a practical reality and the court simply cannot
                    avoid the inevitable issue of <em>application</em> (see
                    also <em>per</em> Gleeson CJ in <em>DP</em> (especially at 408)).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     But what, then, of the <em>general</em> situation? In our view, adhering to the concept
                    of jurisdiction selection in the <em>general</em> situation
                    pursuant to the spirit of the Hague Convention itself is not <em>necessarily</em> inconsistent with the paramount interests of the
                        <em>individual</em> child concerned. The relationship
                    between the general and the specific is, in the <em>usual</em> situation, more often than not <em>complementary</em> (as opposed to contradictory) in nature. For this
                    reason, the tension alluded to above (at [29]) is (in most situations at least)
                    more apparent than real. In particular, it will be seen that the so-called
                    (general) policy is not <em>necessarily</em> inconsistent
                    with the (particular) rights of the individual child (<em>cf
                        Lowe &amp; Ong</em> (at 228) who refer to “the individual child’s
                    welfare [being] subjected to the higher goal of preventing future
                    abductions”).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Balance, complementarity and fairness</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     In the general situation, the
                    child concerned is returned as swiftly as possible to the country of his or her
                    habitual residence. However, this does <em>not</em> mean
                    that his or her interests have been wholly ignored. Indeed, as has been
                    perceptively observed, “[t]he right not to be removed or retained in the name of
                    more or less arguable rights concerning its person is one of the most objective
                    examples of what constitutes the interests of the child” (see <em>Pérez-Vera</em> at para 24). Perhaps more importantly, what it
                        <em>does</em> mean is that the other interests relating
                    to the welfare of the child are not adjudicated upon by the court of the country
                    to which the child has been abducted. Nevertheless, this does not mean that such
                    interests are not adjudicated upon at all; such interests will, in fact, be
                    adjudicated upon in the courts of the child’s habitual residence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     Looked at in this light, there
                    is no <em>unfairness</em> to the child concerned inasmuch
                    as the Hague Convention ensures that the issues of custody and/or care and
                    control are adjudicated upon in the appropriate forum, whilst simultaneously
                    depriving the abducting parent of any juridical or other advantage which he or
                    she has unfairly sought to gain through the abduction. (In this last-mentioned
                    regard, it has been pertinently observed that “[i]t frequently happens that the
                    person retaining the child tries to obtain a judicial or administrative decision
                    in the State of refuge, which would legalize the factual situation which he has
                    just brought about” (see <em>Pérez-Vera</em> at para 14)).
                    In a similar vein, Prof Leong has observed thus (see <em>Leong</em> at p 432; reference may also be made to the observations
                    by Dr Vivian Balakrishnan <em>Debates</em> at cols 1258 and
                    1271–1272):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">That no court other than the child’s habitual residence should decide on
                        the child’s custody should not be regarded as reneging from pursuing the
                        welfare of the child. <b><em>It is simply the realisation that
                            the welfare of the child is best served when the court so desists and
                            leaves the matter in the hands of the court of proper
                            jurisdiction.</em></b> It is irrefutable that, among all the courts
                        that are interested in the child’s custody, the interest of the child’s
                        habitual residence is the strongest. [emphasis added in bold italics]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     We would also note that the
                    country of the child’s habitual residence would be a signatory to the Hague
                    Convention. Given that that country is a signatory, there is at least a
                    presumption that the courts of that country would consider the paramount
                    interests of the child concerned when deciding upon the substantive merits in
                    the context of issues relating to that child’s custody. It is of course possible
                    that that might not be the case – although this is likely (in the nature of
                    things and following from what has just been said) to be extremely rare. But
                    that is also precisely the type of situation where one or more of the exceptions
                    embodied in Art 13 can then be invoked to ensure fairness to the child
                    concerned. For example, as Doogue J observed, delivering the judgment of the New
                    Zealand Court of Appeal in <em>A v Central Authority for New
                        Zealand</em> [1996] 2 NZLR 517 (at 523):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In most instances where the best interests of the child are paramount in
                        the country of habitual residence the Courts of that country will be able to
                        deal with any possible risk to a child, thus overcoming the possible defence
                        of the abducting parent. That does not gainsay the fact that <em>in some instances there will be situations where the Courts of
                            the country to which the child has been abducted will not be so
                            satisfied. </em><b><em>This will not necessarily be
                            limited to cases where there is </em></b><b><em>turmoil

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     It bears reiterating, however,
                    that Art 13 of the Hague Convention will not be lightly invoked; on the
                    contrary, the parent seeking to invoke one or more of the exceptions contained
                    in this particular Article bears the onus of proof (the standard of which, as
                    the Judge correctly pointed out, is a high one (see the Judgment at [24])).
                    Indeed, as already noted, the <em>presumption</em> is that
                    the court of the country to which the child is returned will consider the
                    paramount interests of the child when deciding upon the substantive merits in
                    the context of issues relating to that child’s custody<em>.</em> As Butler-Sloss LJ pertinently observed in the English Court
                    of Appeal decision of <em>Re M (Abduction:
                        Undertakings)</em> [1995] 1 FLR 1021 (“<em>Re
                        M</em>”), which involved an application to direct the return of the

                    inception of the Hague Convention itself, but also because they constitute an
                    excellent summary of aforementioned points (see <em>The Hague
                        Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction –
                        Explanatory Documentation prepared for Commonwealth Jurisdictions by
                        Mr J M Eekelaar in association with the Commonwealth Secretariat</em>
                    (Commonwealth Secretariat, London, February 1981) at para 1.1 (“<em>Explanatory Documentation</em>”) (reference may also be made
                    to <em>Eekelaar</em> at 305–306)):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The Preamble to the [Hague] Convention makes explicit the twin premises
                        upon which the [Hague] Convention is based: first, that the interests of
                        children are of paramount importance in matters relating to their custody
                        and, second, that, in cases of international abduction, these interests are
                        best served by the establishment of procedures ensuring their prompt return
                        to the place where they were habitually resident prior to their removal.
                            <em>The acceptance of the second premise entails a
                            willingness on the part of a State to exercise a degree of self-denial
                            regarding its natural inclination to make its own assessment about the
                            interests of children who are presently in its jurisdiction by
                            investigating the facts of each individual case.</em> To do this
                        would generally give abductors important advantages over the other parent.
                        It will usually be difficult for the latter effectively to present his or
                        her side of the case from what may be a great distance and in foreign
                        courts. By the time these questions are all investigated the child may have
                        begun to settle in its new environment and it may be difficult to argue that
                        its return will be in its best interests. <em>The longer the
                            abductor can delay the decision, the stronger the likelihood that his
                            abduction will succeed. Hence the necessity, in dealing with this
                            problem, for prompt action to return the child. </em><em>This accounts for the distinction, which runs through the
                            [Hague] </em><em>Convention, between a decision on
                            an application for the return of the child and a decision
                            </em><em><u>on the merits </u></em><em>of the case. No decision on the merits can be made until it is
                            decided that a child is </em><em><u>not
                            </u></em><em>to be returned under the [Hague]
                            </em><em>Convention (or unless there has been an
                            unreasonable delay in seeking the return) (Article 16) and a decision to
                            return a child is not to be taken as a decision on the merits
                            (Article 19). </em><b><em>This does not mean that the
                            merits of the custody issue- will go undetermined. It means simply that
                            they will be determined in the place where it is most appropriate, both
                            for the child and the parties, that they should be determined, namely,
                            the place where the child normally lives. It is in this spirit that the
                            [Hague] Convention should be approached and implemented.</em></b>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     We note that one of the basic
                    premises of the Hague Convention (to the effect that it is in the child’s
                    interests generally to be returned to his or her home jurisdiction) has
                    nevertheless been subject to critique. However, it has, in our view, been
                    persuasively responded to thus (see N Lowe, M Everall &amp; M Nicholls,
                        <em>International Movement of Children – Law, Practice and
                        Procedure</em> (Jordan Publishing Limited, 2004) (“<em>Lowe, Everall &amp; Nicholls</em>”) at para 17.140):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[I]t does not necessarily follow that the [Hague] Convention has become
                        fundamentally flawed. There surely remains an overwhelming argument that it
                        is basically wrong for children to be uprooted from their home by the
                        unilateral act of either parent and taken to a foreign jurisdiction and thus
                        to be separated from the other parent. Admittedly, that argument becomes
                        weaker if the left-at-home parent has been violent and the abducting parent
                        is escaping to find sanctuary by returning to her family abroad. But, even
                        then, it surely remains a strong argument that, provided the child and
                        abducting parent can properly be protected, the best court to deal with the
                        merits of the dispute is that of the <em>child’s</em>
                        home jurisdiction. Whether Art 13(b), as it currently operates, properly
                        draws the balance can and, no doubt, will continue to be debated. [emphasis
                        in original]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">We would only observe that, given the various interests and arguments, there
                    can – in the nature of things – be no perfect solution as such. However, as we
                    have sought to explain briefly above, the situation is really one of balance and
                    complementarity which is intended to lead to a just and fair result based on the
                    particular facts of each case.</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     This would be an appropriate
                    juncture to turn specifically to Art 13(<em>b</em>) of the
                    Hague Convention (“Art 13(<em>b</em>)”), which reads as
                    follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Notwithstanding the provisions of the preceding Article, the judicial or
                        administrative authority of the requested State is <b><em>not

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added in italics and bold italics]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     Prof Eekelaar aptly observes
                    that Art 13(<em>b</em>) is an “emergency clause” (see
                        <em>Explanatory Documentation</em> at para 2.4(iii) and
                        <em>Eekelaar</em> at 313). This is consistent with the
                    very nature of Art 13 in general and Art 13(<em>b</em>) in
                    particular, <em>ie</em>, that of an exception to the
                    general rule under the Hague Convention which requires the swift return of the
                    child concerned to his or her country of habitual residence. That having been
                    said, Art 13(<em>b</em>) “is the most litigated of all the
                    exceptions” (see N V Lowe &amp; G Douglas, <em>Bromley’s Family
                        Law</em> (10th ed, Oxford University Press, 2007) (“<em>Bromley</em>”) at p 654; reference may also be made to <em>In re E (Children) (Abduction: Custody Appeal)</em> [2012]
                    1 AC 144 (“<em>In re E</em>”) at [9]).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Onus and standard of proof</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     As noted above, the <em>onus of proof</em> is on “the person, institution or other
                    body which opposes [the child’s] return” (<em>viz</em>, the
                    Appellant in the present appeal) (see Art 13(<em>b</em>) as
                    well as <em>Pérez-Vera</em> at para 114). Moreover, as has
                    been pertinently observed, “it is <em>a stringent
                        burden</em> to discharge” (see <em>Lowe,
                        Everall &amp; Nicholls</em> at para 17.87 [emphasis added] (reference
                    may also be made <em>ibid</em> at paras 17.88–17.94 as well
                    as to <em>Bromley</em> at p 654 and
                    Paul R Beaumont &amp; Peter E McEleavy, <em>The Hague Convention
                        on International Child Abduction</em> (Oxford University Press, 1999)
                        (“<em>Beaumont &amp; McEleavy</em>”) at p 140)). This
                    is consistent with the fact that Art 13(<em>b</em>) is
                    intended to be an exception to the general rule just mentioned.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     As already noted above (at
                    [31]), care must be taken in order to ensure that the exception does not
                    “swallow up” the general rule. Indeed, the high standard just mentioned was also
                    acknowledged in the court below (see the Judgment at [24]). In the
                    circumstances, there appears to be merit in Gaudron, Gummow and Hayne JJ’s view
                    in <em>DP</em> (at 418) that the courts need not to go out
                    of their way to give Art 13(<em>b</em>) a “narrow”
                    construction but that “[t]he exception is to be given the meaning its words
                    require” (reference may also be made to <em>El Sayed</em>
                    at 360). This approach in <em>DP</em> was endorsed more
                    recently by the UK Supreme Court in <em>In re E</em> (at
                    [31]–[35]) (reference may also be made to the even more recent (also) UK Supreme
                    Court decision of <em>In re S (A Child) (Abduction: Rights of
                        Custody)</em> [2012] 2 AC 257 (“<em>In re
                    S</em>”) at [6]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     The following observations by La
                    Forest J (with whom Lamer CJC and Sopinka, Gonthier, Cory, Iacobucci as well as
                    Major JJ concurred) in the Supreme Court of Canada decision of <em>Thomson v Thomson</em> (1994) 119 DLR (4th) 253 (“<em>Thomson</em>”) (at 286) might also be usefully noted:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It has been generally accepted that the [Hague] Convention mandates a more
                        stringent test than that advanced by the appellant. In brief, although the
                        word “grave” [in Art 13(<em>b</em>)] modifies “risk”
                        and not “harm”, this must be read in conjunction with the clause “<em>or otherwise</em> place the child in an intolerable
                        situation”. The use of the word “otherwise” points inescapably to the
                        conclusion that the physical or psychological harm contemplated by the first
                        clause of art. 13(<em>b</em>) is harm to a degree that
                        also amounts to an intolerable situation. [emphasis in original]</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Discretion remains in the court of the requested State
                throughout</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     It is also of no mean
                    significance that (as Art 13(<em>b</em>) itself makes
                    clear), even if one or more of the conditions set out in the Article is
                    satisfied, “the requested State is <em>not bound to
                        order</em> the return of the child” [emphasis added]. Put simply, what
                    this means is that the court of the requested State (here, Singapore) has a
                        <em>discretion</em> in the matter and is not, <em>ipso facto</em>, duty-bound to refuse the return of the child
                    even if one or more of the conditions set out in Art 13(<em>b</em>) are satisfied (see also, for example, <em>Pérez-Vera</em> at para 113, the Judgment at [35], as well as the New
                    Zealand High Court decisions of <em>Clarke v Carson</em>
                    [1996] 1 NZLR 349 at 351 and <em>El Sayed</em> at [67]). To
                    that extent, the entire process is very much <em>a fact-centric
                        one</em>. We encounter – once again – the important issue of <em>application</em> to which we referred earlier (see above at
                    [33]), albeit in a slightly different context.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The overriding importance of the relevant
                facts</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     The issue of <em>application</em> is also significant in relation to its impact on the
                    utility (or otherwise) of the relevant precedents. In particular, given the
                    myriad fact situations, it is difficult for the most part to discern clear
                    strands of legal principle (apart, perhaps, from those which are pitched at a
                    relatively high level of generality) (see also, for example, <em>Lowe, Everall &amp; Nicholls</em> at para 17.100). That this is so
                    will also be evident in the context of the present appeal. Indeed, as we shall
                    see, the overriding theme is that a <em>close and granular
                        analysis of the precise facts</em> is <em>imperative.</em> This is not, perhaps, surprising in view of the
                    delicate nature of the balancing process, given the very personal nature of the
                    subject matter. Bearing this in mind, let us now turn to what we consider to be
                    the specific (albeit non-determinative as well as non-exhaustive) strands of
                    legal principle.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     It should also be noted at this
                    juncture that an appellate court will not overturn the judgment of the court
                    below unless, whether by reference to the law or to the evidence, it had not
                    been open to the judge in the court below to make that judgment (see, for
                    example, <em>In re S</em>).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The abducting parent cannot take advantage of his or her
                own wrong</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     This first strand of legal
                    principle is a logical, commonsensical and fair one inasmuch as the abducting
                    parent cannot seek to rely upon his or her own conduct in order to create a
                    situation of grave risk of physical and/or psychological harm to the child
                    concerned in order thereby to rely upon that alleged risk to argue against the
                    return of that child pursuant to Art 13(<em>b</em>) (see
                    also, for example, <em>McClean</em> at p 11; <em>Lowe, Everall &amp; Nicholls</em> at paras 17.101?17.104; and
                        <em>Beaumont &amp; McEleavy</em> at p 146). This is
                    based on the broader rationale to the effect that <em>a person
                        cannot take advantage of his or her own wrong</em>. As Butler-Sloss LJ
                    aptly expressed it in <em>C v C</em> (at 661) (reference
                    may also be made to the (also) English Court of Appeal decision of <em>Re C (Abduction: Grave Risk of Physical or Psychological
                        Harm)</em> [1999] 2 FLR 478 (“<em>Re C</em>”) at
                    486 and the Scottish Outer House decision of <em>McCarthy v
                        McCarthy</em> [1994] SLT 743 at 745):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b><em>Is a parent to create a psychological situation, and
                            then rely upon it? </em></b>
<em>If the grave risk of
                            psychological harm to a child is to be inflicted by the conduct of the
                            parent who abducted him, then it would be relied upon by every mother of
                            a young child who removed him out of the jurisdiction and refused to
                            return. It would drive a coach and four horses through the [Hague]
                            Convention, at least in respect of applications relating to young
                            children.</em> I, for my part, cannot believe that this is in the
                        interests of international relations. <b><em>Nor should the
                            mother, by her own actions, succeed in preventing the return of a child
                            who should be living in his own country and deny him contact with his
                            other parent.</em></b> [emphasis added in italics and bold

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     The broad principle just
                    mentioned underpins legal principles across diverse areas of the law. Take, for
                    example, the principle that <em>self-induced</em>
                    frustration does not constitute operative frustration under the common law of
                    contract (see generally <em>The Law of Contract in
                        Singapore</em> (Academy Publishing, 2012) (Andrew Phang Boon Leong
                    gen ed) ch 19 at paras 19.143–19.188). Another example is the principle that
                    criminals cannot profit from their crimes (see, for example, the oft-cited
                    English High Court decision of <em>In the Estate of
                        Crippen</em> [1911] P 108).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     Not surprisingly, however, the
                    situation will not always be clear-cut. In the English Court of Appeal decision
                    of <em>D v D (Child Abduction: Non-Convention Country)</em>
                    [1994] 1 FLR 137, the mother (the abducting parent) had initially indicated that
                    if the children were sent back to their home country, Greece, she would not go
                    with them. The trial judge had nevertheless ordered the children’s return to
                    Greece. However, at the hearing of the appeal, it was discovered that the mother
                    had become pregnant by an Englishman living in England (with the baby being due
                    in a few months) and that, in those circumstances, she was no longer prepared to
                    go back to Greece. The English Court of Appeal allowed the mother’s appeal. We
                    note however that there was no evidence as to the circumstances in which the
                    mother became pregnant. More importantly, this was a <em>non-Convention case</em> and the <em>specific welfare
                        of the children</em> was therefore the overriding factor. However,
                    what is clear is that (as emphasised in the preceding section) the <em>precise facts</em> of the case concerned are of the first
                    importance.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The role of undertakings</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     The practice of requiring
                    undertakings was pioneered by the English courts (see <em>Lowe,
                        Everall &amp; Nicholls</em> at para 17.123). As Butler-Sloss LJ
                    articulated it in the oft-cited English Court of Appeal decision of <em>C v C</em> (at 659?660):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Those [undertakings], as far as they go, are <b><em>very
                            valuable</em></b> – and, if I may say so, for my part, <em>show the good intent</em> that [the father] has for the
                        welfare of his child and to return him to the jurisdiction of the Australian
                        court. In my view, those undertakings <em>should go somewhat
                            further</em>, and the undertakings that I for my part think should
                        be required of this father, <b><em>as a </em></b><b><em><u>prerequisite</u></em></b><b><em> of the return of
                            the child, and without which I consider the child should not be expected
                            to return</em></b><em>, are as follows</em>.
                        [emphasis added in italics, bold italics, and underlined bold
                        italics]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Indeed, L’Heureux-Dubé J (with whom McLachlin J concurred) in <em>Thomson</em> (citing the passage just quoted) also observed
                    thus (at 307):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Undertakings such as those of the respondent in this case are to be
                        commended. They are often made in cases where an applicant seeks the return
                        of a child under the [Hague] Convention.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     Returning to the observations by
                    Butler-Sloss LJ in <em>C v C</em> (as quoted in the
                    preceding paragraph), we agree that not only are undertakings by the parent
                    seeking the return of the child a sign of good faith on his or her part, they
                    are also important in ensuring that the return of the child will not (as far as
                    possible) adversely impact the child and/or the abducting parent. They are in
                    fact often spoken of with regard to <em>the protective
                        measures</em> which exist to ensure the justice and fairness just
                    mentioned (see also generally <em>In re E</em>). That is
                    why Butler-Sloss LJ spoke of <em>undertakings</em> being
                    even “a <em>prerequisite</em>” to the return of the child.
                    As we shall see, this is also the approach we adopted with regard to the present
                    proceedings.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     However, whilst it has been
                    observed that such undertakings “can alleviate what might otherwise be regarded
                    as an intolerable situation”, “[t]hey are intended … to have a short life, ie
                    until the court of the child’s habitual residence becomes seized of the
                    proceedings” and that “[a]ccordingly, the court should be careful not in any way
                    to usurp or be thought to usurp the functions of the court of habitual
                    residence” (see <em>Bromley</em> at p 659); the learned
                    authors of <em>Bromley</em> further state that
                    “undertakings must not be so elaborate that their implementation might become
                    bogged down in protracted hearings and investigations” (see <em>ibid</em>; reference might also be made, in a similar vein, to
                        <em>Lowe, Everall &amp; Nicholls</em> at para 17.124 as
                    well as to <em>McClean</em> at p 12). Indeed, this was also
                    the very point which was made – in a judicial context – in <em>Re
                        M</em>, where Butler-Sloss LJ observed thus (at 1025):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">This court must be careful not in any way to usurp or to be thought to
                        usurp the functions of the court of habitual residence. Equally, the
                        requirements made in this country must not be so elaborate that their
                        implementation might become bogged down in protracted hearings and
                        investigations, as was suggested by Sir Thomas Bingham MR in <em>Re M (A Minor) (Child Abduction)</em> (above) at p 397.
                        Undertakings have their place in the arrangements designed to smooth the
                        return of and to protect the child for the limited period before the foreign
                        court takes over, but they must not be used by the parties to try to clog or
                        fetter, or, in particular, to delay the enforcement of a paramount decision
                        to return the child.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     However, one difficulty with
                    respect to undertakings is the need to ensure that they are complied with as
                    well as enforceable in the State seeking the return of the child (“the
                    requesting State”). This might be why Kay J did not appear very enthusiastic
                    about undertakings in the Family Court of Australia decision of <em>In the Marriage of McOwan</em> (1993) 17 Fam LR 377
                        (“<em>In </em><em>the Marriage of
                        McOwan</em>”); as the learned judge observed (at 383) (see also, in a
                    similar vein, <em>per</em> Gaudron, Gummow and Hayne JJ in
                        <em>DP</em> at 425):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">If undertakings are to be given it is important to make sure they can be
                        enforced. There does not appear to be any existing mechanism by which the
                        court that extracts the undertaking can ensure that it is complied with.
                        There does not appear to be any legal basis upon which the court of the
                        State in which the child has been returned, can require compliance with an
                        undertaking given to another court.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     This is a fair point and one
                    that we had to consider in the context of the present appeal. However, as the
                    proceedings in this appeal demonstrate, this potential difficulty is not, with
                    respect, an insuperable one. For example, this court required the Respondent to
                    undertake that he would, prior to the Appellant returning to Germany with the
                    children, apply to the German court seized of the matter to incorporate all the
                    relevant undertakings given by the parties as an order of that court. Indeed, on
                    a more general level, practical solutions in this particular regard are
                    imperative. As Kay J aptly observed in <em>In the Marriage of
                        McOwan</em> (at 385):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<em>Unless contracting States can feel reasonably assured
                            that when children are returned under the Hague Convention, their
                            welfare will be protected</em>,<b><em> there is a
                            serious risk that contracting States and courts will become reluctant to
                            order the return of children.</em></b></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In <em>Foxman</em> (Case Number:
                        MA 2898/92 Nov 1992 available through the reporting service of William
                        Hilton, California) Justice Hayim Porat of the Tel Aviv District Court
                        said:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">“Responsibility for the child’s welfare in the usual meaning of the
                            word is mainly the responsibility of the legal court cases in the
                            country to which the child will be returned, and we must assume that
                            there, the court will do its utmost to minimize harm to the
                            child.”</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">A more liberal view of the exceptions to mandatory return as set out in
                        Article 13 may become common. This outcome would seem unfortunate given the
                        successful operation of the Convention to date.</p>

                    447) by Kirby J in <em>DP</em> are apposite, whilst we
                    emphasise that the court should nevertheless (as just indicated) always strive
                    for a practical, balanced solution in the case at hand:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<em>Too much should not, in my view, be made of the

                        find of practical difficulties that have arisen in conforming to such
                        undertakings. This Court need not be concerned about such problems where
                        they are not shown to exist. At least we should not pass upon them in the
                        absence of a clear challenge on the record either to the power to exact
                        undertakings generally or to obtain them in the form required. [emphasis

<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Where the abducting parent has medical (especially
                psychological) problems which are alleged to prevent him or her from returning to
                the requesting State with the child concerned</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a>58     A preliminary note of sorts is
                    apposite. Looked at from a more general perspective, it might be cogently argued
                    that this is not a separate category of legal principle in and of itself, but an
                    aspect or sub-set of a more general principle, <em>viz</em>, the overriding importance of the relevant facts (see above at
                    [47]; reference may also be made to <em>Lowe,
                        Everall &amp; Nicholls</em> at paras 17.117?17.119 (which, whilst
                    commencing with the proposition (at para 17.117) that “[i]t would appear … that
                    mental illness suffered by the wronged parent is unlikely to constitute
                    sufficient reason to find the requisite grave risk of harm”, in our view focuses
                    more on the <em>facts</em> of relevant decisions which (not
                    surprisingly) did not always give rise to the same result)). This is because
                    each individual and each medical (in particular, psychological) problem is
                    invariably different. Most importantly, however, it must always be borne in mind
                    that the present category is relevant only in so far as it impacts <em>the child concerned</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a>59     That having been said, given the
                    close biological and emotional bonds between mother and child, especially in the
                    situation where the abducting parent is the mother and the child is very young
                    (which is precisely the situation faced by this court in the present appeal),
                    the situation of the mother is often critical. Put simply, the relationship
                    between mother and child is not only fluid but also organic and symbiotic in
                    nature (reference may also be made to <em>El Sayed</em> at
                    361; <em>C v C</em> (where the child concerned was also
                    very young); as well as <em>In re E</em>). In this regard,
                    an essential point ought to be emphasised right at the outset. It is often the
                    case that the abducting parent’s (usually, the mother’s) medical situation is –
                    in the nature of things – <em>involuntary</em> in nature
                    and <em>beyond her control.</em> For example, in <em>DP</em>, Gaudron, Gummow and Hayne J observed (at 427 with
                    regard to the mother’s illness) that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">To say that she is the originator of the source of the risk of harm
                        appears to take no account of the fact that the mother is <em>not</em> in command of her situation and it betrays a complete
                        lack of any understanding of the major depressive illness from which she
                        suffers. [emphasis in original]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a>60     However, if the abducting parent
                    can in fact be <em>treated</em> for his or her medical
                    condition <em>but refuses</em> to be so treated, then
                    (particularly if the prognosis is that treatment might lead to a cure or an
                    improvement such that the parent is no longer a danger or threat to the child
                    concerned) it could be persuasively argued that the abducting parent is
                        <em>attempting to take advantage of his or her own
                        wrong</em>. As noted above, this is of course impermissible as a
                    matter of general logic, commonsense and fairness (see above at [49] and
                    [50]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a>61     Nevertheless, we note that the
                    issue of <em>treatment</em>, whilst of potential importance
                    (as the facts of this very appeal demonstrate), appears to be a factor that has
                    seldom been considered in detail in the relevant case law.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_62"></a>62     In the English High Court
                    decision of <em>Re G (Abduction: Psychological Harm)</em>
                    [1995] 1 FLR 64 (“<em>Re G</em>”), for example, the
                    father’s application for the return of the children concerned (from England back
                    to Texas) was dismissed as it was held that the relevant medical evidence
                    demonstrated that the children would be exposed to a risk of physical or
                    psychological harm or otherwise be placed in an intolerable situation owing to
                    the mother’s depression, which would become exacerbated if she were to return
                    with the children to Texas (and there was also a considerable danger that she
                    might become psychotic). It should be noted, in this regard, that the mother was
                    in fact <em>willing</em> to return with the children to
                    Texas. It should also be noted that the relevant point was the effect which the
                    mother’s mental condition would have <em>on the
                        children.</em> However, what was not explored by the court in
                        <em>Re G</em> was whether or not the mother’s mental
                    condition was <em>treatable</em>; indeed, there was no
                    suggestion that she should undergo treatment. It might well have been the case
                    that the medical prognosis might have shown that treatment would be futile.
                    However, what remains clear is that the possibility of treatment does not appear
                    to have been explored in <em>Re G</em>. We also note that
                        <em>Re G</em> was described in a leading treatise as
                    “an extreme case [which] represents very much the exception to the rule” (see
                        <em>Beaumont &amp; McEleavy</em> at p 147); it was also
                    described (in a similar vein) in yet another textbook as “[a] rather
                    controversial case” (see Jonathan Herring, <em>Family
                        Law</em> (5th ed, Pearson Education Limited, 2011) at
                p 569).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_63"></a>63     In the New Zealand District
                    Court decision of <em>Armstrong v Evans</em> [2000] NZFLR
                    984 (“<em>Armstrong</em>”), the court did consider the fact
                    that the abducting mother had received treatment for post-traumatic stress
                    disorder relating to her history of post-natal depression as well as her
                    relationship with the husband, by whom she had been violently abused. Her mental
                    condition had apparently stabilised but the court was of the view that, if she
                    were to return from New Zealand to Australia, she was likely to suffer a rapid
                    and severe deterioration in her mental well-being and that there was also a
                    prospect of suicide. In the circumstances, the court declined to allow the
                    husband’s application for the return of the child as such deterioration in the
                    wife’s mental well-being posed a grave risk in so far as the child was
                    concerned. Indeed, the court emphasised (at [38(1)]) that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The focus is on the child’s situation not that of the [mother]. The issue
                        is not whether the mother would be exposed to physical or psychological harm
                        but whether the child would be exposed to physical or psychological harm or
                        otherwise be placed in an intolerable situation.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_64"></a>64     However, as alluded to above (at
                    [59]), the situation is often an organic and symbiotic one in so far as mother
                    and child are concerned. Returning to the facts of <em>Armstrong</em>, it is significant in our view that Doogue J observed
                    (at [57]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It cannot be said that the [mother] has created a situation of potential
                        psychological harm and now seeks to rely on it to prevent the return of the
                        child. The evidence of [the registered psychologist] is unequivocal that the
                        impairment to the psychological wellbeing of the mother was occasioned by
                        the experience of being in an abusive relationship. The risk of
                        psychological harm is beyond the control of the [mother]. She is not the
                        architect – she is the victim – by that I am referring to the potential of
                        suicidality.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The learned judge also observed at the end of his judgment (at [72]) that
                    “[t]he prospect of one parent suiciding and being thereby permanently out of the
                    child’s life weighs far more heavily with me” (reference may also be made to the
                    Full Court of the Family Court of Australia decision of <em>Director-General, Department of Families v RSP</em> [2003] FamCA 623
                        (“<em>RSP</em>”)).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_65"></a>65     
          <em>Armstrong</em> is therefore an illustration of a situation (referred
                    to above at [59]) where the mother’s condition was <em>involuntary</em> in nature and <em>beyond her
                        control</em>. However, we also note that there is nothing in the
                    judgment in that particular decision which indicates what the options for
                        <em>treatment</em> of the mother were and, in
                    particular, what the prognosis for recovery was with treatment (including
                        <em>continued </em><em>treatment</em> if she and the child were returned from New Zealand to
                    Australia) (and <em>cf</em> the Family Court of Australia
                    decision of <em>Director-General, Department of Families, Youth
                        and Community Care v Bennett</em> [2000] FamCA 253).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_66"></a>66     As always, however (and bearing
                    in mind the need for a nuanced consideration of the relevant fact situation), a
                        <em>balanced</em> approach is required. For example, as
                    Kirby J observed in <em>DP</em> (at 449):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Obviously, as Rose J recognised, courts of law must be particularly
                        cautious before permitting parents, in the highly charged circumstances of
                        international child removal or retention, to attempt to dictate the outcome
                        of proceedings by threatening that if a court decision goes against them,
                        they will commit suicide to the great risk of harm to the child concerned.
                        In many cases of this type, the very circumstances that have driven a party,
                        typically a parent, to cross, or refuse to cross, the world with a child
                        will be such as to engender the deepest of feelings. If such threats were
                        easily upheld as attracting the exception [in Art 13(<em>b</em>)] in a particular case, it might be expected that like
                        claims would multiply enormously. These are the practicalities of cases of
                        this kind which the Full Court can be taken to know only too well. Such
                        threats would themselves add to the disruption occasioned to children by
                        such international abduction or retention. I do not say that the threat of
                        suicide by an abducting or retaining parent could never be established to
                        occasion the type of “grave risk” of which para (b) speaks. But it would be
                        a case different from the present where a number of events had to occur and
                        then coincide and where the assertions of the necessary circumstances of
                        suicide did not bear out the reasoning of the primary judge.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Our decision</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_67"></a>67     As already noted above (at
                    [21]–[23]), we confirmed the order for the return of [B] to Germany, albeit
                    together with a different set of undertakings to take into account the
                    Appellant’s psychological condition as well as to ensure that the substantive
                    proceedings in the German court with regard to the custody and/or care and
                    control of [B] proceeded on a level playing field in all (including legal)
                    respects (as noted above at [23], these undertakings are to be found in the
                    Annex). We will now elaborate on our reasons for arriving at our decision,
                    applying the legal principles just enumerated.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_68"></a>68     It is, in our view, imperative
                    to commence this section with the reminder (already flagged above at [47]) that
                        <em>the precise facts</em> are not only the first port
                    of call but are also of the first importance. Indeed, as we have seen, the
                    relevant principles are but guidelines at best. This is especially so because of
                    the very nature of this particular sphere of the law.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Our decision in the light of the Appellant’s
                psychological condition</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_69"></a>69     Bearing in mind the stringent
                    burden which lay on the Appellant (see above at [43]), we noted, first, the fact
                    that she had significant psychological problems. Indeed, that was the crux of
                    her argument in the appeals before us and the Judge. In particular, counsel for
                    the Appellant, Ms Poonam Mirchandani, relied heavily upon the psychiatric
                    evidence by Dr Lim, in particular Dr Lim’s Further Report (summarised above at
                    [15]), which stated that the Appellant could not, owing to her psychological
                    condition (in particular, her fragile state of mind), return to Germany. Dr Lim
                    further opined that it was undesirable, in the circumstances, to separate [B]
                    from his mother who was his primary caregiver. It should be noted, however, that
                    Dr Lim’s Further Report came into being only <em>after</em>
                    the Appellant had been unsuccessful in the proceedings in the District Court, a
                    point also noted by the Judge (see the Judgment at [105] and above at
                    [16(c)]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_70"></a>70     As the Judge observed, the DJ
                    was of the view that Dr Lim’s First Report should be accorded little weight as
                    it was based solely on information provided by the Appellant and three sessions
                    of observation of interaction between only the Appellant and [B] (see the
                    Judgment at [48]) and [96]). Before the Judge, the Appellant had submitted that
                    “she [could not] return to Germany due to her fragile state of mind and the real
                    risk that [existed] that she might either end her life or become psychologically
                    impaired or further depressed” (see the Judgment at [52]). After considering the
                    Appellant’s first affidavit as well as Dr Lim’s Further Report (together with
                    the Respondent’s version of events) in some detail, the Judge decided in favour
                    of the Respondent. In particular, the Judge agreed with the DJ that the
                    Appellant’s allegations of violence having been inflicted on her by the
                    Respondent had <em>not</em> been made out (see the Judgment
                    at [93]–[95] as well as above at [16(a)]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_71"></a>71     In so far as the alleged risk of
                    harm to [B] was concerned (see also generally above at [16(b)] and [16(c)]), the
                    Judge noted, <em>inter alia</em>, that it appeared that the
                    risk of separation of [B] from his mother arose mainly from the possibility that
                    the Appellant would not return to Germany with him (see the Judgment at [97] and
                    above at [16(b)]). Indeed, despite noting that the Appellant had maintained that
                    she <em>could not</em> (as opposed to <em>would not</em>) return to Germany, the Judge was of the further view
                    that the Appellant “[seemed] adamant in her refusal to return” (see the Judgment
                    at [97] and [104]). Distinguishing the cases cited by the Appellant, the Judge
                    was primarily of the view that she could not overturn the findings of the DJ
                    unless they were against the weight of evidence (see the Judgment at [100] and
                    [103]). This is, of course, entirely consistent with the general principle set
                    out above (at [48]). Indeed, it is apposite to note, in this regard, that the
                    present court is now faced with <em>two concurrent sets of
                        findings</em> (by both the DJ <em>and</em> the
                    Judge).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_72"></a>72     One other point noted by the
                    Judge is also of relevance to the present appeal; as she observed (see the
                    Judgment at [106]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b><em>It remains a concern that the mother has expressed
                            suicidal thoughts.</em></b> Dr Lim noted that at first she had not
                        done so but that as she observed and tried to understand the proceedings of
                        the court over the preceding two months, her depressive symptoms had been
                        accentuated. It is not surprising that the mother would have had an adverse
                        reaction to the outcome of the proceedings below. The notion of wanting to
                        end it all became, apparently, more entrenched in her psyche. <b><em>However, Dr Lim did opine that the mother’s mental state could
                            be improved if she went on a course of antidepressant
                            medication.</em></b> So far the mother has refused this treatment
                        because she is breastfeeding. The younger child was about six months old at
                        the time of Dr Lim’s second report and whilst the mother might have wanted
                        to continue to breastfeed him, other suitable methods of feeding him would
                        have been available had she gone on medication. <b><em>The
                            mother has not helped herself very much.</em></b> [emphasis added in
                        bold italics]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_73"></a>73     In fact, the Appellant’s
                    psychological state was a factor that weighed heavily in our decision. This was
                    due – in the main – to the precise facts before us. In particular, we noted the
                    very young age of [B] and the fact that the Appellant was his primary caregiver.
                    Looked at in this light, any physical separation of [B] from his mother at this
                    particular stage of his life would not have been in the best interests of
                    [B].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_74"></a>74     It will be noted, at this
                    juncture, that, whilst we were dealing with the Appellant’s psychological state,
                    the focus must be (as noted above at [58]) on its effect or impact on <em>the child</em>, <em>viz</em>,
                        [B]<em>.</em> That having been said, a closely related
                    issue also required us to focus on <em>the </em><em>Appellant</em>. In particular, as alluded to above (at [72]),
                    there appeared to be more than a hint by the Judge that this psychological state
                    might possibly have been self-induced. Given the importance of this particular
                    factor, we ordered an independent assessment by a court-appointed psychiatrist,
                    Dr Mahendran. Indeed, given the almost inevitable leaning of a particular expert
                    towards his or her client, it might be preferable in cases such as the present
                    appeal to request an <em>independent</em>
                    assessment.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_75"></a>75     We found Dr Mahendran’s Report
                    (summarised above at [20]) to be extremely helpful in the resolution of this
                    appeal. Whilst it was similar to Dr Lim’s evidence (especially Dr Lim’s Further
                    Report) in so far as it indicated that the Appellant was indeed suffering from
                    psychological problems, it <em>differed</em> in its
                        <em>diagnosis</em>. In particular, Dr Mahendran did not
                    find that the Appellant’s psychological difficulties were as severe as Dr Lim
                    had thought, finding that the Appellant was suffering from “<em>Delusion Disorder</em>”. Crucially, Dr Mahendran demonstrated, in our
                    view, great professional and practical insight by not only proposing an
                    appropriate course of treatment but also (recognising the precise factual
                    context) recommending continued treatment in Germany<em>.</em></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_76"></a>76     Indeed, as we alluded to above
                    (at [60]), an abducting parent’s reluctance or refusal to undergo a course of
                    recommended (and appropriate) treatment would be tantamount to that parent
                    taking advantage of his or her own wrong, which would have been wholly
                    unacceptable from the perspectives of logic and fairness. Given the close
                    dependence by [B] on the Appellant in the context of the precise facts, an
                    extremely difficult situation would have been posed to this court had the
                    Appellant refused to undergo the appropriate treatment. However, if that had
                    been the case, we would have been prepared to assume that (unlike many of the
                    other seemingly relevant precedents) [B] would nevertheless have received
                    adequate care by the Respondent and his parents were he to return to Germany.
                    Such care would, of course, not have been ideal without the presence of the
                    Appellant. However, we reiterate that it would have been wholly unacceptable to
                    have permitted the Appellant to take advantage of her own wrong by refusing the
                    appropriate treatment and then relying upon such wrong to create the very
                    separation used to challenge the return order in respect of [B].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_77"></a>77     Fortunately, the Appellant
                    adopted a sensible and appropriate approach in undertaking to undergo the
                    appropriate treatment not only in Singapore but also in Germany. The latter
                    point is, in our view, very significant simply because it would have been
                    self-defeating for the Appellant to have begun her treatment in Singapore only
                    to discontinue it when she returned to Germany – which discontinuation would
                    inexorably have led to a deterioration in her psychological condition which
                    could (in turn) lead to a grave risk of the very harm contemplated in
                        Art 13(<em>b</em>).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Our decision on the relevant undertakings to be provided
                by the parties</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_78"></a>78     In our view, the issue of
                    undertakings was a very important one in the context of the present case. On the
                    facts of this case at least, it seemed to us that, whilst the issue of <em>treatment</em> of the Appellant’s psychological condition
                    (elaborated upon in the previous section) represented the Appellant’s
                    perspective and responsibility, the issue of <em>undertakings</em> by the Respondent represented the Respondent’s
                    perspective and corresponding responsibility. Both these perspectives are
                    complementary in nature. That is why we were very concerned about the precise
                    content of the undertakings. That having been said, although the issue of
                    undertakings was primarily the Respondent’s responsibility, we could not ignore
                    the necessity of ensuring that the Appellant also entered into some undertakings
                    in order to ensure that the performance of the Respondent’s undertakings were
                    not undermined.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_79"></a>79     Before we turn specifically to
                    the very important role which the various undertakings played in the resolution
                    of the present appeal, we refer to the UK Supreme Court decision of <em>In re E</em>, which involved rather similar circumstances.
                    There, the abducting mother was suffering from an adjustment disorder and the
                    undertakings furnished by the father played a very important role. In this
                    regard, Baroness Hale of Richmond and Lord Wilson JJSC, who delivered the
                    judgment of the court, observed thus (at [49]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">We have no reason to doubt that the risk to the mother’s mental health,
                        whether it be the result of objective reality or of the mother’s subjective
                        perception of reality, or a combination of the two, is very real. <b><em>We have also no reason to doubt that if the mother’s mental
                            health did deteriorate </em></b><em>in the way
                            described by Dr Kolkiewicz</em>,<b><em>there would be
                            a grave risk </em></b><em>of psychological harm to the
                            children. But the judge considered very carefully how these risks might
                            be avoided.</em> The highest the case can be put is that part of
                        her conclusion relies upon undertakings given to the English High Court,
                        which could not be enforced in Norway, rather than upon any orders yet made
                        in the Norwegian courts. But the judge was reassured by the answers given by
                        Judge Selvaag as to the remedies which would be available if need be.
                            <em>Nor is there anything in the history to suggest that
                            the father is not a man of his word.</em> The judge trusted him to
                        abide by the solemn promises which he was asked to make to her; he was asked
                        to make them because the judge thought it in the best interests of the
                        children he loves so much for him to do so; however little he understands or
                        accepts the mother’s feelings, he must accept what the judge thought best
                        for his children. It is certainly not the task of an appellate court to
                        disagree with the judge’s assessment. [emphasis added in italics and bold
                        italics]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">It would appear that the court in that case did not think that there would
                        <em>in fact</em> be a deterioration in the mother’s
                    mental health – which was somewhat different from the prognosis by Dr Mahendran
                    in the present appeal. It should, however, be noted that, like the present
                    appeal, a set of detailed undertakings was put in place. It should also be noted
                    that one of the undertakings <em>did</em>, in fact, involve
                    “on-going psychological interventions, such as counselling or cognitive
                    behavioural therapy” (see <em>In re E</em> at [44]).
                    Finally, we note that the court was satisfied with the father’s good faith in
                    that particular case.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_80"></a>80     Although the undertakings
                    entered into by the parties in the present case appear fairly substantive, they
                    were, in our view, wholly <em>necessary</em>. It seems to
                    us that, in the oft emotionally charged atmosphere in cases of this kind,
                    something akin to what this court ordered might (without casting any aspersions
                    on the parent entering into the undertakings concerned) be advisable, even if
                    they might appear to be effected <em>ex abudanti
                        cautela</em>. More importantly, we were mindful of the need not to
                    usurp (and, indeed, not even hint at usurping) the functions of the German
                    court.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_81"></a>81     That is why we were glad that
                    the Respondent undertook that, prior to the Appellant returning to Germany with
                    the children, he would apply to the German court seized of the matter to
                    incorporate all his undertakings as an order of that court. Indeed, unless this
                    particular undertaking was fulfilled, the Appellant and [B] were not obliged to
                    embark on the journey back to Germany. For good order, his undertakings were to
                    subsist until the final disposal of the proceedings before the German court
                    seized of the matter with regard to the custody and/or care and control of [B].
                    Likewise (and in fairness to the Respondent), the Appellant agreed that she
                    would consent to the Respondent applying (on her behalf) to the German court
                    seized of the matter to incorporate all <em>her</em>
                    undertakings as an order of that court.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_82"></a>82     Indeed, we would also note that,
                    in addition to ensuring that we did not usurp (or be perceived to be usurping)
                    the function of the German court, the undertakings referred to in the preceding
                    two paragraphs also ensured that any potential problems of <em>enforcement</em> (see above at [55]?[57]) would in all likelihood be
                    taken care of. What this further provides by way of normative guidance in future
                    cases is this: undertakings are not only important; it is also imperative that
                    they be carefully tailored in order to ensure that the appropriate safeguards
                    are in place so that they are not only enforceable by the court of habitual
                    residence but also that they furnish the abducting parent and child with
                    adequate protection so that the intent and spirit of the Hague Convention are
                    achieved in their fullest measure.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_83"></a>83     All this must also be viewed in
                    light of this court ensuring (by way of the relevant undertakings by the
                    Respondent) that the Appellant would be provided the appropriate legal
                    representation in Germany before the German court. Put simply, it is imperative
                    that the abducting parent have his or her day in the court of habitual
                    residence, consistently with all the requirements of due process as well as
                    justice and fairness (which are foundational and common to all jurisdictions).
                    Looked at in this light, undertakings are (in most, if not virtually all, cases)
                    of the first importance. However, we reiterate that it is vital that the court
                    overseeing the formulation of the relevant undertakings is constantly alert to
                    the precise facts so that the undertakings complement the Hague Convention (as
                    well as its underlying purpose and spirit) to the fullest extent possible.
                    Indeed, this is a paradigm instance of how the universal and the particular can
                    be integrated holistically to ensure justice and fairness to both
                    parties.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_84"></a>84     Returning to the precise facts
                    and context of the present case, we were conscious of the need to ensure that,
                    whilst a sufficient period of time would be furnished to the Appellant to embark
                    upon treatment and hopefully experience a reasonable amount of recovery, there
                    would nevertheless be a timely return of [B] to Germany together with the
                    Appellant (who would thereafter <em>continue</em> with her
                    treatment in Germany). To this end, the Appellant had to enter into the
                    necessary undertakings to, <em>inter alia</em>, undergo
                    such treatment.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_85"></a>85     It seemed to us that, on the
                    Respondent’s part, he had to undertake to ensure that the Appellant’s return to
                    Germany with [B] was one that – in all justice and fairness – would see her
                    being placed on a level playing field with him, especially with respect to
                    access to legal advice and representation. In order to ensure that this was the
                    case, we required that he give the necessary undertakings with regard to,
                        <em>inter alia</em>, the Appellant and the children’s
                    travel to Germany, reasonable accommodation, maintenance and health care, as
                    well as the Appellant’s legal representation in Germany. In our view, far from
                    usurping the function of the German court, these undertakings would clear away
                    unnecessary logistical and other obstacles and set the legal stage for the more
                    efficient resolution by the German court of the substantive issues of custody
                    and/or care and control of [B].</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_86"></a>86     For the reasons set out above,
                    we arrived at the decision to confirm the order to return [B] to Germany, albeit
                    together with the undertakings annexed to this judgment. We should add – for the
                    avoidance of doubt – that there will be no order as to the costs of the present
                    appeal, whilst the costs orders in the courts below are to stand. The usual
                    consequential orders will apply.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_87"></a>87     Before concluding the present
                    judgment, a few seemingly disparate but nevertheless crucial observations are in
                    order.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_88"></a>88     The first is that proceedings
                    under the Hague Convention have always been intended to be dealt with as
                    expeditiously as possible. That having been said, we note that there has been a
                    rather lengthy period of delay in the context of the present proceedings.
                    Indeed, the Judge herself recognised this, observing that “[u]nfortunately … the
                    appeal [before her] took a rather long time to come on for hearing” (see the
                    Judgment at [49]). However, there was a reason for such delay. As the Judge
                    further elaborated (see <em>ibid</em>):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">This was partly because the mother’s lawyers discharged themselves as the
                        mother was unable to afford private representation and the mother then had
                        to apply to the Legal Aid Bureau for legal assistance. An emergency legal
                        aid certificate was issued to the mother on 2 November 2012 but then some
                        further time was taken to obtain an opinion from the solicitors on the legal
                        position of the mother in relation to the appeal.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>Notwithstanding these reasons for the relatively
                    lengthy period of delay, it is hoped that all future proceedings involving the
                    Hague Convention will be dealt with expeditiously. In this regard, a system of
                    monitoring the progress of such proceedings by way of tracking and co-ordination
                    ought to be implemented by the Subordinate Courts and the Supreme
                Court.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_89"></a>89     On this point, the following
                    observations by Lord Hope of Craighead in the House of Lords decision of
                        <em>In re D (A Child) (Abduction: Rights of
                        Custody)</em> [2007] 1 AC 619 (at [5]) might also be usefully
                    noted:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Delay does not, in itself, excuse compliance with the [Hague] Convention.
                        Courts must do the best they can to give effect to it, so long as its
                        provisions have not become completely unworkable. <em>The
                            lesson of this case is that every effort must be made to avoid such
                            delays. If there is a dispute as to whether the removal was wrongful it
                            should be dealt with summarily. A balance must, of course, be struck
                            between acting on too little information and the search for too much. A
                            court cannot make a finding that the child’s removal was wrongful unless
                            it is provided with a basis for doing so. But if it is to deal with the
                            case summarily the court must not seek perfection. It has to do the best
                            it can on the information that has been made available</em> …
                        [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_90"></a>90     Secondly, we are of the view
                    that the present proceedings highlight the need to further develop and refine
                    collaboration with respect to, <em>inter alia</em>, the
                    smooth and effective implementation of the Hague Convention across jurisdictions
                    – particularly pursuant to <em>Art 7</em> of the Hague
                    Convention (see also <em>McClean</em> at p 12). Indeed, the
                    following observations by Singer J in the English High Court decision of
                        <em>Re O (Child Abduction: Undertakings)</em> [1994]
                    2 FLR 349 (at 372–373) are worth noting (reference may also be made to the
                    English High Court decision of <em>Re M and J (Abduction:
                        International Judicial Collaboration)</em> [2000] 1 FLR 803, where
                    several instructive observations with respect to <em>judicial</em> collaboration were made (<em>cf</em> also the English Court of Appeal decision of <em>S v C</em> [2011] EWCA Civ 1385 at [42] and the UK Supreme
                    Court decision of <em>In re E</em> at [45])):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Article 7 [of the Hague Convention] requires Central Authorities to
                        co-operate with each other and to promote co-operation amongst the competent
                        authorities in the Contracting States. … <em>These provisions
                            prompt me to volunteer </em><b><em>the suggestion
                            that there may be some scope for developing, probably on a bilateral

                            Central Authorities so that each may have the opportunity of explaining
                            and, it may be, justifying the approach their domestic courts take to

                            country wishes to cause any offence to the courts of the other, nor to
                            seek to interfere with or to influence what that court then
                            does.</em></b></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Moreover, it may well be that if such opportunity for the exchange of
                        views does assist to promote co-operation, it should be possible in an
                        appropriate case for the Central Authority of the requested State to liaise
                        with its counterpart in the requesting State to put in place measures agreed
                        by the parties or reasonably required as a proper precondition of
                        return.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added in italics and bold italics]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_91"></a>91     Thirdly, as noted in the UK
                    Supreme Court decision of <em>In re E</em> (at [53]), the
                    potential reference to <em>mediation</em> ought always be
                    borne in mind, although that same court quite correctly observed (<em>ibid</em>) that “[m]ediation will not work if one party is
                    allowed to dominate or bully the other” and “[t]hat is why it is usually thought
                    unsuitable in cases of alleged domestic violence or abuse”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_92"></a>92     Finally, it is of the first
                    importance to emphasise once again the vital role that the precise facts play in
                    the ultimate decision by the court concerned (see above at [47]). We hope that
                    these proceedings, including the decision of this court in this very appeal,
                    illustrate this in no uncertain fashion.</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>It is ordered that:</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>Upon the undertakings given by the Respondent (“the

<p class="Judg-Heading-2">(1) The family’s travel to Germany</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1_2"></a>1       The Wife shall travel to [M],
                    Germany with [B] and [J] before the expiry of two and a half (2.5) months from
                    1 December 2013 (<em>ie</em>, 15 February
                2014).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2_3"></a>2       The Husband undertakes to source
                    for reasonable airfares for the Wife, [B] and [J]’s return journey to Germany
                    and will purchase air tickets for the Wife, [B] and [J]’s direct flights from
                    Singapore to Frankfurt, Germany in the week immediately after the expiry of
                    one (1) month from 1 December 2013.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3_4"></a>3       The Husband shall arrange and
                    pay for inter-city flights from Frankfurt Airport, Germany to [M], Germany for
                    the Wife, [J] and [B] upon their arrival in Germany. However, the Wife will bear
                    the cost of transport from [M] Airport to [M].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4_5"></a>4       If the Wife and [J] do not wish
                    to return to Germany with [B], she shall notify the Husband of the same at any
                    time before the expiry of one (1) month from 1 December 2013.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5_6"></a>5       If the Wife notifies the Husband
                    of her intention not to return to Germany with [J] after the expiry of
                    one (1) month after the date of 1 December 2013 and if the Husband has already
                    purchased air tickets for the Wife, [B] and/or [J] as provided in paragraph 2
                    above, the Wife shall bear the costs of the cancellation of [J] and her air
                    tickets and any costs related to any changes that may need to be made to [B]’s
                    air ticket solely.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6_7"></a>6       If the Wife notifies the Husband
                    of her intention not to return to Germany with [J], the Husband shall give the
                    Wife at least seven (7) days’ advance notice of his arrival in Singapore and the
                    appointed day and time of [B]’s return journey to Germany with the
                    Husband.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7_8"></a>7       Upon the Husband’s arrival in
                    Singapore, parties shall mutually agree on the appointed day and time for [B] to
                    be handed over to the Husband at the Husband’s solicitors’ office with [B]’s
                    passport and other relevant travel documents. For the avoidance of doubt this
                    shall not amount to a surrender of the Wife’s rights of custody, care and
                    control over [B], which rights shall then be a matter for the German court
                    seized of the issue.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">(2) The Husband’s access to [B]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8_9"></a>8       If the Wife agrees to accompany
                    [B] back to Germany with [J], [B] shall reside with the Wife and [J] at her
                    rented accommodation in [M], Germany.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1-p2_a"></a>(a)     For the first two months
                    following the arrival of the Wife, [J] and [B] in Germany, the Husband shall
                    have access to [B] twice a week for four (4) hours per access
                session.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1-p2_b"></a>(b)     Thereafter, the Husband shall
                    have access to [B] three (3) times a week for four (4) hours per access
                    session.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1-p2_c"></a>(c)     The Wife accepts that the
                    Husband should be entitled to access [J] at the same times and durations as he
                    accesses [B]. However, both parties recognise and accept that this may not be
                    achievable initially because of the lack of contact hitherto between the Husband
                    and [J]. The parties therefore agree to step up the Husband’s access to [J] over
                    time in a manner that is conducive to [J]’s well-being and the desirability of
                    his achieving a healthy relationship with his father.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9_10"></a>9       The Husband and no other person
                    shall pick [B] up from the Wife’s rented accommodation and shall return [B] to
                    the Wife’s rented accommodation at the end of each access session.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1-p2_a_11"></a>(a)     Such access shall not
                    extend to a time later than 6.00 p.m. unless mutually agreed between
                    parties.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1-p2_b_12"></a>(b)     The Wife shall provide the
                    Husband with her e-mail address prior to her departure from Singapore, and the
                    Husband shall provide the Wife with a pre-paid mobile phone number upon her
                    arrival in Germany but he shall not be liable to pay for the cost of the Wife’s
                    pre-paid mobile line thereafter. The Wife shall not change the said mobile
                    number without first notifying the Husband of her new mobile
                number.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1-p2_c_13"></a>(c)     The Husband shall notify
                    the Wife weekly by e-mail to the said e-mail address provided by the Wife or by
                    SMS to the said pre-paid mobile number of his intended access to [B] at least
                    one (1) week in advance.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1-p2_d"></a>(d)     Such access as the Husband is
                    able to have to [J] will initially take place at the Wife’s option either at the
                    rented accommodation itself or within 100 metres of the rented accommodation
                    until it is reasonably possible for the parties to agree to other more suitable
                    arrangements.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">(3) Accommodation in Germany</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10_14"></a>10     The Husband undertakes (not
                    less than two (2) weeks before their arrival in Germany) to provide (at his
                    expense) the Wife, [B] and [J] with rented accommodation at an affordable and
                    reasonable rental rate (and with proper lightings, utilities, heating and
                    ventilation).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1-p2_a_15"></a>(a)     Such accommodation to be
                    ready for immediate occupation on arrival of the Wife, [B] and [J] in Germany
                    pursuant to the timeline stated at paragraph 1 above.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1-p2_b_16"></a>(b)     The rented accommodation
                    shall be located either in a safe and suitable part of [M], Germany or in [W],
                    Germany. The Wife shall inform the Husband which location she prefers by
                    6 December 2013 (subject to the respective amounts of maintenance to be provided
                    to the Wife as specified at paragraph 14 below). The Husband undertakes to
                    provide the Wife with basic furniture, including a stove, a refrigerator, a
                    wardrobe, two beds with mattresses, as well as a sofa set, dining table, chairs
                    and television and Internet facilities in the said rented
                accommodation.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1-p2_c_17"></a>(c)     The Husband shall return
                    to the Wife all her belongings which were left behind by her in the parties’ [S]
                    home including the Wife’s bicycle, her personal belongings, all her and [B]’s
                    winter wear etc. The Husband shall also purchase winter clothes and shoes for
                    [B] and [J]. For so long as the Wife and the children are in Germany, the
                    Husband shall hand over for the Wife’s use the bicycle trailer which she used to
                    move around in [S] with [B].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11_18"></a>11     If the Wife notifies the
                    Husband of her refusal to return to Germany with [J] after the Husband has
                    already procured the rented accommodation, all monies that the Husband may
                    already have expended in procuring the said rented accommodation and on the said
                    furniture for the Wife shall be borne solely by the Wife. Further, if the Wife
                    returns to Singapore before the contract for Internet facilities at the rented
                    accommodation and the custody and/or care proceedings before the German court
                    are concluded, she will be solely liable for the balance fees due and owing for
                    the said Internet facilities.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">(4) Maintenance for the Wife and [J] in
                Germany</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12_19"></a>12     The Husband undertakes to
                    assist the Wife to apply for social security benefits from the government of
                    Germany (such as Arbeitslosengeld II (basic social security) and/or Kindergeld
                    (children’s benefits) and/or Wohngeld (housing benefits)) which the Wife is
                    entitled to receive under German law.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13_20"></a>13     If there is any shortfall
                    between the monthly payments from the government of Germany and the rent payable
                    for the said rented accommodation inclusive of the cost of the Wife’s energy,
                    utilities and Internet bills, the Husband undertakes to pay the
                    difference.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14_21"></a>14     In addition, the Husband
                    shall pay €800.00 per month for the Wife’s maintenance while she resides in [W],
                    Germany, pending any government grant for her maintenance and if the Wife does
                    not have any income in Germany. If, however, the Wife chooses instead to reside
                    in [M], Germany, the amount payable shall be €700.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15_22"></a>15     The Husband further
                    undertakes to provide the Wife with maintenance of €200.00 per month for each
                    child while [B] and [J] reside in Germany, pending any government grant for
                    their maintenance.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16_23"></a>16     If the amount of the
                    government grants paid exceeds the amount of the rent, service and utility
                    charges payable by the Husband for the rented accommodation together with the
                    total sum of maintenance payable by the Husband under paragraphs 14 and 15
                    above, the difference shall be paid by the Husband to the Wife. In this regard,
                    the Husband undertakes to disclose the full amount of the government grants
                    received. If there is a shortfall between the monthly payments of social
                    security benefits from the Government of Germany and the monthly maintenance
                    amount of €1,200.00 or €1,100.00 as the case may be for the Wife and children
                    which is payable by the Husband, the Husband shall pay the difference to the
                    Wife.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17_24"></a>17     The Husband also undertakes
                    that he will pay the rent, service and utility charges for the rented
                    accommodation as well as the total monthly maintenance for the Wife and the two
                    children in advance. These sums shall be paid by the Husband at the end of the
                    calendar month preceding (and for) the next calendar month. The Husband shall
                    pay half a month’s maintenance for the Wife and two children for the month of
                    February 2014 prior to the departure of the Wife and two children for Germany
                    pursuant to paragraph 1 above.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18_25"></a>18     The Husband also undertakes
                    to pay for the Wife’s German language course, provided that the Wife undertakes
                    to attend and complete the said German language course and attain the standard
                    required to communicate in the German language on a basic level, failing which
                    the Wife shall bear the costs of the said German language course
                solely.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">(5) Health insurance</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19_26"></a>19     The Wife shall provide the
                    Husband with a copy of [J]’s birth certificate in order for the Husband to apply
                    for [J] to be covered under the Husband’s family health insurance in Germany.
                    The Husband undertakes not to use this for any other purpose.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20_27"></a>20     The Husband undertakes to
                    continue to pay for German family health insurance for the Wife, [J] and [B] for
                    as long as the Wife, [J] and/or [B] remain in Germany.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21_28"></a>21     In addition, the Husband
                    undertakes to pay for the Wife’s medical (including psychiatric) expenses if or
                    to the extent that they are not covered by German family health
                    insurance.</p>

                    confirming the appointment of a lawyer, the Husband’s Singapore solicitors shall
