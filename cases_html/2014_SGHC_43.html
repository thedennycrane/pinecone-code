        Woo Bih Li J:</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       The
plaintiff, Wellspring Investments Ltd (“the Plaintiff”), is the owner
of shop unit #B1-08 (“B1-08”) in a row of units in a development
at No 17 Dairy Farm Road. The defendants, Samuel Sam and Chow Siow
May (“the Defendants”), are husband and wife. They are the owners
of an adjoining shop unit #B1-09 (“B1-09”). The Plaintiff claimed
that the Defendants’ B1-09 was encroaching on its B1-08. The Plaintiff
brought this action to claim various reliefs, including a mandatory
injunction for the Defendants to pull down a wall separating the
two units and to erect a new wall on an alleged proper boundary
between the two units.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       I
heard submissions on 28 October 2013. Thereafter, I granted the Plaintiff
the reliefs it had sought with damages to be assessed by a judge
and costs. I also granted a stay of one of my orders which required
the Defendants to pull down and reinstate the wall along the proper
boundary pending an appeal to the Court of Appeal. At the Defendants’
request, I heard further arguments. That hearing was on 20 January
2014. Thereafter, I affirmed my earlier decision.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The issues</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       The
Defendants’ arguments raised the following issues:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_3-p2_a"></a>(a)     whether
B1-09 was in fact encroaching on B1-08; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_3-p2_b"></a>(b)     whether
the terms of the Plaintiff’s purchase of B1-08 or of the Defendants’
purchase of B1-09 were relevant.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Whether B1-09 was in fact encroaching
on B1-08</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       The
Plaintiff’s case was straightforward. It had purchased B1-08 from a
mortgagee bank (“Maybank”). According to an online search of the Singapore
Land Authority (“SLA”) database, the area of B1-08 was stated to be
41sqm. However, the actual physical area on site was smaller.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       The
Plaintiff engaged a surveyor, Mr Tang Tuck Kin (“Mr Tang”), in 2005
to conduct a survey of B1-08 and the adjacent units. According to
the survey, B1-09 was encroaching on B1-08. The area of B1-09 was
stated in a similar online search to be 41sqm, <em>ie</em>,
the same as that for B1-08. However, the actual physical area of
B1-09 was about 61sqm whereas the actual physical area of B1-08
was about 21sqm. It appeared that B1-09 had encroached on B1-08
by about 20sqm, <em>ie</em>, by about half
of B1-08’s 41sqm.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       The
Defendants initially denied that B1-09 had encroached on B1-08. They
suggested that the encroachment was by unit #B1-07 (“B1-07”) instead.
However, they did not engage a surveyor to pursue this allegation and
indeed they stopped pursuing this point.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       The
Defendants’ second argument was that there was in fact no encroachment
by B1-09. They alleged that the existing boundary wall between B1-09
and B1-08 is in the correct place because that boundary wall is
correctly placed between two sets of external windows. They implied
that the intention of the developer could not have been to place
a boundary wall in the midst of a set of external windows. If the
boundary wall was moved as the Plaintiff wanted, it would split
up one set of external windows which the developer could not have
intended. Therefore, their position was that the survey plan for
the row of units in question had not been updated as should have
been the case. The alleged error was in the failure or omission
by the developer to amend the plan to be in line with the existing
physical situation on site. Therefore, the existing boundary wall
between B1-09 and B1-08 is not in the wrong place.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       There
was also a survey plan that was prepared by Mr Tang in 1993, which
showed that the areas of B1-08 and B1-09 were both 41sqm. The Defendants
suggested that this survey plan was there only to apportion the share
values for each strata title. This argument did not make any sense. There
was no reason for the survey plan to give wrong information just
to apportion the share values for each strata title.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       As
for the second argument that the 1993 survey plan was incorrect, the
Defendants faced various hurdles.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     First,
there was no evidence from the developer to support the Defendants’
suggestion.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     Secondly,
the existing boundary wall between two other units, <em>ie</em>,
B1-07 and B1-08 was already placed in the midst of a set of external
windows. If the developer was using the set of external windows
as the guide for which each boundary wall was to be placed, then
the boundary wall between B1-07 and B1-08 was placed at the wrong
location. Yet there was no suggestion by anyone, including the Defendants,
that this was the case.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     Thirdly,
Mr Tang was the surveyor who had prepared the 1993 plan of the development.
He was also the surveyor engaged by the Plaintiff in 2005, after
the Plaintiff had purchased B1-08. Mr Tang did not say that there
was an error in the 1993 plan or that there was an omission to update the
plan. On the contrary, his survey in 2005 indicated that B1-09 had encroached
on B1-08, as stated above.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     Fourthly,
the area of each unit was stated in the database of the SLA. The
suggestion that the areas for B1-08 and B1-09 were wrongly stated
was quite astounding, as there was no real evidence to support the
Defendants’ suggestion. The location of the external windows was
unreliable and inadequate evidence to support the Defendants’ suggestion,
in the absence of any evidence from the developer to that effect.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     In
passing, I mention one other point. It was unclear who was responsible
for the position of the existing boundary wall between B1-08 and
B1-09. Was it placed there by the developer, or one of the previous owners
before Maybank sold B1-09 to the Defendants? The Defendants had initially
speculated that the existing wall was put up by the mortgagor but switched
their position later and suggested that the existing wall was put
up by the developer. In any event, it was immaterial who was responsible
for the position of the existing boundary wall.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     The
Defendants’ third argument was that the boundary wall was already
in existence when they bought B1-09. However, that was immaterial to
the Plaintiff’s claim for encroachment.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     The
Defendants’ fourth argument was that the search on SLA’s database
for B1-08 revealed that there was no encumbrance. Therefore, the Plaintiff
could not claim that B1-09 was encroaching on B1-08. I was of the view
that the Defendants had got the argument backwards. It is for the person
claiming a valid interest to lodge or register the appropriate instrument
on the land register. The absence of notification of any encumbrance
on the land register is to the benefit of the Plaintiff and not the
Defendants. If the Defendants were right, then an owner may encroach on
the property of his neighbour, and when his misdeed is discovered,
he is entitled to say that because no encumbrance is recorded in
the particulars of the neighbour’s property in the relevant land
register, his neighbour cannot complain about his encroachment.
That is not correct. The same point applies even if the encroachment
was committed by a previous owner and not the current owner.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Whether the terms of the Plaintiff’s
purchase of B1-08 or of the Defendants’ purchase of B1-09 were relevant</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     I
come now to the second issue. In relation to this issue, the Defendants
had two arguments. The Defendants’ first argument was that they
too had bought their unit from Maybank. They inferred that Maybank’s
terms of sale of B1-08 to the Plaintiff would be the same as Maybank’s
terms of sale of B1-09 to them (the Defendants), even though the
sale of B1-09 to the Defendants was in 2001 and the sale of B1-08
to the Plaintiff was in late 2004 or early 2005.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     The
Defendants argued that it was likely that the Plaintiff would have bought
B1-08 on an “as is where is” basis just as they did when they bought B1-09.
They also referred to several terms of their purchase which would preclude
a purchaser from raising with Maybank any objection to the area of
the unit purchased from Maybank. However, the obstacle facing the Defendants
was that there was no privity of contract between the Plaintiff and
the Defendants. Even if the terms of sale of B1-08 precluded the Plaintiff
from complaining to Maybank about the area of B1-08, the Defendants
were not entitled to the benefit of those terms. To overcome this
hurdle, the Defendants relied on s 46(2)(<em>b</em>)
of the Land Titles Act (Cap 157, 2004 Rev Ed) (“the LTA”) which
states:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(2)    Nothing
in this section shall be held to prejudice the rights and remedies
of any person—</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">…</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(<em>b</em>)    to enforce against a proprietor
any contract to which that proprietor was a party;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">…</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     I
was of the view that the Defendants had misinterpreted s 46(2)(<em>b</em>) of the LTA. It merely preserves the
right of a person to enforce against a proprietor a contract to
which that proprietor was a party. It does not create a new right
if none existed. The person seeking to enforce the contract must first
establish his right to do so. The Defendants were not able to establish that
right since they were not a party to the contract of sale between Maybank
and the Plaintiff.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     The
Defendants’ second argument was that the Plaintiff was getting a windfall.
They suggested that the Plaintiff must have inspected B1-08 and have
known that the area of that unit was less than 41sqm. This was “supported”
by the fact that the Plaintiff had paid only $90,000 for B1-08. On
the other hand, the Defendants had paid $240,000 for B1-09. By referring
to the price they had paid, the Defendants were suggesting that they
had paid a much higher price than the Plaintiff because they were supposed
to get a much larger unit than the Plaintiff; whereas, if the Plaintiff
were entitled to the reliefs sought, the area of the two units would be
about the same. The Defendants attempted to show that the Plaintiff
had paid an unusually low price for a 41sqm unit and that they (the
Defendants) had paid an unusually high price for a 41sqm unit by
referring to prices reflected in online property searches done for
the periods 2002 to 2003 and 2004 to 2005 respectively.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     As
regards such evidence, the Plaintiff pointed out that, firstly,
the online property searches were general and were not even confined
to the Dairy Farm area. They covered District 23 which included
Hillview, Bukit Panjang and Choa Chu Kang. Secondly, the Defendants
had bought B1-09 in or about April 2001. Yet they were using figures
for the period 2002 to 2003. This suggested that the 2001 figures
would not support their contention that they had paid an unusually
high price for a 41sqm unit. I agreed with these two submissions
made by the Plaintiff.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     The
Defendants did not adduce any other evidence to support their allegation
that the price they had paid was for a 61sqm unit. At the first hearing
of the Plaintiff’s application on 30 July 2013, the Defendants’ counsel,
Mr Godwin Campos (“Mr Campos”), had already raised the allegation
that the price that the Defendants had paid was much more than what
the price for a 41sqm unit would have been. When I asked him whether
he had verified this allegation with the solicitors who had acted
for the Defendants in their purchase of B1-09, he said he had not.
I granted an adjournment to give the Defendants time to file an
affidavit in response to the first affidavit filed for the Plaintiff.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     The
affidavit in response was the first affidavit of the first Defendant filed
on 7 August 2013. There was no letter or supporting affidavit from
the solicitors acting for the Defendants in their purchase of B1-09.
There was therefore no evidence from the solicitors acting for them
in their purchase to support their contention that they had paid
for a unit larger than 41sqm. This omission, coupled with their
tactic of referring to prices for the period 2002 to 2003 of properties
in District 23, instead of 2001 prices for properties in Dairy Farm
estate only, led me to conclude that their allegation that they
had paid for a larger unit was untrue and that it was they who were
seeking to reap an undeserved windfall.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     More
importantly, it seemed to me that the issue was not whether the Plaintiff
would be obtaining a windfall or whether the Defendants would have
suffered a loss if the court were to grant the reliefs which the
Plaintiff sought. The real question was whether the Defendants had
acquired title to a unit of about 61sqm when they paid $240,000.
If the Plaintiff was obtaining a windfall at the expense of Maybank,
that was not the Defendants’ concern. Even if the Defendants had
contracted with Maybank to purchase B1-09 on the basis that B1-09
has a floor area of 61sqm, that would not assist the Defendants
vis-à-vis the Plaintiff if B1-09 in fact has a floor area of 41sqm.
The Defendants’ recourse would be possibly against Maybank only.
However, if they were precluded by the terms of their purchase from
making any claim against Maybank, then they would have to bear the
loss. Therefore, the terms of the Plaintiff’s purchase of B1-08
and the Defendants’ purchase of B1-09 were irrelevant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     In
the circumstances, I did not accept the Defendants’ argument that the
action should have been commenced by way of a writ of summons, as opposed
to an originating summons. The Defendants were suggesting that there
were major disputes of relevant facts because the terms on which
the Plaintiff had purchased B1-08 from Maybank were relevant. However,
as stated above, the Defendants were not a party to that contract. Furthermore,
the Plaintiff did establish that B1-09 was encroaching on B1-08.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     Accordingly,
I granted the Plaintiff the reliefs it had sought with damages to
be assessed by a judge and costs. I also ordered a stay as mentioned
above.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Further arguments</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     Subsequent
to my decision on 28 October 2013, the Defendants’ solicitors, Godwin
Campos LLC (“Campos”) wrote on 4 November 2013 to request an opportunity
to present further arguments. Various reasons were given but the
most pertinent one was in para 4 of Campos’ letter. It stated that
the Defendants had found old letters (in the plural) written to
them by Maybank’s solicitors before Maybank sold B1-08 to the Plaintiff.
The allegation was that Maybank always knew that B1-08 was only
21sqm. Maybank had asked the Defendants to buy the said 21sqm. The
Defendants had declined and Maybank subsequently sold B1-08 to the
Plaintiff. The letters were said to be “pivotal to any adjudication
of the present matter”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     Paragraph
6 of Campos’ letter stated that the Defendants do not have their
sale and purchase agreement as the Defendants’ previous solicitors, M/s
Boswell, Hsieh &amp; Lim (“BH&amp;L”), had ceased practice some
years ago. A letter confirming this could be produced if so required.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     Paragraph
11 of Campos’ letter stated that Maybank and Jones Lang Lasalle
(who conducted the auction of B1-08 to the Plaintiff) ought to be made
parties to the Plaintiff’s action “to bring the fullest facts …
for fair and final determination”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     Campos’
letter did not enclose the alleged letters from Maybank’s solicitors
as should have been done. Nevertheless, I decided to accede to the request
for further arguments to be presented. Subsequently, I directed
the Registrar of the Supreme Court to write to notify the solicitors
of both sides that the old letters which had been referred to in
para 4 of Campos’ letter had not been enclosed with that letter
and also to inform them that the time for filing an appeal pending
the outcome of the further arguments was suspended.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     On
6 December 2013, Campos wrote to forward one letter dated 23 September
2002 from Rajah &amp; Tann LLP (“R&amp;T”) (Maybank’s solicitors) to
the Defendants (“the R&amp;T Letter”) and one letter dated 12 November 2003
from BH&amp;L to the Defendants. The contents of each letter were revealing
as I will elaborate on later.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     The
further arguments took place on 20 January 2014. Mr Campos, counsel
for the Defendants, did not even seek to elaborate on why the Defendants
could not find the two letters from R&amp;T and from BH&amp;L earlier.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     In
any event, the letter from BH&amp;L did not help the Defendants’
case. It showed that BH&amp;L had informed the Defendants in November
2003 that BH&amp;L would cease practice from 1 January 2004. That
letter also asked the Defendants to “collect the complete file”
relating to B1-09 for their own safe-keeping. This letter came as
a surprise to me. As mentioned above, I had given time to the Defendants
to try and get whatever information they might need from the solicitors
who had acted for them in the purchase of B1-09. Mr Campos did not
disclose then that their previous solicitors had ceased practice
and that the Defendants already had an opportunity to collect the
complete file from the previous solicitors. Perhaps Mr Campos did
not know about BH&amp;L’s letter dated 12 November 2003. Eventually, Mr Campos
confirmed that the Defendants did in fact collect the complete file
from BH&amp;L.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     As
for the R&amp;T Letter, it referred to a letter dated 25 June 2002
(from R&amp;T to the Defendants) and an email dated 28 June 2002
(from the Defendants to R&amp;T). Mr Campos said that the Defendants
could not locate the earlier letter dated 25 June 2002 or their
email. No elaboration was given. Mr Campos did not ask R&amp;T for
a copy of either. His only excuse was that the communication was
so long ago. In any event, the R&amp;T Letter was revealing.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     It
showed that the Defendants had realised in 2002, if not earlier,
that B1-09 only had a floor area of 41 sqm, and that the Defendants
had already made an issue of this with Maybank. The R&amp;T Letter
did not agree with the Defendants that they were entitled to an
additional 20sqm. This suggested that the Defendants were not truthful
when they contended that they had in fact contracted to buy a unit
of 61sqm. They might have thought that the unit was of that size
but that was different from saying that their contract specified
that size. Indeed, they were unable to produce any document to support
the latter.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     Furthermore,
the R&amp;T Letter did not say that B1-08 was only 21sqm as was
alleged in Campos’ letter dated 4 November 2013. On the contrary, the
R&amp;T Letter had proposed that the Defendants purchase the additional area
occupied by them (about 20sqm) and the “remaining” area of B1-08 (about
21sqm) at a price to be agreed. R&amp;T also threatened to take
steps to recover “the encroached area” from the Defendants if there
was no agreement on the proposal. Paragraph 4 of Campos’ letter
was therefore misleading.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     Ironically,
the substance of the R&amp;T Letter made the Defendants’ case worse.
It showed that:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_37-p2_a"></a>(a)     The
Defendants knew that their allegation in the present action that
any encroachment was by B1-07 (and not B1-09) or that there was
no encroachment of B1-08 was false. They already knew in 2002 that
B1-09 was encroaching upon B1-08.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_37-p2_b"></a>(b)     If
the Defendants genuinely believed that an error had been made in
the 1993 survey plan, they would have made an application for rectification
in 2002 or 2003 after R&amp;T’s letter. They did not do so and only
mentioned rectification in 2013 and 2014 in the proceedings before
me.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_37-p2_c"></a>(c)     Maybank
was disputing with the Defendants that they were entitled to 61sqm,
contrary to the Defendants’ suggestion. This reinforced the point
that the Defendants’ emphasis on their purchase price was irrelevant.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_37-p2_d"></a>(d)     The
Defendants were given the opportunity to buy B1-08 comprising the
encroached area of 20sqm and the remaining area of 21sqm. They chose
not to do so.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_37-p2_e"></a>(e)     Maybank
knew that B1-08 was 41sqm and knew about the problem of the encroachment.
There was no basis to suggest that Maybank had sold or transferred
only 21sqm to the Plaintiff when Maybank sold B1-08.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     Unsurprisingly,
Plaintiff’s counsel did not pursue his objection to the Defendants’
introduction of the two letters from BH&amp;L and from R&amp;T.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     As
for the Defendants’ repeated arguments that more information should
be given about the terms of the contract between the Plaintiff and Maybank,
I have said above that such terms were irrelevant. The Defendants
are not a party to that contract and they acquired title to their own
unit of about 41sqm only.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     I
was of the view that the Defendants had been economical with the truth.
They have had the benefit of wrongfully occupying the additional 21sqm
for about 12 years with full knowledge of the encroachment. I affirmed
my orders given on 28 October 2013 including the stay order pending
an appeal.</p>
