The DJ had allowed an appeal by the Respondent, Mai Xun Yao, against the decision of the Deputy Registrar (the “DR”) who had awarded costs of $40,000 in the Applicant’s favour. The DJ found that the DR (who was the trial judge) had not taken into consideration an offer to settle (the “OTS”) made by the Respondent before the trial which was rejected by the Applicant. This was mainly due to the parties’ failure to raise the issue of the OTS to the DR before the DR’s costs award was made. However, the existence of the OTS was brought to the attention of the DR at the first tranche which dealt with the liability of the parties. In view of the OTS, the DJ allowed the Respondent’s appeal, reversed the DR’s costs award and ordered costs of $20,000 in the Respondent’s favour instead, with disbursements to be fixed if not agreed. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 The Applicant was dissatisfied with the costs award made by the DJ and applied in DC/SUM 706/2023 (“SUM 706”) for permission to appeal against the DJ’s decision as the DJ’s decision is appealable only if permission is granted. In SUM 706, after hearing the application and the submissions of the parties, the DJ denied the Applicant permission to appeal against the DJ’s decision on the basis that the necessary criteria for permission to appeal to be granted had not been satisfied.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">3 The Applicant now makes this application for permission to appeal against the decision of the DJ and to set aside the DJ’s decision which rejected the Applicant’s application for permission to appeal in SUM 706. Having considered the parties’ submissions, I find that the application is unmeritorious as the threshold for permission to appeal to be granted has not been met.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">4 I shall set out below the brief facts and procedural history of the case before explaining my views on why the application for permission to appeal against the decision of the DJ is unmeritorious.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Background facts and the proceedings below</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Background facts</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">5 The Applicant and the Respondent were business partners in two companies (the “two companies”). One of the two companies was Sheenway Exhibition and Projects Pte Ltd (“SE&amp;P”). The Applicant held 40% of the shares in SE&amp;P and the Respondent held 60% of the shares in SE&amp;P. As a result of differences which arose, the parties entered into a settlement agreement (the “SA”). As part of the SA, the parties had agreed that SE&amp;P would cease all operations except the collection of outstanding debts. Further, the receivables were to be distributed between the Applicant and the Respondent in accordance with the proportion of shares they each held. The parties also appended their signatures to a document which stated that SE&amp;P’s receivables were in excess of $530,000 (see <span class="font-italic">Tey Leng Yen v Mai Xun Yao </span>[2021] SGDC 65 (the “Trial Judgment”) at [1]–[6]).

The first tranche dealt with the liability of the parties. There were two issues to be decided at the first tranche: (a) whether the Respondent had breached the SA by allowing SE&amp;P to continue operating; and (b) whether the Respondent had breached the SA by failing to distribute the receivables of SE&amp;P in accordance with the proportion of the shares held by the parties (see the Trial Judgment at [14]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">10 The DR who was the trial judge in the second tranche on assessment of damages found that the Applicant succeeded in proving that the Respondent had breached the SA by allowing SE&amp;P to continue operating (see the Trial Judgment at [16]–[48]). However, the DR found that the Applicant failed to prove that the Respondent had breached the SA by failing to distribute the receivables of SE&amp;P in accordance with the proportion of the shares held by the parties as SE&amp;P was still in operation with outstanding receivables, debts and expenses. Thus, the receivables could not be distributed until after SE&amp;P’s liabilities were settled (see the Trial Judgment at [50]–[54]). Given the Applicant’s success on the first issue, the DR found that the Applicant was entitled to interlocutory judgment with damages to be assessed for the loss occasioned by the Respondent’s breach of the SA by allowing SE&amp;P to continue operating (see the Trial Judgment at [55]). The Respondent appealed to the High Court against the decision of the DR, but the appeal was dismissed on 15 July 2021.

The DR, however, found that the Applicant had failed to prove the loss she suffered and the quantum of that loss as a result of the Respondent’s breach which allowed SE&amp;P to continue operating because the company was in operation and the Applicant’s share of SE&amp;P’s receivables could only be determined after SE&amp;P’s liabilities were settled. The DR thus awarded nominal damages of $1,000 to the Applicant with interest.

</div> The DJ’s decision can be summarised as follows:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The OTS remained valid at the time the DR made an assessment on damages. Further, the Applicant did not obtain a judgment that was more favourable than the OTS. Although the Applicant had won on the first liability issue of the Respondent’s breach of the SA by allowing SE&amp;P to continue operating, the Applicant was awarded only nominal damages as the Applicant could not prove the damages suffered. The Applicant had to wait until after SE&amp;P’s liabilities had been settled and its operations ceased before she could ascertain her share of SE&amp;P’s receivables. This was akin to what was offered in the OTS. If the Applicant had accepted the OTS, she would have been in no worse a position than she was after the decision on assessment of damages was made by the DR. Therefore, the judgment obtained by the Applicant was not more favourable than the terms of the OTS.

Therefore, the costs consequences provided for in O 22A r 9(3) of the ROC 2014 should have applied. In other words, the Applicant was entitled to costs on the standard basis until 17 March 2020 which was when the OTS was served, and the Respondent was entitled to costs on the indemnity basis from the date the OTS was served to 18 November 2022 when the DR made her decision on damages.

Nevertheless, the DJ considered whether the Applicant should be regarded as a successful party given that she had only been awarded nominal damages. Here, the DJ stated that the general principle as set out in <span class="font-italic">Anglo-Cyprian Trade Agencies Ltd v Paphos Wine Industries Ltd </span>[1951] 1 All ER 873 was that where a plaintiff is only awarded nominal damages, the plaintiff should not be regarded as a successful party and costs should be awarded to the defendant as if he had succeeded in his defence. In RA 85, the DJ took the view that even if the OTS had not existed or applied, the DR should have ordered that each party should bear its own costs for the first tranche of the trial. As for the second tranche, the DJ was of the view that the Applicant should have to bear costs of the assessment of damages hearing as the Applicant took an unrealistic position in the second tranche of the trial to insist on damages unnecessarily and caused costs and expenses in the second tranche of the trial. Therefore, even if the OTS did not exist or apply, the DJ would have found that the DR erred in awarding the Applicant costs of $40,000.

The DJ also awarded the Respondent costs of $32,000 on an indemnity basis from the date the OTS was served to the date of judgment in the second tranche of the trial. The net effect of this was a costs award of $20,000 in the Respondent’s favour. Therefore, the DJ set aside the DR’s costs award and ordered costs of $20,000 in the Respondent’s favour, with disbursements to be fixed if not agreed.

On the one hand, the Applicant took issue that the DJ had considered the OTS in RA 85 when it had not been brought up to the DR during the hearing on costs before the DR. On the other hand, the Applicant took issue that the DJ had considered the OTS in RA 85 when the DR had already considered the OTS when it was brought to the attention of the DR by way of the Respondent’s 21 November 2022 Letter. The Applicant’s counsel also accepted that these were contradictory positions.

The DJ also gave due weight to the DR’s decision when evaluating whether the DR had erred in deciding on the award of costs. The DR had not indicated that she had considered the OTS, or provided reasons to support the DR’s award of costs in light of the OTS. In view of the facts of the case, the DR’s award of costs could not be sustained.

</div> If this were so, this would mean that every appellate decision by an adjudicator not involved in proceedings below would necessarily lead to a <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> case of error for which an appeal would lie. Furthermore, the Applicant has no basis to substantiate her allegation that the DJ had failed to accord due weight to the DR’s costs award beyond emphasising that the DR was better placed to make the costs award.

</div> However, a perusal of the DJ’s oral grounds in RA 85 dated 10 March 2023 shows that the DJ had expressly considered the DR’s costs award and that the DR had erred by omitting to consider the OTS costs regime. Specifically, the DJ found that it was “almost certain” that the DR omitted to consider the OTS costs regime when making the decision on costs because: (a) there was no record of the OTS costs regime being raised in parties’ costs submissions in the hearing after the decision on assessment of damages was rendered; (b) although the existence of the OTS was mentioned briefly by the Defendant’s counsel after the decision on liability was rendered, there was no indication that the DR considered this in her award on costs; and that (c) the DR’s oral remarks before awarding costs were brief and failed to mention the OTS costs regime.

If it can be shown that the master took into account matters that he should not have taken into account or failed to take into account matters that he should have taken into account, in those circumstances the judge in chambers would be entitled to vary the order made by the master, but in my judgment it would not be in the interests of justice if judges in chambers entered into detailed examination of all the matters that were before the master in order to decide whether they would have come to the same decision as the master. Generally speaking, in my judgment, judges in chambers should not allow appeals against costs orders by masters, <span class="font-italic">unless it can be shown that the order made was unreasonable or erred in law or, as I have indicated, either failed to take into account proper matters or took into account matters that should not have been taken into account.</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">From the passage above, it can be seen that while the court in <span class="font-italic">Hoddle</span> had cautioned against going into too detailed an examination of the matters below, the court nonetheless accepted that appeals against costs awards can be allowed where the award  made was unreasonable, resulted from an error of law or resulted from <span class="font-italic">the failure</span><span class="font-italic"> to take into account proper matters</span> or from the taking into account of matters which should not have been taken into account. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 I am of the view that the DJ did not err in allowing the appeal in RA 85 because the DJ correctly found that the DR failed to properly consider the OTS in making the costs award.

First, the DJ had explained that, in the absence of any reasoned decision by the DR on why the OTS did not affect the DR’s decision on costs, the DJ concluded that the OTS had not been properly considered.

Whilst the DR’s decision was to be considered when deciding RA 85, costs is a matter of discretion and the DJ was entitled to decide on the issue of costs differently from the DR.

This is based on the principle that where the requirements above are fulfilled, the plaintiff should have accepted the offer to settle instead of proceeding to judgment (see <span class="font-italic">NTUC Foodfare Co-operative Ltd v SIA Engineering Co Ltd and another </span>[2018] 2 SLR 1043 at [25]).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The monetary sum offered in an offer to settle is only one factor to be taken into account in determining whether the judgment obtained by the plaintiff is more favourable than an offer to settle (see <span class="font-italic">CCM Industrial Pte Ltd v Uniquetech Pte Ltd </span>[2009] 2 SLR(R) 20 at [40]).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) There is nothing in Order 22A r 9(3) of the ROC 2014 which requires an offer to settle to be one which settles the entirety of the proceedings, or which prevents an offer to settle from dealing with non-monetary claims (see <span class="font-italic">Ram Das V N </span><span class="font-italic">P v SIA Engineering Co Ltd </span>[2015] 3 SLR 267 (“<span class="font-italic">Ram Das</span>”) at [30] and [42]).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) What is important in assessing an offer to settle is whether it is a serious and genuine offer to settle (see <span class="font-italic">Ram Das </span>at [46]).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) While the plaintiff may derive some non-monetary value from obtaining a judgment, this is subjective and incapable of precise quantification. Therefore, as a matter of principle, the non-monetary value that the plaintiff may obtain from a judgment should not be accounted for when analysing whether the judgment obtained by the plaintiff is one which was not more favourable than the terms of the offer to settle (see <span class="font-italic">Michael Vaz Lorrain v Singapore Rifle Association </span>[2021] 1 SLR 513 at [56]–[57]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 When applying the principles above, it is clear that the DJ’s position that the judgment obtained by the Applicant was not more favourable than the terms of the OTS is correct.
