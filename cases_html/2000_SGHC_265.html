<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">The Action</font></p></b>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">1.

        On 20 February 1999 a fire razed two shophouses

known as 23 and 25 Senang Crescent ("No. 23" and "No. 25"

respectively). The first plaintiffs are the owners of No. 23 and the second plaintiff was

the tenant of the second storey of that shophouse. The first defendants are the owners of

No. 25. The second defendants were the tenants of the second storey of No. 25, and the

third defendants were the tenants of the first storey of No. 25. The plaintiffs sued all

three defendants for damage arising from the fire on the ground that the fire started at

No. 25 and was the result of the negligence of the defendants. They also sued

alternatively under the rule in <i>Rylands v Fletcher</i>, and recited <i>res ipsa

loquitur</i> for good measure. No claim, however, was made in the tort of nuisance. The

first and second defendants filed a counter-claim on the ground that the fire started at

No. 23. At trial Mr. Cheong and Mr. Anparasan for the first and second defendants

respectively were granted leave to discontinue the counter-claims. At the close of the

plaintiffs’ case, counsel for the first and second defendants submitted that there

was no case for their clients to meet.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">2.

        The main issue of fact concerned the origin and

cause of the fire although, of course, where the cause of action founded on negligence is

concerned, the origin of fire need not necessarily be at the defendants’ premises.

However, in this case the plaintiffs’ allegations were that the point of origin and

the negligent act (cause of the fire) occurred at the premises occupied by the third

defendants, namely the first storey of No. 25. The plaintiffs’ case was that the fire

originated beneath a woodpile in the front yard of No. 25. They alleged that the fire

ignited from a fuse box which had been negligently tampered with when the normal fuses

were replaced with three copper wires. Consequently, the fuses failed to blow when a

short-circuit occurred. An electrical arcing (electrical sparks) occurred and ignited the

fire which subsequently spread to the plaintiffs’ premises next door.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">3.

        Counsel for the first and second defendants

submitted that the action against them ought to be dismissed. Their submissions were

straightforward. Counsel argued that there is no legal liability in law against persons

who were not in occupation or control of premises in which a fire had started and spread

to surrounding premises. Secondly, they argued, that there was no allegation or evidence

of any negligence on their clients’ part in causing the fire. The evidence was

manifestly clear that neither of these defendants were occupiers or tenants of the lower

premises at No. 25.</font></p>
<b xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Strict Liability Of Owners </font></p></b>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">4.

        Mr. Gn, counsel for the plaintiffs, submitted

that the first defendants, as owners, are liable to the plaintiffs on "an ancient

common law" that owners are strictly liable for fires that start or spread from their

premises. He argued that s 63 of the Insurance Act, Cap 142, offers the only possible

relief to an owner, but that provision does not avail the first defendants because the

fire here was not an accidental fire. S 63 is based on s 86 of The Fires Prevention

(Metropolis) Act 1774. S 63 reads as follows:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">"No action shall lie against

    a person in whose house or premises or on whose estate any fire accidentally began except

    that no contract or agreement made between landlord and tenant shall be hereby defeated or

    made void".</font></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">5.

        Mr. Gn contended that in this case, if he

succeeded in showing that the fire was caused by someone’s negligence, and it did not

matter whose, then the fire cannot be said to have started accidentally, and the first

defendants as owners must therefore be liable. An important point must first be made about

s 63. It is a statutory provision which confers immunity from action in circumstances in

which fire was started accidentally. It is not a statutory provision creating a cause of

action. This statutory provision therefore provides an instance in which an owner would

not be liable. It does not interfere with the position of the owner at common law.

Historically, the cases that have dealt with the escape of fire concerned owners who were

also occupiers, but Mr. Gn wanted a judicial pronouncement that an owner who is not in

occupation or control is liable for damage caused by fire spread from his premises unless

the fire began accidentally. A passage from Michael Jones’s <i>Textbook On Torts</i>

(7th edition, p367 – p368  8.2.1) provides an illuminating summary of an

owner’s liability at common law:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">"The early common law remedy

    for damage caused by fire was a form of trespass on the case for negligently allowing

    one’s fire to escape. The word ‘negligently’ was not used in its modern

    sense and there is some doubt as to whether liability was strict or fault-based (cf. <i>Winfield

    and Jolowicz, p446</i> with <i>Clerk and Lindsell,  25-29</i> and <i>Charlesworth and

    Percy,  12-105</i> to <i>12-109</i>). Many of the judicial comments to the effect that a

    man must keep his fire ‘at his peril’ have been made in the context of actions

    which are analogous to the rule in <i>Rylands v Fletcher,</i> although liability for fire

    predates <i>Rylands v</i> <i>Fletcher</i>. Thus, there must be an escape; liability is

    based on the occupation and control of land and so an occupier is liable for the acts of

    others who are under his control; and act of a stranger or an unforeseeable Act of God are

    defences.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">The modern tendency, then, has

    been to assimilate the common law liability for fire with the rule in <i>Rylands &amp;</i>
<i>Fletcher</i>."</font></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">6.

        A similar commentary is found in <i>The Law of

Torts</i>, by John Fleming (9<sup>th</sup> edition, p392) which stated that the common law

liability "was fundamentally changed by <i>Rylands v Fletcher</i>. Not only was fire

itself readily treated as a <i>Rylands v Fletcher</i> object, but the ancient rule for the

escape of fire, including its statutory modification, was eventually absorbed and

qualified by, the principle in <i>Rylands v Fletcher</i>". In my view, there is

neither authority nor justification in holding an owner who is not in occupation or

control of premises which had been tenanted out is nonetheless liable for fire arising and

spreading from those premises on account of mere ownership. The plaintiffs’ recourse

is to sue the actual occupier who may join the owner as a third party if he has an

independent claim for an indemnity from the owner.</font></p>
<b xmlns=""><i>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Ryland v Fletcher</font></p></i> And The

First And Second Defendant </b>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">7.

        Mr. Gn conceded that the plaintiffs had no

basis in proceeding against the owners here under the rule in <i>Rylands v Fletcher</i>,

but sought to argue that they did as against the second defendants. However, the

plaintiffs did not plead <i>Rylands v Fletcher</i> against the second defendants and,

having closed their case, it was too late to amend the pleadings. It would have required

them to plead the particulars of non-natural user and the subsequent escape, both of which

are indispensable elements of the rule. The only particulars in the pleadings refer to an

escape of fire due to what the plaintiffs call "defective wiring". It would not

be right to expect the second defendants to amend their defence and get-up their case at

this stage to meet the fresh cause. Furthermore, the plaintiffs’ evidence have not

shown that there was a non-natural user of land, by the second defendants. The ordinary

use of electricity is not a non-natural user of land in the <i>Ryland v Fletcher</i>

sense. No submission was, in any event, made by Mr. Gn in this regard.</font></p>
<b xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Negligence Against First And

Second Defendants</font></p></b>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">8.

        The third ground which Mr. Gn relied on against

the first and second defendants was based on negligence. He argued that these defendants

though not occupiers of the lower floor of No. 25, were under a duty of care as owner and

main tenant respectively, to inspect the fuse box at regular intervals. On the evidence,

the third defendants were in occupation as tenants for at least four years prior to the

fire. There was no contractual obligation on the part of the first or second defendants to

maintain the fuse box, and even if there were, their duty as owner and main tenant was

only to carry out repairs as and when required by the tenant. It would be an unwarranted

expansion of that duty to require them to make regular inspection of premises which they

had no right of entry during the duration of the tenancy to the third defendants without

the latter’s consent. Furthermore, the suggestion, postulated by Mr. Gn, that three

separate and independent parties (the three defendants) may and ought to share the same

duty of inspecting the fuse box is impractical, and unnecessary for imposing legal

responsibility. Only one party should hold that responsibility, and that lies with the

occupier. If he has a separate contractual arrangement with anyone else then it is for him

to bring that person into the action by way of third party proceedings. Mr. Gn relied on <i>Virco

Metal Industrial Pte Ltd v Carltech Trading Industries Pte Ltd &amp; Ors, <a class="remove" href1="/scripts/lp/dll/prospect.dll?GetHTML_lpqs&amp;type=1&amp;CaseID=51033&amp;freetext=" target="LWBMainFrame">[2000] 2 SLR 201</a>, </i>for the authority that the landlord is responsible for checking and installing a

safe and proper switch. But that case turned on its own facts. There was no allegation by

the plaintiffs or the third defendants in the present case that it was the first or second

defendants who replaced the fuses with copper wires. The third defendants’ case was

that they did not tamper with the fuses but they did not know who did; and they were not

prepared to say that it was either the first or second defendants who were responsible for

it. In the nine years that the first storey of No. 25 was tenanted out no complaint was

received by the first defendant landlords that something about the fuse box was amiss.

There was no evidence that anyone had any inclination that the fuses in the fuse box had

been replaced by copper wire; but more importantly, there was no evidence that that

particular fuse box, in the shophouse that was at least 30 years old, was still in use. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">9.

        Mr. Gn suggested that an expansion of the duty

of care requiring the three defendants to make regular inspection merely required them to

meet and agree on the appointment of an electrician to make regular inspections of the

fuse box, and was, therefore, not an onerous duty. It is not quite so simple. Mr.

Gn’s idea may be convenient for persons in the plaintiff’s position, but an

expansion of the duty he proposed involves an unnecessary intrusion into areas of law and

practice concerning landlords and tenants. The law imposes sufficient obligations and

sanctions on an occupier not to do harm to his neighbour, whether by trespass, negligence,

nuisance or under the Rule in <i>Rylands v Fletcher</i>. An occupier in the

plaintiffs’ position seeking comfort against harm or damage that falls outside the

above laws protecting him, must cover himself with appropriate insurance. </font><b></b></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Res Ipsa Loquitur</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">10.

        I need to deal with the plaintiffs’ plea

of <i>res ipsa loquitur</i>. In my judgment, <i>res ipsa loquitur </i>is only an

evidentiary doctrine and does not apply in this case because the plaintiffs had

specifically sought to show that the cause of the fire was an electrical ignition. That

being the case, it will not assist them to say that if they fail, the defendants must then

explain how the fire occurred. This is not how the doctrine is intended to be used. The

burden of proof lies with he who asserts. Where a plaintiff asserts negligence he must

prove negligence. If he is unable to assert any cause, then he may, if the circumstances

permit, cry <i>res ipsa loquitur</i> and shift the burden of proof to the defendant to

establish how the facts complained of occurred. The overall burden (the legal burden) of

proving the plaintiffs’ case remains with the plaintiff. Where, as in this case, the

plaintiff makes a specific allegation of negligence he cannot rely on the rule to

establish a preliminary case of negligence. He must proceed to prove forthwith that which

he has asserted to be the defendant’s negligence.</font></p>
<b xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Conclusion</font></p></b>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">11.

        For the reasons above I find that the

plaintiffs have no cause to pursue against the first and second defendants. Their

application to dismiss the plaintiffs’ claim was therefore allowed. The trial then

continued against the third defendants. In the meantime, however, the plaintiffs have

filed an appeal against my decision dismissing their claim against the first and second

defendants.</font></p>
