First, the Defendant argues that Lee Teck Har (“David Lee”), who is a member of the CSC, was not an independent member as there was a conflict of interest. He was in a patronage relationship with the rest of the CSC members. This allegation arose from the fact that the Management Corporation Strata Title No 1729 (“MCST”) of The Albracca had waived $644 for late payment interest owed by David Lee to the MCST in 2015 as he had failed to pay his maintenance charges on time. The members of the MCST then were the spouses of the other members of the CSC.

</div> Therefore, the Defendant contends that this created a patronage relationship and this gave rise to a conflict of interest between David Lee and the other members of the CSC as David Lee was indebted to them. Furthermore, the Defendant submits that the waiver of David Lee’s late payment interest for not paying his maintenance charges on time was not raised or disclosed by David Lee at the EGM on 15 June 2016 when the members of the CSC were elected.

The Defendant doubts Savills was acting independently because the valuation figures in its reports were uncannily similar to the indicative valuation report (“Indicative Valuation”) submitted by JLL prior to Savills’ appointment as a third-party valuer.

In particular, the Defendant argues that the TAS was on a “no sale, no fee” basis and the SPA provided for a pool of funds which would cover any expenses incurred in defending the collective sale and against any objections raised by the SPs. However, the Defendant would have to bear all the expenses, including the litigation costs, to oppose the collective sale. This, according to the Defendant, is unfair and the CSC had breached its duty of even-handedness when it entered into the TAS and the SPA.

</div>
</div>At the time of the waiver the CSC was not formed yet. There is also no evidence that the topic of collective sale was discussed when the waiver was granted to David Lee. The CSC was only formed at the EGM on 15 June 2016. Hence the waiver was given by the MCST nine months or 13 months, depending on the Defendant’s or Plaintiffs’ version respectively, before the formation of the CSC. The decision for the waiver was made by the MCST and not by the CSC. Furthermore, none of the members of the MCST was in the CSC. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 It is insufficient for the Defendant to merely show that David Lee had received a waiver of his late payment interest arrears of $644 for his late payment of his maintenance charges and then conclude that David Lee was in a patronage relationship with the rest of the CSC members and thus incapable of acting independently. There is no <span class="font-italic">prima</span><span class="font-italic"> facie</span> evidence that David Lee had failed in any way, to act independently or in the best interest of the SPs, as a member of the CSC. I also notice that the amount of $644 waived was only the interest on the arrears owed by David Lee for late payment of his maintenance charges. Furthermore, David Lee’s second request for waiver of $59 interest for late payment of the maintenance charges in June 2016 was not granted by the MCST albeit the sum was much smaller. Thus I agree with the Plaintiffs that the waiver of David Lee’s interest arrears of $644 in 2015 and David Lee’s appointment to the CSC are two unrelated events. He, like the Defendant, owns one of the four small units. Like the other SPs of the small units he would want the best returns from the collective sale. It is unimaginable for him to compromise his own interest and that of the other SPs of small units for a paltry sum of $644.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 Hence, I find that there was nothing untoward in David Lee’s appointment to the CSC.

Whether the collective sale is carried out fairly and equitably will probably be determined at this stage when the CSC has to recommend the most equitable MOA to all the SPs, including those who resist the collective sale. This case is no different. There are various formulations of MOA in any collective sale. In fact, in Savills’ MOA report, at paragraph 5, Savills referred to the Singapore Institute of Surveyors and Valuers’ (“SISV”) guidelines on the distribution methods which generally include the following:

JLL showed that a MOA comprising 50% SV and 50% SA would result in wide variations between the collective sale premium each unit type will enjoy. A collective sale premium is the difference between what a SP would receive in a collective sale and what a SP would receive when he or she sold his or her unit in the open market. According to JLL, the difference in premium between the unit with the highest premium and the lowest premium using the MOA of 50% SV and 50% SA was 23%. This was due to the unique configurations of The Albracca and the way share values were distributed across the units.

As such, JLL advised the CSC that the MOA of 1/3 SV – 1/3 SA – 1/3 CMV would result in a distribution of sale proceeds that is fair and just for all the SPs of The Albracca.

</div> JLL gave a presentation to them explaining the proposed MOA of 1/3 SV – 1/3 SA – 1/3 CMV and informed the SPs that if they agree to include CMV into the formulation of the MOA, they would need to bear the costs of engaging an independent valuer to determine the CMV of each unit. JLL also explained to the SPs about the two different types of approaches that could be used to arrive at the CMV of each unit – the Individual Unit Valuation or the Typical Unit Valuation. For the Individual Unit Valuation, the valuer would have to enter each individual home unit and assess the value of the unit. For the Typical Unit Valuation, the valuer disregards unit orientation, height, views and internal renovations and assigns values to each of the unit types. The valuer would not inspect all units but only the typical units.

The CSC was also thorough and careful as it had consulted real estate experts in its deliberation on the most equitable MOA. The CSC was also transparent and had regularly updated and consulted the SPs on the proposed MOA at the appropriate stages of the collective sale.

</div> The Defendant’s preferred MOA of 50% SV and 50% CMV had deliberately excluded the strata area of the SPs.

In fact the Defendant’s unit type stood to gain the highest premium of 99.2% from the MOA of 1/3 SV – 1/3 SA – 1/3 CMV.

However, I find that Savills’ valuation report was sound and the CSC had acted in good faith when it accepted the valuation report prepared by Savills.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 Looking first at Savills’ valuation report, there was nothing untoward which would lead me to doubt the soundness of the report. Savills had clarified that it adopted the Typical Unit Valuation approach as per CSC’s instructions and derived its figures using the Direct Comparison Method. The Typical Unit Valuation and the Direct Comparison Method were also explained in Savills’ report. Savills further justified the approach it took to derive the Typical Unit Valuation figures for the various unit types in The Albracca. Savills explained that it first used unit #06-02 of The Albracca as a base unit for analysis and made adjustments to derive the value of the other typical units in The Albracca. Savills used recent sales transaction data from comparable developments in the immediate vicinity of The Albracca to help form the basis of its analysis and its opinion of the valuation. In determining which developments were comparable to The Albracca in the vicinity, Savills took into consideration factors such as the date of sale (to be as close to 16 February 2017 as possible), tenure, size, age and proximity of the development to The Albracca as well as the facilities in the development. Savills then made the appropriate upward or downward adjustments of the market value of the units of the comparable developments to derive the valuation of the base unit. Again, the upward or downward adjustments took into consideration the same factors used in determining which developments are comparable to The Albracca. Finally, Savills then made the necessary adjustments from the base unit’s valuation to derive the valuation of the other unit types in The Albracca. Savills also highlighted that its approach was in line with the SISV’s guidelines which is the industry practice.

The Defendant has raised a number of rather technical objections to the valuation report prepared by Savills. In particular, the Defendant relies on the sales transactions of units at The Albracca over the past 25 years. The Defendant also refers to the sales transactions of developments in faraway districts such as The Interlace in District 4 and Pandan Valley in District 21 to estimate the per square foot (“psf”) price of units in The Albracca which is in District 15.

Therefore, the balcony areas of the large units should be priced at one-third the psf price of built-in areas. Thus the psf price of the large units in The Albraca had to be 33% lower than the psf price of the small units. The Defendant argues that Savills did not take into account this premium for the small units in its valuation report.

The Defendant claims that his experience as the Head of Investments at Great Eastern Life Assurance Co Ltd and Mr Han’s experience as Head of Resource and Development Team at DBS Bank, amongst others, meant that they were suitably qualified to provide expert comments on real estate and property valuations.

Furthermore, neither he nor Mr Han has any training or qualifications in valuing private residential properties for collective sales. Therefore, I find that the Defendant’s analysis of and challenges against Savills’ valuation report which were solely based on his own understanding of the report and how he believed the valuation should have been done bear very little or no weight. On top of all these, the Defendant has a strong self-interest in his own calculations and thus there was a severe deficiency of objectivity. Furthermore, there is no affidavit from Mr Han.

</div> Savills had analysed the sales transactions of other residential developments in the vicinity and carried out “pairing analysis” of sales transactions of large and small units in each of the comparable developments and the large and small units in The Albracca. The “pairing analysis” included identifying suitable pairs of comparable developments in the vicinity of The Albracca by looking at the size, date of transaction and whether the large and small units in these comparable developments were located in the same building. Savills then made adjustments to determine the effective floor area to account for uncovered strata area such as roof terraces and private enclosed spaces and strata void areas wherever appropriate. Further adjustments were made to the large units in these comparable developments to equalise the differences within each pair of comparables in terms of floor level, orientation, view, type, condition and date of sale.

I must also add that I accept Savills’ findings that an 8% psf price differential between large and small units (in favour of the small units) is the appropriate adjustment to make in evaluating the units in The Albracca. Finally, as discussed above, Savills’ valuations took into account prevailing market conditions which is required in assessing whether the valuation is sound: <span class="font-italic">Horizon Partners </span>at [130]. The same cannot be said of the Defendant’s calculations.

</div> In my view the Defendant’s minutiae attack on Savills’ calculations was unwarranted. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">76 The Defendant also argues that Savills was not independent when it prepared its report. The Defendant seems to intimate that Savills was in cahoots with JLL and the CSC in coming to its valuation findings. To support this, the Defendant alleges that Savills’ valuation figures were very close to the figures in the Indicative Valuation provided by JLL. Thus the Defendant submits that the CSC was acting in bad faith when it chose to accept Savills’ valuation figures in coming to a decision on the MOA to adopt.

</div>
</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">77 On this point, I find that there was nothing in Savills’ valuation report to indicate that it did not conduct independent research in coming to its findings. Apart from the similar findings between Savills’ valuation report and JLL’s Indicative Valuation, the Defendant did not adduce any evidence to show that there was collusion between Savills and JLL in the preparation of Savills’ valuation report. Given that both JLL and Savills are experts and professionals in property valuation, it is probable that the similar conclusions in their findings can be attributed to them using the proper industry method to derive the valuation of the units in The Albracca. The Defendant’s suspicion of collusion between Savills and JLL because their findings were similar was not supported by any evidence. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">78 Finally, the Defendant argues that Savills gave full valuation to the built-in and balcony areas of the large units. This is a misconception of the Defendant. Savills had explained in its affidavit that it applied a downward adjustment of 8% psf price from the psf price of the small units to derive the market value of the large units (see above at [68] and [69]). This meant that Savills had taken into account the fact that the large units have larger built-in and balcony areas as compared to the small units. Hence the small unit had a premium over the large unit.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">79  For the above reasons, I find that Savills’ valuation report was sound and there was nothing on the face of the valuation report and on the evidence which casted any doubt on Savills’ independence when they prepared the valuation report. Thus the CSC had not acted in bad faith when it accepted the valuation report prepared by Savills. In fact, I must add that I find that the CSC had acted conscientiously by engaging an independent third-party valuer, with the consent of the SPs, to conduct an independent valuation of all the units of The Albracca before it made the decision to adopt the MOA of 1/3 SV – 1/3 SA – 1/3 CMV as the preferred MOA for the collective sale of The Albracca.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Were the TAS and the SPA fair and in line with the CSC’s duty to act even-handedly?</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">80 The relevant clause which the Defendant took issue with is cl 59 of the SPA:

I find that cl 59 shifted the financial burden of funding the costs of obtaining the approval necessary for the collective sale onto the purchaser without affecting the purchase price and the amount each SP will receive based on the MOA of 1/3 SV – 1/3 SA – 1/3 CMV. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">83 Therefore the Defendant’s contention that this fund unduly prejudiced the interest of the SPs who objected to the collective sale on the basis that the $50,000 formed part of the purchase price is entirely misconstrued.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">84 Further, the Defendant also argues that the $50,000 fund contributed by the purchaser is unfair because it meant that the SPs who supported the collective sale need not pay for any costs that may be incurred defending the collective sale against objections while the SPs who objected to the collective sale would have to bear the costs incurred for doing so on their own. Coupled with the fact that the TAS is on a “no sale, no fee” basis, the Defendant submits that the entire arrangement of the collective sale places a heavy burden on the SPs who objected to the sale.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">85 I wish to reiterate that the SPA is a voluntary commercial agreement entered freely between the purchaser and the CSC on behalf of the consenting SPs. The purchaser chose to bear the burden of funding the costs of facilitating and defending the collective sale. Thus, I find that there is nothing unfair or unusual in such an arrangement. It would be against the grains of logic to expect the purchaser or the MCST to financially support the objectors, such as the Defendant, in their actions against the collective sale.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">86 Similarly, the TAS is a voluntary commercial agreement entered freely between the CSC and De Souza Lim &amp; Goh LLP. Under the TAS, De Souza Lim &amp; Goh LLP would not charge any fee “if collective sale is abortive and there are no monies forfeited from the purchaser”.

</div> This, I find, is a commercial risk De Souza Lim &amp; Goh LLP took and this is in fact to the benefit of the SPs of The Albracca in the event the collective sale did not pull through. Thus, I find that there is nothing unfair or unusual in such an arrangement.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">87 Therefore, the CSC was not acting in bad faith when it drafted the TAS and the SPA in the aforementioned way. It is a commercial decision the CSC took which was in favour of the SPs. Furthermore, the Plaintiffs had sworn on affidavit that any unused funds would be distributed to all the SPs, including the Defendant, in accordance with the MOA.

</div></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Summary of findings</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">88 In summary, at the commencement of the collective sale process there were two SPs who were not in favour of selling their properties. The Defendant was one of them. Later, one of the objectors, the SP of unit #09-02, eventually agreed to the collective sale, leaving the Defendant as the only SP against the collective sale. This brought the percentage of the SPs who were in favour of the collective sale in terms of share value and strata title to over 90%. These facts are undisputed hitherto.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">89 The Defendant then proceeded to oppose the collective sale by attacking the CSC on the grounds that it failed to discharge its duty fairly, honestly and in good faith. Under the LTSA it does not matter whether there is only one or more who oppose the collective sale, the interest of all the SPs must be well looked after in good faith and the proceeds of sale must be fairly and equitably apportioned: see s 84A(9)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the LTSA.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">90 I find that the CSC had acted in good faith. First, there was no evidence to show that there was some dishonesty or bad faith in the appointment of David Lee to the CSC. There was also no evidence that David Lee had not acted independently or had acted dishonestly or in bad faith. It is in David Lee’s own interest to seek the best deal for himself and the other owners of the three small units which included the Defendant.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">91 Second, I find that the CSC had acted in good faith when it adopted the MOA of 1/3 SV – 1/3 SA – 1/3 CMV and proposed it to the SPs. The CSC had been even-handed and conscientious in its conduct. It took the time to obtain the expert opinions of JLL and Savills on the appropriate MOA to adopt. It also took the time and effort to consult the SPs on the course of action to take. Savills, an independent third-party valuer, was engaged to carry out a Typical Unit Valuation to derive the CMV for each unit in The Albracca. Eventually, the CSC was convinced that the MOA of 1/3 SV – 1/3 SA – 1/3 CMV was indeed the fairest for all units in The Albracca. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">92 Third, based on Savills’ valuation figures and the sale price of $69,119,000, I find that the MOA of 1/3 SV – 1/3 SA – 1/3 CMV was indeed the fairest MOA. It resulted in the narrowest band of premium differential. It also evened out the differences between share value, strata area and current market value such that none of the owners was significantly favoured or disadvantaged.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">93 Fourth, I do not agree with the Defendant’s objections to Savills’ valuation figures. On this, I find that Savills had provided a cogent and coherent explanation of how it arrived at its findings in its valuation report. The Defendant is not an expert at property valuation and he did not adduce or rely on any expert evidence to buttress his case. Thus I am unable to agree with the Defendant’s technical objections and criticism of Savills’ valuation report. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">94 Finally, I find that there is nothing unfair about the TAS and the SPA. They are commercial agreements entered into by the purchaser and the CSC on behalf of the SPs who consented to the collective sale of The Albracca whereby the purchaser voluntarily agreed to bear the financial costs of facilitating and defending the collective sale. In coming to this arrangement, I find that the CSC had not acted uneven-handedly and neither had it acted dishonestly nor in bad faith towards any SP. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">95 In conclusion, I find that the Defendant’s objections against the collective sale are unmeritorious. The CSC had acted in good faith in carrying out the collective sale. Accordingly, I quash the Stop Order imposed by STB and allow the collective sale to proceed. Furthermore, I grant to the Plaintiffs order in terms of the prayers in OS 28/2018.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">96  I shall now hear parties’ submissions on the costs of these proceedings. </div><div class="Judg-Sign text-left">Tan Siong Thye<br>Judge </br></div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Jason Lim Chen Thor, Kevin De Souza and Geena Liaw Jin Yi (De Souza Lim &amp; Goh LLP) for the first, second and third plaintiffs;<br>The defendant in person. </br></div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
