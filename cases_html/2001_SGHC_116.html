<strong>JUDGMENT:</strong>
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><strong><font color="#804040" face="Times New Roman" size="3">Grounds of Decision</font></strong></p>
<font face="Times New Roman" xmlns="">
<p align="justify">1. This matter came on as an appeal against some orders on damages. The damages

were assessed following the death of Krishnan A/L Marriappan in a road accident on 11 May 1999. The

damages were assessed by an Assistant Registrar on 24 February 2001.</p>
<p align="justify">2. The deceased who was born on 23 May 1961 was 38 years old when he died on 11

May 1999. He was survived by his widow the plaintiff and their two daughters, Thevishree and

Dharshaini. The plaintiff is working as a staff nurse and was 34 years old at the time of the

assessment. Thevishree the elder daughter was 10 years old at that time and the younger daughter

Dharshaini was 8 years old. The elder child who is afflicted with cerebral palsy has poor motor

skills, refractory epilepsy and severe mental retardation.</p>
<p align="justify">3. The awards appealed against were for the loss of dependency of the plaintiff

and the children. The awards were split into two categories for pre-trial and post-trial loss of

dependency.</p>
<p align="justify">4. The damages assessed by the Assistant Registrar were </p>
<blockquote>
<i>
<p align="justify">Pre-trial loss</p>
</i>
<p align="justify">As the parties agreed that the pre-trial period of loss was 21 months, the

  Assistant Registrar only set the multiplicands.</p>
<p align="justify">Plaintiff - $200 x 21 months</p>
<p align="justify">Elder daughter - $1000 x 21 months</p>
<p align="justify">Younger daughter - $300 x 21 months</p>
<p align="justify">and</p>
<i>
<p align="justify">Post-trial loss</p>
</i>
<p align="justify">For the post-trial loss, the Assistant Registrar determined the multiplicands

  which were raised to take into account future earnings and needs, as well as the multipliers.</p>
<p align="justify">Plaintiff - $400 x 8 years</p>
<p align="justify">Elder daughter - $1200 x 16 years</p>
<p align="justify">Younger daughter - $500 x 10 years</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">5. The Assistant Registrar found that the joint monthly income of the plaintiff

and the deceased was $3,760. The figure must have been derived from the plaintiffs evidence that

the deceaseds gross monthly salary at the time of his death was about $1,760 and that her own

gross monthly salary was about $2,000. She also stated that they each contributed about 80% of their

salaries to the family finances.</p>
<p align="justify">6. It was common ground that the elder daughter will always need financial

support because of her physical and mental disabilities whereas the younger daughter will be

dependent up to the time she is able to seek support herself financially.</p>
<p align="justify">7. By placing a multiplier of 16 years on the award to the elder daughter, the

Assistant Registrar was fixing the deceaseds lost working period at 16 years. The figure was on

the high end of the range as the deceased was 38 years old when he died, and counsel for the

plaintiff was quite right to accept that "the multiplier of 16 cannot be complained of".</p>
<p align="justify">8. The plaintiff and the children were content with the Assistant Registrars

awards. The matter came before me on the defendants appeal.</p>
<p align="justify">9. After reading the written submissions and hearing counsel, I found that there

was no basis for disturbing the Assistant Registrars findings on the earnings of the deceased and

the plaintiff, the multiplier of 16 years for the deceaseds lost earning years and the

multipliers for the awards. There are no formulae for the precise determination of these figures,

and the figures the Assistant Registrar arrived at were within the acceptable ranges.</p>
<p align="justify">10. However two elements of the awards required attention because they arose out

of errors of principle which must be rectified. The first was the oversight to adjust the post-trial

multipliers. The multipliers set for the post-trial losses apply from the date of the deceaseds

death, and not the date of trial  see <i>Muthan Sinnathambi v Puran Singh</i> <nobr>[1992] 2 SLR 103</nobr>

following <i>Cookson v Knowles</i> [1979] AC 556 @ 575. The 21-month pre-trial period must be

deducted from the post-trial multipliers.</p>
<p align="justify">11. The second matter relates to the awards to the children. The Assistant

Registrar arrived at the multiplicands after considering the submissions on the amounts required for

their upkeep. Up to the time of the accident, the children were supported by both their parents.

After the accident the support from the deceased was lost, but the support from the plaintiff was

unaffected. The loss the children suffered is not the full amounts needed for their upkeep, but the

portions of that contributed by the deceased. Counsel for the plaintiff argued that it is the

primary duty of the father to maintain the family and that a wrongdoer should not be given the

benefit of the wifes earnings. I find little basis for and merit in this unsupported proposition.

The wrongdoer should compensate for the losses actually caused and no more. In my view it would be

fair and favourable to the children that they receive half the amounts as damages even though the

plaintiff earned and contributed more than the deceased.</p>
<p align="justify">12. For the reasons stated, I varied the Assistant Registrars awards to

reflect the deduction of the 21 months from the multipliers for the post-trial awards, and to reduce

by half the multiplicands for the childrens awards. The adjusted awards are</p>
<blockquote>
<i>
<p align="justify">Pre-trial loss</p>
</i>
<p align="justify">Plaintiff - $200 x 21 months</p>
<p align="justify">Elder daughter - $500 x 21 months</p>
<p align="justify">Younger daughter - $150 x 21 months</p>
<i>
<p align="justify">Post-trial loss</p>
</i>
<p align="justify">Plaintiff - $400 x 75 months (8 years  21 months)</p>
<p align="justify">Elder daughter - $600 x 171 months (16 years  21 months)</p>
<p align="justify">Younger daughter - $250 x 99 months (10 years  21 months).</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">13. The plaintiff is unhappy with the reductions and has appealed against them.</p>
