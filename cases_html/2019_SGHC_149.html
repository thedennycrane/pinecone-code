It cannot, on its own, create mutually binding obligations between the company and a third party, even if that third party was one of the directors who had signed the resolution.

</div> Much was made of the fact that YTP and YTL used to withdraw sums of money from SWE and SWT. In essence, YTP alleges that there was a mutual understanding shared with YTL to the effect that both YTP and YTL could draw monies from the companies at will, on the basis that these withdrawals would be offset against deposits and advances made by YTP and YTL to the companies from time to time.

</div> However, from sometime in 1988, there were other shareholders of SWE, especially Hwee and Siong with 41,500 shares each. Certainly, there is no indication that any such understanding was shared with Hwee and Siong. As I observed at [24] above, in Suits 235/236, Hwee had complained about such withdrawals by YTP and YTL. Therefore, I do not accept that YTP and YTL were permitted to withdraw funds from SWE and SWT after 1988, at the expense of the other shareholders. Further, even if such an understanding had existed after Hwee and Siong became shareholders, I would have thought that that state of affairs clearly came to an end following the passing of the 2013 Resolution.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 Having dismissed YTP’s broad arguments, I turn now to the contentions raised by YTP in respect of the individual cheques.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Cheques 1 and 2</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 YTP submits that Cheques 1 and 2 were payments of dividends in respect of the sale of certain investment properties.

</div> Second, it was not at all clear that YTL had received roughly identical amounts as dividends. Cheque No 394988 was not a payment to YTL alone, but a payment into an account jointly held by YTL and YTP.

</div> In fact, as I stated earlier, while this was originally indicated as a payment out to YTP in the AccVisory email, it was not included as a claim against YTP in the 2013 Resolution: see [28] above. As for Cheque No 606010, I accept YTL’s evidence that this sum was not treated by him as a payment of dividends, and that he eventually repaid this amount. Third, on YTP’s own evidence (in his affidavit of evidence-in-chief (“AEIC”)), Cheque 1 was a “repayment for the monies that [he] had put into the companies”, not dividend payments.

</div> He has been inconsistent on this point. I therefore reject YTP’s submission that Cheques 1 and 2 were payments of dividends.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 I turn now to the alternative argument that some of the sums withdrawn by YTP under the cheques were actually repayments of sums that YTP had previously deposited into the companies. Over the years, many deposits and withdrawals were made into and out of the bank accounts of both SWE and SWT. In my view, the onus was on YTP to establish that there existed a sufficient nexus between particular deposits and the withdrawals in question before it could be said that a particular withdrawal (pursuant to a cheque) was a repayment of sums previously put in or has been paid by subsequently. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 Turning first to Cheque 1, there was no evidence before me as to any specific deposits YTP had made that Cheque 1 might have been repayment in respect of. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 However, in respect of Cheque 2, YTP refers to a US$300,000 payment he had made to <span class="font-italic">SWT</span> in September 2008.

</div> In other words, YTP argues that he had repaid the sum. He relies on the fact that at around the same time, YTL also returned a similar sum, and for which he is acknowledged not to owe any sum to SWE for cheque number 606010.  Against this, SWE argues that SWE and SWT were separate legal entities, and that monies paid into the latter could not be later withdrawn from the former. This argument is at first blush quite attractive, but, as mentioned, the touchstone is whether YTP could prove a nexus between the sums withdrawn and deposited. Here, YCW had herself accepted – in no uncertain terms – not just that there was a nexus, but that it had been <span class="font-italic">agreed</span> that the US$300,000 paid by YTP could be used to offset the sums he owed to SWE:

Rather, his evidence was that Cheques 3 and 4 were repayments in respect of two entirely different sums of US$300,000 and S$298,193.67 drawn down from his personal loan facility with Credit Industrial et Commercial (Singapore Branch) around 8 September 2008 and 2 March 2010 respectively.

</div> In my view, the shift in his case undermines his contention that the June 2008 deposit and Cheques 3 and 4 had always been linked. In fact, it appears to me likely that YTP was simply trying to pick a deposit which bore sufficient similarities in time and quantum to Cheques 3 and 4 such that they might seem linked. It certainly appeared that he had changed his case because the June 2008 deposit was at least for the same quantum as the sums drawn under Cheques 3 and 4.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 I should add that contrary to YTP’s reading of YCW’s evidence under cross-examination, I do not think YCW unequivocally conceded that there existed a correlation between Cheques 3 and 4 and the June 2008 deposit. Her evidence was that any correlation was, at best, “tenuous”.

</div> YTP submits that SWE’s claim for sums withdrawn under the cheques is <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> time-barred by operation of s 6 of the Limitation Act. This submission appears to have been made on the footing that SWE’s claim is for recovery of monies withdrawn without proper authorisation, which cause of action would have arisen at the time the BOC Cheques were allegedly improperly drawn – <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, from 2006 to 2009. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">71 It is clear to me, however, that this is in fact a claim for a debt arising from a loan agreement.

In particular, there is some discrepancy as to whether this was in 2013 or in 2014. Paragraph 9 of the Statement of Claim (Amendment No 1) states that YCW discovered the unauthorised withdrawals in or around 19 May 2014 and that an agreement to repay the amounts was only reached subsequently, whereas, Particular 1 of the Particulars provides that the 2013 Resolution regularised the withdrawals (though I note that Particular 3 of the Particulars claims that SWE first found out about YTP’s drawings “in or around 2014”). Notwithstanding the discrepancies in the pleadings on this aspect, YCW’s evidence is that the discrepancies were raised in or around October 2013 and that the decision to regularise them was made on 14 November 2013. This is corroborated by the AccVisory email (dated 9 October 2013)

I am fortified in this conclusion by the fact that the Suits 235/236 Settlement Agreement was concluded at a time when there was no dispute nor legal proceedings between SWE and YTP.

Therefore, I allow SWE’s claim in the sum of S$1,805,156.62, less the sum of US$300,000.

</div> Thus, I begin by considering whether there was such a mutual understanding. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">88 SWE is clearly a family business, managed and run by YTP and YTL since its incorporation. On the evidence, there existed a relationship of mutual trust between YTP and YTL, at least until the subsequent breakdown of the relationship. In the circumstances, it seemed an obvious inference that there existed a mutual understanding that both YTP and YTL would have a say in the running and management of the company. This position did not change with Hwee and Siong becoming shareholders, as YTP and YTL continued to be the sole directors of SWE. Indeed, YTL agreed, under cross-examination, that this was the case:

In particular, they point to arts 74 and 75 (which contemplate the retirement of directors at annual general meetings so as to stand for re-election), art 79 (which provides for the removal of directors) and art 82 (which concerns the vacation of office of directors if requested to resign). However, I disagree with this argument. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">90 The mere fact that the Articles provide for various mechanisms for the removal of a director does not preclude the formation of such a mutual understanding. Under s 216 of the Act, the court is empowered to take into account wider equitable considerations which go beyond what was formally recorded in the constitutive documents of the company, and to find the existence of informal understandings that trump the express provisions of those formal constitutive documents: Margaret Chew, <span class="font-italic">Minority Shareholders’ Rights and Remedies</span> (LexisNexis, 3rd Ed, 2017) (“<span class="font-italic">Margaret Chew</span>”) at para 4.061. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Commercial unfairness</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">91 That said, proving the existence of a legitimate expectation (founded on a mutual understanding) that both parties would have a say in the running and management of the company is but the first step for YTP. It must also be established that the conduct complained of is contrary to or has departed from such expectations, <span class="font-italic">and </span>that the departure was of such an extent as to become unfair (see <span class="font-italic">Eng Gee Seng </span>at [11]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">92 The test of commercial unfairness is a necessarily fact-sensitive one. Whether or not the impugned conduct is unfair is an objective inquiry; but one which must be assessed within the context of the actual, circumstantial and relational scenario of the dispute: <span class="font-italic">Margaret Chew</span> at para 4.042. Therefore, in determining whether the majority has acted unfairly, it seems only right that the court also takes into account the conduct of all the parties in determining whether there has been unfairness as a whole. As Quentin Loh JC (as he then was) explained in <span class="font-italic">Tan Yong San v Neo Kok Eng and others</span> [2011] SGHC 30 at [103]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Since considerations of fairness and equity play a crucial role in an action under s 216, a court should rightly be able to take into account the conduct of all the parties in determining whether there has been unfairness as a whole warranting the grant of relief under s 216(2). After all, <span class="font-italic">fairness is a relative concept</span>. Furthermore, because the court has a very wide discretion in granting such relief, <span class="font-italic">it would only be natural to consider the relative equities of both the minority and majority shareholders in determining the appropriate form of relief</span>… [emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">93 Thus, in determining whether the dismissal of the aggrieved party in violation of his legitimate expectation to be involved in management constitutes oppression, the <span class="font-italic">reasons</span> for the aggrieved party’s removal are a relevant factor (see <span class="font-italic">Eng Gee Seng </span>at [56]; <span class="font-italic">Grace v Biagioli and others</span> [2006] 2 BCLC 70 (“<span class="font-italic">Grace</span>”) at [65]). If the removal of the aggrieved party was justified, it will not be considered unfair, even if done in breach of that party’s expectation to remain involved in management. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">94 Essentially, YTP argues that in his removal, there were various breaches of the Articles, and other procedural irregularities, which caused him to suffer substantial prejudice.

</div> According to her, she had initially wanted to remove YTP under art 79, as she felt that “he was incompetent as a director”, and “had done various things that were harmful to SWE”. In the course of Suits 235/236, Hwee and Siong produced some evidence to suggest that YTP had given them “gifts” from SWE, and that YTP was aware of certain withdrawals amounting to about $1,150,000. Upon discussion with YTL, it was decided that rather than remove YTP, they would give YTP a chance to explain himself at the AGM. Thus, they decided to put YTP up for re-election. Upon the suggestion of AccVisory (the company secretary) that it might appear “unfair” to put up only YTP for re-election, it was decided that all three directors would be subject to re-election. Quite clearly, there was no need for YCW to be subject to this, given that she was the most recent appointee.

</div> I note that YTP has been inconsistent in his reasons for <span class="font-italic">not </span>attending the AGM. Putting aside the reasons for his non-attendance, what is more critical to me is the issue of whether YTP should have expected that he would be <span class="font-italic">deemed</span> re-elected pursuant to art 76. I see little basis for this expectation. Article 76 requires the retiring director to <span class="font-italic">offer </span>himself for re-election so as to be <span class="font-italic">deemed </span>to be re-elected. YTP conceded that he did not inform anyone of his intentions to carry on being a director.

</div> Further, art 76 provides that the<span class="font-italic"> deemed </span>re-election takes effect, “unless a resolution for the re-election of that director is put to the meeting and lost”. In other words, the deeming mechanism provided for in art 76 will only apply where there is no vote (or perhaps no valid vote) on the re-election of a director. YTP provided no reasons for believing that the meeting would <span class="font-italic">not</span> vote against his re-election. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">100 Indeed, from YCW’s evidence, the meeting voted on the re-election of each of the three directors separately. YTP’s re-election was defeated. Although the proposed Resolution 3 was framed as a resolution “[t]o re-elect [YTP], [YTL] and [YCW] retiring under Article 74 of the Company’s Articles of association”, I do not consider it improper to vote on the re-election of each of the directors separately, rather than as a group. In fact, I thought it appropriate for the meeting to have done so, in accordance with art 74, as each of the three individuals had to agree to continue to be a director, and each re-election must not be turned down by the meeting. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">101 That said, I should add that the conduct of the meeting was in breach of art 59,

</div> which provides that if there is no chairman of the board of directors to preside over a general meeting, a shareholder (elected among those present) shall chair it. As SWE did not have a formal chairman for its board of directors, either YTL’s ex-wife or Low (as proxy for YTL), should have chaired the meeting. In breach of the article, YCW, a non-shareholder, did so. That being said, this was a minor irregularity which did not cause any prejudice to YTP. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">102 In the round, I accept that YTP’s non-election at the AGM involved breaches of arts 59, 74 and 75. Nonetheless, contrary to YTP’s argument, I did not form the view that those breaches were so egregious as to render the removal of YTP as a director commercially unfair.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">103 With that, I move to the issue of whether YTP’s removal was justified. In <span class="font-italic">Grace</span>, the English Court of Appeal affirmed the trial judge’s finding that the aggrieved party’s dismissal was justified in circumstances where that aggrieved party had, without prior disclosure or discussion with his fellow directors, negotiated to purchase (for himself) the business of a potential competitor to the company in question, and then attempted to conceal the existence of those negotiations. This is, of course, but an example, and whether or not dismissal as a director was justified is ultimately an intensely fact-sensitive question which entails a balancing of the equities of the case. Past authorities, even those with seemingly similar factual circumstances, are of limited precedential value and much will depend on the precise facts of the case.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">104 As I mentioned at [96] above, in the course of investigations, there were allegations by Hwee and Siong against YTP. This formed the basis of the counterclaim in Suits 235/236. Oddly, YTP decided not to get involved in the lawsuit, and left it all to YCW to handle.

However, I note that upon finding out about the repayment obligation sometime in April 2017, SWE took reasonable steps to find alternative means of financing. In particular, attempts were made to obtain re-financing from no less than four different banks, being Maybank, United Overseas Bank, Standard Chartered Bank and Bank of China. YTP argues that from the email correspondence with the banks, options were proposed by the banks but with no follow up from YCW and/or YTL.

Therefore, the rights issue could have been set at a lesser value per share. However, the price was set at $1 per share because SWE had always issued new shares at the book value previously.

Viewed in context, I do not think that there is this form of oppressive conduct.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">122 As I set out above at [32], the agreed hourly rate was $100, for the lead partners, YCW and Low, as well as the staff. In my view, this is an eminently reasonable rate. Indeed, it seems to me that the rate of $250 per hour contained in the Letter of Engagement is also reasonable, especially taking into account the fairly substantial experience of YCW and Low (which I shall not set out here). I should add that I do not accept YTP’s claim that there was an agreement with Low to cap professional fees at 8% of the recovered sum. This was a bare and vague assertion, with no real explanation of what was meant by the “recovered sum”. Thereafter, a first payment of $301,881.70 was made on 16 December 2014 by SWT: see [33] above. This was more than two years after work commenced, which pointed away from YTL and YCW trying to siphon money away from SWE. Low explained that this first progress bill was in respect of 2,988.5 hours of work done (charged at $100 per hour) plus $3,038.70 in disbursements. In my view, this seemed to be sufficient justification for the amount.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">123 It seems to me what YTP really takes issue with is the mention of the “incurred” sum “capped” at $1,500,000 for work done from 2012 and ending 31 December 2016, as stated in the account summary dated 15 May 2017 which enclosed the second progress bill for $520,000. A sum of $250,000 was paid on 1 August 2018, which means that a total amount of $551,881.70 had been paid to S2. While the remaining amount has not been billed to SWE and SWT, Low confirmed that he would be billing for the balance of the $1,500,000.

</div> Based on the agreed rate of $100 per hour, the professional fees incurred would have amounted to some $684,550 for Low’s work alone. This is without taking into account the substantial work done by YCW (also at the rate of $100 per hour), the hours put in by S2’s staff, as well as disbursements incurred. Once all of this is accounted for, I do not think it can be clearly said that the invoice for $1,500,000 constitutes overcharging. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">131 In light of the substantial work done, the significant commercial benefit of the work to SWE, and the agreed rate for charging for the work, it seems to me there is some basis for the proposed quantum of fees. That said, of course, it remains for SWE and SWT to peruse any bill rendered, and to raise appropriate queries with S2, if and when necessary. On balance, however, I do not find that the amount of fees charged and proposed to be charged by YCW and her affiliated companies is so excessive as to support a finding that this was a scheme to divert funds from SWE. I also do not find that YTL and YCW have already made payments of such excessive amounts so as to constitute oppressive conduct. At the end of the day, apart from some bare assertions, YTP has simply failed to produce any evidence to prove that the acts are clearly meant to favour YTL and YCW at the expense of the company (and therefore YTP).  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Accounting for the settlement proceeds</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">132 I turn next to YTP’s allegations that YTL had failed to properly account to SWE for the settlement proceeds in respect of the Suits 235/236 Settlement Agreement. In my view, these allegations are not proved on the facts. Although there may have been some discrepancies in YTL’s account of the monies received, the monies received have been substantially accounted for and further sums have yet to be paid in.

</div> YTP’s request for documents was not made in his capacity as shareholder of SWE, but was made in connection to his defence to SWE’s claim against him. The proper avenue for such a request would be to seek specific discovery of the documents sought; it does not lie in YTP’s mouth to allege that SWE, YTL or YCW were acting improperly in declining to disclose the documents sought.
