</div> The question to be determined, therefore, was whether Scott was entitled to terminate his employment under the Employment Agreement on that date. The parties had different views of what the Employment Agreement entailed. Marken Singapore mounted two alternative arguments. First, the Employment Agreement contemplated that the International Assignment was a separate and standalone “component” of the Employment Agreement.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">9 Ultimately, the issues raised had to be determined through an exercise of contractual interpretation informed by the relevant factual matrix as found by the court. In my judgment, Scott’s position was the correct one. The effective date of the Employment Agreement was 1 June 2012, and the employment term was to last for two years therefrom. This effective date was not amended by the Amendment Agreement. I now set out my reasons for finding that Scott had not breached the Employment Agreement. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">10 The principles of contractual interpretation were recently set out by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Yap So</span><span class="font-italic">n On v Ding Pei Zhen </span>[2017] 1 SLR 219 (“<span class="font-italic">Yap So</span><span class="font-italic">n On”</span>) and <span class="font-italic">Y.E.S. F&amp;B Group Pte Ltd v Soup Restaurant Singapore Pte Ltd</span><span class="font-italic"> (formerly known as Soup Restaurant (Causeway Point) Pte Ltd) </span>[2015] 5 SLR 1187 (“<span class="font-italic">Y.E.S. F&amp;B Group</span>”). In essence, a two-step contextual approach was to be employed (see <span class="font-italic">Yap So</span><span class="font-italic">n On </span>at [28]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The contextual approach to contractual interpretation in Singapore requires the court to proceed in two broad steps …</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a)   The first step requires consideration of whether the extrinsic evidence sought to be adduced in aid of interpretation is admissible. This is a matter governed by the procedural rules of the law of evidence, which governs what and how facts may be proved. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b)   The second step is the task of interpretation itself, which involves ascertaining the meaning of expressions used in a contract, taking into account the admissible evidence. The rules which govern this process may be found in the substantive law of contract.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">11 Under the first step, it was settled law that even where there was no ambiguity, extrinsic evidence of circumstances surrounding a contract would be admissible to interpret it (and not contradict, vary, add to or subtract from its terms) pursuant to s 94(<span class="font-italic">f</span>) of the Evidence Act (Cap 97, 1997 Rev Ed) (“the Evidence Act”). This general permissive approach was subject to the following restrictions (see <span class="font-italic">Yap So</span><span class="font-italic">n On </span>at [41]–[42]): </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The requirement that the nature and effect of the extrinsic evidence must be pleaded with sufficient specificity;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The requirement that the extrinsic evidence sought to be admitted must be (i) relevant; (ii) reasonably available to all the contracting parties; and (iii) relate to a clear or obvious context (the criteria set out in<span class="font-italic"> </span><span class="font-italic">Zurich Insurance (Singapore) Pte Ltd v B-Gold Interior Design &amp; Construction Pte Ltd </span>[2008] 3 SLR(R) 1029 (“<span class="font-italic">Zurich Insurance</span>”) (“<span class="font-italic">Zurich </span>criteria”));</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Sections 95 and 96 of the Evidence Act, which were absolute bars to evidence falling within these provisions; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) The bar against the admissibility of parol evidence of the drafters’ subjective intentions at the time of the conclusion of the contract unless there was latent ambiguity.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">12 Besides these restrictions, the issue of pre-contractual negotiations merited further elaboration. The blanket prohibition on such evidence had been removed in <span class="font-italic">Zurich Insurance </span>(see <span class="font-italic">Zurich Insurance</span> at [132(d)]), but the <span class="font-italic">Zurich </span>criteria would have to be fulfilled before such evidence could be admitted (see <span class="font-italic">Xia </span><span class="font-italic">Zhengyan v Geng Changqing </span>[2015] 3 SLR 732 (“<span class="font-italic">Xia </span><span class="font-italic">Zhengyan</span>”) at [63]–[69]; <span class="font-italic">HSBC Trustee (Singapore) Ltd v Lucky Realty Co Pte Ltd </span>[2015] 3 SLR 885 at [50]). It should also be pointed out that the Court of Appeal had commented in <span class="font-italic">Xia </span><span class="font-italic">Zhengyan</span> that the contours of this rule of admissibility remained an “open question” and that limits and safeguards might have to be put in place (see <span class="font-italic">Xia </span><span class="font-italic">Zhengyan </span>at [69]). Unfortunately, while both parties in the present action pleaded and led evidence on the pre-contractual negotiations leading to the Employment Agreement and the Amendment Agreement, neither side addressed, as a matter of law, the admissibility of such evidence for the purposes of interpretation (as was the case in <span class="font-italic">Xia </span><span class="font-italic">Zhengyan</span>: see [62]). In any case, I found that the <span class="font-italic">Zurich </span>criteria were satisfied in respect of the pre-contractual negotiations (see [15]–[16] and [33] below) and I admitted them as evidence so that they could be used to shed light on what the contract meant (as was done in <span class="font-italic">CIFG Special Assets Capital I Ltd </span><span class="font-italic">(formerly known as Diamond Kendall Limited) v Polimet Pte Ltd and others (Chris Chia Woon Liat and another, third parties) </span>[2017] SGHC 22 at [92]–[93]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">13 As for the second step (the task of interpretation), it was “the objectively ascertained intentions of the parties that is relevant, and not their subjective intentions” (see <span class="font-italic">Yap So</span><span class="font-italic">n On </span>at [30]). Further, both the text and context must be considered, and although “the text of [the parties’] agreement would [usually] be of first importance”, if the text was ambiguous then the “relevant <span class="font-italic">context </span>will <span class="font-italic">generally </span>be <span class="font-italic">of the first importance</span>” (see <span class="font-italic">Yap So</span><span class="font-italic">n On </span>at [30]; <span class="font-italic">Y.E.S. F&amp;B Group </span>at [34]). A holistic approach should be taken: the agreement should be construed as a whole and courts should not be fixating on any particular word or phrase (see <span class="font-italic">Zurich Insurance</span> at [131]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">14 I turn to consider the present facts and issues arising in the light of the above principles. At the outset, I agreed with Mr Chew (who represented Scott) that clause 1 of the Employment Agreement was “clear and unambiguous” in conveying the meaning that the “transfer to the Singapore office” <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">was the International Assignment</span>, which would last for two years starting 1 June 2012.

</div>  I also found that Marken Singapore’s argument that the International Assignment was a separate component of the Employment Agreement was an <span class="font-italic">ex post facto </span>rationalisation. Indeed, Ms Ang (who represented Marken Singapore) could not point to any provision within the contract that expressly and unambiguously made a distinction between the International Assignment and the Employment Agreement.  It seemed absurd that the Marken group, a large entity with access to legal advice, would leave such an important distinction unexpressed and be content with relying on an alleged common understanding that the International Assignment could begin only when Scott was “consistently on the ground”

According to Ms Ang, end August 2012 was when Scott contemplated that he would arrive in Singapore.

Scott’s offer to extend the period of employment demonstrated his understanding that if the effective date was 1 June 2012, the employment term would have ended two years later, the last day being 31 May 2014, barring a further amendment to extend the period of the employment. If it was Scott’s understanding that under the earlier draft agreement (see [15] above) circulated on 14 July 2012, the two-year International Assignment would only commence after Scott had obtained his employment pass and moved to Singapore, then it would have been unnecessary for Scott to make the offer in the 17 July 2012 email. It should be recapitulated that in this later email, Scott had asked for “the start date of the assignment” to be reflected as 1 June 2012; on an objective ascertainment of the parties’ intentions, I found that Scott had offered <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">to extend the duration of the International Assignment</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>(which had already started at that time).

Given that specially agreed provisions would trump inconsistent standard terms that had not been specifically negotiated (see <span class="font-italic">Zurich Insurance </span>at [131]), the effective date of the Employment Agreement, being the subject of focused negotiations, would override any inconsistency that clause 10 could give rise to.

Indeed, there was nothing to cater to the possibility that the visa application would be unsuccessful. In fact, Simon Golan (“Simon”), a Senior Director of Tax &amp; Corporate Affairs of Marken UK, had in an email dated 16 May 2012, raised this concern to Doaa, but no amendments were made to address such a possibility.

</div> In this document, Scott set out a rough plan of how he intended to carry out his role as VP APAC over the two-year period. It was apparent that Marken Singapore did not wish to put much weight on the proposal. Whatever could be said about the proposal, it clearly debunked the notion that residence in Singapore was contemplated to be a necessary condition of the International Assignment since only eight out of the 24 months would be spent in Singapore.

In fact, it was nowhere to be found in Marken Singapore’s pleadings. In <span class="font-italic">Yap Son On</span>, the Court of Appeal explained that one of the “critical benefits” that adherence to the pleading requirement would bring was “procedural fairness and substantive justice”, the concern being that no party or the court should be “taken by surprise at the trial” (see <span class="font-italic">Yap Son On </span>at [49(b)]). This concern weighed heavily in the present case as Simon (the drafter of the Email) had neither given evidence nor been cross-examined on the Email or for that matter, on the Amendment Agreement. More importantly, Scott was deprived of any opportunity to address the meaning of the Email. Despite the timeous objections by Scott, Ms Ang only adduced the Email and attempted to justify its admissibility in her closing submissions.

The fact remained that the only binding agreement that Scott was under from 1 June 2012 was the Employment Agreement. One should also not read too much into Scott’s indication of 1 November 2012 as the start date of employment in his tax filings. Instead, the date was stated as such for the computation of tax payable to the Singapore authorities,

</div> and did not undermine the effect of the recital of the Employment Agreement.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 In the event, I found that as regards the Amendment Agreement, the common intention of the parties was for the amendment of the date to 1 November 2012 to apply only to clauses 3, 4 and 23. To be sure, the fact that clauses 3 and 4 referenced a midpoint exchange rate of 1 November 2012 did not render the amendment of date redundant. In the Employment Agreement, it could be seen from clause 3 that even though there was a date on which the midpoint exchange rate was to be determined, the parties to the Employment Agreement had nonetheless set an effective date for clause 3.

</div> It is appropriate at this point to make an observation about how Marken Singapore ran its case. As stated above at [7], two primary submissions were made by Marken Singapore, and they were arguments made in the alternative. In my view, however, the plaintiff’s arguments on the Amendment Agreement were inconsistent with and struck at the heart of their primary position that the International Assignment was a standalone component of the Employment Agreement and both were not coterminous. If the parties’ common understanding was truly that the International Assignment would commence only when Scott obtained his employment pass and moved to Singapore, it would not have been necessary to “reset” the effective date of the Employment Agreement by entering into the Amendment Agreement.

</div> Marken Singapore had failed to satisfy me that its methodology of determining loss (of profits) (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, essentially, a linear extrapolation of the contracts that Scott had won in the preceding months of 2014) would allow the court to assess the quantum of the loss suffered by Marken Singapore. While I acknowledged that the analysis, capably presented and supported by Ariette, may be accepted in a corporate boardroom, it was neither permissible nor apt in proving losses in a courtroom, which also had its own rules on causation and remoteness.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 Even assuming <span class="font-italic">arguendo</span> that Marken suffered the loss of profits they were claiming for (though I did not accept this), Marken Singapore’s claim for loss of profits would also have failed for lack of causation and because it was too remote. As regards causation, it should be noted that customer relationships were forged between Marken Singapore – not Scott alone – and their respective clients. Scott was one of the many employees handling Marken Singapore’s client relationships. These employees included staff involved in day-to-day customer service, regulatory staff, quality control staff and other business development representatives.

</div> Notwithstanding that Scott was a “star employee”, I could not conclude from the evidence adduced that he was the “effective” or “dominant” cause for any loss (see <span class="font-italic">Sunny Metal &amp; Engineering Pte Ltd v Ng </span><span class="font-italic">Khim Ming Eric </span>[2007] 3 SLR(R) 782 at [60]). As for remoteness, I found that Marken would have faced insurmountable difficulties in proving imputed or actual knowledge under either limb of <span class="font-italic">Hadley v </span><span class="font-italic">Baxendale </span>(1854) 9 Exch 341; 156 ER 145 (see <span class="font-italic">Out of the Box Pte Ltd v </span><span class="font-italic">Wanin Industries Pte Ltd </span>[2013] 2 SLR 363 (“<span class="font-italic">Out of the Box</span>”) at [17]–[18]) such that he could foresee the type of loss <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">as pleaded and argued</span> by Marken Singapore. In this regard, it was important to bear in mind the proposition in <span class="font-italic">Out of the Box </span>that it would be “simplistic and ultimately unhelpful to argue that a given head of loss is not too remote simply because it could semantically be packaged within a broader category of loss that was foreseeable by the contract breaker” (see <span class="font-italic">Out of the Box </span>at [44]). The “special facts that pertain to the type and scale” (see <span class="font-italic">Out of the Box</span> at [44]) of loss – like in the present case – must also be taken into account.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 For completeness, I should add that Marken Singapore’s claim as regards the lost opportunity to negotiate (as pleaded and argued before me) was misconceived. The juridical basis of <span class="font-italic">Wrotham Park </span>damages – whether it was compensatory or restitutionary – had been a vexed question (see, <span class="font-italic">eg</span>, Harvey McGregor, <span class="font-italic">McGregor on Damages </span>(Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 19th Ed, 2014) at para 14-030). Recently, the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">PH </span><span class="font-italic">Hydraulics &amp; Engineering Pte Ltd v Airtrust (Hong Kong) Ltd and another appeal </span>[2017] 2 SLR 129 clarified at [80] that “<span class="font-italic">Wrotham Park </span>damages [were] largely accepted to be <span class="font-italic">compensatory </span>in nature, although they are different, in substance, from a traditional award of compensatory damages”. The Court of Appeal went on to explain at [82] that although <span class="font-italic">Wrotham Park </span>damages were “a departure from the traditional loss-based measure of damages, their primary purpose [could] still be said to be compensatory, in that they protect a plaintiff’s interest in contractual performance.” Leggatt J in <span class="font-italic">Marathon Asset Management LLP v James </span><span class="font-italic">Seddon </span>[2017] EWHC 300 (Comm) (“<span class="font-italic">Marathon Asset</span>”) explained that <span class="font-italic">Wrotham Park </span>damages were “compensatory” in the broad sense that it was a “remedy which [was] awarded as a response to a wrong done to the claimant”, though he also found that such damages were “restitutionary” in the loose sense that it referred to an award of money that was assessed by valuing a gain by the defendant (at [199]–[200]). In <span class="font-italic">Marathon Asset</span>, Leggatt J also cautioned that a finding that a claimant had failed to prove loss was “tantamount to a finding that the claimant has not suffered loss, and the same legal consequence should follow”; <span class="font-italic">Wrotham Park </span>damages would be a “just response” only where compensatory damages were an “<span class="font-italic">inherently </span>inadequate remedy” (at [214]–[215]). In the present case, while Marken Singapore had claimed for <span class="font-italic">Wrotham Park </span>damages, it appeared to be just another way to dress up their claim for <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">loss of profits</span>

</div><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic"> </span>– plainly a “traditional loss-based measure of damages”. Indeed, Marken Singapore did not plead or prove that Scott had made gains pursuant to his breach of contract.  Further, Marken Singapore failed to convince me that this was a case where compensatory damages were “inherently inadequate”. Instead, I found that this was a case where Marken Singapore had not proven loss suffered as a result of the alleged breach. All said, Ms Ang’s repeated appeals to the “justice of the case”
