Such malice may be inferred from the facts set out below.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-center"><span class="font-weight-bold font-underline">Particulars</span></div><div class="txt-body text-justify">ii.[<span class="font-italic">sic</span>] On or around 27 February 2020, the Defendant published a post on its Facebook page captioned “The Women World Marathon Record is faster than our Singapore Men’s National Record by 9 minutes”. </div><div class="txt-body text-justify">iii.  This Facebook post was clearly targeted at the Plaintiff, the current national record holder in Singapore, and was made with the malicious intention to insult the Plaintiff and undermine his reputation.</div><div class="txt-body text-justify">iv.  The Facebook post was eventually taken down with an admission from the Defendant’s president Tang Weng Fei that it was a “lapse in judgment” after the Defendant received severe backlash from the public.</div><div class="txt-body text-justify">v.  The Defendant also acted in breach of its duty of confidentiality by providing the Plaintiff’s confidential documents and information to Mr Malik Aljunied, an executive director of the Defendant, without the Plaintiff’s knowledge and/or consent, and further permitted the unauthorized misuse of the Plaintiff’s confidential information by Mr Malik Aljunied for his own purposes, in Mr Malik’s suit in his private capacity against the Plaintiff in HC/S 851/2019 (“Suit 851”). These confidential documents and/or information include:</div><div class="txt-body text-justify">a.  SAA’s Code of Conduct dated 23 November 2018 signed between the Plaintiff and SAA (the “COC”);</div><div class="txt-body text-justify">b.  The Singapore National Olympic Council’s (“SNOC”) Team Membership Agreement signed between the Plaintiff and SNOC (“SNOC TMA”);</div><div class="txt-body text-justify">c.  The spexCarding Agreement dated 23 November 2018 signed between the Plaintiff and SAA; and</div><div class="txt-body text-justify">d.  A letter regarding the Plaintiff’s alleged non-compliance with the SNOC TMA dated on or before 14 August 2017 from Yip Ren Kai, Team Manager, SNOC, MGPC Athletics (the “TMA Letter”).</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(collectively, the “Confidential Documents”)</div><div class="txt-body text-justify">vi.  These Confidential Documents contained a significant amount of confidential information. For instance, at pages 8 to 10 of the COC, athletes such as the Plaintiff were required to submit to the Defendant highly confidential and personal information, including <span class="font-italic">inter alia </span>their NRIC and passport information, as well as details of their personalized training regimes, as below:</div><div class="txt-body text-justify">a.  A scanned copy of their NRIC and Passport;</div><div class="txt-body text-justify">b.  The Name and Accreditation of their coach;</div><div class="txt-body text-justify">c.  Their Annual Performance Goals; and/or</div><div class="txt-body text-justify">d.  Their Annual Training Plan.</div><div class="txt-body text-justify">vii.  On or around 26 August 2019, the Plaintiff filed a suit in HC/S 851/2019 (“Suit 851”) against Mr Malik Aljunied for defamatory remarks published on his Facebook Profile page.</div><div class="txt-body text-justify">viii.  However, on 23 September 2019, Mr Malik Aljunied filed his Defence in Suit 851 relying on the existence and contents of the Confidential Documents in various parts of his pleadings. In particular, the Confidential Documents and/or their contents were referred to in the following paragraphs of the Defence:</div><div class="txt-body text-justify">a.  The SNOC TMA – at paragraphs 14.1.1, 14.3, 14.5 and 14.6 of the Defence;</div><div class="txt-body text-justify">b.  The COC and the SCA – at paragraphs 14.1.2, 14.3.2, 14.4, 14.5 and 14.6 of the Defence; and</div><div class="txt-body text-justify">c.  The TMA Letter – at paragraph 14.6.2 of the Defence.</div><div class="txt-body text-justify">ix.  Subsequently, the Plaintiff’s solicitors issued a Notice to Produce Documents Referred to in Pleadings dated 27 December 2019 requesting the production of documents referred to in the Defence. Through his solicitors, on 28 January 2020, Malik Aljunied provided copies of the documents requested, which contained scanned copies of the Confidential Documents enumerated at paragraphs 5A(iv)(a) to (d) above.</div><div class="txt-body text-justify">x.  In light of the foregoing, the Defendant acted in breach of its duty of confidentiality by permitting and/or allowing the unauthorized use and/or disclosure of the Confidential Documents by Mr Malik Aljunied in Suit 851.

As the Plaintiff has never circulated his POSB bank account details to Mr Malik Aljunied personally, and had only disclosed his POSB Bank Account details to the Defendant in strict confidence on 30 January 2020, the Defendant has unlawfully disclosed the Plaintiff’s POSB bank account details to Mr Malik Aljunied and/or permitted the unauthorized misuse of such confidential information by Mr Malik Aljunied in breach of its duty of confidentiality towards the Plaintiff.</div><div class="txt-body text-justify">xiii.  In the circumstances, it is abundantly clear that Words which the Defendant had published and/or caused to be published were actuated by malice and that the Defendant had no honest belief in the truth of the same.

As such, any alleged malice concerning the Alleged Breach of Confidence must have post-dated the August 2019 Statement. The Alleged Breach of Confidence therefore cannot provide any basis for pleading malice in relation to the August 2019 Statement.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Second, further or alternatively, the Alleged Breach of Confidence is the subject matter of HC/OS 432/2020 (“OS 432”). The issues in OS 432 have been canvassed before a High Court Judge and adjourned to a date after judgment is rendered in S 851. In raising issues in the present suit concerning the Alleged Breach of Confidence, the Plaintiff is effectively asking the High Court to determine whether the Alleged Breach of Confidence had taken place. This is an abuse of the court process and is “effectively asking for a second bite at the cherry in respect of [the Plaintiff’s] case in OS 432”.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">13 Mr Lee counterargued as follows: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) First, paragraph 25 of the Amended Reply is legally sustainable. O 18 r 9 of the Rules of Court permits a party to plead any matter which has arisen at any time, whether before or since the issue of the writ; this was also the approach taken in <span class="font-italic">DyStar Global Holdings (Singapore) Pte Ltd v Kiri Industries Ltd and others and another suit </span>[2018] 5 SLR 1 (“<span class="font-italic">DyStar</span>”)). In this regard, paragraph 25 of the Amended Reply does not plead a new cause of action; instead, it simply pleads facts in support of an existing cause of action. Furthermore, post-publication conduct, including conduct after the commencement of proceedings, can be considered as evidence of malice in the context of a defamation suit (citing <span class="font-italic">DHKW Marketing and another v Nature’s Farm Pte Ltd </span>[1998] 3 SLR(R) 774 (“<span class="font-italic">DHKW Marketing</span>”)). </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Second, there is no issue of abuse of process. At present, there is no final and conclusive judgment on the merits in OS 432. While there is an overlap between OS 432 and the present suit, the issue in OS 432 concerns restraining the use of the confidential documents, whereas paragraph 25 of the Amended Reply “is wider and concerns <span class="font-italic">malice</span> arising out of, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, the use of the Confidential Documents” (emphasis in original).

In <span class="font-italic">The Bunga Melati 5</span>, the Court explained the distinction between a legally and factually unsustainable action, as follows: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) A <span class="font-italic">legally unsustainable</span> action is one in which it is “clear as a matter of law at the outset that even if a party were to succeed in proving all the facts that he offers to prove he will not be entitled to the remedy that he seeks” (<span class="font-italic">The Bunga Melati 5</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [39(a)]). </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) In contrast, a <span class="font-italic">factually unsustainable </span>action is one in which it is “possible to say with confidence before trial that the factual basis for the claim is fanciful because it is entirely without substance”; for instance, that it is “clear beyond question that the statement of facts is contradicted by all the documents or other material on which it is based” (<span class="font-italic">The Bunga Melati 5</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [39(b)]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">17 Mr Gaznavi also appeared to allude to paragraph 25 of the Amended Reply being prejudicial or embarrassing under O 18 r 19(1)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the Rules of Court (by virtue of the argument at [11(c)] above) and an abuse of process under O 18 r 19(1)(<span class="font-italic">d</span>) of the Rules of Court (by virtue of the argument at [12(b)] above). </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic"> Malice in defamation proceedings</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">18 In defamation proceedings, a defamer’s malice may be relied upon to defeat the defences of qualified privilege and fair comment. There is a distinction between the types of malice that will defeat these defences (<span class="font-italic">Basil Anthony Herman v Premier Security Co-operative Ltd </span>[2010] 3 SLR 110 (“<span class="font-italic">Basil Anthony Herman</span>”) at [60]). To briefly elaborate: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The defence of qualified privilege is grounded on the law’s recognition that there are circumstances where a party has a duty or interest to pass on information to another party who has a duty or interest in receiving it (<span class="font-italic">Basil Anthony Herman </span>at [61]). In other words, motive (rather than honesty of belief) is the “essential indicator” of malice that defeats a defence of qualified privilege (<span class="font-italic">Basil Anthony Herman </span>at [60]). Such malice may be proven in two ways, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, (i) the defendant’s knowledge of falsity, recklessness, or lack of belief in the defamatory statement; and (ii) where the defendant has a genuine or honest belief in the truth of the defamatory statement, but his <span class="font-italic">dominant </span>motive is to injure the defendant or some other improper motive (<span class="font-italic">Chan Cheng Wah Bernard and others v Koh Sin Chong Freddie and another appeal </span>[2012] 1 SLR 506 (“<span class="font-italic">Chan Cheng Wah Bernard</span>”) at [90], citing <span class="font-italic">Lim Eng Hock Peter </span>at [38]). </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) In contrast, the defence of fair comment is not based on a notion of performing a duty or protecting an interest. It is, instead, meant to protect and promote the freedom of comment on matters of public interest, irrespective of particular motives for such comment (<span class="font-italic">Basil Anthony Herman </span>at [61]). As such, honesty of belief (rather than motive) is the essential indicator of malice that defeats a defence of fair comment. It follows that the defence of fair comment is not available if the defamer did not honestly believe in the truth of the defamatory comment (<span class="font-italic">Basil Anthony Herman </span>at [60]). The fact that the defamer was acting with ulterior purposes is by itself immaterial for the purposes of the defence of fair comment, although it can – depending on the facts – give rise to an inference that the defamer did not honestly believe in the truth of the comment he or she made (<span class="font-italic">Basil Anthony Herman </span>at [60]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">19 To succeed in a plea of malice to defeat the defences of qualified privilege or fair comment, the Plaintiff must show that the defamatory act was <span class="font-italic">actuated </span>by the Defendant’s malice (see, <span class="font-italic">eg</span>, <span class="font-italic">Chan Cheng Wah Bernard </span>at [88] (defence of qualified privilege) and <span class="font-italic">Nirumalan K Pillay and others v A Balakrishnan and others </span>[1997] 1 SLR(R) 953 at [12] (defence of fair comment)). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">20 A party alleging malice must provide particulars of the facts on which it relies to support its claim (see O 12 r 12(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the Rules of Court), and give particulars of the facts and matters from which the malice is to be inferred (see O 78 r 3(3) of the Rules of Court). These constitute “stringent requirements” to raise a plea of malice, because such a plea is “a very serious allegation of intentional impropriety or bad faith” (<span class="font-italic">Ezion </span>at [26], citing <span class="font-italic">Gatley on Libel and Slander </span>(9th Ed, 1997) at paragraph 28.6). It follows that mere assertion is insufficient when pleading particulars of malice (<span class="font-italic">Ezion </span>at [27], citing <span class="font-italic">Claire Henderson v The London Borough of Hackney and</span><span class="font-italic"> The Learning Trust </span>[2010] EWHC 1651 (QB)<span class="font-italic"> </span>at<span class="font-italic"> </span>[34]). A party alleging malice “must be in possession of facts and matters which support malice and not concoct a case by introducing irrelevant facts which embarrass the defendant” (<span class="font-italic">Nirumalan K Pillay v A Balakrishnan </span>[1996] 2 SLR(R) 650 at [9]–[10]). </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Pleading facts occurring after the commencement of the action</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">21 One of the major issues on which Mr Gaznavi and Mr Lee crossed swords was whether the Plaintiff may plead particulars (in paragraph 25 of the Amended Reply) which occurred after the commencement of the action. However, they did not appear to dispute the applicable principles, which are as follows: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) First, a cause of action must be established as at the date when proceedings are instituted. A new cause of action may not be introduced if it arises after the date of the writ (<span class="font-italic">The “Jarguh Sawit” </span>[1997] 3 SLR(R) 829 (“<span class="font-italic">The Jarguh Sawit</span>”) at [58], referring to <span class="font-italic">Saga Foodstuffs</span>). An amendment to the pleadings is retrospective to the original date that the pleading was filed (<span class="font-italic">Saga Foodstuffs </span>at [9]).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Second, the above does not preclude the pleading of matters (which are not causes of action) that post-date the pleadings in question. As observed by the Singapore International Commercial Court in <span class="font-italic">DyStar</span> at [137], the principle in <span class="font-italic">The Jarguh Sawit </span>does not mean that facts occurring after the issue of the writ cannot be relied on in support of a cause of action existing at the date of the writ. The Court further pointed<span class="font-italic"> </span>out<span class="font-italic"> </span>that<span class="font-italic"> </span>O 18 r 9(1) of the Rules of Court allows a party to plead “any matter which has arisen at any time, whether before or since the issue of the writ”. On the facts of <span class="font-italic">DyStar</span>, the court found that the plaintiff had successfully made out its allegations of pre-writ minority oppression; in the circumstances, the Court held that post-writ conduct could be relied on as evidence of oppressive conduct continuing beyond the date of the writ, in determining whether (and, if so, what) relief the Court should order. For completeness, the Court in <span class="font-italic">DyStar </span>did not have to deal with a scenario where none of the allegations of pre-writ oppressive conduct were made out (see “Civil Procedure”, (2018) 19 Singapore Academy of Law<span class="font-italic"> </span>Annual Review of Singapore Cases 2018 at paragraph 8.7). </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Decision</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">22 On the face of paragraph 25 of the Amended Reply, the Plaintiff is contending that there was pre-existing malice on the part of the Defendant which actuated the August 2019 Statement – “the Defendant <span class="font-italic">had no genuine belief in the truth of the Words</span> and <span class="font-italic">had acted with malice in publishing and/or causing the Words to be published</span>” (emphasis added. If the Plaintiff can substantiate and establish this plea, he will presumably be able to defeat the defences of fair comment and qualified privilege. While Mr Gaznavi attempted to distinguish <span class="font-italic">DyStar</span> on the basis that post-writ conduct was taken into consideration in that case because there was pre-writ oppressive conduct, the point remains that as a matter of pleading, paragraph 25 of the Amended Reply purports – on its face, at least – to plead pre-existing malice. The situation would have been different had the Plaintiff pleaded, for example, that “the Defendant had acted with malice <span class="font-italic">after</span> the Words were published”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">23 At this juncture, I do acknowledge that the particulars pleaded in support of paragraph 25 of the Amended Reply entirely post-date the writ. However, as a matter of pleading, such particulars may be pleaded if they are meant to support an allegation of pre-existing malice. Indeed, in the specific context of defamation proceedings, courts have taken post-publication conduct into account as evidence of pre-existing malice. For instance, in <span class="font-italic">DHKW Marketing</span>, the court held that “[t]he defendants’ conduct after litigation had been commenced was further evidence of malice” (<span class="font-italic">DHKW Marketing </span>at [37]), while in <span class="font-italic">Ezion</span>, the Court noted that “post-publication conduct may be relevant to the question of malice in certain situations” (<span class="font-italic">Ezion </span>at [48]). Both <span class="font-italic">DHKW Marketing </span>and <span class="font-italic">Ezion </span>were also referred to in <span class="font-italic">Gao Shuchao v Tan Kok Quan an others </span>[2018] SGHC 115 at [53].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 The <span class="font-italic">real</span> difficulty with paragraph 25 of the Amended Reply is not the mere fact that the particulars post-date the publication of the August 2019 Statement, but that the particulars do not sustain the Plaintiff’s plea of malice. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 In this regard, I find that the Plaintiff’s plea of malice is factually unsustainable. The supporting particulars entirely post-date the August 2019 Statement. Of the two sets of post-publication conduct pleaded by the Plaintiff, the first (<span class="font-italic">ie </span>the Facebook Post) took place more than six months <span class="font-italic">after </span>the August 2019 Statement, and there are no particulars to show how the Facebook Post demonstrated malice at the time of the August 2019 Statement. The second set of post-publication conduct (<span class="font-italic">ie </span>the Alleged Breach of Confidence) was closer in time to the August 2019 Statement, but again the Plaintiff did not provide any basis for contending that this demonstrated malice actuating the August 2019 Statement. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 While post-publication conduct may constitute “further evidence of malice” (see, <span class="font-italic">eg</span>, <span class="font-italic">DHKW</span><span class="font-italic"> Marketing </span>at [37]), the Plaintiff has not pleaded <span class="font-italic">any</span> material fact linking such post-publication conduct to the August 2019 Statement. Despite ample opportunity for Mr Lee to explain how the pleaded post-publication conduct related to pre-existing malice, he could only assert generally that it provided some basis for inferring pre-existing malice. He was unable to point to any other pleaded material fact (or, indeed, any affidavit evidence) to support the assertion that there was pre-existing malice which caused the making of the August 2019 Statement. I further note that in the Plaintiff’s further written submissions, it was somewhat confusingly contended on the one hand that “<span class="font-italic">… </span><span class="font-italic">malice need not have existed prior to the writ</span> and been continually operating, before the Court could take into account post-writ matters towards determining the issue of malice” (emphasis added),

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 The Plaintiff is obliged to plead matters which support his allegation of malice which, as observed above, is a very serious allegation of intentional impropriety or bad faith (see [20] above). However, the present pleading simply asserts a tenuous link between the Facebook Post, the Alleged Breach of Confidence and the supposed malice which actuated the August 2019 Statement. In my view, this assertion is insufficient to support a plea of malice. I would also add for completeness that no request or attempt was made, whether in oral or written submissions, to amend paragraph 25 of the Amended Reply to rectify the deficiencies or to clarify the Plaintiff’s position. I therefore order that paragraph 25 of the Amended Reply and its accompanying particulars be struck out under O 18 r 19(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the Rules of Court. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 In addition to being struck out under O 18 r 19(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the Rules of Court, paragraph 25 of the Amended Reply may also be struck out under O 18 r 19(1)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the Rules of Court for failing to comply with the rules of pleading. This is because the Plaintiff has failed to plead “particulars of the person or persons through whom it is intended to fix the corporation with the necessary malicious intent” (<span class="font-italic">Ezion </span>at [27]). It bears noting that in <span class="font-italic">Ezion</span>, the High Court concluded that (<span class="font-italic">Ezion </span>at [50]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">While remediable by way of an amendment, <span class="font-italic">individuals within </span><span class="font-italic">[the Defendant] alleged to have malicious intent were also not particularised</span>. Hence, the unsupported plea of malice could also be said to “embarrass or delay the fair trial of the action” under O 18 r 19(1)(c) of the ROC for <span class="font-italic">failing to comply with the rules of pleading</span>. (Emphasis added)</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 I pause to note, parenthetically, that the parties did not dispute the applicability of this principle to the Defendant (being a registered society). In oral submissions, Mr Lee acknowledged the need to identify the individual to whom malice may be imputed, and submitted that the individual in the present case was the Defendant’s president Mr Tang Weng Fei. To this end, Mr Lee pointed to one of the pleaded particulars

</div> where Mr Tang was mentioned by name. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 However, it is difficult to see how that reference to Mr Tang demonstrates any malice on Mr Tang’s part, or that he is the “person … through whom it is intended to fix the [Defendant] with the necessary malicious intent”. This is so, for two reasons. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) First, the pleaded reference simply states that Mr Tang had admitted a “lapse in judgment” resulting in the Facebook Post. It does not actually state that Mr Tang is the person with the necessary malicious intent. It is also unclear, without more, how a “lapse of judgment” suggests malice on Mr Tang’s part – indeed, the material that the Plaintiff himself relies on in relation to the “lapse of judgment” suggests that the “lapse of judgment” was on the part of a staff member.

Have a nice weekend. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">While this striking out application is not the proper forum for assessing or weighing evidence in detail, the point is that the material relied upon by the Plaintiff does not support Mr Lee’s submission that Mr Tang is the person to be fixed with the alleged malicious intent. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Second, the pleaded reference to Mr Tang in any event appears limited to the Facebook Post. There is no similar mention of Mr Tang in relation to the Alleged Breach of Confidence. When queried about this at the hearing, Mr Lee simply confirmed that the Plaintiff was imputing malice to Mr Tang for the Alleged Breach of Confidence, but did not identify any pleading or particulars to that effect. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 I further observe that at no point in written or oral submissions did Mr Lee seek an opportunity to amend the pleadings to clarify or restate the Plaintiff’s position in relation to the individual within the Defendant who had the necessary malicious intent. In the light of the matters in [30] above, and keeping in view the decision of <span class="font-italic">Ezion</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>(particularly at [27], [28] and [50]), I find that paragraph 25 of the Amended Reply would “embarrass or delay the fair trial of the action”.

Even though the Alleged Breach of Confidence is a live issue in OS 432, OS 432 has yet to be judicially determined. Mr Gaznavi has not provided any legal basis for his submission that raising an issue which has yet to be judicially determined in another proceeding amounts to an abuse of process. While there is a possibility that allowing the Plaintiff to canvass the Alleged Breach of Confidence in the present matter “may result in an inconsistent decision” with OS 432,
