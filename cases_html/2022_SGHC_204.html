Two other charges, also preferred under s 420 of the Penal Code, were taken into consideration (“TIC”) for the purpose of sentencing (“the TIC Charges”).

The First Tenancy Agreement spanned 12 months and stipulated that rent was payable at $3,200 per month. In entering the First Tenancy Agreement, the appellant deceived the Landlord into believing that (a) he, along with his co-tenants, would be tenants of the Unit; and (b) he would observe all the covenants of the First Tenancy Agreement, including not to use the Unit for any illegal purpose and not to part with possession of the Unit without the Landlord’s written consent.

Again, in so doing, the appellant deceived the Landlord into believing that, together with his co-tenants, he would occupy the Unit and observe the associated covenants.

</div> The DJ’s grounds of decision can be found at <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v Woo Haw Ming </span>[2022] SGDC 110.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">10 At the first stage of her analysis, the DJ identified and itemised the offence-specific and offender-specific factors. Offence-specific factors that went towards harm included the “[f]rustration of government regulations”, “[p]ublic policy considerations”, “[d]ifficulty in detection” and the “[p]revalence of paper tenancy offences”. Offence-specific factors that were relevant to an offender’s culpability spanned an offender’s knowledge of the illicit nature of “paper tenancies”, the number of properties involved, the duration of offending and the offender’s role. As for offender-specific factors, aggravating elements included offences that were TIC for the purpose of sentencing and an offender’s history of offending while mitigating factors included a plea of guilt and co-operation with the authorities.

</div>
</div>
</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">11 In dealing with the offence-specific factors, the DJ noted that the appellant’s offences: (a) frustrated the regulatory framework aimed at “polic[ing] the type of activities that [went] on at private residences behind closed doors” as well as the public interest in upholding public decency in the community; (b) were part of a “well-orchestrated operation”; (c) were difficult to detect; and (d) were an example of increasingly prevalent “paper tenancy offences”.

</div>
</div> The DJ also found that the appellant had some awareness that the Unit would be used for illegal activities. Whilst the Defence had submitted to the contrary, the DJ noted that the highly irregular tenancy agreements – including the fact that the appellant did not reside in the Unit despite being listed as an occupier – must have alerted the appellant to the fact that the Unit would likely be used for an illicit activity. Coupled with the fact that the appellant signed multiple rental agreements over 11 months, the DJ considered that the appellant’s culpability “was not insignificant”.

First, the DJ accorded excessive weight to the offence-specific factors that were relevant to the harm occasioned by the appellant’s offences. In particular, there was no basis for the DJ to find that sham tenancies frustrate government regulations (given that there are no government agencies regulating tenancy agreements) or were prevalent. Moreover, the financial harm caused to landlords by sham tenancies is mitigated by a landlord’s recourse to the rental deposit. Sham tenancies also do not require elaborate planning.

The factors that the DJ considered in assessing the harm occasioned by the appellant’s offences were valid. Fraudulent tenancies have serious and wider repercussions on society; they frustrate governmental interest in holding tenants accountable for actions that take place within rented premises. Moreover, it was reasonable for the DJ to find that there was a sophisticated and well-orchestrated operation undergirding the appellant’s offences. The appellant entered into the fraudulent tenancies on behalf of Eric (who communicated with the appellant at arm’s length), the tenancies were monitored and renewed before they fell due, and females were subsequently recruited to run the vice operations.

The DJ correctly held that the suspicious circumstances of the transactions must have alerted the appellant that something illicit was being planned. The appellant had been asked to sign the agreements for no reason, had not been given a reason why Eric could not sign the agreements, was paid money for signing the agreements, was listed as the occupier of the Unit despite having no intention to reside in the Unit and had been told to leave the keys to the unit and the tenancy agreement in the Unit. In this regard, <span class="font-italic">Chang Kar Meng v Public Prosecutor</span> [2017] 2 SLR 68 (“<span class="font-italic">Chang Kar Meng</span>”) is authority for the proposition that a court can draw inferences in determining the relevant factual matrix for sentencing purposes, so long as there is a sufficient factual basis to support the inference.

The two-stage, five-step <span class="font-italic">Logachev</span> sentencing framework eschews a focus on the principal factual elements of the cases and instead employs at the first step, a general holistic assessment of the seriousness of the offence by reference to <span class="font-italic">all</span> the offence-specific factors rather than the principal factual elements. These offence-specific factors can be in turn broken down into factors that go towards the offender’s culpability and the harm caused by the offender’s actions. Thereafter, the court identifies the applicable indicative sentencing range within the sentencing matrix based on the level of harm and culpability disclosed, locates the appropriate indicative starting point within that range, makes adjustments to the indicative starting point by considering offender-specific factors and makes further adjustments (if any) to the sentence to take into account the totality principle (<span class="font-italic">Logachev</span> at [75]–[84]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 As I observed in <span class="font-italic">Sue Chang v Public Prosecutor</span> [2022] SGHC 176, however, the <span class="font-italic">Logachev</span> sentencing approach combines the granularity of a sentencing matrix model with the holistic nature of the sentencing of the sentencing bands approach. It may thus be better suited for offences where a broad range of outcomes may arise under the specific axes of harm or culpability (at [64]). Thus, in <span class="font-italic">Ye Lin </span><span class="font-italic">Myint v Public Prosecutor</span> [2019] 5 SLR 1005, one of the reasons the High Court considered that a <span class="font-italic">Logachev</span> sentencing framework could aptly govern offences under s 507 of the Penal Code, which concerns criminal intimidation by an anonymous communication, was that such a framework “would more fully capture the wide diversity of acts punishable under s 507 [of the Penal Code]” (at [46]). The difficulty with fashioning a sentencing framework with reference to <span class="font-italic">Logachev</span> to deal with fraudulent tenancies is that these offences tend to manifest in a particular manner, <span class="font-italic">viz</span>, an offender deceives a landlord into believing that he intends to reside in the property when he possesses no such intention and where the property is then used for other, often nefarious, purposes. Any variation amongst offences involving fraudulent tenancies, for instance in the eventual use of the property or an offender’s role in the criminal enterprise, is not – at least, presently – so wide that it demands a general holistic assessment of the seriousness of the offence in the spirit of <span class="font-italic">Logachev</span>. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 Additionally, I also found the particulars of the DJ’s proposed sentencing framework to be doctrinally suspect. For instance, apart from noting that the court ought to utilise the full range sentencing range prescribed by Parliament, the DJ provided no explanation for her determination that a sentence of up to six months imprisonment was appropriate for an offence disclosing low harm and low culpability.

</div> It was not self-evident or intuitive that this should be the indicative sentencing range, especially when the maximum punishment for an offence under s 420 of the Penal Code (ten years’ imprisonment) was brought to bear upon the analysis. In a similar vein, I did not agree that “[p]ublic policy considerations”, “[d]ifficulty in detection” and the “[p]revalence of paper tenancy offences” were offence-specific factors that went towards harm.

</div> These considerations did not pertain to the manner and mode by which an offence is committed (see <span class="font-italic">Ng Kean Meng Terence v Public Prosecutor</span> [2017] 2 SLR 449 (“<span class="font-italic">Terence </span><span class="font-italic">Ng</span>”) at [39(a)]).  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 In my view, there is some merit in establishing a presumptive sentence for offenders who enter into fraudulent tenancies. This would ensure consistency in sentencing while maintaining an appropriate level of flexibility and discretion for sentencing courts. To this extent, the single starting point approach (which calls for the identification of a notional starting point which will then be adjusted to take into account any aggravating or mitigating factors) and the benchmark approach (which provides the focal point against which sentences in subsequent cases can be determined) warrant serious consideration; both approaches are “particularly suited for offences which overwhelmingly manifest in a particular way” (<span class="font-italic">Terence Ng</span> at [23], [27]–[28], [31]–[32]). Nevertheless, as parties did not submit on this issue, I left it for consideration on another occasion. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 Before I deal with whether the sentences meted out by the DJ were manifestly excessive, I make one other observation. In the proceedings below and before me, counsel for the appellant, Mr Markandu, suggested that some weight could be accorded to unreported precedents in so far as they offer a “useful point of reference” in the court’s final determination of whether a sentence is just and fair.

</div> Mr Markandu further referred me to the Notes of Evidence (“NE”) of the proceedings below wherein the Prosecution purportedly conceded that the appellant’s knowledge that Eric had allowed multiple women to reside in the property (or lack thereof) was not relevant to his culpability. I did not find that the DJ so erred. Reading the salient portions of the NE in context,

</div> I found that the Prosecution merely conceded that whether the appellant knew that Eric operated within a broader syndicate was not relevant to the appellant’s culpability. This was, however, qualitatively distinct from the question of whether the appellant knew that the Unit would be exploited for vice. In this regard, while “[t]he charges and the statement of facts constitute the four corners of the case” against a person who pleads guilty (<span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v Development 26 Pte Ltd</span> [2015] 1 SLR 309 at [16]), I accepted that a court may draw inferences from undisputed facts in determining the relevant factual matrix for sentencing purposes (<span class="font-italic">Chang Kar Meng </span>at [38]–[39]). That the appellant signed the First and Second Tenancy Agreements with no intention to reside in the premises, did so for $100 under the instructions of Eric (who did not account for why he could not have signed the agreement himself) and was instructed to leave the keys and the tenancy agreement in the Unit (with the Unit unlocked) grounded the ineluctable inference that he knew the Unit would be used for illicit activities. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 Next, I found the appellant’s arguments that there was no basis for the DJ to assert that sham tenancies frustrate government regulations or that the Landlord suffered limited loss because he had recourse to the rental deposit to be misplaced.

</div> Both contentions were united by a myopic view of the harm occasioned by the appellant’s conduct (and, at a more general level, by fraudulent tenancies). To construe the harm caused as being confined to the Landlord’s pecuniary loss unjustifiably elides any consideration of the fact that the Landlord did not consent to having his property exploited for vice. Furthermore, due weight must be accorded to the fact that the appellant facilitated the provision of unregulated sexual services and introduced (presently, unbridged) distance between law enforcement authorities and the perpetrators of the broader illicit scheme such as Eric. The private, contractual nature of the tenancy agreements did not detract from the clear public interest in deterring the proliferation of such fraudulent tenancies. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 I was likewise unable to accept the appellant’s contention that the DJ erred in having regard to <span class="font-italic">Mikhy</span> and <span class="font-italic">Dong</span>, which the Prosecution contended (in proceedings below) were instructive in so far as they also concerned offenders who perpetrated deception “aimed at circumventing government regulations” and where the harm occasioned pertained to the “subver[sion of] the proper operation of the [said] regulations”.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 At this juncture, I pause to mention that the Prosecution’s reliance on <span class="font-italic">Mikhy</span> and <span class="font-italic">Dong</span> (as well as Mr Markandu’s reliance on unreported precedents) throws the paucity of reasoned decisions dealing with fraudulent tenancies into sharp relief. This might bolster the case for the promulgation of a presumptive sentence or a sentencing framework to deal with offences under s 420 of the Penal Code involving fraudulent tenancies (see [28] above and <span class="font-italic">Huang</span><span class="font-italic"> Ying-Chun v Public Prosecutor</span> [2019] 3 SLR 606 at [32]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 Returning to the appellant’s submission, while there was force in the contention that <span class="font-italic">Mikhy</span> and <span class="font-italic">Dong</span> were not directly analogous precedents, involving, as they did, the frustration of manpower policy, the manner and context in which the DJ had regard to <span class="font-italic">Mikhy</span> and <span class="font-italic">Dong</span> had to be borne in mind. More specifically, the DJ considered that <span class="font-italic">Mikhy</span> and <span class="font-italic">Dong</span> were cases disclosing harm that was not “easily quantifiable” and thus provided “important indicators for arriving at a starting sentence in [the present] case”.

</div> I found no reason to interfere with this. Even if <span class="font-italic">Mikhy</span> and <span class="font-italic">Dong</span> involved deception in different contexts, the DJ was entitled to consider these two cases as guides to ensure that the sentences she imposed on the appellant were sufficient and proportionate to his overall criminality. This is consistent with the principle of cardinal proportionality which demands that the ultimate sentence meted out by any court must adequately reflect the relative seriousness of the present offence as against the full range of possible offences under the relevant statutory provision (<span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v Tan </span><span class="font-italic">Thian Earn</span> [2016] 3 SLR 269 at [37], [40]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 Finally, I deal with the appellant’s submission that the DJ transgressed the rule against double counting by treating the TIC Charges both as an offence-specific factor relevant to the appellant’s culpability and as an independent aggravating factor.

</div>
</div> The central concern of the rule against double counting is that a sentencing factor should be given only its due weight in the sentencing analysis and nothing more (<span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v </span><span class="font-italic">Raveen Balakrishnan</span> [2018] 5 SLR 799 (“<span class="font-italic">Raveen</span>”) at [98(d)]). This is, however, not to say that a sentencing factor must be considered in silo or invariably only has relevance at one stage of the sentencing exercise. Rather, the rule against double counting prohibits a court from attributing weight to a sentencing factor where this “has already been <span class="font-italic">fully factored</span> into the sentencing equation” [emphasis added] (<span class="font-italic">ADF v Public Prosecutor and another appeal</span> [2010] 1 SLR 874 (“<span class="font-italic">ADF</span>”)<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [92]). I accorded a degree of deference to the DJ and declined to intervene with the sentences imposed merely because she made repeated mention of the appellant’s TIC Charges. As explained in <span class="font-italic">Raveen</span>, the due weight to be accorded to a sentencing factor (which does not form the basis of a charge framed against the offender or of a statutorily enhanced sentence) entails a degree of judgment and the mere fact that a sentencing factor is mentioned in separate parts of a decision should not, without more, be taken to constitute double counting (at [91]). To hold otherwise would imbue sentencing with an overly formalistic character when “[t]he sentencing process is not – and ought not to be – a mechanistic one” (<span class="font-italic">ADF </span>at [218]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 In the final analysis, the threshold for appellate intervention was not met and I thus dismissed the appeal. In coming to my decision, I agreed with the respondent that the appellant committing the offences shortly after being released from custody and the difficulty in detecting fraudulent tenancies drew considerations of specific and general deterrence to the forefront of the sentencing calculus (<span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v Law </span><span class="font-italic">Aik Meng</span> [2007] 2 SLR(R) 814 at [21], [25(d)]).  </div><table class="table table-sm table-borderless"><tbody><tr><td><div class="txt-body text-left">Vincent Hoong</div><div class="txt-body text-left">Judge of the High Court</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-left"></div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-left"></div></td></tr></tbody></table><div class="txt-body text-left"></div><div class="txt-body text-left"></div><div class="txt-body text-left"></div><table class="table table-sm table-borderless"><tbody><tr><td><div class="txt-body text-left"></div></td></tr></tbody></table><div class="txt-body text-right">Asoka Markandu <span style="color: rgba(33,37,41,1)">(</span><span style="color: rgba(33,37,41,1)">Anitha &amp; Asoka LLC) for the appellant;</span></div><div class="txt-body text-right">Deputy Attorney-General Tai Wei Shyong, Norine Tan and Timothy Ong <span style="color: rgba(33,37,41,1)">(</span><span style="color: rgba(33,37,41,1)">Attorney-General’s Chambers) for the respondent.</span></div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
