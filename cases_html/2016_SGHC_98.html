The appellant was to repay $1.5m by 4 September 2012 and a further sum of $500,000 by 9 September 2012 (“the Settlement Payments”) in exchange. It was undisputed that the appellant had made the Settlement Payments. Clause 1.1(ii) of the Deed of Settlement also provided that the aggregate liabilities and obligations of, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, the appellant towards the respondent and Ever Tycoon after the Settlement Payments would not exceed $2m; this was referred to in the Deed of Settlement as the “Balance Principal”. Under cl 1.3 of the same deed, parties agreed to reach an agreement regarding the reinvestment or settlement of the Balance Principal by no later than 1 March 2013. The three supplementary deeds (“the Supplementary Deeds”) served to extend the deadline and forbearance period up till 1 May 2014. Under cl 2.4 of the third supplementary deed, it was also provided that if the parties failed to reach agreement under cl 1.3, the appellant and Realm Capital would be jointly and/or severally liable to pay to the respondent and Ever Tycoon the Balance Principal in addition to all accrued interest at the rate of 5% per annum from 9 September 2012 until the date of full payment. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">5 Parties failed to reach an agreement under cl 1.3; the respondent then served a statutory demand on the plaintiff dated 14 October 2014 for a sum of $2,209,863.01 (“the SD”) pursuant to cl 2.4 of the third supplementary deed.

</div> The plaintiff had attempted, unsuccessfully, to set aside the SD in Originating Summons (Bankruptcy) No 15 of 2015 (“OSB 15/2015”) and in the consequent Registrar’s Appeal No 89 of 2015 (“RA 89/2015”) (See <span class="font-italic">Liew Kai Lung Karl v Ching Chiat Kwong</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>[2015] 3 SLR 1204). The main grounds relied on by the appellant in RA 89/2015 were that the service of the SD was irregular and that there was a dispute as to the debt owed, giving rise to a genuine triable issue. The appellant attempted to argue that the respondent was double claiming for the Settlement Payments, which was a genuine triable issue; Chan Seng Onn J found the argument completely unmeritorious since it was quite apparent that the SD was for the Balance Principal and thus a separate sum and dismissed the appeal. The Court of Appeal in Civil Appeal No 77 of 2015 (“CA 77/2015”) agreed with Chan J and dismissed the appeal.

Given that the Court of Appeal had already affirmed the validity of the SD in CA 77/2015, there was no basis to dismiss the Application which was premised on a valid statutory demand; thus she dismissed Prayer 1 of OSB 89/2015.

However, the Court of Appeal was also careful to note that one could not stave off bankruptcy proceedings <span class="font-italic">merely </span>by alleging that there is a substantial and <span class="font-italic">bona fide</span> dispute over the debt claimed by the applicant-creditor.

I was very doubtful that the issues raised by the appellant in this case were genuine. It appeared incredible to me that the appellant only raised these purportedly triable issues after having gone through the proceedings in OSB 15/2015 and RA 89/2015, when these issues were very fundamental to whether there is even a debt in the first place. The position up till CA 77/2015 had always been that the debt was not disputed; the appellant’s former counsel took that position explicitly when he was queried at the hearing of OSB 15/2015.

</div> The appellant had also made the Settlement Payments pursuant to the Deed of Settlement. The appellant was essentially asking me to believe that after nearly three years, during which deeds were signed that reflected outstanding loans under the facility agreements and were in fact admissions of the appellant’s liability to the respondent, there had never been any monies disbursed from Ever Tycoon and the respondent in favour of the appellant. This was plainly unconvincing. Further, the claim that the appellant was misled by his former solicitors, who were discharged in May 2015, into believing that he had executed personal guarantees giving rise to the debt when he had not, was frivolous to me. Whether or not he signed those personal guarantees was a fact that he would be in the best position to know, not his solicitors. There was no shred of evidence to indicate that the appellant had been misled by his former solicitors, other than bare allegations. There was also no shred of evidence to show that the Deed of Settlement and the Supplementary Deeds were not genuine; it was undisputed that parties entered into the facility agreements and personal guarantees with the benefit of legal advice. There was also no shred of evidence that the respondent had knowledge of the appellant’s purported mistake. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">15 Merits of the appellant’s claims on the triable issue aside, given that the issues raised in the present case effectively go to the validity of the SD, they should have been raised before the CA in the Appellant’s Case for CA 77/2015. The AR was right to find that the appellant had in fact already covered these identical issues in his Appellant’s Case for CA 77/2015, under Section B of the Appellant’s Case which pinpointed issues for the appeal.

It was undisputed that the appellant did not pursue the arguments arising out of these issues before the Court of Appeal during the November hearing, and also did not seek leave to adduce fresh evidence on these issues. This decision also appeared to be a conscious one, rather than one made because of the lack of time, judging from the appellant counsel’s response to the AR at the hearing that had leave not been granted to adduce new evidence, there could have been an issue of estoppel.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">16 I agreed with the respondent’s submissions that the present case falls into the situation described in <span class="font-italic">The Royal Bank of Scotland NV (formerly known as ABN Amro Bank NV) and others v TT International Ltd (nTan Corporate Advisory Pte Ltd and others, other parties) and another appeal</span> [2015] 5 SLR 1104 (“<span class="font-italic">TT International</span>”) (at [101]) where a litigant seeks to “argue points which were not previously determined by a court or tribunal because they were not brought to the attention of the court or tribunal in the earlier proceedings even though they ought properly to have been raised and argued then.” The Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">TT International</span> noted that the “extended” doctrine of <span class="font-italic">res judicata</span>, also known as abuse of process, would apply in such situations; absent special circumstances, a litigant should not be permitted to argue those points in order that there might be finality in litigation. In this aspect they also highlighted (at [101]) Sir James Wigram V-C’s comments in <span class="font-italic">Henderson v Henderson</span> (1843) 3 Hare 100; 67 ER 313 that this doctrine applied “not only to points upon which the Court was actually required by the parties to form an opinion and pronounce a judgment, but to every point which properly belonged to the subject of litigation, and which [the] parties, exercising reasonable diligence, might have brought forward at the time.” The Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">TT International</span> (at [104]) recognized that in dealing with situations where the extended doctrine of <span class="font-italic">res judicata</span> applies, the approach should be a flexible, merits-based one like that described in <span class="font-italic">Goh Nellie v Goh Lian Teck</span> [2007] 1 SLR(R) 453. The court must look at all circumstances of the case, such as whether there is fresh evidence that might warrant re-litigation or whether there are <span class="font-italic">bona fide</span> reasons why a matter was not raised in the earlier proceedings. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">17 On the facts of the case, the triable issues that the appellant sought to ventilate were clearly available at the time of the earlier proceedings, and were in fact covered in the Appellant’s Case; this was not fresh evidence warranting re-litigation. There were no <span class="font-italic">bona fide</span> reasons for not raising them during the hearing before the Court of Appeal; the failure to apply for leave to adduce new evidence was unjustifiable since it was not as though the appellant’s counsel had come on-board right before the hearing. Even if that were to be the case, if the appellant’s position was really that these issues were genuine and should be ventilated, he should have sought an adjournment of the Court of Appeal hearing to prepare an application for leave. As noted earlier, the appellant’s counsel’s reason for not applying for leave was that he was too busy and did not have time to do so. In my view, the only plausible inference that I could draw from the handling of the matter was that the appellant had no confidence in the merits of those triable issues and chose to abandon them on appeal. The appellant failed to raise these issues before the Court of Appeal in CA 77/2015 when he could have, and it would be an abuse of process to allow him to try and raise them in the present proceedings. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">18 There were no merits in the purportedly triable issues raised by the appellant, and more importantly, he should not be allowed to raise them as it would constitute an abuse of process.
