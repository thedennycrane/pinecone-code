<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       This case concerns the distribution of the
                    proceeds from the sale of a Housing and Urban Development Corporation
                    (“HUDC”) maisonette at Block 146 Hougang Street 11 #02-22 Minton
                    Rise, Singapore 530146 (“the Property”). The Property was sold for
                    $617,737.25, as part of an en-bloc sale of the development, on 1 February
                    2007.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The plaintiff, Lim Geok Suan, is the mother of
                    the defendant, Lim Shook Luan.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       In November 1991, the plaintiff and defendant
                    purchased the Property and were registered as joint tenants; the defendant, her
                    two brothers, the plaintiff and, subsequently, one Mr Png Teck Kim
                    (“Mr Png”) who is the plaintiff’s business partner,
                    resided at the Property.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       Following the en-bloc sale of the Property,
                    $463,350.08 from the sale proceeds was refunded to the defendant’s CPF
                    account. The balance sum of $147,030.84 was placed with Messrs Wong Thomas &amp;
                    Leong as stakeholders, with the consent of both parties.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The plaintiff’s case</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       The plaintiff claims $308,868.25 being a half
                    share of the proceeds of sale of the Property. The plaintiff and the defendant
                    contributed in unequal shares to the purchase of the Property. In normal
                    circumstances, this would mean that a resulting trust would be presumed to apply
                    so that the parties would hold the Property on trust in proportion to their
                    respective direct contributions to the purchase price. The plaintiff’s
                    case is that this presumption was displaced by a prior agreement between the
                    parties that they would share the Property equally.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       The plaintiff says that an oral agreement was
                    made between her and the defendant in or about October 1991 (“the
                    Agreement”). The terms of the Agreement were that:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_6-p2_a"></a>(a)     If the Property were to be sold, the
                        sales proceeds would be shared equally between the
                    parties.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_6-p2_b"></a>(b)     Both
                        parties would have a half share in the Property and the right of
                        survivorship would apply.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_6-p2_c"></a>(c)     If the defendant wanted to keep the Property for herself,
                        she would buy a three-roomed HDB flat for the plaintiff.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_6-p2_d"></a>(d)     The plaintiff would sell her apartment
                        at Block 433, Ang Mo Kio Avenue 10 #07-1225, Singapore (“Blk
                        443”) to help finance the purchase of the
                    Property.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_6-p2_e"></a>(e)     The
                        plaintiff and the defendant would take a loan from Credit POSB to finance
                        their purchase of the Property and the defendant would pay the monthly
                        instalments of the loan from moneys in her CPF account.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_6-p2_f"></a>(f)     The plaintiff would pay the monthly
                        conservancy fees, utilities, property tax and household expenses for the
                        Property.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       In support of her case, the plaintiff gave
                    evidence that the decision to purchase the Property was made after many
                    discussions between the defendant, Mr Png and herself. The plaintiff
                    alleged that the defendant would persistently, “almost daily”, ask
                    her to sell Blk 443 and buy a bigger flat jointly with the defendant. The
                    defendant’s concern was that the neighbours would complain about their
                    keeping a large dog in Blk 443. The plaintiff further alleged that the defendant
                    stated that they would own the new property jointly if the plaintiff sold Blk
                    443 to help finance the acquisition of the Property, as she had insufficient
                    funds to finance the purchase on her own.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       The plaintiff alleged that the defendant
                    reassured her regarding the Agreement on various occasions. In particular, she
                    recalled that the evening before they made an offer for the Property, she had a
                    “panic attack” due to her “deep-seated fear that things
                    would go wrong” and asked the defendant to promise her again that should
                    the Property be sold, she would receive half of the proceeds or alternatively
                    the defendant would buy her a 3-roomed flat (should the defendant wish to keep
                    the Property). The defendant then reassured the plaintiff regarding the terms of
                    the Agreement.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       In her statement of claim, the plaintiff set out
                    the terms of the Agreement and then went on to state:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_9-p2_a"></a>(a)     In accordance with the Agreement, the
                        parties purchased the Property on October 1991 for $280,000 (with completion
                        in November 1991) – the Property was registered in their names as
                        joint tenants.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_9-p2_b"></a>(b)     The Property was financed in the following manner:</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_9-p2_b-p3_i"></a>(i)       The plaintiff sold Blk 443
                            for $47,000.00 and used $28,000 of the sale proceeds to pay the 10%
                            deposit for the Property;</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_9-p2_b-p3_ii"></a>(ii)       Both the plaintiff and the defendant obtained a
                            POSB housing loan of $200,000;</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_9-p2_b-p3_iii"></a>(iii)       the defendant used $32,400 from her CPF
                            account;</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_9-p2_b-p3_iv"></a>(iv)       the defendant paid the mortgage instalments;</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_9-p2_b-p3_v"></a>(v)       the plaintiff paid outgoings
                            comprising the monthly conservancy fees, utilities, property tax and
                            household expenses for the Property from 1991 to 2009, which totalled
                            $87,786.00;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_9-p2_c"></a>(c)     The plaintiff said that her cash contributions in relation to the
                        purchase of the Property totalled $65,988.28:</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     In evidence, the plaintiff stated that she
                    had, additionally, paid $11,218.52 for conservancy/maintenance charges,
                    $13,929.61 for utilities and $2,823.46 for property tax and an unnamed figure
                    for telephone charges/household expenses. These amounts, however, were not
                    specifically pleaded in the statement of claim.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     The plaintiff also pleaded that
                    notwithstanding the Agreement, the defendant reassured her on several occasions
                    that she was an equal owner of the Property.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     The plaintiff said that she occupied the
                    Property for 18 years until it was sold whilst the defendant only
                    “resided there on and off”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     The plaintiff’s main claims are
                    for:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_13-p2_a"></a>(a)     a declaration that she has a half
                        share in the sale proceeds of the Property or such interest as the court
                        deems just; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_13-p2_b"></a>(b)     payment out of the sale proceeds in accordance with her interest in the
                        Property.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The defendant’s case</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     The defendant denies the existence of the
                    Agreement. She says that the plaintiff decided to purchase the Property as a
                    home for the plaintiff as well as for the defendant and her two younger
                    brothers. The Property was purchased in the names of the plaintiff and the
                    defendant as joint tenants in order that they would constitute a family unit.
                    The defendant was not married and was not eligible to purchase the Property on
                    her own.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     The defendant denies that there was any
                    discussion or agreement that the plaintiff would have a half share in the
                    Property. Further, there was no discussion on the right of survivorship. Blk 443
                    was sold because the plaintiff could not be the owner of two HDB properties and
                    had to sell Blk 443 in order to acquire the Property. The defendant did not
                    admit that the sale proceeds of Blk 443 were applied to the purchase of the
                    Property.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     The defendant says that the parties had
                    obtained a loan of $200,000 from Credit POSB secured by a mortgage over the
                    Property and she used her CPF savings to pay the balance of the purchase price
                    of $280,000. Although the defendant alone made payment towards the mortgage, the
                    mortgage was in the names of both the plaintiff and the defendant as they were
                    the registered owners of the Property. The defendant disputes the payments which
                    the plaintiff said she made towards the purchase.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     The defendant avers that in equity the parties
                    held the Property as tenants in common with shares in proportion to their
                    respective direct contributions to the purchase price and that there is no basis
                    for the creation of a trust as argued by the plaintiff.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Issues</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     In determining the parties’ respective
                    interests in the Property, the following issues fall for consideration:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_18-p2_a"></a>(a)     Was there an Agreement as alleged by
                        the plaintiff?</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_18-p2_b"></a>(b)     If there was no such agreement, on a resulting trust analysis, what were
                        the parties’ respective beneficial interests in the
                    Property?</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_18-p2_c"></a>(c)     What
                        contributions of the parties are to be considered?</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Was there an agreement as alleged by the plaintiff?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     The evidence as to the existence of the
                    Agreement comes solely from the oral testimony of Mr Png and the plaintiff
                    herself. The defendant denied the existence of the Agreement and her witnesses,
                    who were her siblings, each denied personal knowledge of the Agreement. Thus,
                    this issue turns on an assessment of the evidence and the reliability of the
                    plaintiff’s account.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     There are two versions as to how the Property
                    was acquired. The plaintiff’s version was that she had purchased Blk 443
                    as a home for her six children (four daughters and two sons) and herself. By the
                    time she moved in, the plaintiff and her husband were already separated and he
                    did not occupy Blk 443. They were subsequently divorced.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     The purchase price of Blk 443 was $15,400. The
                    plaintiff paid $8,162 from her CPF account and the balance was paid by
                    instalments. Initially, these instalments were paid by the plaintiff’s
                    eldest daughter, Lim Soh Meng. She became a joint tenant of Blk 443 in about
                    1979 so that her CPF contributions could be used to pay the monthly instalments
                    for that property. When Lim Soh Meng married a few years later, the
                    plaintiff’s younger son, Lim Chan Cherng, became joint owner of Blk 443 in
                    her place and took over that obligation. He also used the moneys in his CPF
                    account to reimburse Lim Soh Meng’s account.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     By about 1985, some of the children had
                    married and moved out and the persons occupying Blk 443 were the plaintiff, her
                    two younger sons, the defendant and Mr Png. The plaintiff maintained that
                    Mr Png was only her business partner although the defendant and her
                    witnesses considered that he was her boyfriend. She insisted that Mr Png
                    always slept on the floor with her two sons in one of the bedrooms while she
                    occupied the bed by herself. Subsequently, in court, she agreed that after some
                    of the children had moved out of the flat, she and Mr Png had shared a room
                    from time to time.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     In about 1985, the defendant moved out of Blk
                    443 to live with her boyfriend. Sometime in 1991, however, the defendant moved
                    back to Blk 443 after this relationship ended. The defendant then wanted to buy
                    a bigger flat because she was afraid that the neighbours would complain about
                    her dog being kept in Blk 443. The defendant did not, however, have sufficient
                    cash to buy a new flat and she persistently asked the plaintiff to sell Blk 443
                    to help finance the purchase of the new flat.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     The plaintiff was reluctant to sell Blk 443
                    because it had been fully paid up and for the first time in her life she was
                    secure in her own house and had a little money saved. She was almost 60 years
                    old at that time and had no desire to live in a bigger flat. She thought that
                    Blk 443 was sufficient for her old age and there was no reason for her to sell
                    it.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     The defendant, however, told the plaintiff
                    that there was no need for her to worry. She said that if the plaintiff sold Blk
                    443 to finance the purchase of the Property, they would own it jointly. The
                    defendant said this meant that half of the Property would belong to the
                    plaintiff. She also said that she intended to take a loan to buy the Property
                    and that she could use the money in her CPF account to repay this
                loan.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     The defendant’s version was that she did
                    not move out of Blk 443 in 1985 but she travelled frequently in the course of
                    her work and therefore frequently she was not at home. When the defendant broke
                    up with her boyfriend in 1991, she wanted to rent a flat for herself, given the
                    cramped living conditions in Blk 443 and the presence of Mr Png whom she
                    disliked. When the plaintiff heard about this, she asked the defendant:
                    “Don’t you want to live with mummy anymore? If you don’t like
                    living here, let’s get something bigger”. Although acquiring a
                    bigger flat was not, initially, the defendant’s idea, she agreed to this
                    proposal so that there would be a more comfortable home for everyone. The
                    defendant denied having pestered the plaintiff to sell Blk 443. She said once
                    the decision to buy the Property was made, the plaintiff had no choice but to
                    sell Blk 443.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     The defendant also asserted that she had
                    agreed to the purchase although she had a strained relationship with the
                    plaintiff because the Property would become the family home and the plaintiff
                    agreed to her request not to allow Mr Png to reside there. As the defendant
                    was not married, she and the plaintiff would form the family unit required to
                    qualify them to purchase the Property.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     Evidence was given by the defendant and some
                    of her siblings that they had a difficult relationship with the plaintiff
                    because the latter became abusive when drunk. She and Mr Png would
                    frequently drink together and this was one of the reasons that the
                    plaintiff’s children did not like Mr Png. The plaintiff admitted that
                    there were frequent quarrels between the children and herself. When it was
                    pointed out to her that Lim Chan Cherng had given evidence that these quarrels
                    took place especially after her drinking bouts with Mr Png, the plaintiff
                    said that she only had one or two cans of stout when she was very tired after
                    work. She also asserted that her daughter, Lim Soh Meng, had lied in her
                    affidavit when she stated that Mr Png had resided in Blk 443 despite the
                    children’s objections and this had resulted in many family
                    arguments.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     A substantial portion of the plaintiff’s
                    case focused on establishing that it was the defendant’s idea to buy the
                    Property. In fact, most of the cross-examination of the witnesses for the
                    defendant focused on establishing this. The problem is that even if the
                    defendant had initiated the purchase (by showing the plaintiff and Mr Png
                    advertisements for available properties as alleged), this does not mean that
                    there was any agreement between the parties in the terms alleged by the
                    plaintiff. In fact, the defendant flatly denied that there was any prior
                    agreement that the plaintiff was to pay conservancy charges, utility bills,
                    property tax and household expenses in return for a half-share in the Property.
                    The defendant stated that she contemplated the purchase as if she was to be the
                    “sole ... person financially responsible”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     Further, the plaintiff’s account of
                    events contained many inconsistencies. The plaintiff was a difficult witness and
                    was frequently evasive or non-responsive. The lapses in her testimony cannot be
                    fully explained away by the facts of her age and the lapse of time between the
                    occurrence of the events and the trial.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     A core part of the plaintiff’s evidence
                    was that she had various discussions with the defendant where the latter
                    allegedly agreed to split the proceeds of the Property (should there be a sale)
                    with her; Mr Png similarly testified to this effect and asserted that he
                    had been involved in said discussions. However, the plaintiff later contradicted
                    herself as seen in the following extract:</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     This undermines the credibility of both the
                    plaintiff’s and Mr Png’s testimony. Further, given the
                    defendant’s dislike of Mr Png (which was verified by her siblings and
                    to some extent by the plaintiff herself), it is unlikely that she would have
                    acquiesced to Mr Png’s presence and input during the alleged
                    discussions. As a matter of fact, Mr Png did not live in the Property for
                    the first two years after it was purchased. It was the plaintiff herself who
                    said that he only went to live there two years later. This fact supports the
                    defendant’s assertion that one of the conditions she put forward and the
                    plaintiff accepted in relation to the purchase of the Property was that
                    Mr Png should not live there.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     The plaintiff had asserted that at her
                    advanced age, she had no need for a bigger flat and that there was no need to
                    assume the financial risk of purchasing the Property. That was no doubt true but
                    although the plaintiff was a party to the mortgage, she did not assume a
                    substantial financial burden in relation to the purchase because it was the
                    defendant who paid all the instalments of the loan. The defendant also paid a
                    lump sum of $32,400 from her CPF account. The plaintiff knew that the defendant
                    would be paying the instalments of the loan. She herself asserted that the
                    defendant had agreed to do so. She was used to loan instalments for property
                    being paid by her children from their CPF contributions as this is what had
                    occurred in relation to Blk 443 from the time the family moved in there in 1979.
                    Even if it was the defendant who suggested the purchase of the Property, it is
                    safe to deduce that the plaintiff would have taken it for granted that she would
                    bear no responsibility for the instalments as these could be satisfied from the
                    defendant’s CPF account.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     The plaintiff would have me believe that the
                    parties had discussed, considered and addressed all the various situations that
                    might later develop as a result of the purchase of the Property. From the
                    evidence, I am satisfied that at the material time the parties had a poor
                    relationship and were not prone to long discussions with each other. The
                    defendant did not approve of the plaintiff’s relationship with Mr Png
                    and also found the plaintiff herself to be a very difficult person who could be
                    abusive when she was drunk. The defendant recounted an incident involving an
                    attempted attack on her by the plaintiff when the latter was drunk and this
                    evidence was corroborated by another daughter, Lim Soo Kheng. The plaintiff
                    herself admitted, as noted above, that contrary to her assertion regarding the
                    terms of the Agreement, prior to the acquisition, there was no discussion as to
                    what would happen on the sale of the Property.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     Further, the plaintiff’s assertion that
                    it was agreed that if the defendant wanted to keep the Property for herself, she
                    would buy a smaller three-roomed flat for the plaintiff does not make sense. The
                    defendant could not have agreed to this since at that time she could not legally
                    be the sole owner of the Property as it was an HUDC property. Sole ownership on
                    the part of the defendant only became possible when the Property was privatised
                    much later, in 2001. Hence, the parties could not have envisaged sole ownership
                    by the defendant and discussed and agreed to the purported term in 1991 when the
                    Agreement was allegedly made. During cross-examination, the plaintiff was asked
                    how she and the defendant could have, before the purchase of the Property,
                    foreseen that it would be privatised later. Her response was telling. She said
                    “We did not foresee”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     The plaintiff was not able to provide a
                    consistent account in relation to each party’s financial contributions.
                    While precision cannot be expected given her age and the length of time that has
                    passed since the purchase of the Property, she was not merely inconsistent but
                    on various occasions contradicted herself. One example is that she stated during
                    the trial that the defendant only contributed by paying the monthly instalments
                    and taking up the loan. Later, however, she agreed that the defendant also paid
                    a lump sum of $32,400 from her CPF Account. Similarly, the plaintiff claimed in
                    her affidavit to have financed the payment of the $23,000 option fee through the
                    sale proceeds of Blk 443. However, upon cross-examination, she claimed that
                    Mr Png had lent her the $23,000 and the monies were transferred through 3
                    blank cheques given to the defendant. Further, in examination in chief, at the
                    start of her oral testimony, the plaintiff said that she had contributed half of
                    the money payable for the purchase of the Property. Under cross-examination, she
                    went further and stated that she had contributed more than half of the moneys
                    for the purchase of the Property. These oral assertions contradicted her
                    assertion in her affidavit that the total amount paid by her was $62,188.28. It
                    was only during re-examination that the plaintiff was able to
                    “clarify” and explain that her entitlement to half the sale
                    proceeds was not based on her contributions but rather on the
                Agreement.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     There are also some doubts about the date of
                    the alleged agreement. The statement of claim states that the agreement was made
                    in October 1991 – which the plaintiff initially confirmed during the
                    trial. However, during cross-examination, the plaintiff stated that she could
                    not remember the exact date (both year and month) on which the parties made the
                    agreement. During re-examination, the plaintiff clarified that the date October
                    1991 stated in her affidavit was incorrect and that the oral agreement was
                    concluded sometime in June or July of 1991. These discrepancies are not material
                    to the extent that, taken by themselves, they would undermine the credibility of
                    the plaintiff’s account but they must be viewed in the context of a
                    witness who kept changing her story and as further examples of how often she
                    changed course during trial.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     The plaintiff also claimed that she did not
                    seek written or formal confirmation of the alleged agreement because she trusted
                    the defendant; she stated she “was taught a lesson” by the
                    defendant not honouring the alleged agreement, which caused her to document in
                    writing the loan of $127,500 she took on 12 January 2010 from Mr Png.
                    Nevertheless, she acknowledged in her affidavit that she was especially anxious
                    about the purchase of the Property such that she repeatedly asked for
                    reassurance that the Agreement had been made. However, during cross-examination,
                    she stated that she “did not mention it to [the defendant]” as
                    “[the defendant] already said “Yes” to me”. This
                    response is curious as her alleged level of anxiety resulting from her alleged
                    lack of trust in the defendant, would surely have prompted her to request for
                    some security or written confirmation regarding the Agreement.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     I should state that Mr Png too did not
                    impress me as a credible witness. He did not have the plaintiff’s excuse
                    of old age, being a much younger man, and yet not only did he sometimes claim to
                    be unable to remember but also he changed his evidence on occasion. For example,
                    when he was asked whether he had given the defendant cash of about $19,682.61 to
                    pay the balance due on completion, he gave varying answers. At first he said he
                    did not know if he had given her cash. Then he said he had bought “a
                    piece of paper from the bank” (the amount was paid by cashier’s
                    order) and then changed his evidence again to say it was the defendant who
                    bought the cashier’s order.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     The plaintiff bears the burden of proving the
                    existence of the oral agreement. In all the circumstances, she has not
                    discharged this burden. I find that there was no Agreement in the terms alleged
                    by the plaintiff in relation to the purchase of the Property.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">What are the parties’ respective interests in the
                Property?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     The plaintiff and defendant were joint tenants
                    at law. Their positions at equity however require some discussion. Since they
                    contributed in unequal shares to the purchase price of the Property (the
                    defendant contributing the majority of the purchase price), the presumption of a
                    resulting trust applies albeit subject to (potential) displacement by the
                    presumption of advancement. In this case, there is no need to discuss the
                    presumption of advancement as it was not pleaded or relied on by the
                    plaintiff.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Applicable law</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     The type of resulting trust relevant here is
                    the “presumed intention resulting trust”, sometimes referred to as
                    the “presumed resulting trust” (“PIRT”). The law
                    relating to this type of trust was comprehensively considered and set out in
                        <em>Lau Siew Kim v Yeo Guan Chye Terence and
                        another</em> [2008]  2 SLR(R) 108 (“<em>Lau Siew Kim</em>”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     This type of resulting trust arises as a
                    consequence of a lack of intention to benefit the recipient. There are two ways
                    that it may arise – first, by means of presumption (unless it can be shown
                    that the transfer was <em>indeed</em> intended to
                    benefit the recipient); and second, independently of the presumption so long as
                    it can be shown that the transfer was not intended to benefit the
                    recipient.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     While the continued basis of the presumption
                    of resulting trust <em>(ie</em> why such a presumption even
                    exists) is not entirely clear (see [23-[42] of <em>Lau Siew Kim</em>), it is clear
                    that the fact being inferred when the presumption is applied is a lack of
                    intention to benefit the recipient.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     As to the specific circumstances which trigger
                    the operation of the presumption, the usual starting point is the following
                    statement from Lord Browne-Wilkinson in <em>Westdeutsche
                        Landesbank Girozentrale v Islington London Borough
                    Council </em>[1996] AC 669 at 708:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">A [<b>PIRT</b>] arises....where A makes a voluntary
                        payment to B or pays (wholly or in part) for the purchase of property which
                        is vested either in B alone or in the joint names of A and B, there is a
                        presumption that A did not intend to make a gift to B: the money or property
                        is held on trust for A (if he is the sole provider of the money) or in the
                        case of a joint purchase by A and B in shares proportionate to their
                        contributions.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(emphasis added.)</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     The following passage by Robert Chambers, in
                        <em>Resulting Trusts</em> (Clarendon Press,
                    Oxford, 1997) at p 32, approved by the Court of Appeal in <em>Lau Siew Kim</em> at [35], is instructive:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The facts which give rise to the presumption of a resulting trust are
                            <b>(i) a transfer of property to another, (ii) for which
                            the recipient does not provide the whole of the
                            consideration.</b> The facts which give rise to the resulting
                        trust itself are (i) a transfer of property to another, (ii) in
                        circumstances in which the provider does not intend to benefit the
                        recipient.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(emphasis added.)</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     Evidence that the recipient has not provided
                    the whole of the consideration typically comprises direct financial
                    contributions to the purchase price of the property. However, there is a quasi
                    exception in relation to contribution to renovations that increase the value of
                    the property, although the property must additionally have been redeveloped
                    “closely after purchase and ... its value...increased by the
                    redevelopment” (<em>Lau Siew Kim</em> at [126] per
                    VK Rajah JA).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     It should be noted that the presumption of
                    resulting trust is a rebuttable presumption of law. The Court of Appeal in
                        <em>Lau Siew Kim</em> clarified that though the
                    presumption of resulting trust must be <em>applied</em> in the circumstances described above in <a href="#p1_45">[45]</a>-<a href="#p1_47">[47]</a>,
                        the <em>strength</em> of the presumption must
                    vary according to the facts of the case and the contemporary community attitudes
                    and norms (the Court of Appeal at [46]
                    of its judgment). A common method of rebutting the presumption is via
                    examination of the parties’ relationship – if the facts reveal a
                    certain relationship between the parties, a counter presumption <em>ie</em> the presumption of advancement is
                triggered.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     Where the presumption of a resulting trust is
                    first, triggered and second, not subsequently rebutted, the proprietor(s) at law
                        (<em>ie</em> the individual(s) in whom legal title is
                    vested) are deemed to hold the legal title on trust for the parties in
                    proportion to their direct financial contributions. In this case, the
                    presumption of resulting trust has been triggered by the unequal contributions
                    made by the parties. It has not been rebutted because I have rejected the
                    plaintiff’s case that there was an express agreement that the parties
                    would be equal owners of the Property notwithstanding their unequal
                    contributions to its acquisition.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Application to the facts</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">Contributions to the purchase price</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     It is undisputed that the plaintiff paid
                    $5000.00 (comprising the option fee), $8,027.50 (legal fees) and $1,878.17
                    (legal fees). Though the plaintiff wavered in her position on the stand, she
                    finally agreed that the defendant had made an initial cash payment of $32,400
                    from her CPF Account.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     Thus by the close of the evidence, the
                    following payments were <em>undisputed</em>:</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     The parties took out a mortgage loan of
                    $200,000 to fund the portion of the purchase price that they could not pay in
                    cash. It is common ground that all the instalments in respect of this loan were
                    paid by the defendant from money in her CPF account. What is in dispute is
                    whether the defendant should be given credit for such payments as being solely
                    her contribution to the purchase or whether the plaintiff and the defendant
                    should be considered to have contributed equally to the payment of the loan
                    because both of them were parties to the mortgage and jointly and severally
                    liable to the lender in respect thereof.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-5" style="font-variant: small-caps;">$23,000 payable on exercise of Option (<em>ie</em> the remainder of the 10% deposit)</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     The only documentary evidence available
                    regarding this payment is an original receipt from C S Tan &amp; Co that is in
                    the defendant’s name. However, the defendant frankly admitted that she
                    could not remember if she had paid this $23,000 or not. She stated that she
                    “cannot remember if I actually wrote out a cheque to pay for it or not.
                    It is possible; it is possible that I did not”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     Conversely, the plaintiff claims that she
                    should be credited with this $23,000 payment. The plaintiff’s version of
                    events is, however, inconsistent. In the statement of claim, she averred that
                    she used the sale proceeds from the flat to pay this $23,000. However, in her
                    affidavit and also during the trial, she claimed that she borrowed monies from
                    her partnership account with Mr Png. Mr Png supported the
                    plaintiff’s account and stated that he gave three unsigned blank cheques,
                    drawn on a Far Eastern Bank partnership account in the joint names of the
                    plaintiff and himself, to the defendant and that one of these was used to fund
                    the $23,000 payment. Unfortunately, there is no documentary evidence of this
                    payment - the plaintiff stated that her bank passbook, account and tax returns
                    of the partnership were thrown away and the loan from the partnership account
                    was not documented (which Mr Png verified).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     The plaintiff further alleged that she repaid
                    this $23,000 loan to Mr Png in 2008 or 2009 using compensation she received
                    from the HDB due to the relocation of her roast meat market stall. Again, there
                    is no documentary evidence of either the repayment of the $23,000 loan or her
                    receipt of the $160,000 compensation received from the HDB (apparently, the
                    $160,000 compensation was not declared on the plaintiff’s income tax
                    return and the partnership accounts detailing the repayment were thrown
                    away).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     On the one hand, the defendant’s
                    testimony does not suggest that she should be credited for this $23,000 payment.
                    The only evidence in her favour is that the receipt from C S Tan &amp; Co was in
                    her name. On the other, the plaintiff would have had enough cash on completion
                    of the sale of Blk 443 to fund this amount (the evidence was that a cheque for
                    some $38,000 odd was issued to her and Lim Chan Cherng on completion and that
                    she retained all this money). She also had an ongoing business with Mr Png
                    and access to the cash and bank accounts of the business. It is possible that
                    she contributed towards this payment though perhaps not to the full amount of
                    the same. Having regard to the unsatisfactory state of the evidence from both
                    parties, I would attribute the payment to both of them in equal shares <em>ie</em> $11,500 each.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-5" style="font-variant: small-caps;">$19,682.61 paid to CS Tan &amp; Co</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a>58     This sum was paid by way of a cashier’s
                    order on the completion of the purchase of the Property.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a>59     Again, the plaintiff claims that this
                    $19,682.61 was procured through a loan from her partnership with Mr Png.
                    She stated that Mr Png gave the defendant three blank cheques, and that the
                    latter used the/these cheque(s) to purchase the cashier’s order which was
                    given to CS Tan &amp; Co. Again, there is no evidence of the details of the loan
                    and the alleged receipt of the $19,682.61 by the defendant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a>60     The defendant stated during the trial that she
                    did not remember whether she made the payment (though defendant’s counsel
                    stated that she did so from her own savings). She elaborated that she could not
                    remember who paid for this $19,682.61 and does not remember receiving blank
                    cheques from Mr Png or the plaintiff. Counsel for the defendant, however,
                    submitted that the plaintiff’s account was to be disbelieved for three
                    reasons. First, given the hostile relationship between Mr Png and the
                    defendant, it was unlikely that Png would have freely given the defendant blank
                    cheques. Second, that the plaintiff and Mr Png’s alleged reliance on
                    the defendant to make all payments and their concomitant apparent lack of
                    knowledge (or concern) as to what the cheques were used to finance was illogical
                    given that they could have asked their lawyers or the property agent what
                    payments were necessary. Third, that Mr Png’s explanation for
                    entrusting the defendant with blank cheques, <em>ie</em>
                    that he was illiterate, was false.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a>61     Apart from the oral testimony of the plaintiff
                    and Mr Png, there is no evidence supporting the “three blank cheques
                    story” and I accept the defendant’s counsel’s submissions on
                    the inherent unlikelihood of that story. In particular I note that although all
                    the cheques were allegedly handed over together in July 1991, they were not in
                    sequential order as one would expect if they had been torn out of the cheque
                    book at the same time. There was also no logical reason why they had to be
                    handed over at one time rather than cheques being issued as and when payments
                    had to be made.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_62"></a>62     On the other hand, the evidence shows that the
                    plaintiff did make some cash contributions to the purchase and therefore I
                    accept she was willing to make further contributions which could be recovered
                    when she sold Blk 443. The defendant has produced no evidence that she had
                    sufficient savings in 1991 to fund the cash payment of $19,682.61 in its
                    entirety. Neither party has been able to show full payment by herself and
                    therefore I think that this payment too should be credited to both parties in
                    equal shares <em>ie</em> $9,841.30 each.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-5" style="font-variant: small-caps;">Agent’s fees, legal and stamp fee comprising
                $12,705.67</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_63"></a>63     The plaintiff alleges that she paid a total of
                    $12,705.67 through one of the three blank cheques provided by Mr Png. The
                    defendant accepted that the plaintiff paid for (some) of the legal fees
                    incurred, specifically, first, $1,878.00 to Ramdas &amp; Wong and second,
                    $8,027.50 to C.S Tan &amp; Co - a total of $9,905.50. It is the excess of
                    $2,800.17 claimed by the Plaintiff which the defendant disputes. Apart from the
                    plaintiff and Mr Png’s oral evidence, there is no evidence of payment
                    of the excess $2,800.17. Accordingly, only the payments evidenced by receipts
                        (<em>ie</em> $9,905.50) will be attributed to the
                    plaintiff and considered in the apportionment of the parties’ respective
                    beneficial interests.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-5" style="font-variant: small-caps;">Agent’s fees for the sale of blk 443 of $1,060.00</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_64"></a>64     This payment alleged made by the plaintiff
                    must be disregarded as it certainly does not constitute a direct or indirect
                    contribution to the purchase price of the Property. It was incurred in relation
                    to the sale of Blk 443 and therefore between the plaintiff and the defendant, it
                    has no significance.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-5" style="font-variant: small-caps;">Stamp duty of $3,800</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_65"></a>65     No evidence of this contribution was provided
                    by the plaintiff and this was flatly denied by the defendant. In view of the
                    lack of evidence, I will disregard this contribution.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-5" style="font-variant: small-caps;">Installation of grilles, $740</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_66"></a>66     The grills were installed on 9 March
                    1992, after the purchase of the Property. The plaintiff claims that the
                    defendant requested that she install the grilles and the iron-gate. No evidence
                    was provided by either party as to whether the plaintiff incurred this expense.
                    In any event, this expense is irrelevant as it does not constitute a direct
                    contribution towards the purchase price.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-5" style="font-variant: small-caps;">Conservancy charge and Property tax</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_67"></a>67     The plaintiff stated that while she is certain
                    that she paid the property tax, she is unsure of when she started doing so as
                    the defendant “did not tell [her]”. There is evidence (from the
                    plaintiff’s bank passbook) that GIRO deductions were made for property tax
                    payments from September 1994. However, there were also property tax deductions
                    (accounted for in the plaintiff’s bank passbook) in 1991 and 1992 –
                    though the defendant’s counsel pointed out that there was no indication of
                    which property these payments were made in reference to. The total amount of
                    property tax payments made by the plaintiff amounted to $2,743.20.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_68"></a>68     The plaintiff claims to have paid $10,995.52
                    in respect of conservancy charges levied on the Property. This was evidenced by
                    records in her bank passbook.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_69"></a>69     In <em>Gurnam
                        </em><em>Kaur d/o Sardora Singh v Harbhajan Singh s/o
                        Jagraj Singh</em> [2004] 4 SLR(R) 420, one of the parties
                    claimed that he had contributed to the purchase price of the relevant property
                    in dispute by paying $150 per month for food for the family and paying the
                    electricity and water bills. He added that he gave his mother $40 per month for
                    her expenses. Tan Lee Meng J rejected the assertion that these payments
                    constituted contributions to the acquisition of the property. He said that they
                    had nothing to do with its purchase price (at [7] of the judgment). On the same reasoning, the conservancy
                    charges had nothing to do with the purchase price – they were indirect
                    expenses incurred in relation to the occupation of the Property. They therefore
                    cannot be counted as part of the plaintiff’s contribution.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_70"></a>70     Property tax payments have, in matrimonial
                    cases, been considered to be part of a party’s contribution to the
                    acquisition of a property. Whilst this precedent may be long established in
                    cases where the courts have to divide matrimonial property between ex-spouses
                    and undertake an exercise of assessing direct financial contributions to
                    acquisition of this property, there is no good reason to extend this policy to
                    other cases where financial contributions are being assessed. Property tax
                    payments are made to settle annual taxes levied on a property by the government
                    and arise periodically after a purchase has been completed. They play no part in
                    determining the cost of acquiring the property because the amount that is paid
                    in taxes depends on how long the property is owned and has nothing to do with
                    any obligation undertaken at the time of acquisition. Strictly speaking, such
                    payments constitute household expenses and therefore cannot be direct
                    contributions to acquisition of a property. I must therefore disregard this
                    amount paid by the plaintiff.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-5" style="font-variant: small-caps;">$200,000 Housing Loan</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_71"></a>71     Generally, payments of mortgage instalments
                    are not regarded as direct contributions to the purchase price of a property per
                        <em>Calverley v Green</em> at [27] and <em>Lau Siew
                        Kim</em> at [115]. However, payment of mortgage instalments pursuant
                    to an agreement between the parties are considered direct contributions to the
                    purchase price and will give rise to a resulting trust (<em>Lau
                        Siew Kim</em> at [116]-[117]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_72"></a>72     While it is undisputed that the defendant paid
                    for all mortgage instalments, both parties were jointly liable for the mortgage
                    as the mortgage was taken out in both parties’ names. Accordingly, each
                    party would be <em>prima facie</em> held to have directly
                    contributed $100,000 to the purchase price. However, the defendant argues that
                    she made the mortgage payments pursuant to a prior agreement between the parties
                    that “the defendant was to be solely responsible for the financing of the
                    purchase and making the mortgage instalment payments”. Accordingly, the
                    “ultimate source of the funding” (<em>Lau Siew
                        Kim</em> at [116]-[117]) was provided by the defendant (and not
                    jointly by the parties). Following from this, she submits that the monthly
                    mortgage payments should be considered in the apportionment of the
                    parties’ beneficial interests.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_73"></a>73     The plaintiff’s own evidence was that it
                    was a term of the Agreement that the defendant would arrange for the financing
                    needed for the purchase and would pay the mortgage instalments. She not only
                    said this in her affidavit but also repeated it in open court and specified that
                    the Agreement was that the defendant would use moneys from her CPF account to
                    make these payments. The plaintiff cannot now argue that she should be taken as
                    having contributed to half the housing loan simply because she was a party to
                    the mortgage. First, the housing loan was only in the joint names of the parties
                    because the Property was held in their joint names. Second, as mentioned
                    earlier, the plaintiff was used to a situation in which loan instalments were
                    paid from her children’s CPF accounts and she made no contribution to the
                    same whatsoever. The plaintiff’s stand was that she was concerned not to
                    incur any additional financial liability by reason of the purchase of the
                    Property. Given that position, it is a fair deduction that she only went into
                    this purchase because she knew she would not have to pay the mortgage
                    instalments and that these would be settled by the defendant. Further, there was
                    no risk of the plaintiff being made liable to make the mortgage payments if the
                    defendant defaulted as the defendant had taken out a mortgage insurance policy
                    to safeguard against this eventuality.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_74"></a>74     I am satisfied that in all the circumstances
                    of the case, the defendant’s direct contributions to the purchase should
                    include the amounts that she paid towards settling the mortgage loan. These
                    amounts totalled $289,199.96 as shown by the defendant’s CPF
                    statement.</p>

<b>Total :

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_78"></a>78     Based on the tables above, the total amount
                    expended by the parties in relation to the purchase of the Property was
                    $379,188.23 ($36,246.97 and $342,941.26). The plaintiff’s contribution to
                    this sum amounts to 9.56% thereof and the defendant’s to 90.44%. I think
                    it is fair to round off the plaintiff’s contribution to 10%. That
                    percentage would also represent her beneficial interest in the
                Property.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_79"></a>79     As the net proceeds of sale of the Property
                    amounted to $610,380.92 (comprising the sum of $463,350.08 refunded to the
                    defendant’s CPF account and the sum of $147,030.84 held by the
                    stakeholders), the plaintiff is entitled to 10% thereof <em>ie</em> $61,381.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_80"></a>80     There will be the following orders:</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(a)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">A declaration that the plaintiff has a 10%
                            beneficial interest in the Property; and</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(b)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">The sum of $61,381 shall be paid out to the
                            plaintiff from the money held by M/s Wong Thomas &amp;
                        Leong.</div>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_81"></a>81     As regard costs, the plaintiff asserted a
                    right to half the sale proceeds whilst the defendant in her closing submissions
                    asserted the plaintiff’s entitlement was only 5.3%. Whilst the plaintiff
                    has succeeded in recovering more than the defendant recognised as her due, she
                    has recovered much less than she claimed. Accordingly, I will hear the parties
                    on what the appropriate costs order to be made is.</p>
