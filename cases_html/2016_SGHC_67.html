</div> Living was part of the Link Group of companies who were pioneers in the high end retail fashion business in Singapore. Prior to the voluntary liquidation, the remaining inventory and certain shares held by Living were transferred to its associate companies, Link Boutique Pte Ltd (“Link”) and Alldressedup International Pte Ltd (“Alldressedup”) (together “the associate companies”). Substantial inter-company cash transfers were also recorded between the companies, particularly between Living and Link, in the two years preceding the liquidation.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 The bulk of Living’s unsecured debts are owing to Link and Alldressedup who had provided financial support to Living from its inception for its operation and the acquisition of inventory. The only substantial creditor not related to Living is its former landlord, Cheong’s Company Pte Ltd (“Cheong”) who has a claim for rental arrears and damages arising from the premature termination of the tenancy agreements between Cheong and Living.

</div> who is also funding the present claim against the defendants, namely Living’s director and sole shareholder, Tina Tan Lay Yin (“Tina Tan”), and the associate companies. In this judgment, the plaintiffs are referred to as the liquidators.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">3 As the impugned transfers of inventory and the majority of the cash payments were made to associate companies within the two years preceding the creditors’ voluntary liquidation (“the relevant period”), the liquidators are relying on the statutory presumption that these transactions were undue preferences under s 329 of the Companies Act (Cap 50, 2006 Rev Ed) read with ss 99 and s 100(1)(b) of the Bankruptcy Act (Cap 20, 2009 Rev Ed). The liquidators also assert that Tina Tan breached her duties as Living’s director by, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, procuring these transactions. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">4 The liquidators seek a reversal of all the impugned transactions, the total amount of which far exceeds the claims of the unsecured creditors not related to Living, particularly Cheong. This gives rise to a real risk of the remedy being disproportionate to the claim, with the associate companies paying monies over to Living only for a substantial portion to become repayable to them after their Proofs of Debt are assessed. The question arising from this state of affairs is whether the court is entitled to order a partial reversal of the impugned transactions <span class="font-italic">only</span> to the extent sufficient to meet the claims of Cheong and any other unrelated creditors even if all or most of the transactions constituted undue preferences. Initially, counsel for the liquidators indicated that this would be a sensible approach. However, after considering an issue which I had flagged to the parties when giving directions for the closing submissions, the liquidators changed their position and submitted that the court does not have the power to order a partial reversal because such an order would have the effect of approving and paying some of the debts owing to Link and Alldressedup even before they are adjudicated by the liquidators. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">5 Additionally, the liquidators have sued Tina Tan in her capacity as director and seek against her, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, an order that she pays a sum equal in value to the undue preference transactions. Although it has been observed that a director might be in breach of his or her fiduciary duties in procuring undue preferences, to-date there is no reported decision by our courts on whether this alone is sufficient to warrant such a finding against the director and if so, what orders can or should be made against the director as a defendant in such proceedings. This case thus raises several interesting issues on the law governing undue preferences which this judgment will examine. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Facts</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Background to the dispute  </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">6 Link was first founded by Tina Tan as a retailer of ladies’ apparel and high fashion merchandise in 1982.

</div> At that stage, it was asserted, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, that at least some of the transferred inventory and the Graha shares were held by Living on constructive or resulting trust for Link and Alldressedup and/or the secured lenders who financed the purchase of the inventory. The constructive trust argument was, however, dropped on the first day of the trial, and the resulting trust defence was abandoned just before the close of the defendants’ case. Hence, the defendants now accept that the transferred inventory and the Graha shares were owned by Living before their transfers to Link and Alldressedup. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">14 The liquidators’ case has also somewhat narrowed. Initially, it was argued that the transfers of inventory and the Graha shares were not just undue preferences, but also undervalue transactions as these assets were worth more than the amounts which were credited to Living upon their transfers. This is no longer pursued. Similarly, certain transfers of fixed assets by Living to Link were initially the subject of dispute but the liquidators have since confirmed at the close of the defendants’ case that they were no longer pursuing this claim. Finally, the claim for personal expenses was broader before the parties agreed to limit the quantum of the claim to the amount stated above.   </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">15 Following the culling of these arguments, the remaining issues for determination, broadly stated, are:</div><div class="mb-3"><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify"><span class="font-italic font-underline">Undue preference</span></div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(a) whether Living was insolvent when the impugned transactions were made during the relevant period, or became insolvent in consequence thereof;</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(b) whether the statutory presumption that these transactions were influenced by a desire to prefer the defendants is rebutted;</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(c) if not, what is the appropriate remedy and does the court have the power to partially reverse any undue preferences to an amount sufficient to meet the claims of Cheong and any other unsecured creditors;</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify"><span class="font-italic font-underline">Breach of directors’ duty arising from undue preference </span></div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(d) whether Tina Tan is <span class="font-italic">per se</span> in breach of her duties as director if any of the impugned transactions are found to be undue preferences, and if so what orders, if any, should be made against her;

reg 5 of Companies (Application of Bankruptcy Act Provisions) Regulations (Cap 50, Rg 3, 1996 Rev Ed)). Hence, under s 99(5) of the Bankruptcy Act, there is a presumption that Living was influenced by a desire to prefer the associate companies when the transactions were entered into. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">19 The defendants seek to challenge the presumption on various grounds. The overarching argument which cuts across all the claims is that Living was not insolvent at the time of the impugned transactions. Independently, the defendants raise a number of specific arguments to rebut the presumption. First, in respect of the inventory and shares, Tina Tan claims she had the genuine belief that Living had no substantial creditors at the time of their transfers apart from Link and Alldressedup. In particular, she says she genuinely believed at the time that Cheong neither was nor would be a creditor of Living since Living was entitled to terminate the tenancy agreements prematurely and had paid all its rental arrears as of the date of termination. Hence, it is claimed that the transfers were not motivated by the requisite desire to prefer Link and Alldressedup over Cheong or any other unsecured creditor. Second, Tina Tan relies on the continued payments made by Link and Alldressedup to Living after the transfers of the inventory and shares as evidence that she had no desire to prefer the associate companies in the first place. Finally, in respect of the cash payments made by Living to Link during the relevant period in 2008, she asserts that they were part of a series of legitimate mutual dealings under a running account between the companies.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Was Living insolvent at the time of the impugned transactions?</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Was the inventory transferred in December 2008 or April 2009?</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">20 Before examining whether Living was insolvent at the time of the impugned transactions, there is an anterior question which has to be addressed in relation to the date of the transfers of the inventory. The parties are <span class="font-italic">no longer</span> in agreement as to the date of the transfers.  I say <span class="font-italic">no</span> <span class="font-italic">longer</span> because until 21 January 2016, when the Defence and Counterclaim was amended for the seventh time on the eve of the trial, it was not in dispute that the transfers had occurred on 31 December 2008.

<div class="FootnoteRef text-justify">  Defence and Counterclaim (Amendment No. 7) dated 21 January 2016, para 9.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> With the latest amendment, the defendants now assert that the transfers were instead effected on 27 April 2009. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">21 The purpose for this late amendment was initially not clear. But it became apparent in the defendants’ closing submissions that the date of the transfers has several ramifications to the defence. For a start, Living’s solvency has to be examined with reference to the date of the transfers. More importantly, the defendants accept that Living had effectively ceased business following the inventory transfers. So the date has a material impact on various other arguments which the defendants have put forward. It is the defendants’ case that Living continued operating until April 2009 with the financial support of the associate companies. This continued financial support, the defendants argue, indicates that the cash payments made by Living to Link for the whole of 2008 were legitimately made with a view to obtaining fresh financial support from the associate companies. However if it is found that the inventory transfers took place on 31 December 2008, with Living ceasing business thereafter, then questions arise as to the veracity of this continued financial support, which is an issue which will be further examined below. It is also then difficult to explain why Living continued to reimburse the personal expenses of its directors from January to April 2009. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">22 In support of their amended position that the transfers occurred on 27 April 2009, the defendants relied on the fact that the total value of the transferred inventory, as recorded in Living’s books on 31 December 2008

</div> On this premise, the defendants’ expert witness, Mr Sim Guan Seng (“Mr Sim”) concluded that Living must have used the 27 April list to record the transfers as if they were made at the end of December 2008.

</div> In other words, the decision to transfer the inventory was made on 27 April 2009 but the transfers were backdated to 31 December 2008. Mr Sim though was unable to provide any information as to provenance of the 27 April list – by whom, when and why it was prepared and whether there are similar inventory lists for January to March 2009 to verify that the amounts stated in the 27 April list were not simply a reproduction of amounts earlier recorded on 31 December 2008. In addition, the defendants drew the court’s attention to a $2m credit facility which Living obtained from the Bank of East Asia (“BEA”) on 25 November 2008. They claim that it is unlikely that a decision to wind down Living would have been taken so soon after this event. I disagree. First, it is clear that this credit facility was not obtained by Living solely to finance its own business. As acknowledged by the defendants, it was merely a transfer of Link’s credit facility with BEA to Living,

</div> This is an unequivocal indication of Living’s intention to cease its retail business on that date.

</div> In other words, Link rather than Living was the <span class="font-italic">de facto</span> company operating at One Nassim in 2009, and the transfers of the inventory at the end of 2008 precipitated a transfer of the Link Group’s retail business from Living to Link following the decision that Living was not going to proceed as a going concern.

It was always dependent for its cash flow on Link and Alldressedup as determined by Tina Tan. When and whether Living was able to pay its debts as they fell due was therefore entirely dependent on the cash flow made available by Tina Tan to Living. The defendants argue that this support from the associate companies should be taken into account in the assessment of whether Living was cash flow solvent. In aid of this submission, they rely on the following passage from Belinda Ang J’s judgment in <span class="font-italic">Chip </span><span class="font-italic">Thye Enterprises Pte Ltd (in liquidation) v Phay Gi Mo and others</span> [2004] 1 SLR(R) 434 (“<span class="font-italic">Chip </span><span class="font-italic">Thye Enterprises</span>”) at [17]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">There is support in the cases for the view that the test for putting a company into liquidation under s 254(1)(e) read with sub-s (2)(c) of the Companies Act (Cap 50, 1994 Rev Ed) is one of fact to be decided in the light of all the circumstances of the case: <span class="font-italic">Re </span><span class="font-italic">Sanpete Builders (S) Pte Ltd</span> [1989] 1 SLR(R) 5.

See Chao JC (as he then was) in <span class="font-italic">Re </span><span class="font-italic">Sanpete Builders (S) Pte Ltd</span>.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 The above dicta, however, is based on authorities dealing with the court’s discretion to wind up a company under s 254(1)(e) read with sub-s (2)(c) of the Companies Act. That is a different context in which all the relevant circumstances of the case should rightly be taken into account. Here, I am concerned with the specific application of the cash flow test in s 100(4)(a) of the Bankruptcy Act. In applying this test, I am of the view that the past financial support extended by the associate companies should not be relied upon to prove that Living was able to pay its debts as it fell due, especially as the shareholders and directors of the associate companies, in particular Tina Tan, were never obliged to provide this support. In any case, even with the financial support of the associate companies, the fact remains that Living encountered difficulties from January 2008 in paying its rental as it fell due despite being pressed for payments by Cheong. Hence, applying the cash flow test, I find that Living was insolvent from January 2008, and certainly throughout the relevant period starting 13 May 2008.    </div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(2) Balance sheet test</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 Given my finding that Living was unable to pay its debts as they fell due, it is strictly unnecessary to deal with the balance sheet test. Nonetheless, for completeness, I will examine the issue. The balance sheet test is simply whether the value of the company’s assets as at the balance sheet date was less than the amount of its liabilities, taking into account its contingent and prospective liabilities (<span class="font-italic">Tam Chee Chong</span> at [65]). This test is distinct from what has been called the “quick assets” test in which the companies’ current assets, which can be readily converted into cash, are compared to its current liabilities (see <span class="font-italic">Chip </span><span class="font-italic">Thye Enterprises</span> at [19]).

</div> I make this observation because the defendants have relied on the date of the Graha shares transfer to support the amended April 2009 date for the transfers of the inventory: the reasoning being that the defendants must have intended all the transfers to take place at the same time. This comparison is, however, misconceived since the inventory and the shares have been treated differently in Living’s books.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 As stated above, the defendants seek to uphold the transfers of the inventory and shares on two grounds. First, they say that Tina Tan genuinely believed that Cheong would not be a creditor following the premature termination of the lease. Thus the transfers were not motivated by a desire to prefer the associate companies over Cheong, which was Living’s only other substantial creditor at the time apart from Link and Alldressedup. Next, the defendants rely on continued payments made by the associate companies to Living after the transfers of the inventory and shares as evidence that there was no desire to prefer the associate companies in the first place. I find both these grounds are without merit. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(1) Did Tina Tan genuinely believe that there were no other substantial creditors at the time of the transfers? </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 First, as the lease was <span class="font-italic">prematurely</span> terminated, it seems obvious that Cheong would bring a claim for damages for the remaining term of the lease.

</div> there is no express contractual requirement that Cheong was obliged to provide the specific type of power supply sought by Living. If this was indeed Living’s technical requirement for the operation of its contemplated lifestyle café, then it was incumbent on Living to specify this requirement to Cheong <span class="font-italic">and</span> for Cheong to expressly agree to provide it in the lease. This was not done. Evidently the power supply provided by Cheong was adequate to operate a café at One Nassim as a previous establishment, the Jackie Chan café, was in operation there until May 2009.

</div> This inevitably leads to the inference that this defence was an afterthought raised by Tina Tan in her attempt to justify the premature termination. It is telling that Living wrote to Cheong’s property agent on 24 October 2008 to request for a waiver of two months of rental and a reduction of rental because it had not been “able to generate the same amount of sales as [at the] previous location in Mandarin hotel” and to assure that, if Cheong was agreeable, it would “endeavour” to pay the monthly rental till the end of the lease.

</div> This is entirely consistent with my earlier finding that the transfers of the inventory had taken place on 31 December 2008 in order for Link to take over the Link Group’s retail business (see [24] above). The entries for the rental and wages/staff costs in Living’s books indicate that these expenses also pertained to the other entities of the Link Group such as Link Wedding, Link Home and Alldressedup Distribution.

</div> In other words, the rental and wage/staff costs recorded were not those of Living. It follows that the funds were transferred to Living in 2009 to enable it to pay these expenses <span class="font-italic">on behalf</span><span class="font-italic"> of the associate companies</span>. Accordingly, these monies could not conceivably have constituted financial support for Living. In fact, this alleged financial support appears to have been used by Living to cover expenses which had been booked against it even though these were unrelated to Living’s business and ought not to have been borne by it in the first place.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 In the premises, the presumption in respect of the inventory and share transfers remains unrebutted. At the time these transfers were made, on 31 December 2008 and 1 April 2009 respectively, the decision had already been made that Living was not going to proceed as a going concern and Tina Tan was aware that there were other unsecured creditors, particularly Cheong, with substantial claims against the company. Given this context, it is implausible that a desire to better the position of the associate companies did not operate on Tina Tan’s mind at all when she procured these transfers to the family owned associate companies to the exclusion of Living’s other creditors.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Cash transfers in 2008 and the running account principle</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 The liquidators initially claimed that the entire <span class="font-italic">net</span> cash payments of approximately $3.86m by Living to Link over the course of 2008 were tainted by undue preference. However s 329 of the Companies Act read with ss 99 and 100(1)(b) of the Bankruptcy Act only extends to payments made within the period of two years ending on the date of the commencement of the winding up. It is common ground that in this case the relevant date is 13 May 2008 when the resolution for the creditors voluntary winding up was passed: s 329(2)(b) read with s 291(6) of the Companies Act. The liquidators therefore can only challenge the cash transfers as undue preferences for the period from 13 May 2008 to 31 December 2008.

In particular, they rely on the “running account principle” which determines when a transaction, which on its face is an undue preference, can be upheld on the basis that it was made under a mutually beneficial running account. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(1) Running account principle</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 Within the common law, the running account principle can be traced to a series of Australian authorities starting with <span class="font-italic">Richardson v Commercial Banking Co of Sydney Ltd</span> (1952) 85 CLR 110 and culminating in the decision of the High Court of Australia in <span class="font-italic">Airservices</span><span class="font-italic"> Australia v Ferrier and another </span>(1996) 185 CLR 483 (“<span class="font-italic">Airservices</span><span class="font-italic"> Australia</span>”). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 In <span class="font-italic">Airservices</span><span class="font-italic"> Australia</span>, there were nine payments made by Compass Airlines to the Australian Civil Aviation Authority (“CAA”), for airport and air navigation services, in the lead up to the airlines’ insolvency. In considering whether the payments were undue preferences, the majority of Dawson, Gaudron and McHugh JJ (Brennan CJ and Toohey J dissenting) elaborated on the definition of a running account and its relevance to preference law (at 504–505):  </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… A running account between traders is merely another name for an active account running from day to day, as opposed to an account where further debits are not contemplated. <span class="font-italic">The essential feature of a running account is that it predicates a continuing relationship of debtor and creditor with an expectation that further debits and credits will be recorded. Ordinarily, a payment, although often matching an earlier debit, is credited against the balance owing in the account. Thus, a </span><span class="font-italic">running account is contrasted with an account where the expectation is that the next entry will be a credit entry that will close the account by recording the payment of the debt or by transferring the debt to the bad or doubtful debt a/c.</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">If the record of the dealings of the parties fits the description of a “running account”, that record will usually provide a solid ground for concluding that they conducted their dealings on the basis that they had a continuing business relationship and that goods or services would be provided and paid for on the credit terms ordinarily applicable in the creditor's business. When that is so, a court will usually be able to conclude that the parties mutually assumed that from a business point of view each particular payment was connected with the subsequent provision of goods or services in that account. Sometimes, however, the transactions recorded in the account may be so sporadic that a court cannot conclude that there was the requisite connection between a payment and the future supply of goods even though the account was kept “in the ordinary form of a running account in which debits and credits are recorded chronologically and in which payments are not shown as attributable to any particular deliveries but are brought generally into credit”. <span class="font-italic">Thus, it is not the label “running account” but the conclusion that the payments in the account were connected with the future supply of goods or services that is relevant, because it is that connection which indicates a continuing relationship of debtor and creditor. It is this conclusion which makes it necessary to consider the ultimate and not the immediate effect of individual payments.</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 On the facts, the majority found that there was a running account between Compass Airlines and the CAA. Critically, the facts recorded in the running account indicated that the parties had a continuing relationship which contemplated further debits and credits; the individual payments were intended to continue and not determine the relationship, and their purpose was to acquire goods and services equal to or of greater value than the payment. Hence, except for the last payment made the day before Compass Airlines went into provisional liquidation, the rest were upheld as legitimate. The last payment was judged to have been made in response to a demand by the CAA for partial payment of an old debt rather than for the provision of continuing services, and was thus found to be an undue preference.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 In Singapore, the running account principle was first considered, in the context of undue preferences given to associates, by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Progen</span>. That case concerned a number of payments made by the insolvent company, PEPL, to its holding company, the respondent. These included, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, the repayment and discharge of loans owed by PEPL to the respondent, and payments for the salaries and expenses of the respondent’s employees. The directors of PEPL sought to rebut the statutory presumption that there was a desire to prefer the respondent by demonstrating that the payments were part of PEPL’s “settled practice” and in line with its past practice of acting as a “payment centre” for the other related companies within its group. PEPL’s specific defence was rejected. Evidence that the payments were in line with a course of dealing established when the company was <span class="font-italic">solvent</span> was held to be insufficient – it must be proved that the payments made when the company was <span class="font-italic">insolvent</span> were made with <span class="font-italic">the intention of obtaining new value to keep the business going</span>. V K Rajah JA elucidated as follows (at [57]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… The existence of an established course of dealings, or “past practice” so to speak, is only <span class="font-italic">relevant</span> if those past practices show that the creditor has been <span class="font-italic">providing new value </span>by granting new credit to the company to purchase supplies and items (for example) to keep its business going. Where that is the case, payment is made not with the desire to prefer the creditor, but with the motivation to obtain fresh financing to sustain the company’s business in earnest. As observed by Prof Roy Goode in <span class="font-italic">Principles of Corporate Insolvency Law</span> (Thomson Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 3rd Ed, 2005) at p 465:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[The] fact that there is a series of mutual dealings, with debits and credits on both sides, will usually suffice to negate an intention to prefer, for it suggests either that a payment into the account was made in the expectation that further drawings would be allowed or that the bank allowed a further drawing on the understanding that it would be covered by a further payment into the account. In either case there is no intention to prefer, or indeed, a true preference at all. Indeed, it has been said that the real question is … the intention that payments into the account will generate future supplies of goods, services or credit. <span class="font-italic">Accordingly … even payments made to discharge specific debit items will qualify for the application of the principle if the intention is that they should form part of a continuing relationship involving the extension of further credit.</span> </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis in original]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 On the facts of <span class="font-italic">Progen</span>, there was no evidence that the contested payments were made in the expectation that the respondent would provide new credit to the company to finance its business. The payments constituted “one way traffic” as the respondent did not provide new value nor extended new credit throughout the history of the contested payments (<span class="font-italic">Progen</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [62]). Hence, they could not be upheld as part of a series of mutual dealings on a running account between the parties.   </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 The Court of Appeal also discussed, with approval, <span class="font-italic">Re Libra Industries Pte Ltd</span><span class="font-italic"> (in compulsory liquidation)</span> [1999] 3 SLR(R) 205 (“<span class="font-italic">Re Libra</span>”), the facts of which are analogous to the present matter. In <span class="font-italic">Re Libra</span>, just as in this case, there were a series of payments made by the company to a related creditor, Libra Holdings, over the course of a year. The liquidator challenged these payments on the basis that they were largely unaccounted with no details or particulars to explain them. The liquidator relied on the case of <span class="font-italic">Wills</span><span class="font-italic"> and another v Corfe Joinery Ltd (in liquidation)</span> [1998] 2 BCLC 75 (<span class="font-italic">“Wills</span>”) in which repayments to the insolvent company’s directors were found to be undue preferences as “there was no explanation given for making the repayments to the directors” (<span class="font-italic">Re Libra </span>at [45]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 Kan Ting Chiu J distinguished <span class="font-italic">Wills</span> on the basis that there was a valid commercial basis for the transfers. The records showed that the company had been making such payments to Libra Holdings over a substantial period in return for financial support or assistance which Libra Holding provided to the company. This support took the form of various payments of the company’s staff salaries as well as the purchase of raw materials required by the company. The court also accepted that the company would not have been able to carry out its business operation without the financial support of Libra Holdings (at [46]). Finally, the court took into account the fact that Libra Holdings was not repaid in full while other creditors were neglected (at [49]).

However, in examining this issue, it would be incomplete to examine only the cash transfers between the parties. It is common ground that Living’s retail business was entirely dependent on the financial support of its associate companies and Tina Tan. Although there was a net cash transfer of $2,885,174.35 from Living to Link, the debit notes issued by Link to Living over this same period indicate that Link supplied Living with inventory of approximately $2.9m in value and paid about $1.3m of Living’s operating expenses as follows:

</div> Clearly the repayments to the banks had to be made by the borrower – Link and not Living. Thus it is naïve for the liquidators to assert that the defence has not been established because no evidence was adduced to prove that Link would have ceased supporting Living’s retail business if Living had not made the cash transfers.  In essence, the liquidators appear to suggest that Link was expected to fund the acquisition of inventory for Living without getting any repayments in return. Such a structure is not only plainly contrary to the manner in which Living operated its retail business and was funded; it is also financially unworkable. The sale of the inventories was effected by Living as the retail outlet of the group. So in order for Link to supply Living with fresh inventories and pay the latter’s operating expenses, the transfer of funds from the sale proceeds by Living to Link on a regular basis would be expected in the ordinary course of business and as a matter of proper cash-flow management. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 Thus I am satisfied that the evidence does establish the existence of a running account between Living and Link, as there was in <span class="font-italic">Re Libra</span>, without which Living would not have been able to operate as a going concern in 2008. In making the cash payments, Living was acting solely by reference to proper commercial considerations rather than a desire to prefer Link as a creditor. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 In the circumstances, does it follow that Living has successfully rebutted the presumption in respect of <span class="font-italic">all</span> the cash transfers over the relevant period? As it must be recalled, I made an earlier finding that Living ceased its business following the transfers of the inventory to Link and Alldressedup at the end of 2008. That being the case, the decision to wind down Living’s business would have been made shortly before the end of the year. The evidence is inconclusive as to when exactly the decision was made. But this can be inferred by examining the payments which were made over the relevant period. I observe that there was no unusual spike in the payment amounts towards the end of 2008. The payments were fairly regular and were mostly supported by debit notes. Unlike <span class="font-italic">Progen</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>this was not a case where there had been a “one way traffic”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 I turn to the evidence of the cash payments and debit notes between Living and Link in the second half of 2008. As the table above (at [57]) shows, Link was still supplying Living with substantial inventory of over $100,000 per month up to November 2008. There was then a drastic drop in the amount of inventory supplied in December 2008, to $9,794.69, which indicates that the decision to wind down Living was, on balance, made sometime in December, after the last debit note dated 30 November 2008 was issued by Link to Living.

</div> In the bank statements and debit notes, the payments are briefly described as “FOR EXPENSES”, “FOR REPYMT OF LOAN”, and so on. Eleven transactions, including the sole payment by Link to Living, do not have any description at all. So there is simply insufficient evidence before this court for me to make a finding as to when in December 2008 the directors of Living made the decision to wind down the company. Thus there is no basis for me to hold that any of the December 2008 payments were made with the intention of obtaining new value, and the defendants have failed to rebut the presumption that these 23 payments were motivated by a desire to prefer Link as a creditor. Given this finding, the order should be to reverse<span class="font-italic"> all</span> the December 2008 payments from Living to Link <span class="font-italic">ie</span><span class="font-italic">,</span> $361,050 and not just the <span class="font-italic">net </span>payments.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Summary of findings on undue preference</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 In summary, the defendants have failed to rebut the statutory presumption in respect of the following transactions which are therefore set aside:</div><div class="mb-3"><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(a) Transfer of Graha shares to Link on 1 April 2009</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(b) Inventory transfers to Link and Alldressedup on 31 December 2008</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(c) Cash transfers to Link amounting to $361,050 for the month of December 2008</div></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Appropriate remedy and court’s powers </span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Reversal of undue preferences</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 While the values to be reversed in respect of the Graha shares, $120,000, and the December 2008 cash transfers, $361,050, are self-evident, the parties could not agree on the value to be reversed for the inventory transfers.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 Although the book value of the transferred inventory was reported at an aggregate amount of $2,627,785.40, it is not in dispute that most of the inventory has since been sold by Link.

When queried as to the current status of the unsold stock, the defendants were unable to provide a satisfactory explanation. The defendants submitted that the starting point for the amount to be reversed should be the sale proceeds of $2,035,595. The liquidators, on the other hand, urged me to use the aggregate book value of the inventory instead. As the defendants have not been able to account for the unsold inventory and the records indicate that the inventory which was actually sold did generate a profit over and above the book value, in my view, it would be fair to use the total book value of $2,627,785.40 as the base figure.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 Both parties are in agreement that deductions should be made from this amount to reflect the expenses, namely the rental and wage/staff costs, which Living would have incurred in retailing the inventory if the transfers had not taken place.

As the lease was terminated in July 2009, rental and wage/staff costs for the period from January to July 2009 should be deducted against the book value of the inventory.

For example in <span class="font-italic">In </span><span class="font-italic">Re Paramount Airways Ltd (in Administration)</span> [1993] 1 Ch 223, the English Court of Appeal held at 239 that, despite the use of the verb “shall” in the provision, the court has an overall discretion which is wide enough to enable the court to make <span class="font-italic">no order at all</span> “if justice so requires”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">73 The following dicta, also by the English Court of Appeal, in <span class="font-italic">Ramlort</span><span class="font-italic"> Ltd v Michael James Meston Reid</span> [2004] EWCA Civ 800 (at [125]) is instructive as well:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… [A]s a matter of general approach, in deciding what is the appropriate remedy where there has been transaction at an undervalue the Court does not start with the presumption in favour of monetary compensation as opposed to setting the transaction aside and reinvesting the asset transferred. <span class="font-italic">Indeed, in my judgement, in considering what is the appropriate remedy on the facts of any particular case the Court should not start from any priori </span><span class="font-italic">position. Each case will turn on its particular facts, and the task of the Court in every case is to fashion the most appropriate remedy with a view to restoring, so far as it is practicable and just to do so, the position as it “would have been if [the debtor] had not entered into the transaction”.</span> In some cases that remedy may take the form of reversing the transaction; in others it may not.

Such an order would avoid the potential harshness and unnecessary transactions costs resulting from the associate companies having to pay monies over to Living only for a substantial portion to become repayable to them after their Proofs of Debts are assessed.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">75 An analogy can perhaps be made with the cases on transactions at undervalue. The court’s remedial powers in dealing with undervalue transactions, under s 98(2) of the Bankruptcy Act, are exactly the same as those provided under s 99(2) for undue preferences. In this context, it is accepted that the court may, in appropriate cases, allow the defendant to retain the asset in return for a payment of the difference between the full value of the asset and the value which was in fact received by the company (see R Goode, <span class="font-italic">Principles of Corporate Insolvency Law </span>(Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 4th Ed, 2011) (“<span class="font-italic">Goode</span>”)<span class="font-italic"> </span>at para 13-46; <span class="font-italic">Pena v Coyne and another (No 2)</span> [2004] 2 BCLC 730 (<span class="font-italic">“Pena</span>”). The liquidators point out that such an order is distinguishable as it results in the company obtaining the <span class="font-italic">full</span> value of the asset, unlike the partial reversal proposed by the defendants in this case. Nevertheless, I find the analogy apposite as both orders involve the court necessarily sanctioning a wrongful transaction which ought not to have taken place, and look to the practical impact of the remedial order on the parties before the court. In a case where the court makes a partial reversal of a preferential transaction on the basis that the preferred creditor will <span class="font-italic">ultimately</span> be entitled to the remaining sums in any case, the company is <span class="font-italic">in reality</span> restored to the position it would be in if a full reversal is ordered. In such circumstances, it is hard to see how the other unsecured creditors will be prejudiced. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">76 The difficulty with this analysis, however, is that the court in making such an order will invariably have to undertake a projected calculation of the various claims and take into account imponderables such as the liquidators’ overall expenses. Crucially, in deciding on the partial amount to be reversed, the court will have to notionally adjudicate the competing Proofs of Debts of the company’s creditors which is properly the role of the liquidators. While this consideration did give me pause, I am of the view that this is a factor which goes towards the exercise of the court’s broad discretion under s 99(2) of the Bankruptcy Act and does not rule out the possibility that, in an appropriate case, the court may order a partial reversal of transactions found to be undue preferences if justice so requires. Such an order may be justified, for example, in clear cases where the parties’ claims are uncontroversial, or where there is an agreement between the preferred creditor and the liquidators as to the amount which ought to be set aside for the claims of the other unsecured parties (see <span class="font-italic">Pena</span> at [28]). In this case, the parties were not at <span class="font-italic">ad idem</span> as to the amount to be partially reversed should the court arrive at the view that it has the power to do so. Both parties’ calculations were premised on different base figures, and significantly did not provide for the liquidators’ costs and expenses. As it is quite clear that Cheong will not in any event achieve full recovery of its claim of $1,297,135.75 (see [8] above), a reversal in the sum of $2,053,878.31 may appear extravagant. Given the court’s determination of the precise sums to be reversed, and its consequential impact on the claims of the associate companies, the parties are thus invited to agree on a lesser sum to be reversed. In the absence of such an agreement, my order to reverse the full sum of $2,053,878.31 stands.           </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Breach of directors’ duties </span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Breach arising from undue preference</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">77 The law on the duties of a director in the eve of a company’s insolvency was authoritatively set out by VK Rajah JA in <span class="font-italic">Progen</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>(at [48]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">It is trite that directors have a duty to act in the best interest of the company as a whole. When a company is solvent, the company’s directors owe no duty to creditors. (See <span class="font-italic">Federal Express Pacific </span><span class="font-italic">Inc v Meglis Airfreight Pte Ltd (formerly known as Thong Soon Airfreight Pte Ltd)</span> [1998] SGHC 417 (“<span class="font-italic">Federal Express</span>”) at [17] where it was held that such a duty to consider creditors’ interests only arises during insolvency or in a state of near insolvency; and <span class="font-italic">Multinational Gas and Petrochemical Co v Multinational Gas and Petrochemical Services Ltd</span> [1983] Ch 258, applied in <span class="font-italic">Lexi</span><span class="font-italic"> Holdings plc (In Administration) v Luqman</span> [2007] EWHC 2652 (Ch); also see the observations in Kala Anandarajah, <span class="font-italic">Corporate Governance, Practice and Issues</span> (Academy Publishing, 2010) at p 275.) However, <span class="font-italic">it is now also settled law that when a company is insolvent, or even in a parlous financial position, directors have a fiduciary duty to take into account the interests of the company’s creditors when making decisions for the company. This fiduciary duty requires directors to ensure that the company’s assets are not dissipated or exploited for their own benefit to the prejudice of creditors’ interests. In this regard, the purpose of this duty mirrors that of the avoidance provisions in seeking to preserve the company’s assets for distribution to the company’s creditors through the mechanism of insolvency</span>. …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">78 In the present case, my finding that the transfers of the inventory and shares, as well as the cash payments to Link in December 2008 were undue preferences <span class="font-italic">ipso facto </span>leads to the conclusion that Tina Tan had breached her fiduciary duty to ensure that the company’s assets are not misapplied to the prejudice of creditors’ interests. The fact that the purpose of this duty mirrors that of the statutory avoidance provisions makes this inference practically inevitable in every case although I accept that there may be exceptional circumstances where a director may be found to have acted <span class="font-italic">bona fide </span>in the best interests of the company even though he or she might have procured an undue preference (see, for example, <span class="font-italic">Wilson v Masters International </span>at [91]–[95]). Here, however, as I have found that these transactions were procured by Tina Tan without a genuine belief that there were no other substantial creditors at the time, and that she was influenced by a desire to prefer the associate companies, it necessarily follows that she is in breach of her duties as Living’s director. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">79 The defendants submit that Tina Tan should nonetheless be excused under s 391 of the Companies Act. The provision empowers the court to grant relief if it is found that the defaulting director “has acted honestly and reasonably and that, having regard to all the circumstances of the case including those connected with his appointment, he ought fairly to be excused for the negligence, default or breach”. In support of this submission, they rely on factors such as the eventual payment of the rental to Cheong up to June 2009, the fact that Tina Tan ensured that Living’s other creditors were paid, and the personal losses which she has suffered as a result of Living’s failure as well as the adverse publicity following the commencement of the present proceedings.

</div> None of these factors, however, go towards showing that she had acted honestly and reasonably in procuring the transactions which I have found to be undue preferences. The payment of the rental to Cheong was late, incomplete and in any case, unrelated to the wrongful transfers. Similarly, the fact that Tina Tan ensured that the claims of Living’s other creditors were satisfied is also immaterial, particularly as these were mostly secured creditors who have recourse against Tina Tan, her husband and her mother under their personal guarantees and were only paid after exercising their security rights under the respective credit facilities.

</div> Finally, it is difficult to see how the personal losses suffered by Tina Tan indicate that her actions were honest and reasonable, especially as I have found that the transactions were influenced by a desire to prefer the associate companies of which she is a director and the sole shareholder. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">80 I also accept the liquidators’ case that Tina Tan, in procuring the undue preferences, was influenced by a desire to better her own position as a personal guarantor of the associate companies’ credit facilities with their banks as well. At the hearing, Tina Tan conceded that Link and Alldressedup were hard pressed by the banks in 2008 to settle their outstanding loans amounting to over $1.5m.

</div> Thus the conclusion that a desire to better her own position as a guarantor of these loans must have operated on Tina Tan’s mind in some form when she procured the undue preferences is irresistible. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">81 Hence I am not satisfied that this is a case where relief under s 391 of the Companies Act ought to be granted.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">What order, if any, should be made against Tina Tan?</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">82 The more vexing question is what order, if any, should be made against Tina Tan in her capacity as director for procuring the undue preferences. In <span class="font-italic">Progen</span>, while the Court of Appeal found that the company’s directors had committed clear and manifest breaches of their duties (at [53]), no orders were made against them personally, apart from an adverse costs order against one of the directors who was found to have made egregious misrepresentations to the court (at [70]). This however can be explained by the fact that the directors in <span class="font-italic">Progen</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>were not parties to the proceedings unlike Tina Tan who is a defendant in this matter. As noted in my introduction, to-date there is no reported decision by our courts on what orders can or should be made against the director as a defendant in such proceedings. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">83 The liquidators seek an order that Tina Tan be required to pay a sum equal in value to the undue preference transactions to Living. They rely on the English Court of Appeal’s decision in <span class="font-italic">Liquidator of West Mercia </span><span class="font-italic">Safetywear Ltd v Dodd and another </span>(1988) BCC 30 (“<span class="font-italic">West Mercia</span>”) which is the authority most often cited for the proposition that a director may be made personally liable for procuring an undue preference (see <span class="font-italic">Goode </span>at para 14-14; A Walters, “Preferences”<span class="font-italic"> </span>in J Armour and H Bennett, <span class="font-italic">Vulnerable Transactions in Corporate Insolvency</span> (Hart Publishing, 2003) ch 4 (“<span class="font-italic">Walters</span>”) at para 4.104). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">84 In <span class="font-italic">West Mercia</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>the director of the company, Mr Dodd, authorised a repayment of a debt of £4,000 owed to its parent company so as to reduce his own personal liability under a guarantee. The liquidators, instead of bringing an action for undue preference, brought direct proceedings against Mr Dodd for misfeasance and breach of fiduciary duty. At first instance, the liquidators’ claim failed on the basis that no assets of the company had been misapplied since the monies had been used merely to repay a debt of the company. The English Court of Appeal rejected this analysis and held that Mr Dodd was guilty of a breach of duty by causing the repayment to be made in disregard of the interests of the general creditors of the insolvent company. The question then arose as to the order to be made against him. It was held that “[<span class="font-italic">p</span>]<span class="font-italic">rima</span><span class="font-italic"> facie </span>the relief to be granted where money of the company has been misapplied by a director for his own ends is an order that he repay that money with interest” (at 33). The following order was consequently made on the facts:</div><div class="mb-3"><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(a) Mr Dodd was to repay the £4,000 to the company with interest;</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(b) the debt due from the company to the parent company was to be taken as notionally increased by the same amount to restore the position to what it would have been if there had not been an undue preference; and</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(c) any dividend attributable to the extra monies thus added back to the debt of the parent company was to be recouped to Mr Dodd rather than being paid to the parent company.</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">85 This order was seen as “a rough and ready way of achieving justice on both sides” as it ensured that the unsecured creditors did not receive a larger dividend than they would have otherwise obtained. Specifically, the order that the parent company’s dividend attributable to the repaid monies was to be paid to Mr Dodd instead ensured that the parent company, which was not itself ordered to make any repayment, would not be enriched at the expense of Mr Dodd. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">86 The liquidators also rely on the English High Court’s decision in <span class="font-italic">Kevin</span> <span class="font-italic">Hellard</span><span class="font-italic">, Devdutt Patel (in their capacity as the Joint Liquidators of HLC Environment Projects Ltd) v Horacio Luis De Brito Carvalho </span>[2013] EWHC 2876 (Ch) (“<span class="font-italic">Hellard</span>”) which applied <span class="font-italic">West Mercia</span>. In that case, the directors once again argued that where a payment has gone to reduce a genuine liability of a company, it has <span class="font-italic">ex </span><span class="font-italic">hypothesi</span> not suffered a loss. They sought to distinguish <span class="font-italic">West Mercia </span>on the basis that the payment in <span class="font-italic">West Mercia</span> was made to repay a debt which Mr Dodd had personally guaranteed and was “for his own end”. This was also the same argument raised by the defendants in their attempt to distinguish <span class="font-italic">West Mercia</span>. This argument was emphatically rejected, in my view rightly so, by John Randall QC (sitting as a Deputy High Court Judge). He held that <span class="font-italic">West Mercia </span>highlighted the width of the remedial powers the court has under s 212 of the UK Insolvency Act 1986 (formerly s 333 of the UK Companies Act 1948) and that there was no need for facts akin to a personal receipt by the director. The fact that the director may not have personally benefitted from the undue preference does not render it any less a breach. In any event, the evidence in this case indicates that Tina Tan did personally benefit from the undue preferences given to the associate companies as they were used to discharge bank loans secured by her personal guarantee. The court in <span class="font-italic">Hellard</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>also found that proof of loss to the company is not strictly required as a claim against a director in such circumstances is analogous to a claim against a trustee to restore a fund that he had misapplied (at [139]–[145]). Orders similar in terms to those made by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">West Mercia </span>were held to be <span class="font-italic">prima facie </span>appropriate (at [148]–[151]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">87 I find the reasoning adopted by the English courts in <span class="font-italic">West Mercia </span>and <span class="font-italic">Hellard</span> compelling. Holding a director who procures an undue preference directly responsible for restoring the company to the position it would otherwise have been in is not only just, but also in line with the clear direction of the Singapore Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Progen</span> that a director has a fiduciary duty to take into account the interests of the company’s creditors when a company is insolvent, or near insolvency, and that the purpose of this duty mirrors that of the statutory avoidance provisions. Finding otherwise would empty this duty of substance. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">88 Admittedly in both <span class="font-italic">West Mercia </span>and <span class="font-italic">Hellard</span> the only claims were those against the directors as the plaintiffs did not rely on the statutory provisions governing undue preferences. But I see no reason why a company should not be able to bring concurrent claims for both undue preference and breach of fiduciary duty as the liquidators have done in this case (see <span class="font-italic">Walters </span>at para 4.104). Although they concern the same subject matter, the two claims are clearly premised on distinct causes of action. This however is subject to the caveat, which I will return to below, that the courts must be slow in allowing the liquidator to employ the claim against the director as a means of circumventing the strict statutory criteria for an undue preference laid down by Parliament in the Bankruptcy Act (see <span class="font-italic">Knight v Frost and others </span>[1999] 1 BCLC 364 (“<span class="font-italic">Knight</span>”) at 381–382; <span class="font-italic">Re Continental Assurance Co of London </span><span class="font-italic">plc (in liquidation) (No 4); Singer and another v Beckett and others</span> [2007] 2 BCLC 287 at [420]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">89 Next, does it make any difference that the orders in <span class="font-italic">West Mercia </span>and <span class="font-italic">Hellard</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>were made under the UK statutory equivalent to s 341 of our Companies Act – a provision which the liquidators have neither pleaded nor relied upon in this case? In my view, it does not. Section 341 is derived from s 333 of the UK Companies Act 1948 (now s 212 of the UK Insolvency Act 1986) and allows the liquidator to bring misfeasance proceedings against delinquent officers of the company summarily and without trial. As has been held, the section does not create any new rights but only provides a summary mode of enforcing rights which apart from the section would have to be enforced by an ordinary action in the courts (see <span class="font-italic">Re </span><span class="font-italic">Kie Hock Shipping (1971) Pte Ltd</span> [1983–1984] SLR(R) 796 at [39]; <span class="font-italic">Law and Practice of Corporate Insolvency </span>(A Chan gen ed) (LexisNexis, 2014) at p 457). Thus the principles laid down in <span class="font-italic">West Mercia </span>and <span class="font-italic">Hellard</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>are equally applicable to this case. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">90 Accordingly I find that Tina Tan is liable to repay the sum of $2,053,878.31 to Living representing the total value of the undue preferences as calculated earlier (see [68] above). This liability is joint and several with the liability of the associate companies to repay this sum. Applying <span class="font-italic">West Mercia</span>, I also order that to the extent any repayments are made by Tina Tan personally rather than Link or Alldressedup, the dividend attributable to these monies added back to the debt of the associate companies are to be recouped to Tina Tan rather than paid to the associate companies. There is no need for me to order that the sum due to the associate companies be notionally increased to what it would have been had there been no undue preference as this necessarily follows from my setting aside of these transactions. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Breach arising from other claims</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Cash transfers outside the relevant period</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">91 Outside the relevant period, from 2 January 2008 to 12 May 2008, there was a net cash transfer of $980,000 from Living to Link. The liquidators submit that these payments were made in breach of Tina Tan’s fiduciary duties, essentially for the same reasons they claim the remaining payments made in 2008 were undue preferences. As I have found that the payments made throughout 2008, apart from those made in December 2008 prior to Living ceasing business, were a part of a legitimate series of mutual dealings under a running account between the two companies, it follows <span class="font-italic">a fortiori </span>that these earlier payments were legitimate as well. Hence, I find that Tina Tan did not breach her duties as a director in procuring these payments.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">92 Additionally, <span class="font-italic">even if</span> the evidence suggested that Living had been insolvent when these payments had been made and that Tina Tan had been influenced by a desire to prefer the associate companies in procuring them, it is likely that I still would not have found that she had breached her duties as a director in effecting these earlier payments. As I noted above, the courts must be slow in allowing the liquidator to circumvent the strict statutory criteria for an undue preference laid down in ss 99 and 100 of the Bankruptcy Act by bringing a claim directly against the director. In <span class="font-italic">West Mercia</span>, the payment in question was an undue preference made within the relevant statutory period prior to the commencement of a winding up. So the case is not authority for the proposition that a director who causes the company to prefer one of its creditors over another <span class="font-italic">outside</span> the statutory period is liable to replace the money at the suit of the company (see <span class="font-italic">Knight </span>at 382).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Personal expenses</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">93 The liquidators’ final claim concerns the personal expenses of Tina Tan and Lionel Leo, amounting to $41,738.80, which were reimbursed by Living between 1 May 2008 and 15 July 2009. It is submitted that these were not for the benefit of Living’s business and that Tina Tan breached her fiduciary duties in procuring them. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">94 The defendants’ defence that these expenses were incurred for the purpose of generating more business for Living and maintaining business relationships necessary for the conduct of its business in the fashion industry is untenable following my finding that Living had ceased operating on 31 December 2008 and that its retail business was transferred over to Living on that date (see [24] above). It follows that even if these reimbursements, which included payments for Tina Tan and Lionel Leo’s country club bills, hair salon charges and miscellaneous credit card bills, constituted legitimate business expenses, they would not have been for the benefit of Living. I also note that Living was insolvent both on a cash flow and balance sheet basis throughout this period. Hence, I find that Tina Tan did breach her fiduciary duties to Living in procuring the reimbursement of these personal expenses.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">95 Again, there is no basis for me to find that Tina Tan had acted honestly and reasonably in effecting these payments which were made after the decision to wind down Living was reached in December 2008. Thus relief under s 391 of the Companies Act is equally inappropriate for this claim.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">96 As these reimbursements were not for the benefit of Living, this was a misapplication of the company’s assets which Tina Tan is liable to restore. She is thus to repay the sum of $41,738.80 to Living.   </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">97 In summary, these are my findings and orders in this case:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The cash payments made by Living to Link from 2 January 2008 to 30 November 2008 were part of a series of legitimate dealings under a mutually beneficial running account between the companies. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The transfers of the inventory to Link and Alldressedup on 31 December 2008, the transfer of the Graha shares to Link on 1 April 2009, and the cash payments of $361,050 made to Link in December 2008 are set aside as undue preferences. To reverse these transactions, Link and Alldressedup are to repay to Living the sums of $1,253,079.02 and $800,799.29 respectively.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Tina Tan did breach her fiduciary duties as a director of Living in procuring the above transactions and is liable to repay the total sum of $2,053,878.31 to Living. This liability is joint and several with the liability of the associate companies to repay the sums stated above, and to the extent any payments are made by Tina Tan personally rather than Link or Alldressedup, the dividend attributable to these monies added back to the debt of the associate companies are to be recouped to Tina Tan rather than paid to the associate companies. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) Tina Tan also breached her fiduciary duties by effecting the reimbursement of the personal expenses of herself and Lionel Leo in 2009. She is thus to repay the value of these reimbursements totalling $41,738.80 to Living. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">98 Costs should follow the event. The trial, including oral submissions, was heard over five and a half days, with two rounds of written submissions exchanged. Seven amendments were made to the Defence and Counterclaim and, as noted at [13] above, several defences were abandoned in the course of the trial.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">99 Taking into account these factors, and the fact that the liquidators did not succeed in reversing all the impugned transactions, I order the defendants to pay the liquidators’ costs which I fix at $180,000, plus reasonable disbursements to be agreed if not taxed. For the avoidance of doubt, the defendants are jointly and severally liable for the costs so ordered.</div><div class="Judg-Sign text-left">Steven Chong<br/>Judge</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Suresh Sukumaran Nair and Tan Tse Hsien, Bryan (Advocatus Law LLP) for the plaintiffs;<br/>Tan Kheng Ann Alvin and Lo Ying Xi, John (Wong Thomas &amp; Leong) for the defendants.</div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
