</strong>
</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font color="#800000"><strong><u>GROUNDS OF DECISION</u></strong></font></p>
<i xmlns="">
<p align="justify">Introduction</p></i><font face="CG Times (W1),Times New Roman" xmlns="">
<p align="justify">         The appellant was

convicted on one charge of criminal breach of trust under s 408 of the Penal Code, Cap

224. He appealed against his conviction and sentence. I dismissed his appeal and now give

my reasons. </p>
</font><i xmlns="">
<p align="justify">Background</p></i><font face="CG Times (W1),Times New Roman" xmlns="">
<p align="justify">2        The appellant was the

finance administration manager of Stoval Technologies (‘Stoval’). He had two

other staff and a part-time assistant under him as well as the Human Resource Department

to support him. He was placed in charge of the petty cash account in August 2000 when

Karen, one of Stoval’s accounts executives, resigned. He remained in charge of the

petty cash account until he resigned in December 2000. </p>
<i>
<p align="justify">Prosecution’s case</p></i>
<p align="justify">3        In early December 2000, a

new accounting software was installed at Stoval. As a result, Choo Len, another of

Stoval’s accounts executives, discovered some discrepancies in the petty cash

account. She informed Alex, the chief executive officer and managing director of Stoval. </p>
<p align="justify">4        Choo Len was then

instructed to verify the problem. Upon receiving confirmation that there were indeed

discrepancies, Alex confronted the appellant. The appellant immediately told Alex that he

was resigning and handed over a hand-written resignation letter. </p>
<p align="justify">5        Thereupon, Alex asked that

the appellant hand over the petty cash account to another member of his staff. A few hours

later, the appellant prepared a four-page statement of accounts for the petty cash account

which showed a positive balance of $1012.68. After deducting some transportation payments,

there was a balance of $984.56. However, this balance was missing and the appellant

proposed that the company deduct it from his salary. </p>
</font>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">6        Alex did not accept the

appellant’s proposal and appointed Kelvin, an accountant, to check the statement of

accounts. By early 2001, Kelvin discovered that there was in the statement of accounts a

S$10,000 payment voucher that was not approved or signed by any of Stoval’s

directors. In addition, there was also a S$5,000 cheque due and payable into the petty

cash account which was not reflected in the statement of accounts prepared by the

appellant. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">7        The matter was referred to

Stoval’s board of directors who decided that a police report should be made. Kelvin

then made a police report which resulted in the appellant’s arrest. </p>
<i xmlns="">
<p align="justify">The appellant’s defence</p></i><font face="CG Times (W1),Times New Roman" xmlns="">
<p align="justify">8        The appellant, in his

defence, admitted that there was a shortfall of $15,000 in the petty cash account. He

denied however that he had taken the money. He claimed that the shortfall had arisen

because he had been too busy to update the petty cash account on a daily basis and thus

there were petty cash payments which had been made but had not been recorded. </p>
<p align="justify">9        The appellant further

claimed that he had been forced to resign by Alex as a result of his having informed

Johnny, another of Stoval’s directors, that Alex had withdrawn $200,000 from the

company’s funds. Furthermore, the appellant claimed that he had been allowed by Alex

to take the balance in the petty cash account for his personal expenses. </p>
<i>
<p align="justify">Decision below</p></i>
<p align="justify">10        At the conclusion of the

case, the trial judge accepted the evidence given by the prosecution’s witnesses as

she found them to be straightforward and truthful and their evidence to be consistent and

corroborated. In comparison, she rejected the appellant’s defence as she found the

appellant to be evasive and untruthful. </p>
<p align="justify">11        In addition, she found

that the appellant had fabricated evidence to support his allegations that monies had been

paid out which clearly demonstrated his dishonest intention to conceal his conversion of

the missing sums. She thus convicted the appellant on the charge. </p>
<p align="justify">12        In passing sentence, the

trial judge took into account the appellant’s lack of antecedents, the quantum of

money involved, the appellant’s attempts to cover up his misdeeds and his lack of

remorse or restitution and sentenced him to a term of imprisonment of 14 months. </p></font><i xmlns="">
<p align="justify">Appeal against conviction</p></i><font face="CG Times (W1),Times New Roman" xmlns="">
<p align="justify">13        The appeal against

conviction turned entirely on the trial judge’s finding that the appellant had

dishonestly misappropriated or converted the petty cash to his own use. In particular, the

appellant challenged the findings of the trial judge that:</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">(a) the prosecution witnesses’ evidence was consistent;</p>
<p align="justify">(b) the appellant had resigned after being confronted by Alex;</p>
<p>(c)    the balance in the petty cash account was missing; and</p>
<p>(d)    the omission of the two cheques in the statement of accounts was

    deliberate.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">14        Lastly, the appellant also

appealed against his sentence as being manifestly excessive.</p>
</font><i xmlns="">
<p align="justify">The law on an appeal against findings of fact</p></i>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">15        It is trite law that an

appellate court should be slow to overturn the trial judge’s findings of fact, in

particular where these findings depend on an assessment of the credibility and veracity of

the various witnesses, unless these findings can be shown to be plainly wrong or against

the weight of the evidence. </p>
<font face="CG Times (W1),Times New Roman" xmlns="">
<p align="justify">16        I have previously stated

this in <i>PP v Azman bin Abdullah </i><a class="remove" href1="/scripts/lp/dll/prospect.dll?GetHTML_lpqs&amp;type=1&amp;CaseID=46369&amp;freetext=" target="LWBMainFrame">(1998) 2 SLR 704</a><i> </i>and it bears remembering

that:</p></font><font face="CG Times (W1),Times New Roman" size="3" xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">It is well-settled law that in any appeal against a finding of fact, an

    appellate court will generally defer to the conclusion of the trial judge who has had the

    opportunity to see and assess the credibility of the witnesses. An appellate court, if it

    wishes to reverse the trial judge’s decision, must not merely entertain doubts

    whether the decision is right but must be convinced that it is wrong.</p>
</blockquote></blockquote></font><font face="CG Times (W1),Times New Roman" xmlns="">
<p align="justify">17        With this in mind, I will

now examine the arguments raised at appeal.</p>
</font><i xmlns="">
<p align="justify">(a)    Whether the prosecution witnesses’ evidence

was consistent</p></i>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">18        The appellant sought to

raise several inconsistencies in the prosecution witnesses’ evidence to rebut the

trial judge’s finding that their evidence was consistent. However, I found that the

inconsistencies that the appellant sought to rely on in his appeal were minor and did not

affect the crux of the case against the appellant. In contrast, I found that the

appellant’s testimony was riddled with material inconsistencies. For example, the

appellant indicated that the missing money could have been payments to major big

suppliers; yet, when questioned, he was unable to name any such suppliers. </p>
<font face="CG Times (W1),Times New Roman" xmlns=""><i>
<p align="justify">(b)    Whether the appellant had resigned after being

confronted by Alex;</p></i>
<p align="justify">19        The appellant challenged

this finding on the basis that it was inherently improbable that he would become so

unhappy as to resign, merely because Alex had questioned him about the petty cash account.

I was unable to accept this contention. Instead, common sense dictated to me that, rather

than being inherently improbable, the appellant’s immediate resignation was strongly

indicative of his guilty conscience and his desire to depart immediately from the scene of

the crime. </p>
<p align="justify">20        Furthermore, I found the

appellant’s explanation for his resignation difficult to accept. He was unable to

show why Alex would have been so displeased, as to demand his resignation, over the minor

matter of the appellant informing Johnny about the cashing of the cheque when there was no

evidence that there was anything improper about the transaction. </p>
<i>
<p align="justify">(c)    Whether the balance in the petty cash account was

missing</p></i></font>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">21        The appellant argued that

this finding was against common sense because, if this was true, Alex would simply not

have allowed the appellant to leave. I found this argument to be without merit. On the

facts, the appellant had left only after agreeing for the company to deduct the balance

owing from his salary. As such, there was no reason why Alex would not have let him leave.

Furthermore, Alex had wanted to conduct further investigations into the petty cash account

and this would clearly have been easier without the appellant being present. </p>
<font face="CG Times (W1),Times New Roman" xmlns="">
<p align="justify">22        As for the

appellant’s story of being allowed to take the monies in the petty cash account, I

was plainly incredulous. It was inconceivable that Alex would have allowed the appellant

to have taken the entire amount remaining in the petty cash account, thereby emptying out

the entire petty cash account to the possible detriment of Stoval. This conclusion was

reinforced when viewed against the backdrop of the events which had led Alex to confront

the accused in the first place. </p>
<i>
<p align="justify">(d)    Whether the omission of the two cheques in the

statement of accounts was deliberate</p></i>
<p align="justify">23        The appellant repeated his

arguments that he had used in the Court below that his omission was the result of

negligence. Like the trial judge, I found this argument to be of little merit. The

appellant was an experienced accountant with about 25 years of experience. It was

unimaginable that he would be so overworked as to not have the time to maintain the petty

cash account given that it was not a difficult task involving only the preparation of

payment vouchers and getting them either approved or signed. Furthermore, there was no

supporting evidence that any other aspect of financial management was similarly ignored by

the appellant. </p>
<p align="justify">24        As such, given the ample

evidence supporting the trial judge’s finding of facts, I found no reason to

interfere with any of the trial judge’s findings or her conclusion that the appellant

had dishonestly misappropriated or converted the monies in the petty cash account to his

own use. </p></font><i xmlns="">
<p align="justify">Appeal as to sentence</p></i><font face="CG Times (W1),Times New Roman" xmlns="">
<p align="justify">25        The appellant first argued

that the trial judge had wrongly taken into account the fact that he had claimed trial and

cited <i>Kuek Ah Lek v PP </i><a class="remove" href1="/scripts/lp/dll/prospect.dll?GetHTML_lpqs&amp;type=1&amp;CaseID=9497&amp;freetext=" target="LWBMainFrame">(1995) 3 SLR 252</a><i> </i>in support. </p>
<p align="justify">26        I found the

appellant’s argument to be flawed. The case of <i>Kuek Ah Lek</i> does not stand for

the proposition that the Court can never take into account the fact that the appellant had

claimed trial. Rather it indicates that where the appellant claims trial for a valid

reason such as a viable defence, he should not be prejudiced for doing so. </p>
<p align="justify">27        However, in this appeal,

the situation was different. The appellant had subjected the prosecution witnesses to an

exhaustive and extensive cross examination in a failed attempt to find supporting

evidence. In addition, he even accused one of the prosecution witness of wrongdoing. In

view of such a defence, it must have been correct for the Court to take into account the

fact that he had claimed trial. </p>
<p align="justify">28        Secondly, the appellant

sought to draw from <i>Soong Hee Sin v PP </i><a class="remove" href1="/scripts/lp/dll/prospect.dll?GetHTML_lpqs&amp;type=1&amp;CaseID=61084&amp;freetext=" target="LWBMainFrame">(2001) 2 SLR 253</a>,<i> </i>a case where the

accused was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of nine months, a sentencing tariff to

illustrate that the sentence was manifestly excessive. I found that this argument did not

lend much strength to his appeal. The process of sentencing is a matter of law that

involves manifold factors such that no two cases would ever be totally identical for the

purposes of sentencing. Thus, while past cases are clearly helpful in providing guidelines

for the Court, that is all that they are, mere guidelines. In sentencing the offender, the

Court must look to each case on its unique facts. </p>
<p align="justify">29        In any case, <i>Soong Hee

Sin</i> can be easily distinguished. First, that was a case in which the accused

misappropriated a lesser sum of S$10,485.22 as opposed to S$15,000 in the present appeal.

Secondly, the accused there had pleaded guilty immediately. </p>
<p align="justify">30        Lastly, I noted that in

mitigation, it could only be said of the appellant that he had no previous antecedents.

This factor while normally forceful must be balanced against the numerous aggravating

factors such as the appellant’s failure to make restitution, his lack of remorse

throughout the entire trial and the fact that he had fabricated evidence in an attempt to

escape liability. </p>
<p align="justify">31        As such, I found that the

sentence imposed was not manifestly excessive especially when all the factors were

collectively taken into consideration. </p>
</font><i xmlns="">
<p align="justify">Conclusion</p></i>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">32        For the reasons given

above, I was of the opinion that there was no merit in the appeal. Thus the appeal against

conviction and sentence was dismissed and the sentence imposed by the trial judge was

affirmed. </p>
