At the material time, he was conducting anti-littering enforcement duties in the Chinatown area, accompanied by PW2 Tay Kwang Hong (“PW2 Tay”) and PW3 Brenda Tan Wei Nee (“PW3 Brenda”), who were also NEA officers (collectively, “the NEA officers”). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">6 The evidence adduced at the trial may be summarised as follows. The NEA officers testified that on 29 January 2018, at or about 6.15pm, they saw the appellant throw a cigarette butt on the floor before walking into a restaurant along Mosque Street. They approached the appellant inside the restaurant, where he was dining and drinking with his client. One or more of them identified themselves as enforcement officers from the NEA by showing their authority cards to him, informed him of his littering offence and asked him to step out of the restaurant.

Re-examining the undisputed and uncontroversial facts, the NEA officers had identified themselves as law enforcement officers and informed the appellant that he was spotted littering. They flashed their authority cards, but the appellant refused to show them his NRIC. They called the police and asked the appellant to wait with them for the police to arrive.

</div> The appellant had after all lived in Singapore for some two decades. He ought to be reasonably familiar with local norms. It was reasonable to expect that he should be aware that not all enforcement officers are uniformed officers, even if it might not be reasonable to expect an ordinary person to be aware that the NEA was the agency in charge of littering enforcement. If he had indeed been highly suspicious of the NEA officers, he could have easily sought to verify that they were indeed public servants, but he never did so at any point. If he had harboured real doubts or fears that he was being scammed or kidnapped, the natural and obvious reaction would have been to notify the police immediately or to seek assistance from other persons in the vicinity. He did not do so. Instead, he decided to “play with them”

More so, an ordinary person in the appellant’s position would not have harboured such an irrational belief that he was being scammed and kidnapped, or to have theorised that his best defence was to lead them on a wild goose chase based on a trumped-up tale of being a tourist staying at the Marriott Hotel.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 I accepted that the DJ correctly found that there was no reasonable doubt as to whether the appellant knew (or ought to have known) that the NEA officers were public servants executing duties as such.

The appellant’s claim also completely glossed over PW1 Wyatt’s unwavering evidence that no collision with any passer-by had taken place along Paterson Road, but one did occur at a different location nearer to Far East Plaza and just before Goodwood Park Hotel. PW2 Tay’s evidence corroborated this. The appellant submitted that the collision with the said passer-by might have caused PW1 Wyatt to be confused with an alleged push by the appellant. This was entirely speculative, and the appellant had in fact conceded that he did not personally witness the collision, but this was merely his “theoretical analysis” of what could have happened.

</div> he certainly had the presence of mind to devise various ways to try to give the NEA officers the slip. The fundamental premise of the appellant’s reliance on his acute stress reaction was that his actions were driven by his irrational perceptions. While it would appear that he acted spontaneously, his actions were not purely haphazard or random. His pushing of PW1 Wyatt was not done in a momentary lapse of judgment. Rather, it was the culmination of his efforts to get away from the NEA officers. Moreover, it was more plausible that he had asked his wife to call the police and the Chinese Embassy to bolster his false claim that there were bogus officers out to scam or kidnap him, rather than face up to the fact that he had endeavoured to evade enforcement action.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 Secondly, I was of the view that the DJ had properly applied the framework in <span class="font-italic">Aw Soy Tee v P</span><span class="font-italic">ublic Prosecutor </span>[2020] 5 SLR 453 (“<span class="font-italic">Aw Soy Tee</span>”) (at [30]) to the present case. It was not disputed that this case fell within Category 1 of the sentencing framework enumerated in <span class="font-italic">Aw Soy Tee</span>. In assessing the harm and culpability of an offender, courts may have regard to the factors enumerated in <span class="font-italic">Yeo </span><span class="font-italic">Ek Boon Jeffrey</span> at [60]. In the present case, the appellant had clearly caused harm. His offence resulted in PW1 Wyatt falling to the ground and suffering some pain in his back. In the case of <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v</span> <span class="font-italic">Loh</span><span class="font-italic"> Chee Wah</span> [2020] SGDC 221, the court observed that for s 353 of the Penal Code offences, where there is a direct physical act, for example, a push, the typical sentencing range is between three to five weeks’ imprisonment (at [132]). The NEA officers were also clearly obstructed from carrying out their duties due to the appellant’s non-compliance. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 Furthermore, there were several culpability-enhancing factors. The appellant had demonstrated contempt for authority, lying to the NEA officers about his citizenship status and leading them on a protracted chase from Chinatown to the Orchard area in a prolonged effort to evade enforcement action.

However, as the DJ rightly found, these cases were distinguishable from the present case. In both cases, the accused persons had pleaded guilty. In the case of <span class="font-italic">An </span><span class="font-italic">Heejung, </span>the accused was not a habitual drinker and he had no recollection of the events of the material time as he was highly inebriated. The court assessed that he had acted “completely out of his character” and that what had occurred was a one-off isolated incident (at [29]). In the case of <span class="font-italic">Shalaan</span>, there was no deliberate defiance of authority as the accused had pushed the police officer in the middle of a heated fight which the accused person was attempting to break up (at [26] and [38]). He was not attempting to evade apprehension. Both the harm and culpability in the present case were considerably higher, as he had not only pushed PW1 Wyatt with sufficient force to cause him to fall to the ground, but he had also consciously acted in prolonged contempt of the NEA officers’ authority. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 Accordingly, I agreed with the DJ that the custodial threshold was crossed in this case. As there were no significant mitigating factors, I was not persuaded that the sentence of four weeks’ imprisonment was manifestly excessive. The appellant had clearly intended to lead the NEA officers on a time-wasting trip from Chinatown to Orchard Road and thereafter in the direction of the NEA building, where he could easily have lodged a complaint or sought to verify their identities. The fact that he was told that the NEA officers had called the police and were apparently prepared to follow him all the way to the NEA building should also have informed him that they could not possibly have been scammers or kidnappers.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 In conclusion, I agreed with the DJ’s findings that the appellant’s actions were all part of his planned intent to evade enforcement action. I did not see any reason to interfere with the DJ’s decision to impose a one-week uplift to the indicative sentence of three weeks’ imprisonment. The appeals against conviction and sentence were therefore dismissed.</div><table class="table table-sm table-borderless"><tbody><tr><td><div class="txt-body text-left">See Kee Oon<br/>Judge of the High Court</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-left"></div></td></tr></tbody></table><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Foo Yu Kang Wilson (Fervent Chambers LLC) for the appellant and applicant;</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Niranjan Ranjakunalan (Attorney-General’s Chambers) for the respondent. </div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
