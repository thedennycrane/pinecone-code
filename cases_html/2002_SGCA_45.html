        This was an appeal against a decision of the

High Court refusing the plaintiff-appellants’ application for a Mareva injunction.

The action related to a claim for the loss suffered by the appellants on account of damage

to cargo due to a fire on board a vessel of the respondents. We heard the appeal on 12

September 2002 and allowed it. We granted a Mareva injunction in respect of the proceeds

from the sale of a specific asset. We now give our reasons.</font></p>
<b xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font color="#000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">The facts</font></p>
</b>
<p xmlns=""><font color="#000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">2

        The appellants were the lawful holders of two

bills of lading, No. 01/PRT/PL/VII/01 and No. 02/PRT/PL/VII/01, dated 13 July 2001. The

bills related to the carriage of a cargo of cocoa beans of a total weight of 609 m/t on

board the vessel "PRATIWI" from Palu, Indonesia to Pasir Gudang, Johore. The

appellants were the buyers of the cargo. The defendant-respondents were the owners of the

vessel "PRATIWI".</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font color="#000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">3

        Foong Sun Shipping (Pte) Ltd (Foong Sun) were

the respondents’ agents and managers of the vessel. The bills of lading for this

cargo were in Foong Sun’s standard form. The appellants had business dealings with

Foong Sun from early 2001.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font color="#000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">4

        On 17 July 2001 a fire occurred on board the

vessel. It started at the engine room. After the fire was put out, the vessel was towed to

Banjarmasin, Indonesia. The fire so badly damaged the vessel that eventually it was

declared a constructive total loss and had to be sold for scrap for only S$50,000. No

insurance had been taken out in respect of its hull and machinery though there was a

policy with China Insurance for third party liability for up to $500,000.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font color="#000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">5

        The cargo of cocoa beans was then transferred

to another vessel "SUN RAY" which carried it to Pasir Gudang. Unfortunately, the

cargo was found on arrival to have also been damaged by the fire. It was eventually

disposed of in a salvage sale, causing the appellants a loss that was subsequently

quantified at $904,164.22. In October 2001, the appellants had made a claim against the

respondents for the loss, without stating a specific sum. On 31 October 2001, the

respondents denied liability. </font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font color="#000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">6

        The appellants had insured the cargo with

Malaysian Assurance Alliance Bhd (MAA). The appellants notified Foong Sun that they would

be submitting their claim for the loss to MAA. But on 10 April 2002, MAA informed the

appellants that MAA would be repudiating liability because there was a breach of the

policy. The appellants informed Foong Sun of this development and thereafter, the

appellants’ Finance and Trading Manager, Mr Hia Cheng, discussed the situation with

the Manager of Foong Sun, Ms Elaine Quek. Both expressed a wish to resolve the matter

amicably.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font color="#000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">7

        On 16 May 2002 the appellants’ solicitors

made a claim of RM1,948,253 against China Insurance under their third party policy issued

to the respondents. This communication was copied to Foong Sun.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font color="#000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">8

        On 18 June 2002, China Insurance denied

liability through its solicitors, M/s Kenneth Tan Partnership (KTP), on the ground that

the fire started without the fault of the owners. On the same day, the appellants’

solicitors directed the claim of the appellants to the respondents. The appellants also

asked Foong Sun’s solicitors, KTP, for details of the owners of the PRATIWI,

including its country of incorporation, registered address and assets. The details were

not furnished.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font color="#000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">9

        The appellants instituted this action on 12

July 2002. Their claim was based on breach of contract and, in the alternative, on

negligence. At the time, the searches carried out by the appellants indicated that the

"PRATIWI" was owned by the respondents who had the same address as Foong Sun did

and that the vessel’s previous name was "TAKATORI". Neither the

respondents, nor Foong Sun, informed the appellants that the respondents also owned

another vessel, the "LANGSA". </font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font color="#000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">10

        In the meantime, on 22 June 2002, unbeknown to

the appellants, the respondents had sold the "LANGSA". On 17 July 2002 the

appellants learned, from discreet enquiries with the staff of Foong Sun, that the

"LANGSA" had changed her name to "SRI BAHARI". However, subsequent

searches on the "SRI BAHARI" carried out by Lloyds’ Marine Intelligence

Unit in England, Harper Wira Insurance Surveyors &amp; Adjusters in Malaysia and Seabird

Consultants of Singapore, on behalf of the appellants did not bring forth consistent

results. Harper Wira reported that the vessel’s owner was Foong Sun, whereas Seabird

Consultants learned that it was PT Pelayaran Fajar Sribahari SAK. Furthermore, both

Seabird Consultants and Lloyds Marine Intelligence Unit could not confirm whether the

"LANGSA" had changed its name to "SRI BAHARI"</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font color="#000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">11

        On 26 July 2002 the appellants’ solicitors

wrote to the respondents’ solicitors, KTP, seeking confirmation that the respondents

were still trading. There was no response.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font color="#000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">12

        On 29 July 2002, the appellants sought a

world-wide Mareva injunction against the assets of the respondents, including the LANGSA

and the sale proceeds of the "PRATIWI". The application came before the

judge-in-chambers on 2 August 2002 who refused it. Thereafter, the appellants asked for

further arguments and confined their application to only the vessel "LANGSA" or

its proceeds. On 8 August 2002, the judge certified that she would not require further

arguments.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font color="#000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">13

        In the court below, the respondents raised only

one ground to resist the application, i.e., that the appellants had not shown that there

was any real risk of dissipation of assets. The judge held that there was no "solid

evidence" of any risk of dissipation to satisfy the court that a Mareva injunction

should be granted over assets in Singapore, much less to pounce on the respondents’

assets worldwide. The fact that the respondents were a Panamanian company and only owned

the vessel "LANGSA" and no others, did not necessarily mean that an injunction

should be granted. Before us, the main issue was again whether the real risk of

dissipation test had been satisfied.</font></p>
<b xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font color="#000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">Real risk of

dissipation</font></p>
</b>
<p xmlns=""><font color="#000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">14

        There was a suggestion that as the appellants

had shipped cargoes on board the LANGSA previously, they would have known that it belonged

to the respondents. We were unable to follow the logic of this contention. The appellants

did not deal with the respondents but with Foong Sun who managed the LANGSA and issued its

own form of bill of lading. A ship’s manager cum agent could be handling the vessels

of many owners. The appellants said that they did not know who the owners of the LANGSA

were. There was no evidence that the shippers of goods would normally check on the

ownership of a vessel. It was only after the fire had occurred on the PRATIWI and when

further searches on the Lloyds’ Register of Ships Supplement &amp; New Entries

July/August 2001 and May/June 2002 were made, that it was discovered that the respondents

also owned the LANGSA. Upon this discovery, the writ issued earlier was, on 16 July 2002,

amended to include the LANGSA.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font color="#000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">15

        The appellants relied in the main upon the

following facts and circumstances to contend that there was a real risk of dissipation:-</font>
</p><ol xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font color="#000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">(i)

        The timing of the sale of the LANGSA. In assessing the significance of

    this timing, the following two dates must be kept in mind. In April 2002 the appellants

    informed the respondents that the insurers of the cargo had repudiated liability. Then on

    18 June 2002, China Insurance informed the appellants that they denied liability for the

    claim. Thus, the matter could not be resolved amicably. Four days later, on 22 June 2002,

    the respondents executed the bill of sale of their only asset, the LANGSA, through their

    agents, Foong Sun. No reason was offered as to why the respondents had to dispose of that

    asset. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font color="#000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">(ii)

        The bill of sale stated that the price had been paid. Admittedly, in

    Elaine Quek’s affidavit she stated that the payment had not yet been received. But

    the question was, why did the bill of sale state something which was not true? Was there

    anything behind that? These were queries which any fair minded individual, viewing the

    situation, would naturally have raised. Answers should have been provided. Yet none was

    forthcoming.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font color="#000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">(iii)

        The respondents were no longer carrying on business, having sold their

    only asset, the LANGSA.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font color="#000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">(iv)

        The respondents were evasive about their country of incorporation,

    registered office address, assets and other matters;</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font color="#000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">(v)

        The proceeds of sale of the LANGSA, being cash, could easily be

    disposed of or dissipated.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font color="#000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">(vi)

        The respondents were incorporated in Panama, a country with whom

    Singapore had no arrangement for the reciprocal enforcement of judgments.</font></p>

        It is settled law that an appellate

court’s function in relation to the judge’s exercise of discretion in granting

or refusing to grant an interlocutory relief is only one of review and not to exercise an

independent discretion of its own. In the words of Lord Diplock in <i>Hadmor Productions

    discretion differently. The function of the appellate court is initially one of review

    only. It may set aside the judge’s exercise of his discretion on the ground that it

    was based upon a misunderstanding of the law or of the evidence before him or upon an

    inference that particular facts existed or did not exist which, although it was one that

<p xmlns=""><font color="#000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">17

        There are two main requirements which a

plaintiff must satisfy before a court will grant a Mareva injunction. The first is that

the plaintiff must have a "good arguable case". The respondents did not raise

any argument in relation to this requirement. Their arguments centred wholly on the second

requirement, which is that there is a real risk of dissipation of assets or, in the words

of the Court of Appeal in <i>Ninemia Maritime Corporation v Trave Schiffahrtsgesellschaft

Gmb H</i> [1983] 1 WLR 1412 at 1422 <i>("The Niedersachsen")</i> the test is

whether "the refusal of Mareva injunction would involve a real risk that a judgment

or award in favour of the plaintiffs would remain unsatisfied" and this is an

objective test. The court is not concerned with motive or purpose as opposed to effect: <i>Felixstowe

Dock &amp; Rly Co v United States Lines Ltd</i> [1989] QB 360. There is no need to show an

intention to dissipate assets: see <i>The Niedersachsen</i>. </font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font color="#000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">18

        Clearly, mere assertion that there is a risk of

dissipation is not good enough. There must be some "solid evidence" to

substantiate the alleged risk. In the words of Mustill J in <i>The Niedersachsen </i>[1984] 1 All ER 398, whose judgment was upheld on appeal, (at p.406):-</font>
</p><ol xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font color="#000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">It is not enough

    for the plaintiff to assert a risk that the assets will be dissipated. He must demonstrate

    this by solid evidence This evidence may take a number of different forms. It may consist

    of direct evidence that the defendant has previously acted in a way which shows that his

    probity is not to be relied on. Or the plaintiff may show what type of company the

    defendant is (where it is incorporated, what are its corporate structure and assets, and

    so on) so as to raise an inference that the company is not to be relied on. Or again, the

    plaintiff may be able to found his case on the fact that inquiries about the

    characteristics of the defendant have led to a blank wall. Precisely, what form the

    evidence may take will depend on the particular circumstances of the case. But the

    evidence must always be there."</font></p>
</blockquote>
</ol>
<p xmlns=""><font color="#000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">19

        As is apparent from what Mustill J said, the

hard question in each case is to determine whether the evidence adduced is sufficient to

establish that there is a real risk of dissipation. It is practically impossible to lay

down any general guidelines on how the evidential burden could be held to have been

fulfilled. But the evidence must reasonably have a bearing on the risk factor. In our

opinion, a good piece of evidence would be where the defendant, for no sufficient reason,

starts to put his property up for sale or where a company just ceases business.</font></p>

</b>
<p xmlns=""><font color="#000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">21

        It appeared to us clear that the following

factors were not given sufficient consideration by the court below in refusing the grant

of a Mareva injunction:-</font>
</p><ol xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font color="#000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">(i)

        The sale on 22 June 2002 of the only vessel, LANGSA, owned by the

    respondents.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font color="#000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">(ii)

        The respondents had ceased business.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font color="#000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">(iii)

        The false statement in the bill of sale that the proceeds had been

    paid.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font color="#000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">(iv)

        The respondents are a company incorporated in Panama, a country with

    whom Singapore has no arrangement on reciprocal enforcement of judgment.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font color="#000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">(v)

        The proceeds of sale of the LANGSA when eventually received could be

    easily dissipated or removed out of Singapore.</font></p>
</blockquote>
</ol>
<p xmlns=""><font color="#000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">22

        In our judgment, these facts constituted

"solid evidence" indicating that there was a real risk of dissipation. We

recognised that each of these factors, on its own, would not necessarily indicate a real

risk. An example would be where a defendant was a foreign company. That fact <i>per se</i>

could not be a ground to allege that there would be a real risk of dissipation. A

plaintiff who entered into a commercial arrangement with a foreign entity would have

realized that he would encounter certain inconvenience in enforcing the contract or a

judgment. That would be the normal order of things. But when one were to take this factor,

together with the other factors enumerated above into account, the picture could well be

different as in this case. </font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font color="#000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">23

        Of the five factors listed in 22 above, the

two most critical ones were: (i) the fact that the respondents had sold the LANGSA, and

(ii) the respondents had ceased to carry on business. It was significant that no reason

was offered to explain why the respondents had to dispose of their only asset, the

"LANGSA". This could not be a transaction in the ordinary course of business.

Unless an explanation was offered it would <i>prima facie</i> be an act of dissipation.

This factor alone would have sufficed for the court to grant a Mareva injunction.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font color="#000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">24

        Similarly, with regard to the factor of the

respondents ceasing business, here again there was no explanation. There was no indication

of any future plans. This factor alone would also have sufficed for the issue of a Mareva

injunction. With respect to the judge below, we thought she indulged in speculation when

she held that there was no evidence that the stoppage of trading by the respondents would

be permanent. But the fact of the matter was that no explanation was given by the

respondents at all. What was real was that the business of the respondents had stopped.

There was no evidence to contradict or qualify that. If the stoppage was intended to be

temporary, why didn’t the respondents say so?</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font color="#000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">25

        The bill of sale stated that the proceeds of

sale had been paid when it was not. Why was a falsehood stated in the bill? No explanation

was offered by either Elaine Quek or the respondents. The argument was made that if there

was any intention to deceive, Elaine Quek would not have disclosed that the purchaser had

not yet made payment. Be that as it may, it was a matter exclusively within the knowledge

of the respondents and/or Elaine Quek. Perhaps, faced with an application for a Mareva

injunction, Elaine Quek felt compelled to set out the true position. The silence certainly

did not help. Moreover, the proceeds of the LANGSA, when paid to the respondents, would be

in cash and could be easily disposed of or dissipated. </font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font color="#000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">26

        It seemed to us that a very significant feature

of the case was the deafening silence on the part of the respondents and their managers,

Foong Sun. Foong Sun, in the person of Elaine Quek, purported to speak for the respondents

but gave no explanation of the various actions taken by the respondents including the fact

that the respondents had agreed to a deferred payment of the price of the LANGSA. The

court was also not told what were the actual payment terms. Points which required answers

were just left unanswered. We would also add that many documents were disclosed in the

proceedings, but we were never shown a single document emanating from the respondents.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font color="#000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">27

        Finally, there was one other circumstance we

ought to allude to. It would be noted that China Insurance had issued a policy to cover

the respondents for third party liabilities up to $500,000. But that was still way below

the quantified claim of the appellants at $904,164. Moreover, China Insurance had yet to

reply to the appellants’ letter seeking confirmation that China Insurance would pay

if the appellants should establish their claim against the respondents.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font color="#000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">28

        The cross-undertaking in damages furnished by

the appellants provided an adequate safeguard against the possibility that the injunction

might be wrongly granted. It could not be argued that the injunction might destroy the

respondents’ business, or that a third party’s confidence in them might be

undermined, as the respondents had already ceased business.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font color="#000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">29

        The injunction which the appellants sought

before us, and which we granted, was very specific, namely, only in respect of the

proceeds of sale of the LANGSA, irrespective of whether the moneys would be received in

Singapore or elsewhere. Here again, we would observe that the respondents did not indicate

whether the payment would be received in Singapore or elsewhere. We did not think this

injunction was really of a worldwide nature. But even if this injunction could be

considered to be of that nature, it should still be granted as it did not appear that the

respondents had other assets within the jurisdiction. In <i>Derby &amp; Co Ltd v Weldon

(Nos 3 &amp; 4)</i> [1990] 1 Ch 65 Lord Donaldson of Lymington MR said (at p.79):-</font>
</p><ol xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font color="#000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">I can see neither

    rhyme nor reason in regarding the existence of some asset within the jurisdiction of

    however little value as a pre-condition for granting a <i>Mareva</i> injunction in respect

    of assets outside the jurisdiction. The existence of <i>sufficient</i> assets within the

    jurisdiction is an excellent reason for confining the jurisdiction to such assets, but,

    other considerations apart, the fewer the assets within the jurisdiction the greater the

    necessity for taking protective measures in relation to those outside it."</font></p>
</blockquote>
</ol>
<p xmlns=""><font color="#000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">30

        In the result, we allowed the appeal and

granted a Mareva injunction over the proceeds of sale of the LANGSA.</font></p>
