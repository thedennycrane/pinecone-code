I therefore accept the plaintiff’s submission that the Contracts incorporate Panoil’s T&amp;Cs and, in particular, cl 8.2.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The law on incorporation of contractual terms</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">19 The “law adopts an objective approach towards questions of contractual formation and the incorporation of terms” (<span class="font-italic">R1 International Pte Ltd v Lonstroff </span><span class="font-italic">AG </span>[2015] 1 SLR 521 at [51] (“<span class="font-italic">Lonstroff</span>”)). Whether a term is incorporated into a contract therefore turns, as is usual in matters of contract, upon ascertaining the parties’ objective intentions from their communications and conduct in light of the relevant background at the time they entered into the contract. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">20 The relevant background includes the industry in which the parties are in business, the character of the document which contains the terms in question as well as the course of dealings between the parties (<span class="font-italic">Lonstroff </span>at [51]). For example, if the parties ordinarily agree on a set of essential terms first while continuing negotiations on the other, more detailed terms, the terms agreed later will be more readily found to have been incorporated into their contract (<span class="font-italic">Lonstroff </span>at [52]). Further, even if a party does not expressly communicate acceptance of the terms in question, the party’s positive, negative or even neutral conduct is capable of evincing acceptance (<span class="font-italic">Midlink Development Pte Ltd v The Stansfield Group Pte Ltd </span>[2004] 4 SLR(R) 258 at [50] and [52]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">21 Terms may also be incorporated by notice. As the learned authors of <span class="font-italic">The Law of Contract in Singapore </span>(Andrew Phang Boon Leong gen ed) (Academy Publishing, 2012) (“<span class="font-italic">The Law of Contract in Singapore</span>”) observe at para 7.22, incorporation by notice “is, by its very nature, heavily dependent on the particular facts of the case concerned”. Actual notice is not required, and notice which is objectively reasonable will suffice. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">22 <span class="font-italic">Circle Freight International Ltd (trading as Mogul Air) v Medeast Gulf Exports Ltd (trading as Gulf Export) </span>[1988] 2 Lloyd’s Law Reports 427 illustrates these principles. In that case, the English Court of Appeal held that the standard terms and conditions of an industry body were incorporated into the parties’ contract by reference and by a course of dealing. Each invoice which the plaintiff issued to the defendant carried the following express endorsement: “all business is transacted by the company under the current trading conditions of the Institute of Freight Forwarders, a copy of which is available on request”. The plaintiff sent an invoice bearing this endorsement to the defendant on at least 11 occasions over six months preceding the consignment which gave rise to the dispute. The English Court of Appeal held that the contract covering the disputed consignment incorporated the industry body’s trading conditions. As Taylor LJ said at 433:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[I]t is not necessary to the incorporation of trading terms into a contract that they should be specifically set out provided that they are conditions in common or usual terms in the relevant business. It is sufficient if adequate notice is given identifying and relying upon the conditions and they are available on request. Other considerations apply if the conditions or any of them are particularly onerous or unusual. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">23 Taylor LJ’s final point is echoed in the observation of Belinda Ang J in <span class="font-italic">Wartsila Singapore Pte Ltd v Lau Yew Choong and another suit</span> [2017] 5 SLR 268 at [122]. Ang J noted there that, where a term is onerous or unusual, there is an enhanced standard for ascertaining whether a party was given reasonable notice of it. The defendant does not suggest that cl 8.2 of Panoil’s T&amp;Cs is an onerous or unusual term. In any event, for the reasons set out at [39]–[42] below, I accept that clauses which exclude set-off are common in the marine fuel industry.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The sale confirmations are not fabricated</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 As a threshold issue, the defendant submits that the sale confirmations are fabricated. In particular, the submission is that the defendant’s company stamp and countersignature on the sale confirmations are not genuine. For this submission, the defendant relies on the evidence of Mr Parry Yeo (“Mr Yeo”). Mr Yeo was the defendant’s managing director at the material time.

Mr Yong was the defendant’s own witness. At common law, a party may not attack the credibility of its own witness and cross-examine the witness unless certain conditions are met. This common law rule is given statutory expression in s 156 of the Evidence Act (Cap 97, 1997 Rev Ed) (see <span class="font-italic">PP v BAU </span>[2016] 5 SLR 146 at [24]). The reason for the rule is that a party who calls a witness at trial is deemed to put the witness forward as a witness of truth. The party accordingly vouches to the court for the honesty of the witness (see <span class="font-italic">Alexander v Gibson </span>(1811) 2 Camp. 555). A party cannot resile from this and discredit its own witness unless specific conditions are met. The rule places a salutary burden on a party to choose its witnesses carefully.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 On Mr Yong’s evidence, whichever of his two versions at [25] above is true, the defendant cannot now allege that the defendant’s acceptance of the sale confirmations is fabricated. On the first version, Panoil applied the defendant’s company stamp and signed the confirmations for the defendant with the defendant’s express agreement. On the second version, Panoil did so with the defendant’s knowledge and acquiescence. Mr Yeo’s evidence that none of the defendant’s authorised signatories signed the sale confirmations for the defendant is immaterial.

</div> The defendant was and is bound by the sale confirmations.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 It follows that I also reject the defendant’s submission that it is not bound by Panoil’s T&amp;Cs because it did not sign and stamp the sale confirmations. In any event, there is no legal requirement at common law that a contractual counterparty either sign or stamp a document in order to be bound by the contract which the document embodies. All that is required is that the contractual counterparty signify somehow that it <span class="font-italic">accept</span><span class="font-italic">s</span> the contractual terms. A signature or a company stamp on the document may be the strongest evidence of acceptance.

Even though there is a column headed “Additional Terms” in each sale confirmation, only a few additional terms are listed there.

Until and unless the parties take a settled account and arrive at a net position, the debts on each side remain distinct. As such, they are liable to be paid and recovered gross. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 In that sense, this aspect of the defendant’s submission places the cart before the horse. Whether the defendant is recorded as a creditor or a debtor in Panoil’s books depends on whether the debts due from the defendant to Panoil under the Contracts have been extinguished by being set off against debts due from Panoil to the defendant. This argument therefore presupposes that the defendant’s Set-off Defence has succeeded. I analyse and reject the Set-off Defence at [76]–[137] below.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 Further, I accept the plaintiff’s submission that each Contract and its associated invoice gives rise to a book debt. A book debt is a debt which arises in the ordinary course of a company’s business (<span class="font-italic">Jurong Data Centre Development Pte Ltd (provisional liquidator appointed) (receivers and managers appointed) v M+W Singapore Pte Ltd and others </span>[2011] 3 SLR 337 at [80]). Moreover, a “book debt” is a debt which should be entered in such books as should be kept in the business and as would, if properly kept, sufficiently disclose the company’s business transactions and financial position from time to time (<span class="font-italic">Duncan, Cameron Lindsay and another v Diablo Fortune Inc and another matter </span>[2018] 4 SLR 240 at [43], citing <span class="font-italic">Motor Credits Ltd v WF Wollaston Ltd </span>(1929) 29 SR (NSW) 227 at 244). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 In determining whether a particular debt is a “book debt”, the court looks at whether it is the practice to enter the debt in question in well-kept books of account in the ordinary course of a company’s business. It is not, however, necessary that the debt be actually entered in the company’s books. A debt which is omitted from the books does not by that fact alone cease to be a book debt (<span class="font-italic">Paul &amp; Frank Ltd v Discount Bank (Overseas) Ltd </span>[1967] Ch 348 at 360F – 361C). It is also the common understanding that each account receivable is a book debt (<span class="font-italic">Dawson v Isle </span>[1906] 1 Ch 633 at 637; <span class="font-italic">In re Stevens </span>[1888] W.N 110 at 116). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 I therefore agree that each Contract and its associated invoice constitutes a book debt for the purposes of cl 3.1(c) of the Debenture. These debts ought to be entered into well-kept books of account in the ordinary course of Panoil’s business and is <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> enforceable by action by Panoil directly against the defendant. The Debt therefore comprises seven book debts.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Debenture covers future debts</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 The second ground on which the defendant submits that Panoil’s rights under the Contracts do not fall within the terms of the Debenture is that the terms of the Debenture capture only Panoil’s contractual rights which were in existence at the time Panoil executed the Debenture in July 2016 and not Panoil’s future contractual rights, such as the Debt, which arose only in July and August 2017.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 Clause 3.1(c) of the Debenture assigns to the plaintiff, by way of fixed security, “all … <span class="font-italic">future </span>book debts” [emphasis added]. Clause 3.1(e) further assigns “all … <span class="font-italic">future </span>contract rights, receivables, books and other debts and monetary claims now or <span class="font-italic">at</span> <span class="font-italic">any time hereafter</span> due, owing or payable to the Borrower” [emphasis added]. The explicit references to the “future” and to “any time hereafter” make the defendant’s argument misconceived. Both clauses clearly cover book debts and contractual rights which come into existence after Panoil granted the plaintiff the Debenture. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 The Debenture accordingly captures the Debt even though it did not exist at the time of the Debenture.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 I am satisfied that the Debenture is effective to assign all of Panoil’s rights against the defendant under the Contracts to the plaintiff.

</div> The Set-off Agreement permitted each party to set off its undisputed invoices against the other party’s undisputed invoices. The effect was to nullify contractually cl 8.2 of Panoil’s T&amp;Cs. By an exchange of letters on 13 August 2017, both parties agreed to apply the Set-off Agreement to their intercompany balances. All of the debts owing between Panoil and the defendant as at 13 August 2017 have accordingly been set off by agreement. This includes the Debt. The Debt was therefore extinguished by discharge well before the defendant received the Notice on 29 August 2017. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 The Cancellation Defence runs as follows.

Evidence which is fabricated is not really evidence at all. It is incapable of being relevant to any fact in issue (other than to prove the fabrication itself). Without relevance, the question of admissibility does not even arise.

That ordinarily means, for all practical purposes, that a witness who proves a document must either be the maker of the document or someone who was present when the maker created the document.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">71 A litigant is entitled to object to the authenticity of documents adduced in evidence by its opponent and to require the opponent to prove them in accordance with the Evidence Act (see <span class="font-italic">Jet Holding </span>at [51]).

</div> The Set-off Agreement therefore contemplates that a party must take a further step to exercise its entitlement and actually to set-off the intercompany debts.

</div> Further, the Set-off Agreement does not refer specifically to the Debt. Indeed, it could not: the Debt did not exist when the parties entered into the Set-off Agreement in July 2015. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">87 Finally, the specific terms of the Contracts are inconsistent with the Set-off Agreement. As I have found, the Contracts incorporate cl 8.2 of Panoil’s T&amp;Cs. This provision requires the defendant to pay Panoil the Debt without deduction, set-off or counterclaim. Clause 8.2 operates contractually to preclude the defendant from exercising its entitlement under the Set-off Agreement.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">88 That is not, of course, the end of the matter. It was within the power of Panoil and the defendant to vary the Contracts by nullifying cl 8.2 of Panoil’s T&amp;Cs. The parties do not dispute this. But it is not the defendant’s case that the 13 August Letters effected any such variation. That is no doubt because the essential element of consideration is lacking to support the variation: Panoil was either insolvent or near insolvency in August 2017 and gained nothing from a set-off.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The 13 August Letters are fabrications</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">89 The issue of whether Panoil and the defendant effected a set off of the Debt does not therefore turn on the authenticity of the Set-off Agreement. It turns only on the authenticity of the 13 August Letters and the Contra Statement. I find these documents to be fabrications. I make two observations of general application on this issue before giving my specific reasons for this finding. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">90 First, the defendant failed to prove the 13 August Letters and the Contra Statement at trial. The defendant did not call the two signatories of the two 13 August Letters to prove them. It did not call the maker of the Contra Statement to prove it. It attempted to prove these documents through the oral evidence of Mr Yeo and Mr Yong. But neither of these men is the maker of either of these documents.

The absence of these documents in Panoil’s books and records is peculiar given the substantial financial significance to Panoil and the defendant of setting off the Debt. The defendant failed to suggest any explanation as to why these documents would not be amongst Panoil’s books and records. This failure is peculiar given that the defendant called Mr Yong as a defence witness. As a director of Panoil, Mr Yong has far more personal knowledge of what is and is not in Panoil’s books and records than the judicial managers. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">100 It might perhaps be plausible to say that Panoil handed the original of Panoil’s 13 August Letter to the defendant but failed to make a copy for its own records. But I cannot believe that Panoil would have received D’s 13 August Letter and not have retained the original in its books and records. The Contra Statement is an even more important document than the 13 August Letters. It purports to evidence a settled account between the two companies establishing that the defendant is no longer a debtor of Panoil. A settled account of this nature is a critical document for both the defendant and Panoil. This is so even if Panoil had never assigned its rights under the Contracts to the plaintiff. It is therefore of substantial commercial and accounting significance, quite apart from this litigation.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">101 The defendant’s evidence is that it realised the critical nature of the Contra Statement in August 2017. Mr Yeo’s evidence is that the defendant created the Contra Statement in order to have documentary proof of the set-off on the defendant’s own letterhead “for the directors to sign”.

</div> It is only reasonable to expect that Panoil would retain an important document such as this amongst its books and records, if for no reason other than to allow its accounts to be drawn up properly.

This is particularly the case given that the judicial managers were able to find the Set-off Agreement in Panoil’s books and records. There is no reason why Panoil should have been more concerned about retaining the Set-off Agreement in its books and records for the future than about retaining the 13 August Letters and the Contra Statement in its books and records for the future. After all, it is the 13 August Letters and the Contra Statement which actually effected the set-off. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">103 My finding that the Contra Statement is fabricated is underscored by the defendant’s belated disclosure of the Contra Statement in this action. In October 2017, after Panoil’s judicial managers sent a letter of demand to the defendant, the defendant and Panoil’s judicial managers exchanged correspondence through solicitors. In that exchange, the defendant raised the Set-off Defence but never disclosed or made reference to the Contra Statement, even in passing. Given the legal and commercial significance of the Contra Statement to the claim asserted against the defendant and to the Set-off Defence, it is beyond belief that the defendant or its solicitors would have had it in October 2017 and yet have failed to deploy it in the correspondence. This suggests to me very strongly that the Contra Statement did not exist in October 2017. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">104 So too in March 2018,

</div> The defendant does not require legal advice to appreciate that the Contra Statement is central to the claims made both by the judicial managers and the plaintiff. If the Contra Statement were indeed genuine, and if the defendant had indeed given a copy to its solicitors as early as October 2017, I would have expected the defendant positively to instruct its solicitors to deploy the Contra Statement in both the October 2017 correspondence and in the March 2018 correspondence, rather than to leave it to its solicitors to decide whether to do so.

When confronted with this discrepancy in cross-examination, Mr Yong was suddenly unable to recall the exact date on which he signed the Contra Statement. Instead, he suggested that he “could [have been] departing on the 15th” instead.

</div> The best evidence of this is a series of four letters which Panoil sent between February 2017 and August 2017 to its ship management company relating to the unauthorised alterations which had led to the MPA’s disciplinary action against Panoil. At that time, Mr Yong and Mr Lim Zhisheng (“Mr Joe Lim”), were the only two directors of Panoil. Mr Yeo was neither a director nor an employee of Panoil.

</div> As further evidence of their close relationship, Mr Yeo readily agreed to Mr Yong’s request.

</div> Mr Yeo gave a different reason. He said that he thought it was possible that the ship management company was connected to Mr Yong and Mr Joe Lim.

</div> Ultimately, the actual reason does not matter. What matters is that Mr Yong and Mr Yeo’s relationship was so close in 2017, when Panoil was insolvent or near insolvency, that Mr Yong asked Mr Yeo to sign four letters for Panoil and Mr Yeo agreed even though he had no involvement in Panoil.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Conclusion on the Set-off Defence</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">124 Given my findings, I am satisfied that no set-off took place in August 2017. The documents on which the defendant relies for the Set-off Defence are fabrications. They were created for the purposes of defending a claim on the Contracts. Accordingly, I hold that Set-off Defence fails.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Is the defendant barred from relying on the Set-off Defence?</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">125 Given my rejection of the Set-off Defence, it is strictly speaking unnecessary for me to consider the plaintiff’s alternative submission. That submission is that, if a set-off had indeed been effected in August 2017, upholding the set-off in this action would impermissibly allow the defendant to take advantage of its own wrong. Nevertheless, as the plaintiff made detailed submissions on this point, I shall analyse this point. For the purposes of my analysis, I shall assume – contrary to my finding – that the Debt was in fact set off in August 2017. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">126 In my view, this alternative submission would not have succeeded had it been necessary for the plaintiff to rely on it. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">127 The plaintiff’s submission is straightforward. The plaintiff accepts that Panoil and the defendant had it within their power to agree to nullify cl 8.2 of Panoil’s T&amp;Cs. However, by reaching such an agreement, the defendant dishonestly assisted Mr Yong in breaching his fiduciary duties as a director of Panoil.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">128 The breach of fiduciary duties arises in this way. By August 2017, Panoil was insolvent or near-insolvent. Panoil’s directors then owed a “fiduciary duty to take into account the interests of the company’s creditors when making decisions for the company” (<span class="font-italic">Liquidators of Progen Engineering Pte Ltd v Progen Holdings Ltd </span>[2010] 4 SLR 1089 at [48]). The defendant was contractually bound by cl 8.2 of Panoil’s T&amp;Cs not to effect a set-off. By agreeing to nullify cl 8.2 of Panoil’s T&amp;Cs and by permitting a set-off, Mr Yong placed the defendant in a better position than it would have been in Panoil’s liquidation. The corollary is that the set-off prejudiced Panoil’s other creditors in the liquidation. Mr Yong thereby breached his fiduciary duty to take into account the interests of Panoil’s creditors. The defendant agreed to the set-off with knowledge of its effect. The defendant thereby dishonestly assisted Mr Yong’s breach. To allow the defendant to rely on the Set-off Defence would therefore amount to allowing it to rely on its own wrong.

The classic statement of the <span class="font-italic">ex turpi causa </span>doctrine can be found in <span class="font-italic">Lord Mansfield</span><span class="font-italic"> CJHolman v Johnson </span>(1775) 1 Cowp 341. In that case, Lord Mansfield CJ stated that “[n]o court will lend its aid to a man who founds his cause of action on an immoral or an illegal act” (at 343). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">130 This fundamental principle applies equally to defences as it does to claims. In <span class="font-italic">Montefiori v Montefiori </span>(1762) 1 Wm Bl 363, Lord Mansfield noted that “no man shall set up his own iniquity as a defence, any more than as a cause of action” (at 364, cited in <span class="font-italic">Takhar v Gra</span><span class="font-italic">cefield Developments Ltd and others </span>[2019] UKSC 13 at [92]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">131 For the plaintiff to rely on this maxim successfully, it must establish each of the following propositions: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Panoil was insolvent or near insolvent in August 2017;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Mr Yeo acted dishonestly when he assisted Mr Yong to nullify cl 8.2 of Panoil’s T&amp;Cs and to effect the set-off;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) as a result of the set-off, the defendant was placed in a better position than it would otherwise have been in in Panoil’s liquidation; </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) Mr Yeo’s dishonest assistance constitutes sufficient turpitude to invoke the maxim; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) the defendant, in asserting its Set-off Defence, relies on that turpitude. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">132 The central difficulty with the plaintiff’s alternative submission is proposition (c). It is undisputed that, in <span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">Panoil’s liquidation, insolvency set-off would have applied as between Panoil and the defendant under s 88 of the Bankruptcy Act (Cap 20, 2009 Rev Ed) read with s 327(1) of the Companies Act (Cap 50, 2006 Rev Ed)</span>.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">133 The essential question on proposition (c) is therefore the effect of cl 8.2 of Panoil’s T&amp;Cs in Panoil’s liquidation. Does cl. 8.2 bind Panoil even in liquidation so as to prevent insolvency set-off from taking effect? Or does cl 8.2 yield to insolvency set-off? If the latter is correct, it cannot be said that effecting a pre-insolvency set-off put the defendant in a better position post-insolvency. That is because insolvency set-off would in any event have operated post-insolvency to the same economic effect. As Vaughan Williams J noted in <span class="font-italic">Re Washington Diamond Mining Company </span>[1893] 3 Ch 95, “[y]ou cannot prefer a man…by merely putting him in the very position in which he would be if a bankruptcy followed” (at 104).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">134 Two propositions of law on insolvency set-off are well-established. First<span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">, </span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">insolvency set-off is mandatory. Parties are not permitted contractually to exclude its effect (</span><span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">Good Property Land Development Pte Ltd v Societe-Generale </span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">[1996] 1 SLR(R) 884 at </span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">[10]; </span><span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">National Westminster Bank v Halesowen Presswork &amp; Assemblies Ltd </span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">[1972] AC 785</span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)"> at 805). Second, it is automatic. Insolvency set-off is a self-executing procedural directive. It takes effect without the need for further intervention and arises automatically by operation of law. And it does so irrespective of the wishes of the parties (</span><span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">Stein v Blake </span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">[1995] 2 All ER 961 at 967). </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">135 <span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">The mandatory nature of insolvency set-off means that a pre-insolvency agreement excluding set-off, such as cl 8.2 of Panoil’s T&amp;Cs, yields to insolvency set-off once insolvency intervenes.</span> Thus, in <span class="font-italic">Coca-Cola Financial Corpn v Finsat </span><span class="font-italic">International Ltd </span>[1996] 3 WLR 849, Neill LJ characterised the “statutory obligation to set off mutual debts as an exception to the general principle that someone may renounce the benefit or other right introduced entirely in his favour” (at 857). Goh Joon Seng J cited this proposition with approval in <span class="font-italic">Citibank NA v Lee Hooi Lian and another </span>[1999] 2 SLR(R) 1 at [62].<span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)"> </span>As<span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)"> </span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">Rory Derham, author of </span><span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">Derham on the Law of Set-Off </span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">(Oxford University Press, 4th Ed, 2010) notes at 127:</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The question of contractual exclusion has arisen in relation to other forms of set-off (apart from legal set off). Courts have permitted an equitable set-off to be expressly excluded providing that clear words are used. By contrast, however, they will not permit set-off arising in bankruptcy or liquidation to be excluded as this form of setoff is regarded as mandatory and hence they will strike down contractual arrangements which purport to exclude or restrict that set-off. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">136 If the plaintiff had had to rely on its alternative submission, proposition (c) would therefore not have been established. Insolvency set-off prevails over cl 8.2 of Panoil’s T&amp;Cs in Panoil’s liquidation. In economic terms, insolvency set-off operating automatically post-insolvency is indistinguishable from a set-off agreed between Panoil and the defendant in August 2017, pre-insolvency. The agreed set-off would not have placed the defendant in a better position than it would otherwise have been in in Panoil’s liquidation. There would have been no breach of fiduciary duty by Mr Yong for Mr Yeo dishonestly to have assisted. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">137 Had it been necessary for my decision, therefore, I would have answered this essential question on proposition (c) in the defendant’s favour.

</div> Yet, Mr Yeo was unable to explain satisfactorily why the defendant failed to mention the Cancellation Defence and the underlying facts in its 9 October 2017 letter. Mr Yeo’s evidence was that although the defendant did intend to include the Cancellation Defence in its 9 October 2017 letter, it had chosen not to do so after receiving Panoil’s advice, via Panoil’s financial controller at the time Ms Mary Chua (“Ms Chua”), that the amounts owing under the Contracts were already set off.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">161 I find this implausible. Mr Yeo’s evidence amounts to saying that the defendant allowed Panoil to dictate the defendant’s decision to abandon an available alternative defence. The defendant was itself directly and materially affected by the purported cancellation of the invoices. The cancellation allegedly extinguished its own obligation to pay the Debt. As a rational commercial party, the defendant would thus have had its own understanding of the economic consequences of the invoices being cancelled. Why then would it rely on Panoil’s advice to abandon the Cancellation Defence? Furthermore, Ms Chua was not even a director of Panoil. And the defendant did not call Ms Chua as a witness to corroborate Mr Yeo’s explanation. And none of the correspondence between the defendant and Panoil was disclosed in evidence. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">162 The defendant repeatedly failed to raise the Cancellation Defence when any rational commercial party would have done so. The defendant’s letter to the plaintiff’s solicitors on 13 October 2017 merely reiterates its 9 October 2017 letter and attaches a copy of the Set-off Agreement.

</div> By 23 October 2017, the defendant had appointed solicitors. Yet, the defendant’s position remained only that the Debt had been set off.

This is no small issue as it might entail an adjustment in price or a refund. Yet, Mr Yong was unable to confirm if Panoil had done so at all

</div> Mr Yeo explained as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Q: On 13 August itself you were still thinking of cancelling the invoices, that’s based on what you have said?</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">A: No. In the first place, whether it was cancelling or set-off, we need to talk to them to find out what’s their position on this transaction and what’s their position on the client, which they nominated, so they came back to us, and to them they said set-off would be easy, so we went for set-off. <span class="font-italic">We did the set off.</span> <span class="font-italic">Subsequently Eastern did not agree to that</span>. They wanted to deal directly based on what we heard through the letters they gave to us. So we went ahead with it and we agreed with them also, whichever that they felt, because we just wanted this transaction to be completed in the sense, that means either it’s through a set off or a cancellation which all the parties can come to agreement to. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">Mr Yeo’s explanation raises more questions than it answers. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">187 First, I fail to understand why Eastern Pacific would reject any agreement between Panoil and the defendant to set off the Debt. As the defendant’s buyer, Eastern Pacific’s contractual rights and obligations would remain entirely unaffected by any such set-off. The contracts between Panoil and the defendant and the contracts between the defendant and Eastern Pacific were separate contracts entered into between separate entities, albeit linked commercially. A set-off between Panoil and the defendant would leave Eastern Pacific’s rights against the defendant completely unaffected.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">188 Further, there is no commercial reason for Panoil to cancel the Debt if the Debt had been set-off. A set-off would have extinguished the Debt. No debt would remain in existence after the alleged set-off for Panoil to “cancel”. Even Mr Yong accepted that a debt “cannot be cancelled after it has been fully settled”.

Mr Yeo did not explain how the defendant learned of Eastern Pacific’s request to deal directly with Panoil as well as Panoil’s agreement to the request by 12 August 2017. Eastern Pacific’s request to Panoil was communicated to Panoil no earlier than EP’s 17 August Letter. Panoil accepted the request by its 18 August Letter.

However, he backtracked when he conceded that EP’s 17 August Letter contained no such request for cancellation. He then claimed instead that it was Mr Yeo who came to Panoil’s office demanding the cancellation.

</div>
</div> That is simply a plea that two parties – the defendant and Panoil – agreed to cancel the invoices. It does not contain, even by implication, a plea that there was a tripartite novation let alone a plea of the consideration necessary to support it. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">212 Defendant’s counsel submits that consideration is not required for a novation. That submission is without merit. In a novation, “both the benefits and the burdens of the original contract are transferred to the new contracting parties, essentially because…the original contract is extinguished and a new contract is formed” (<span class="font-italic">Fairview Developments Pte Ltd v Ong &amp; Ong Pte Ltd and another appeal </span>[2014] 2 SLR 318 at [46]). It necessarily follows that consideration is required for this new contract to be formed. It is true that, for a novation, “the consideration [is] usually…the discharge of the old contract” (<span class="font-italic">Koh Chong Chiah and others v Treasure Resort Pte Ltd and another </span>[2013] 1 SLR 1069 at [67], citing <span class="font-italic">Halsbury’s Laws of England </span>vol 9(1) (Butterworths, 4th Ed Reissue, 1998) at para 1036). The requirement of consideration may be easily satisfied in a novation, but it remains a requirement.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">213 The only pleaded defence is a bilateral cancellation. The allegation that there was a tripartite novation is nowhere pleaded. The defendant cannot advance a defence based on a novation.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">214 Even if I were to leave aside the pleading point, the defendant failed to call any witness of fact from Eastern Pacific who had personal knowledge of this alleged novation. And if there were such a novation, one would have expected to see Panoil re-issue the cancelled invoices to Eastern Pacific. No such re-issued invoices were produced in evidence. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">215 Further, it appears that no re-issued invoices exist. Mr Yong confirmed that Panoil did not re-issue any invoices to Eastern Pacific.

</div> This is surprising. No commercial entity would, in the ordinary course of its business, cancel an invoice without re-issuing a fresh invoice covering the same receivable.

</div> During these 13 days, Panoil did not re-issue <span class="font-italic">any </span>invoices to Eastern Pacific. Mr Yong simply offers no satisfactory explanation for why, if Panoil had the time to reply to EP’s 17 August Letter, it did not have the time to re-issue the invoices.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">218 Panoil’s failure to re-issue invoices to Eastern Pacific is a strong indication that the Debt was never cancelled. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Conclusion on the Cancellation Defence</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">219 Given my findings, I am satisfied that the Debt was not cancelled in August 2017. The documents on which the defendant relies for the Cancellation Defence are fabrications. They were created for the purposes of defending a claim on the Contracts. Accordingly, I hold that Cancellation Defence fails.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">220 Both of the defendant’s substantive defences have failed. The plaintiff is therefore entitled to judgment in this action.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Costs</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">221 The event in this action is entirely in the plaintiff’s favour. As part of its judgment, the plaintiff is accordingly entitled to an order for its costs of and incidental to the action. Plaintiff’s counsel submits that the defendant’s conduct throughout the entirety of this action makes this an appropriate case for me to exercise my discretion under O 59 r 27 of the Rules of Court to award costs against the defendant on the indemnity basis. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">222 While this discretion is unfettered, it must necessarily be exercised judicially. As the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Raffles Town Club Pte Ltd v Lim Eng Hock Peter</span><span class="font-italic"> and others (Tung Yu-Lien Margaret and others, third parties) </span>[2011] 1 SLR 582 observed, “[c]osts on an indemnity basis should only be ordered in a special case or where there are exceptional circumstances” (at [29]). Indeed, the “burden on a party who seeks an order for indemnity costs as a matter of discretion is…a high one” (<span class="font-italic">Tan Chin Yew Joseph v Saxo Capital </span><span class="font-italic">Markets Pte Ltd </span>[2013] SGHC 274 at [97]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">223 Order 59 r 5 of the Rules of Court sets out a list of several factors which a court should take into account in considering whether it is appropriate to award costs on the indemnity basis. These factors largely relate to the conduct of the paying party both before and during the litigation. This list is however, not exhaustive (<span class="font-italic">Wong Meng Cheong and another v Ling Ai Wah and another </span>[2012] 1 SLR 549 at [199]). The court thus should have regard to all the circumstances of the case, to ensure that there is “some conduct or circumstance which takes the case out of the norm”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">224 In so far as the conduct of the unsuccessful party is the ground for seeking an order of costs on the indemnity basis, “the test is not conduct attracting moral condemnation, which is an <span class="font-italic">a fortiori </span>ground, but rather unreasonableness” (<span class="font-italic">Three Rivers District Council v The Governor and Co of the Bank of England (No 6) </span>[2006] EWHC 816 (Comm) at [25]). Some relevant factors include “the extent of a party’s dishonest and unscrupulous intentions and actions” (<span class="font-italic">Airtrust (Hong Kong) Ltd v PH Hydraulics &amp; Engineering Pte Ltd </span>[2016] 5 SLR 103 at [50]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">225 I find in all the circumstances that the defendant’s conduct in this litigation rises to the level of unreasonableness which is necessary to make an award of indemnity costs against it appropriate. The defendant conducted its defence contumeliously, evincing a blatant disregard for the court and its processes. The defendant played fast and loose with the court in discovery, in calling witnesses and in its affidavits of evidence in chief. There were many shifts of position, often at the last minute, and some of which involved misleading the court. The defendant engaged in the archetypal unreasonable litigation conduct which ought to be mulcted in indemnity costs.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">226 I highlight a few examples.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">227 On 8 November 2018, already concerned about the completeness of the defendant’s discovery, I directed that no party shall be permitted to file supplementary lists of documents beyond a final round of lists to be exchanged on 13 November 2018. I also barred both parties from relying at trial, without the leave of court, on any document not disclosed in pre-trial discovery. Despite this, without the leave of court, the defendant filed a supplementary list of documents on 15 July 2019.

</div> This piecemeal approach to discovery and the fact that the discovery was given on the eve of trial aggravates the defendant’s blatant disregard of my order.
