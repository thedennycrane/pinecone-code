        Sundaresh Menon CJ (delivering the grounds of decision of the
                court)</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       This appeal arises in the context of an exchange
                    of information request made by the National Tax Agency of Japan (“the
                    JNTA”) to the Comptroller of Income Tax (“the
                    Comptroller”). The request was made pursuant to Art 26(1) of the
                    Agreement between the Government of the Republic of Singapore and the Government
                    of Japan for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal
                    Evasion with Respect to Taxes on Income as amended by the Protocol (“the
                    Treaty”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The JNTA sent a letter to the Comptroller
                    requesting, among other things, the production of bank statements for certain
                    accounts held by the Appellant, his son and their related entities with [BLM]
                    Bank (“the Bank”) pursuant to Art 26(1) of the Treaty
                    (“the Letter of Request”). Having concluded that the bank
                    statements were protected against unauthorised disclosure by s 47 of the
                    Banking Act (Cap 19, 2008 Rev Ed), the Comptroller filed Originating Summons 331
                    of 2013 (“OS 331”) against the Bank for an order directing the
                    production of the bank statements under s 105J(2) of the Income Tax Act
                    (Cap 134, 2008 Rev Ed) (“the ITA”). The Appellant applied for and
                    was granted leave to intervene in OS 331.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       On 31 May 2013, an order in terms of OS 331 was
                    made by a High Court judge (“the Judge”). The Appellant filed
                    Summons No 3310 of 2013 (“Summons 3310”) for the order of court
                    dated 31 May 2013 to be discharged and Summons No 5041 of 2013 (“Summons
                    5041”) for execution of the order of court to be stayed pending the
                    determination of legal proceedings commenced against the JNTA in Japan
                    challenging the validity of the Letter of Request. Both summonses were dismissed
                    by the Judge on 17 October 2013.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       On 13 November 2013 the Appellant filed his
                    appeal in Civil Appeal No 150 of 2013 (“CA 150”) against the
                    Judge’s decision to dismiss Summonses 3310 and 5041. We heard the appeal
                    on 15 October 2014. At the close of the hearing we dismissed the appeal save to
                    the extent that the scope of the order made below on 31 May 2013 was to be
                    varied to reflect the terms of the original request made by the JNTA and no
                    more. As we indicated we would, we now set out the grounds of our decision in
                    full.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Facts</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       The Appellant is a Japanese national residing in
                    Japan. On 22 November 2012, the JNTA sent the Letter of Request to the
                    Comptroller making a request for information pursuant to Art 26(1) of the
                    Treaty. Article 26 bears setting out in full:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-Heading1">
<b>ARTICLE
                        26</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">1.    The competent authorities of the Contracting States
                            shall exchange such information as is foreseeably relevant for carrying
                            out the provisions of this Agreement or to the administration or
                            enforcement of the domestic laws concerning taxes of every kind and
                            description imposed on behalf of the Contracting States, or of their
                            local authorities, insofar as the taxation thereunder is not contrary to
                            this Agreement. The exchange of information is not restricted by
                            Articles 1 and 2.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">2.    Any information received under paragraph 1 by a
                            Contracting State shall be treated as secret in the same manner as
                            information obtained under the domestic laws of that Contracting State
                            and shall be disclosed only to persons or authorities (including courts
                            and administrative bodies) concerned with the assessment or collection
                            of, the enforcement or prosecution in respect of, the determination of
                            appeals in relation to the taxes referred to in paragraph 1, or the
                            oversight of the above. Such persons or authorities shall use the
                            information only for such purposes. They may disclose the information in
                            public court proceedings or in judicial decisions.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">3.    In no case shall the provisions of paragraphs 1 and
                            2 be construed so as to impose on a Contracting State the
                            obligation:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(a) to carry out administrative measures at variance with the laws and
                        administrative practice of that or of the other Contracting State;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(b) to supply information which is not obtainable under the laws or in the
                        normal course of the administration of that or of the other Contracting
                        State.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(c) to supply information which would disclose any trade, business,
                        industrial, commercial or professional secret or trade process, or
                        information the disclosure of which would be contrary to public
                        policy.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">4.    If information is requested by a Contracting State
                            in accordance with the provisions of this Article, the other Contracting
                            State shall use its information gathering measures to obtain the
                            requested information, even though the other Contracting State may not
                            need such information for its own tax purposes. The obligation contained
                            in the preceding sentence is subject to the limitations of paragraph 3
                            but in no case shall such limitations be construed to permit a
                            Contracting State to decline to supply information because it has no
                            domestic interest in such information.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">5.    In no case shall the provisions of paragraph 3 be
                            construed to permit a Contracting State to decline to supply information
                            solely because the information is held by a bank, other financial
                            institution, nominee or person acting in an agency or a fiduciary
                            capacity or because it relates to ownership interests in a person.
                            However, a Contracting State may decline to supply information relating
                            to confidential communications between attorneys, solicitors or other
                            admitted legal representatives in their role as such and their clients
                            to the extent that the other communications are protected from
                            disclosure under the domestic laws of that Contracting
                        State.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       The ostensible purpose of the JNTA’s
                    request, insofar as it is relevant to these proceedings, was to determine
                    whether the Appellant had failed to report distributions he had received from
                    foreign securities investment funds which he and his family had invested in. In
                    this regard the JNTA had found documents during the Appellant’s tax
                    examination in Japan suggesting that he had not done so. This was material
                    because the Appellant was subject to income tax on his worldwide income under
                    Japanese law.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       Arising from its suspicions, the JNTA requested,
                    among other things, the production of bank statements for the following accounts
                    held with the Bank for the period 2006 through to 2011 and furnished the
                    following reasons why these bank statements were required:</p>

<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The Proceedings Below</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       Having formed the opinion that the said bank
                    statements were protected from unauthorised disclosure by s 47 of the Banking
                    Act, the Comptroller sent a notice under s 105E of the ITA to the Bank and each
                    of the account holders on 15 April 2013 informing them of his intention to make
                    an application to the High Court for the production of the bank statements under
                    s 105J(1) of the ITA. Section 105J of the ITA is central in these
                    proceedings and the material parts of it read as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-Heading1">

<p class="Judg-QuoteList-3">(i)    for the administration of this Act, other

                                    (Cap. 336),</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">then the Comptroller or an authorised officer may apply to the High Court

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(2) If, on such an application, the High Court is satisfied
                        that the conditions referred to in subsection (3) are fulfilled, it may make

<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(<em>b</em>)    it is not

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(4) Both or either of the following persons may, within 7

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(6) Proceedings under this section other than subsection (4)

<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(<em>a</em>)    the person
                                alleged to have possession or control of that information or against

                                or</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(<em>b</em>)    the person in

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       Thereafter on 19 April 2013 the Comptroller
                    filed OS 331 against the Bank. The main prayer in the originating summons was
                    for an order under s 105J(2) of the ITA compelling the Bank to produce all
                    bank statements for the period 1 January 2006 through to 31 December 2011 in
                    relation to <em>all the accounts</em> held by the eight
                    account holders identified in the Letter of Request (see [7] above). It may be
                    noted here that the prayer sought by the Comptroller was wider than the
                    JNTA’s original request which related to the eight identified accounts
                    only. We address this point later in these grounds (see [88]
                below).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     OS 331 was first heard by the Judge on 9 May
                    2013. The defendant Bank did not attend. At that hearing, counsel for the
                    Appellant made an oral application for leave to intervene in OS 331 which was
                    granted by the Judge. The Judge exercised his discretion under s 105J(6) of the
                    ITA to allow the proceedings to continue <em>inter
                        partes</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     Subsequently, there were several hearings
                    before the Judge and several affidavits were filed by the Appellant and the
                    Comptroller in support of their respective cases. In short, the Appellant
                    objected to the production of the bank statements on the following broad
                    grounds:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_11-p2_a"></a>(a)     The Comptroller’s notice to
                        the Appellant under s 105E of the ITA was ineffective as it was sent to the
                        wrong residential address.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_11-p2_b"></a>(b)     The statutory regime implementing the Treaty did not
                        permit the disclosure of information relating to periods before 14 July
                        2010, this being the date on which the Treaty took effect in Singapore. This
                        was because it was presumed that legislation did not have retrospective
                        effect. There was nothing in the relevant statutory regime to displace the
                        presumption.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_11-p2_c"></a>(c)     The JNTA was precluded from obtaining the bank statements under the Treaty
                        as it could not have obtained the information under Japanese law. The
                        issuance of the Letter of Request was at variance with the laws and
                        administrative practices of Japan. This was because:</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_11-p2_c-p3_i"></a>(i)       the Appellant was subject
                            to a voluntary tax examination in Japan and not a criminal
                            investigation. In a tax examination the disclosure of information was
                            purely voluntary and the JNTA did not have the power to compulsorily
                            obtain books and information; and</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_11-p2_c-p3_ii"></a>(ii)       the JNTA was precluded from requesting
                            information for 2009 and earlier years by the tax limitation period
                            under Japanese law.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_11-p2_d"></a>(d)     The JNTA had not pursued all available means to obtain
                        the information in Japan. In this regard the Appellant had disclosed
                        statements for an account which he held with [I Bank] in Singapore upon
                        JNTA’s request. The JNTA could have similarly requested that the
                        Appellant produce the bank statements for his account with the Bank but had
                        not done so.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_11-p2_e"></a>(e)     By
                        reason of (c) and (d) above, the Letter of Request did not comply with the
                        requirements set out in the Eighth Schedule of the ITA.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_11-p2_f"></a>(f)     The Appellant had filed the
                        distributions he received from the investment funds with the
                    JNTA.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_11-p2_g"></a>(g)     The
                        JNTA’s request did not satisfy the requirement of foreseeable
                        relevance under Art 26(1) of the Treaty because:</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_11-p2_g-p3_i"></a>(i)       The JNTA’s request
                            amounted to fishing. The language of the request as stated in the
                            Comptroller’s supporting affidavit was tentative and based on
                            assumptions and suspicions.</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_11-p2_g-p3_ii"></a>(ii)       The JNTA had already concluded its examination
                            of the Appellant for the years 2009, 2010 and 2011 and had issued a
                            Notice of Non-Requirement of Reassessment for those years. The enquiry
                            for the years 2006 to 2008 had also been concluded. Hence, the Letter of
                            Request had ceased to reflect the needs of the JNTA.</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_11-p2_g-p3_iii"></a>(iii)       The bank accounts
                            belonging to the other account holders were not sufficiently linked to
                            the Appellant’s tax examination.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     Against this, the Comptroller took the
                    position that:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_12-p2_a"></a>(a)     The s 105E notice was properly
                        served on the Appellant’s last known address. In any event, the
                        Appellant was not prejudiced as he was aware of the notice and was
                        represented at the hearing.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_12-p2_b"></a>(b)     Under the Treaty, and therefore the ITA, information
                        could be exchanged in relation to any taxable period. This would not involve
                        giving the statutory regime retrospective effect as no order for production
                        could be made until after the Treaty came into effect.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_12-p2_c"></a>(c)     The JNTA was not precluded from
                        requesting information for 2009 and earlier years. The JNTA had confirmed
                        that Japanese law permitted a re-assessment to be conducted up to seven
                        years before the tax return date where there had been tax
                    evasion.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_12-p2_d"></a>(d)     The JNTA
                        had also confirmed that the examinee’s consent was not required where
                        the information was sought under a tax convention.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_12-p2_e"></a>(e)     The requirements set out in the Eighth
                        Schedule of the ITA did not require the Court to go behind what the JNTA had
                        stated in the Letter of Request.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_12-p2_f"></a>(f)     The JNTA had confirmed that it still required the
                        requested information. Although the Appellant’s tax examination had
                        been closed based on the information in the JNTA’s possession, the
                        information requested would determine whether the Appellant needed to be
                        re-examined.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     On 31 May 2013, the Judge made an order in
                    terms of the Comptroller’s application in OS 331.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     On 19 June 2013 the Appellant filed Summons
                    3110 to discharge the order of court made on 31 May 2013 and to obtain discovery
                    of the Letter of Request which had not been disclosed to the Appellant at that
                    time as required under O 98 r 2 of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2006 Rev
                    Ed). The other account holders filed Summonses Nos 3108, 3109, 3111, 3112 and
                    3113 of 2013. The orders sought therein were identical to those sought by the
                    Appellant in Summons 3110. In addition the other account holders prayed for
                    leave to intervene in OS 331.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     The Appellant’s application in Summons
                    3110 was premised on a change in circumstances between the end of May 2013 and
                    June 2013 given alleged further developments arising from communications between
                    his representatives and the JNTA in Japan. It was alleged that the JNTA had
                    confirmed that they would not re-examine the Appellant and, therefore, the
                    Letter of Request had ceased to represent the needs of the JNTA. Moreover the
                    JNTA had confirmed that the Appellant’s case was not one of tax-evasion.
                    This meant that a limitation period of three years applied and no re-assessment
                    could be made for years up to and including 2010. As the requested information
                    could not be obtained under Japanese law, it fell outside the scope of the
                    Treaty. The other account holders primarily relied on the same grounds in their
                    respective applications. The only difference was that it was additionally
                    asserted by them that the bank statements for their respective accounts were not
                    relevant to the tax-examination in Japan which related to the Appellant
                    only.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     On 17 July 2013, the Comptroller filed an
                    affidavit exhibiting a letter from the JNTA dated 16 July 2013. In that letter,
                    the JNTA confirmed that it still required the information requested in the
                    Letter of Request. The JNTA also confirmed that the request had been made in
                    accordance with Japanese law and administrative practices.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     The Comptroller resisted Summons 3110 and the
                    summonses filed by the other account holders on the principal basis that because
                    OS 331 had been heard <em>inter partes</em>, there was
                    no basis to discharge or vary the order of court made by the Judge. Further, the
                    other account holders were aware that OS 331 was being contested and should
                    have applied to intervene before the order was made. In fact, [B], who filed
                    affidavits on behalf of each of the other account holders, had filed an
                    affidavit on the Appellant’s behalf in the course of the <em>inter partes</em> hearing. The Comptroller argued that the
                    applications made by the other account holders were dilatory in nature. In any
                    event, the Comptroller submitted that the order for production of the bank
                    statement was correctly made in the circumstances of the case.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     On 20 September 2013, [B] and [D Company]
                    filed a complaint against the JNTA in the Tokyo District Court challenging the
                    validity of the Letter of Request (“the Japan Proceedings”). In
                    the Japan Proceedings, it was alleged that the Letter of Request did not meet
                    the requirements stipulated under Japanese law for its issuance and that the
                    JNTA had lost its right to continue with the request on 17 April 2013 when it
                    notified the Appellant that his tax examination had been concluded. Shortly
                    after the Japan Proceedings were commenced, on 25 September 2013, the Appellant
                    filed Summons 5041 for the execution of the order of court made on 31 May 2013
                    to be stayed pending the determination of the Japan proceedings. The Appellant
                    contended that irreparable harm would be done to him if the bank statements were
                    disclosed to the JNTA before the Japanese courts had the opportunity to
                    determine the matters before it.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     The Comptroller objected to such a stay being
                    ordered. The Comptroller pointed out that the Eighth Schedule of the ITA only
                    required the request to contain a statement that it was made in conformity with
                    the laws of the requesting state. It said that the Singapore court should not be
                    concerned with whether this statement was right or wrong.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     The Judge delivered his judgment on 17 October
                    2013. The written grounds for his decision are reported as <em>Comptroller of Income Tax v BLM</em> [2014] 1 SLR 123
                    (“Judgment”). By his decision, the Judge dismissed each of the
                    summonses filed by the Appellant and the other account holders. On 13 November
                    2014, the Appellant filed his appeal to this Court in CA 150. No appeal was
                    filed by the other account holders.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Issues before this Court</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     The arguments before this Court were
                    essentially a rehash of those made below. We should note however that between
                    the time the appeal was filed and the time it was heard, the Appellant
                    independently obtained a copy of the Letter of Request from the JNTA for use in
                    these proceedings. Armed with the Letter of Request, the Appellant filed Summons
                    No 1373 of 2014 to amend his written case in the appeal, in particular, to
                    buttress his contention that the court could substantively review the Letter of
                    Request under s 105J of the ITA. We granted leave to amend on 6 May
                2014.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     Based on the parties’ written cases and
                    the oral submissions made before us, there were four broad areas of
                    contention:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_22-p2_a"></a>(a)     The High Court’s role under s
                        105J of the ITA, in particular, whether s 105J contemplated substantive
                        review of the Letter of Request by the High Court.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_22-p2_b"></a>(b)     Whether the statutory regime under the
                        ITA permitted the exchange of information for periods before the Treaty was
                        given effect in Singapore.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_22-p2_c"></a>(c)     Whether the making of an order under s 105J of the ITA
                        was justified in the circumstances of the case.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_22-p2_d"></a>(d)     The position of the other account holders in the

<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The High Court’s Role under s 105J of the ITA</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Background to the statutory regime applicable to exchange of
                information requests</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     Before turning to the issues directly before
                    us, we should first explain the statutory regime applicable to exchange of
                    information requests made by foreign tax authorities. This was enacted in 2009
                    as the Income Tax (Amendment) (Exchange of Information) Act 2009 (Act 24 of
                    2009) (“the 2009 Amendments”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     At the second reading of the amending bill
                    (see Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report (19 October 2009) vol 86
                    at columns 1601–1623 (“the Second Reading Speech”)), the
                    Minister for Finance, Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam (“the Minister”)
                    explained the broad rationale for the amendments in the following terms (at
                    column 1601):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The Income Tax (Amendment) (Exchange of Information) Bill proposes
                        amendments to the Income Tax Act that will allow Singapore to implement the
                        internationally agreed Standard for the exchange of information for tax
                        purposes upon request.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     The “Standard” alluded to by the
                    Minister is contained in Art 26 of the Organisation of Economic Cooperation and
                    Development 2008 Model Tax Convention on Income and on Capital (“the EOI
                    Standard”). It is in <em>pari materia</em> with Art
                    26 of the Treaty (see [5] above).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     Four pertinent features of the EOI Standard
                    should be mentioned here:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_26-p2_a"></a>(a)     First, the touchstone for the
                        exchange of information under the EOI Standard is whether the requested
                        information is “foreseeably relevant” for carrying out the
                        provisions of the relevant tax treaty or the enforcement of the domestic tax
                        laws of the requesting state. This is unlike the earlier incarnation of the
                        EOI Standard, which Singapore previously implemented in its tax treaties,
                        which required the information to be “necessary” for those
                        purposes instead.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_26-p2_b"></a>(b)     Second, the EOI Standard does not permit a contracting state to
                        decline a request merely because it lacks a “domestic
                        interest” in the information.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_26-p2_c"></a>(c)     Third, it does not permit a contracting state to decline
                        a request for information only because the information is held by a bank, a
                        financial institution or a person acting in a fiduciary
                    capacity.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_26-p2_d"></a>(d)     Fourth,
                        the EOI Standard allows the sharing of information relating to all forms of
                        taxes and not just income tax.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     Parliament deemed the 2009 Amendments
                    necessary to enable Singapore to comply with its obligations under its tax
                    treaties which incorporated the EOI Standard. In this regard, the statutory
                    regime that existed before the 2009 Amendments did not contain provisions which
                    were specifically geared towards processing requests for information from
                    foreign tax authorities; Singapore’s ability to exchange information was
                    instead premised upon the Comptroller’s general powers to obtain
                    information for the enforcement of Singapore’s domestic income tax laws.
                    Moreover, the Comptroller did not have the power to compel the disclosure of
                    information protected by secrecy laws under s 47 of the Banking Act and s 49 of
                    the Trust Companies Act (Cap 336, 2006 Rev Ed) unless the information was sought
                    for the purpose of investigating or prosecuting domestic tax
                offences.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     Yet, while Parliament sought to broaden the
                    scope of the information which could be exchanged between Singapore and its
                    treaty partners, it also sought to implement safeguards to protect taxpayer
                    rights. As the Minister explained in the Second Reading Speech (at columns
                    1603–1604):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<em>An integral aspect of the [EOI Standard] is its respect
                            for taxpayers’ rights</em>. The Bill contains important
                        safeguards in this respect. <em>Spurious or frivolous
                            requests for information will not be acceded to. Further, it does not
                            allow for what is called “fishing expeditions” – it
                            requires requests for information to be specific, detailed and relevant
                            to the tax affairs of the taxpayer in question</em>. Consistent
                        with the [EOI Standard], we will only provide assistance where there is a
                        genuine case at hand, and the requested information is specific and relevant
                        to the case.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Additionally, the [EOI Standard] also does not allow jurisdictions to take
                        advantage of the information system of another jurisdiction if it is wider
                        than their own system. Hence, <em>we will only exchange
                            information that a requesting jurisdiction would have ordinarily been
                            able to obtain under its own laws or administrative practices, had the
                            information resided in that jurisdiction in the first place.
                            Jurisdictions must also have pursued all domestic means to access the
                            requested information before putting forth a request to
                        us</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Such safeguards do not impede the effective exchange of information. They
                        are provided for by the [EOI Standard] to uphold the principle of respecting
                        taxpayers’ rights. With the amendments proposed in the Bill, Singapore
                        is committed to respecting these rights, while fully meeting our obligations
                        under the Standard and playing our full role as a trusted and responsible
                        jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The [EOI Standard] also sets out clear limits on the types of information
                        that jurisdictions are obliged to exchange. Jurisdictions are not obliged to
                        exchange trade or business secrets, or information that is subject to legal
                        privilege. They may also decline to exchange certain information if doing so
                        would be contrary to public policy. Some examples of such information
                        include state secrets or information sought for the purposes of political,
                        religious or racial persecution. However, these are serious grounds of
                        refusal, and we do not expect to invoke them under normal
                        circumstances.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Features of relevant statutory regime</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     It was in this context that the 2009
                    Amendments were passed to implement a comprehensive statutory regime for dealing
                    with exchange of information requests made by foreign tax authorities. Section
                    105D is the principal enabling provision and it reads as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">105D.–(1) The competent authority under a prescribed arrangement may
                        make a request to the Comptroller for information concerning the tax
                        position of any person in accordance with the EOI provision of that
                        arrangement.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(2) Unless the Comptroller otherwise permits, the request must set out the
                        information prescribed in the Eighth Schedule.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(3) Every request shall be subject to and dealt with in accordance with
                        the terms of the prescribed arrangement.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>The Treaty was declared to be a “prescribed
                        arrangement” by the Income Tax (Singapore — Japan) (Avoidance
                        of Double Taxation Agreement) Order 2010 (Cap 134, S 397/2010) with effect
                        from 14 July 2010 (“the 2010 Order”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     Notably, under s 105D(2) of the ITA, a request
                    must provide the information prescribed by the Eighth Schedule unless the
                    Comptroller otherwise permits. At the time of the JNTA’s request, the
                    Eighth Schedule then in force provided:</p>

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">5.    The grounds for believing that the information

                            Services Tax, the Comptroller of Property Tax, the Chief Assessor or the
                            Commissioner of Stamp Duties, or is in the possession or control of a

                            authority, and that the competent authority is authorised to obtain the
                            information under the laws of that country or in the normal course of
                            administrative practice.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">8.    A statement that the country has pursued all means
                            available in its own territory to obtain the information including
                            getting the information directly from the person in relation to whom the
                            information is requested.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">9.    The details of the period within which that country

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">11.    Any other information that may assist in giving
                            effect to the request.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     Once the Comptroller is satisfied that a
                    request is justified, he has wide powers in most cases to obtain the information
                    under Part XVI of the ITA. There is an exception to this general position
                    however if the Comptroller is of the opinion that the information is protected
                    from unauthorised disclosure by s 47 of the Banking Act or s 49 of the
                    Trust Companies Act. In that event the Comptroller must serve a notice under s
                    105E of the ITA on the person in relation to whom the information is sought and
                    the person who is believed to have possession and control of the information,
                    unless one of the prescribed exceptions under s 105E(4) exists. Next, the
                    Comptroller must apply to the High Court for an order under s 105J(2) of the ITA
                    granting him access to the protected information (see at [8] above). To this
                    end, the High Court’s power to make an order for the production of
                    protected information under s 105J(2) is premised upon whether the conditions in
                    s 105J(3) are satisfied. These conditions are as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(3) The conditions referred to in subsection (2) are as
                        follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(<em>a</em>)    the making of
                                the order is justified in the circumstances of the case;
                            and</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(<em>b</em>)    it is not
                                contrary to the public interest for a copy of the document to be
                                produced or that access to the information be given.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     We note (purely in passing because it has no
                    relevance to the issues before us) that the ITA was amended in 2013 by the
                    Income Tax (Amendment) Act 2013 (Act 19 of 2013) and s 105J was repealed.
                    The High Court is therefore no longer a party to the exchange of information
                    process. In its place, the Comptroller is empowered to issue a statutory notice
                    to compel the production of information protected from unauthorised disclosure
                    by the Banking Act and the Trust Companies Act.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The High Court’s role in assessing the justification of a
                request</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     Before us, the Appellant did not contend that
                    the making of an order for production of the bank statements would be contrary
                    to the public interest. Therefore the sole issue was whether the making of the
                    order for production was justified in the circumstances of the case. This brings
                    into focus the High Court’s role under s 105J(3)(a) of the
                ITA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     In <em>Comptroller of Income
                        Tax v BJY and others</em> [2013] 4 SLR 801 (“<em>BJY</em>”), Andrew Ang J considered the meaning of the phrase
                    “justified in the circumstances of the case” under s 105J(3)(a) of
                    the ITA. Having referred to that part of the Minister’s speech which is
                    set out at [28] above, Ang J observed (at [24]) that the Minister’s
                    concerns were reflected in the Eighth Schedule requirements and also in
                    Singapore’s tax treaties which incorporated the EOI Standard. In Ang
                    J’s view, these considerations (<em>viz</em>, the
                    Eighth Schedule Requirements and the EOI Standard), which included the
                    foreseeable relevance of the information, had to be taken into account in
                    determining whether the making of an order for the production of the protected
                    information was justified in the circumstances of the case.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     The approach in <em>BJY</em> can be contrasted with that adopted by Choo Han Teck J in
                    the earlier case of <em>Comptroller of Income v AZP</em>
                    [2012] 3 SLR 690 (“<em>AZP</em>”). In
                        <em>AZP</em>, it was held (at [6]) that three
                    conditions had to be satisfied before the High Court would make an order under s
                    105J(2) of the ITA:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_35-p2_a"></a>(a)     first, the requested information
                        must be foreseeably relevant to the carrying out of the tax treaty or the
                        enforcement of the requesting state’s domestic tax
                    laws;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_35-p2_b"></a>(b)     second, the
                        making of the order must be justified in the circumstances of the case;
                        and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_35-p2_c"></a>(c)     third, the
                        making of the order must not be contrary to the public
                    interest.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>In the court below, the Judge
                        followed the approach adopted in <em>AZP</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     It will be apparent that the difference
                    between these approaches is that in <em>AZP</em>, the issue
                    of foreseeable relevance was treated as a separate requirement, while in
                        <em>BJY</em>, this, as well as the other limitations on
                    the exchange of information under the EOI Standard, were subsumed under the
                    single broad enquiry of whether the making of an order for production was
                    justified in the circumstances of the case. Although there is little difference
                    in substance between them, in our judgment, the approach set out in <em>BJY</em> is to be preferred as it coheres with both the plain
                    language of s 105J(3)(a) which prescribes a single requirement of
                    justification; as well as the legislative intention underlying the statutory
                    regime, which was for the justification of a request to be assessed in the light
                    of the EOI Standard encapsulated in the relevant tax treaty.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     In our judgment, however, there is an anterior
                    question as to the material which this Court is both required and permitted to
                    consider in satisfying itself of the justification for a request. This was a
                    pivotal issue in the proceedings before us. As he did in the court below,
                    counsel for the Appellant, Mr Sundareswara Sharma (“Mr Sharma”),
                    made three principal arguments as to why an order for the production of the bank
                    statements would not be justified in the circumstances of the present case.
                    First, Mr Sharma contended that the requested information could not have been
                    obtained under Japanese law. Second, Mr Sharma contended that the JNTA had
                    failed to pursue all available means to obtain the bank statements in Japan
                    before making the request. Third, Mr Sharma contended that the request had
                    ceased to be foreseeably relevant to the enforcement of Japan’s income tax
                    laws as the JNTA had concluded its tax examination of the
                Appellant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     There was no real dispute that, on its face,
                    the JNTA’s request met the requirements of the Eighth Schedule. Each of Mr
                    Sharma’s arguments would instead have required the court to go behind the
                    JNTA’s statements in the Letter of Request as well as the subsequent
                    confirmations it provided. The Judge below rejected Mr Sharma’s arguments
                    in this regard. The Judge held that the justification for a request was to be
                    determined on the face of the request and whether it evidently complied with the
                    Eighth Schedule requirements. The Judge thought that in many respects, the High
                    Court’s role under the relevant statutory regime was an
                    “administrative one” and there was little room for the High Court
                    to examine the substantive merits of the Letter of Request (see Judgment at
                    [8]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     Before this Court, Mr Sharma was critical of
                    the Judge’s interpretation of the High Court’s role in this regard.
                    Mr Sharma contended that Parliament’s intention in enacting s 105J of the
                    ITA was to ensure that unjustified requests could be denied at two levels in the
                    case of protected information; the Comptroller would be the first level of
                    protection, while the High Court would be the second. Mr Sharma sought to
                    persuade us that the High Court’s role under s 105J both permitted and
                    required that it substantively review the Letter of Request and go behind the
                    statements made in it to satisfy itself that those statements were in fact true.
                    To make good these contentions, Mr Sharma relied on the Second Reading Speech
                    where the Minister said (at column 1621):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<em>Fishing expeditions can therefore be stopped at two
                            levels – first by [the Comptroller], then by the High Court if it
                            relates to information protected under the Banking Act and Trust
                            Companies Act</em>. This arrangement offers robust safeguards
                        without compromising on the efficiency and responsiveness of our information
                        exchange regime. It is in essence similar to the processes in other major
                        jurisdictions such as the US and the UK, and is not aimed at stifling the
                        effective exchange of information.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     While we agree that s 105J requires the High
                    Court to be independently satisfied as to the justification of a request, we do
                    not think it follows from the Minister’s statements that Parliament had
                    intended for the High Court to substantively review a request to the extent of
                    inquiring into the truth of the factual assertions contained in it. Taking a
                    purposive as well as a contextual interpretation of the statutory scheme, it
                    seems clear to us that Parliament had intended for the validity of a request to
                    be determined on its face. There are four broad reasons for this.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     First, it is clear from the relevant
                    parliamentary material that Parliament had intended for the justification of a
                    request to be assessed in light of the documentary requirements prescribed by
                    the Eighth Schedule. In this vein the Minister explained in the Second Reading
                    Speech that (at column 1607):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The new Eighth Schedule sets out the documentary requirements which a
                        requesting jurisdiction must fulfil for all requests. <em>These requirements ensure that requests are justified, that is, clear,
                            specific, relevant, legitimate and consistent with the
                            Standard</em>. They will help screen out “fishing
                        expeditions”.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     In written submissions, Mr Sharma appeared to
                    suggest that the Eighth Schedule requirements inherently contemplated that the
                    court would examine the veracity of statements contained in a request. In our
                    judgment, Mr Sharma’s contention is not borne out. It is manifestly clear
                    from a plain reading of the Eighth Schedule that it only requires a request to
                    include a <em>statement</em> to the effect of paragraphs 4,
                    7 and 8 of the Eight Schedule (see [30] above). In short, once a
                    “statement” to the requisite effect has been made by the
                    requesting authority, then it will have complied with those requirements of the
                    Eighth Schedule. In keeping with the Minister’s explanation as to the
                    rationale of the Eighth Schedule requirements (see [41] above), it seems to us
                    that once the Eighth Schedule is complied with, the justification of a request
                    in terms of its consistency with the EOI Standard will be determined without the
                    court going behind the statements made in it.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     Second, the interpretation advanced by the
                    Appellant produces anomalous results from a practical perspective. If s 105J
                    requires or permits the court to go behind the Letter of Request, there is a
                    real risk of applications made under s 105J of the ITA resulting in full trials
                    calling for the examination of witnesses and the determination of potentially
                    difficult questions of foreign law. This is a pertinent point even if, in
                    essence, a practical one, because although the Minister alluded to the
                    protection of taxpayer rights as being one of the aims of the statutory regime,
                    he also emphasised that this had to be balanced against the need to ensure that
                    the efficacy of the exchange of information machinery was not compromised (see
                    [39] above).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     Third, international comity would be
                    compromised if the Singapore court was required to make pronouncements that
                    could question the underlying <em>bona fides</em> of
                    requests made by foreign tax authorities. Would the foreign tax authority have
                    to appear in our court to prove the basis of its request? If not, how would its
                    right to be heard be secured before potentially adverse findings are
                    made?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     Fourth, in assessing the justification of a
                    request, the court must be cognisant of its function, which is to apply the
                    relevant provisions of the ITA. It must not step into the shoes of the
                    executive, which is the branch of government charged with the responsibility for
                    entering into and enforcing international agreements, including tax
                    treaties.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     We recently held in <em>Lim
                        Meng Suang and another v Attorney-General and another appeal and another
                        matter</em> [2015] 1 SLR 26 (“<em>Lim Meng
                        Suang</em>”) at [188] that international law and domestic law
                    are regarded in Singapore as separate systems of law. We take a dualist view of
                    the relationship between international law and domestic law.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     Under the dualist view, international law does
                    not form part of Singapore’s domestic law “until and unless it is
                    applied or definitively declared to be part of the domestic law by a domestic
                    court” in the case of customary international law (see <em>Lim Meng Suang</em> at [118]); or until it has been infused into
                    domestic law by legislation in the case of treaty obligations. In our judgment,
                    it is also a corollary of the dualist view that where legislation has been
                    passed to give effect to Singapore’s treaty obligations, the Singapore
                    court’s primary focus must be on applying the relevant provisions of the
                    domestic legislation and not specifically on enforcing the treaty.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     This is not to say that the treaty will never
                    inform the interpretation of the domestic legislation giving effect to it; as we
                    explained at [36] above, the EOI Standard encapsulated in the relevant tax
                    treaty is relevant to the issue of justification that is raised by
                    s 105J(3)(a) of the ITA. But it is not for us, in effect, to adjudicate the
                    validity, as a matter of international law (in this case the relevant treaty),
                    of a request made by a foreign tax authority of our tax authority. Indeed, the
                    EOI Standard contemplates interaction and cooperation between the executive arms
                    of the governments of the contracting states. If there are doubts concerning the
                    veracity of a request, it would fall to the Comptroller to resolve them through
                    diplomatic channels. But where the matter comes to the court, its role is to
                    assess the justification for the request on the face of the request. To the
                    extent that Mr Sharma’s submissions suggested the contrary, we find them
                    untenable.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The Temporal Scope of the Exchange of Information Regime</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     The Appellant’s next principal
                    contention on appeal was that the statutory regime implementing the Treaty did
                    not permit the disclosure of information relating to periods before:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_49-p2_a"></a>(a)     14 July 2010, this being the date on
                        which the Treaty was given effect as a “prescribed
                        arrangement” under s 105D(1) of the ITA by the 2010 Order ; or
                        alternatively</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_49-p2_b"></a>(b)     9
                        February 2010, this being the date on which the 2009 Amendments to the ITA
                        came into operation.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     Mr Sharma’s contentions on this issue
                    were as follows. First Mr Sharma relied on the rule of statutory interpretation
                    that statutes are presumed not to have retrospective effect. Mr Sharma pointed
                    out that the exchange of information regime that existed prior to the 2009
                    Amendments vis-à-vis Japan restricted the sharing of information to what was
                        <em>necessary</em>, as opposed to what was <em>foreseeably relevant</em>, for the enforcement of Japanese
                    income tax laws. Mr Sharma submitted that reading the exchange of information
                    regime as applying to information relating to periods before these dates would
                    be tantamount to giving it retrospective effect. In the absence of clear words
                    to indicate that this was what Parliament had intended, Mr Sharma submitted that
                    we should not adopt such a construction.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     Second Mr Sharma submitted that even if the
                    2010 Order was intended to operate retrospectively, it could not be made to do
                    so before 9 February 2010, this being the date the on which the 2009 Amendments
                    came into operation. In this regard, Mr Sharma cited s 23(2) of the
                    Interpretation Act (Cap 1, 2002 Rev Ed) which reads as follows:</p>

<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The law on the retrospective effect of legislation</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     We turn first to consider the law relating to
                    the retrospective effect of legislation.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     The temporal ambit or reach of any particular
                    piece of legislation is defined by two pertinent concepts: see Ruth Sullivan,
                        <em>Driedger on the Construction of Statutes</em>
                    (Butterworths, 3rd Ed, 1994) (“<em>Driedger</em>”) at p 486. The first is the temporal <em>operation</em> of legislation. This refers to the period
                    during which the legislation forms part of the law, from its commencement to its
                    repeal. In Singapore the temporal operation of legislation is to be determined
                    by reference to s 10(1) of the Interpretation Act which provides as
                    follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-Heading1">
<b>Time of commencement of written
                            law</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">10.—(1) A written law or a
                        provision of a written law shall come into operation —</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(<em>a</em>)    where a
                                particular day for its coming into operation is specified by the
                                written law or by a notification made under the written law, on the
                                expiration of the previous day; or</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(<em>b</em>)    where the day of
                                its coming into operation is the date of its publication in the
                                Gazette, on the expiration of the previous day.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">…</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>In the case of subsidiary legislation its temporal operation
                        is governed by s 23(1) of the Interpretation Act (see [51]
                        above).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     The second is the temporal <em>application</em> of legislation which refers to the period in which
                    events occur that are governed by the legislation during the time of its
                    operation. It is apposite for us to observe that the temporal application of
                    legislation will not always coincide with its temporal operation. For example,
                    legislation may apply to facts or events which have occurred before its
                    commencement, or more rarely, after its repeal.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     In relation to the temporal application of
                    legislation, it is an established common law principle of statutory
                    interpretation that courts will lean against interpreting statutes as having
                    retrospective application unless clear words are stated to this effect. In
                        <em>Maxwell v Murphy</em> (1957) 96 CLR 261
                        (“<em>Murphy</em>”), Dixon CJ famously
                    stated the principle as follows (at 267):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The general rule of the common law is that a statute changing the law
                        ought not, unless the intention appears with reasonable certainty, to be
                        understood <em>as applying to facts or events that have
                            already occurred in such a way as to confer or impose or otherwise
                            affect rights or liabilities which the law had defined by reference to
                            the past events</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     It will be evident from Dixon CJ’s
                        <em>dicta</em> that the principle does not entail
                    legislation being read in a manner where facts and events occurring before its
                    enactment will never fall within the scope of its temporal application. Instead,
                    the presumption against the retrospective application will only arise if the
                    application of the legislation to events occurring before its enactment would
                    lead to the legal consequences attaching to those events being
                altered.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     Where a statute is repealed, the principle is
                    also statutorily enshrined in s 16(1) of the Interpretation Act which reads as
                    follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>16.</b>—(1) Where a written
                        law repeals in whole or in part any other written law, then, <em>unless the contrary intention appears</em>, the repeal

                                not in force or existing at the time at which the repeal takes

<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(<em>b</em>)    affect the
                                previous operation of any written law so repealed or anything duly

<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(<em>c</em>)    affect any
                                right, privilege, obligation or liability acquired, accrued or

<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(<em>d</em>)    affect any
                                penalty, forfeiture or punishment incurred in respect of any offence
                                committed against any written law so repealed; or</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(<em>e</em>)    affect any
                                investigation, legal proceeding or remedy in respect of any such
                                right, privilege, obligation, liability, penalty, forfeiture or
                                punishment as aforesaid; and any such investigation, legal
                                proceeding or remedy may be instituted, continued or enforced, and
                                any such penalty, forfeiture or punishment may be imposed, as if the
                                repealing law had not been passed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a>58     The principle is said to rest upon the broader
                    maxim or presumption that parliament does not intend what is unjust or unfair:
                    see <em>Maxwell on the Interpretation of Statutes</em> (P
                    St J Langan gen ed) (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 12th Ed, 1969) at p 215. Likewise,
                        <em>Driedger</em> (at p 513) identifies the rule of law
                    as the basic tenet upon which the principle is based:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Because a retroactive law applies to past events, its practical effect is
                        to change the law that was applicable to those events at the time they
                        occurred. To change the law governing a matter after it has already passed
                        violates the rule of law. In fact, it makes compliance with the law
                        impossible. As Raz points out, the fundamental tenet on which the rule of
                        law is built is that in order to comply with the law, or rely on it in a
                        useful way, the subjects of the law have to know in advance what it is. By
                        definition, a retroactive law is unknowable until it is too late.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In short, retroactive legislation is undesirable because it is arbitrary
                        and tends to be unfair. It upsets plans and undermines expectations and it
                        may impose penalties or other disadvantages without fair warning. It is
                        helpful to have these reasons for disliking retroactivity in mind when
                        considering whether a particular application of legislation would be
                        condemned as retroactive.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>While we agree with the thrust of the author’s
                        observations, we would add that what we are ultimately concerned with here
                        is nothing more than a presumptive rule of statutory interpretation extant
                        under the common law, which may be rebutted by statements of legislative
                        intent to the contrary. It is not an immutable rule which fetters
                        Parliament’s power to pass retrospective
                legislation.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a>59     Although the basic presumption against the
                    retrospective application of legislation is easily stated in theory, its
                    practical application is fraught with difficulty. The case law on the
                    presumption has precipitated a highly technical and formulaic body of rules
                    which are not always readily reconcilable. Broadly speaking there are three
                    rules of note.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a>60     The first rule states that there is a
                    distinction between, on the one hand, statutes which have a prior effect on past
                    events, and, on the other, statutes which have future operation based on past
                    events. The presumption against the retrospective application of legislation is
                    said to arise in relation to the former but not the latter class of
                    statutes.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a>61     A frequently cited case on point is <em>In re A Solicitor’s Clerk</em> [1957] 1 WLR 1219. There
                    a solicitor’s clerk was convicted of charges of larceny in 1953. As the
                    law stood at the time of his conviction, an order prohibiting him from being
                    employed as a solicitor’s clerk could not be made because his conviction
                    for larceny did not involve stealing from his employer or his employer’s
                    client. The law was later amended to permit such an order to be made for
                        <em>any</em> conviction of larceny. The
                    solicitor’s clerk argued that to apply the amendment to him would be to
                    give it retrospective effect. This argument was rejected by the English Court of
                    Appeal. The court held (at 1222–1223) that the statute did not involve any
                    retrospective application; rather it had future operation only, even if its
                    operation depended on conduct which had happened in the past.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_62"></a>62     The principle relied on in <em>In re A Solicitor’s Clerk</em> has received endorsement in
                    cases and academic commentary: in relation to case law where the principle was
                    applied see the decision of the Full Federal Court of Australia in <em>La Macchia v Minister for Primary Industry</em> (1986) 72 ALR
                    23; in relation to academic commentary see Dennis C Pearce &amp; Robert S
                    Geddes, <em>Statutory Interpretation in Australia</em>
                    (LexisNexis, 7th Ed, 2011) (“<em>Statutory Interpretation
                        in Australia</em>”) at pp 324–325; see also Francis A R
                    Bennion, <em>Bennion on Statutory Interpretation</em>
                    (LexisNexis, 5th Ed, 2008) at p 317.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_63"></a>63     In our judgment, while the basic premise for
                    the principle in <em>In re A Solicitor’s Clerk</em>
                    is apparent, which is that the presumption does not arise unless the application
                    of the statute to past events would alter the legal consequences which those
                    events have (see our discussion at [56] above), its application in the case may
                    be questionable. After all, at the time of his conviction, the person concerned
                    could be employed as a clerk. He lost that right after the legislation came into
                    force on account of what he had done prior to the legislation coming into force.
                    In this respect, <em>In re A Solicitor’s Clerk</em>
                    may be contrasted with the Victorian case of <em>Bakker v
                        Stewart</em> [1980] VR 17 (“<em>Bakker</em>”). In <em>Bakker</em>, the
                    law was amended to remove the power of the court to grant bail to persons
                    convicted of drink-driving offences. The court held that the amendment did not
                    apply to persons who had committed an offence before the amendment. The court
                    reasoned that to hold otherwise would be tantamount to retrospectively
                    increasing the penalty for such offences. To this extent, <em>In
                        re A Solicitor’s Clerk</em> is not readily distinguishable. It
                    seems probable that the court took the view that it did because it recognised
                    that the purpose of the legislation in that case, which was the protection of
                    the public, required that the legislation be read as applying to the solicitor
                    clerk’s previous convictions. While this is entirely sensible, it does not
                    seem principled if one were to insist on a strict application of these
                    rules.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_64"></a>64     The second rule states that there is a
                    distinction between statutes affecting substantive rights and those regulating
                    matters of procedure only. Unlike the former, procedural enactments are
                        <em>presumed</em> to apply to both pending and future
                    actions: <em>Wright v Hale</em> (1860) 6 H &amp; N 227 at
                    232.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_65"></a>65     At a general level, this distinction between
                    substance and procedure is readily understandable. Procedural statutes regulate
                    the pursuit of remedies while substantive statutes are those which define the
                    rights and liabilities of parties that give rise to those remedies. However, the
                    distinction is not always easily drawn in practice. Legislation relating to
                    limitation periods and the right of appeal are apt illustrations of the point.
                    Furthermore, the application of a procedural statute to proceedings pending at
                    the time of its enactment can conceivably result in unfairness, thereby
                    requiring the presumption to be modified: see <em>Statutory
                        Interpretation in Australia</em> at p 337.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_66"></a>66     The third rule states that there is a
                    distinction between legislation which has retrospective effect and legislation
                    which prospectively interferes with vested rights (sometimes referred to as
                    “existing rights”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_67"></a>67     In <em>West v Gwynne</em>
                    [1911] 2 Ch 1 (“<em>West v Gwynne</em>”),
                    Buckley LJ explained the distinction in the following terms (at
                    11–12):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Retrospective operation is one matter. Interference with existing rights
                        is another. If any Act provides that as at a past date the law shall be
                        taken to have been that which it was not, that Act I understand to be
                        retrospective. That is not this case. The question here…is as to the
                        ambit and the scope of the Act, and not to the date as from which the new
                        law, as enacted by the Act, is to be taken to have been the law.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_68"></a>68     In the Canadian case of <em>Gustavson Drilling (1964) Ltd v Minister of National Revenue</em>
                    [1977] 1 SCR 271 (“<em>Gustavson
                    Drilling</em>”), the issue was whether a taxpayer could make
                    deductions against its liability to pay income tax for certain expenses incurred
                    before 1960 when the Act was amended in 1962 to repeal the availability of such
                    deductions for tax years after 1962. A majority of the Canadian Supreme Court
                    rejected that argument that the repealing legislation was retrospective. In this
                    regard, Dickson J observed that (at 282–283):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It is perfectly obvious that most statutes in some way or other interfere
                        with or encroach upon antecedent rights, and taxing statutes are no
                        exception. … No one has a vested right to the continuance of the law
                        as it stood in the past; in tax law it is imperative that legislation
                        conform to changing social needs and governmental policy. A taxpayer may
                        plan his financial affairs in reliance on the tax laws remaining the same;
                        he takes the risk that the legislation may be changed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>This observation was, however, prefaced by another observation
                        (at 282):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The rule is that a statute should not be given a construction that would
                        impair existing rights as regards person or property unless the language in
                        which it is couched requires such a construction. … The presumption
                        that vested rights are not affected unless the intention of the legislature
                        is clear applies whether the legislation is retrospective or prospective in
                        operation. A prospective enactment may be bad if it affects vested rights
                        and does not do so in unambiguous terms.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_69"></a>69     
          <em>Gustavson
                        Drilling</em> therefore established two presumptions. The first being
                    the traditional presumption against legislation having retrospective effect; and
                    the second (albeit weaker presumption) being that legislation is presumed not to
                    prospectively interfere with <em>vested or accrued</em>
                    rights. Put in simple terms, the legislature is thus presumed not to have
                    intended to interfere with vested rights, whether prospectively or
                    retrospectively. This aspect of <em>Gustavson Drilling</em>
                    was endorsed by Lord Rodger of Earlsferry in <em>Wilson v First
                        County Trust Ltd (No 2)</em> [2004] 1 AC 816 (“<em>Wilson</em>”) at [191]–[195]. Lord
                    Rodger’s observations in <em>Wilson</em> have also
                    been endorsed by Lord Neuberger of Abbotsbury in <em>Odelola v
                        Secretary for State for the Home Department</em> [2009] 1 WLR 1230
                        (“<em>Odelola</em>”) at
                [48].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_70"></a>70     The utility of the approach adopted in the
                    line of cases discussed above is not immediately apparent. For a start, it blurs
                    the distinction between the temporal operation and application of legislation
                    (see especially Buckley LJ’s dicta in <em>West v
                        Gywnne</em> at [67] above). Next, it entails the often tenuous enquiry
                    of whether a particular right is a “vested right”. As Lord Rodger
                    observed in <em>Wilson</em> (at [196]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… The courts have tried, without conspicuous success, to define
                        what is meant by “vested rights” for this purpose. … It
                        is not easy to reconcile all the decisions. This lends weight to the
                        criticism that the reasoning in them is essentially circular: the courts
                        have tended to attach the somewhat woolly label “vested” to
                        those rights which they conclude should be protected from the effect of the
                        new legislation.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_71"></a>71     Finally, it entails the further and equally
                    difficult enquiry as to whether a particular reading of the statute affects
                    vested rights prospectively or retrospectively. This in turn affects the
                    strength of the presumption to be applied. In our judgment, these considerations
                    distract from what these cases are really concerned with, which is whether a
                    particular statute has temporal <em>application</em> to
                    past or future facts and events. The answer to this must depend largely on the
                    interpretation of the statute and the presumption is merely one factor to be
                    taken into account by the court in making this broader
                determination.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_72"></a>72     It is therefore unsurprising that courts have
                    attempted to distance themselves from the technical rules which have come to
                    plague the presumption. Instead there has been a discernible shift towards
                    applying the presumption on the broad basis of fairness. The water-shed decision
                    in this regard was that of Staughton LJ in <em>Secretary of State
                        for Social Security and another v Tunnicliffe</em> [1991] 2 All ER 712
                        (“<em>Tunnicliffe</em>”) where it was
                    stated (at 724):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[T]he true principle is that Parliament is presumed not to have intended
                        to alter the law applicable to past events and transactions in a manner
                        which is unfair to those concerned in them, unless a contrary intention
                        appears. It is not simply a question of classifying an enactment as
                        retrospective or not retrospective. Rather it may well be a matter of degree
                        – the greater the unfairness, the more it is expected that Parliament
                        will make it clear if that is intended.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_73"></a>73     In <em>L’Office Chefifien
                        Des Phosphates and another v Yamashita-Shinnihon Steamship Co Ltd</em>
                    [1994] 1 AC 486 (“<em>Yamashita-Shinnihon Steamship Co
                        Ltd</em>”), Lord Mustill cast similar doubts on the reliability
                    of generalised presumptions and maxims in determining legislative intent. He
                    observed (at 524–525) that such maxims had the propensity of confining the
                    court to a perspective which treated all statutes and the situations to which
                    they applied as the same. As Staughton LJ did in <em>Tunnicliffe</em>, Lord Mustill noted (at 525) that the basis for the
                    presumption against retrospectivity was simple fairness. In this regard, Lord
                    Mustill observed that the application of the presumption might be hindered by a
                    formulaic approach which itself tended to become the subject of minute analysis
                    when what ought to be analysed is the statute itself. On the issue of fairness,
                    Lord Mustill made this pertinent observation (at 525–526):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Precisely how the <em>single question of fairness will be
                            answered</em> in respect of a particular statute <em>will depend on the interaction of several factors</em>,
                        each of them capable of varying from case to case. Thus, the degree to which
                        the statute has retrospective effect is not a constant. Nor is the value of
                        the rights which the statute affects, or the extent to which that value is
                        diminished or extinguished by the retrospective effect of the statute.
                        Again, the unfairness of adversely affecting the rights, and hence the
                        degree of unlikelihood that this is what Parliament intended, will vary from
                        case to case. So also will the clarity of the language used by Parliament,
                        and the light shed on it by consideration of the circumstances in which the
                        legislation was enacted. All these factors must be weighed together to
                        provide a direct answer to the question whether the consequences of reading
                        the statute with the suggested degree of retrospectivity are so unfair that
                        the words used by Parliament cannot have been intended to mean what they
                        might appear to say.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">My Lords, whilst the approach which I propose involves a single
                        indivisible question, to be answered largely as a matter of impression, it

                    observation (at [52]–[53]) as to how legislative purpose was to be
                    determined:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">52    The contemporary
                            approach to the determination of parliamentary intention – in the
                            objective sense of intention employed in the law of statutory
                            interpretation – is no longer formulaic in the manner sometimes
                            suggested by lists of “canons” or
                            “principles” of statutory interpretation.

                            are employed to determine the intention of parliament, in the same way
                            as the High Court identified …:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">The existence of the purpose is ascertained by reference to the

                                (<em>Project Blue Sky Inc v Australian Broadcasting
                                Authority</em> [1998] HCA 28; (1998) 194 CLR 355 at
                            [91])</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_75"></a>75     In our judgment these observations are
                    particularly apposite in the Singapore context where s 9A(1) of the
                    Interpretation Act requires that a purposive approach be taken in statutory
                    interpretation. Moreover, as we reiterated in <em>Dorsey James
                        Michael v World Sport Group Pte Ltd</em> [2013] 3 SLR 354 at [18] and
                        <em>BFC Development LLP v Comptroller of Property
                        Tax</em> [2014] 2 SLR 462 at [14], the purposive approach which is
                    mandated by s 9A(1) takes precedence over all common law rules of statutory
                    interpretation. The latter may prove more relevant to <em>confirm</em> the court’s understanding of the purpose of the
                    statute in question, such as where the application of these rules and maxims of
                    construction produces a conclusion that coincides with the evident purpose of
                    the law in question; or if ambiguity in interpretation of the written law
                    persists even after an attempt at purposive interpretation has been properly
                    made: see also <em>Public Prosecutor v Low Kok Heng</em>
                    [2007] 4 SLR(R) 183 at [41].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_76"></a>76     To put this in the context of the presumption
                    against the retrospective application of legislation, we conclude that the
                    purposive approach should be applied to determine questions pertaining to the
                    temporal application of the legislation. This will entail a single overarching
                    enquiry as to parliamentary intent and that will be found in the words of the
                    law, its context and the relevant extrinsic aids to statutory interpretation.
                    Only if ambiguity persists on a purposive interpretation may recourse be had to
                    the various presumptions. In this regard we endorse Lord Mustill’s
                    formulation of the presumption in <em>Yamashita-Shinnihon
                        Steamship Co Ltd</em> (at [73] above), which in our view possesses
                    both the simplicity and the flexibility needed to reach a sensible result in
                    these cases.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Did the exchange of information regime apply to information relating
                to past periods?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_77"></a>77     Keeping with the approach we have identified
                    above (at [75]–[76]), in our judgment, the relevant issue of statutory
                    interpretation concerned whether the exchange of information regime applied to
                    information relating to periods before the Treaty was given effect as a
                    “prescribed arrangement” under the ITA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_78"></a>78     In submitting that the regime did not limit
                    the temporal scope of the information which could be exchanged under the Treaty,
                    counsel for the Comptroller, Mr Vikna Rajah (“Mr Rajah”) referred
                    us to s 105D(1) of the ITA which provides that a competent authority under a
                    prescribed arrangement could make a request for information concerning the
                    “tax position” of any person. “Tax position” is
                    defined in s 105A(1) of the ITA as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">“tax position”, in relation to a person, means
                        the person’s position —</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(<em>a</em>) as regards any tax
                            —</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-3">(i) of the country with whose government the avoidance of double
                                taxation arrangement or EOI arrangement in question was made;
                                and</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-3">(ii) that is covered by the EOI provisions of the avoidance of
                                double taxation arrangement or by the EOI arrangement;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(<em>b</em>) as regards
                            —</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-3">(i) past, present and future liability to pay any tax referred to
                                in paragraph (<em>a</em>);</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-3">(ii) penalties, interest and other amounts that have been paid, or
                                are or may be payable, by or to the person in connection with any
                                such tax; and</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-3">(iii) claims, elections, applications and notices that have been
                                or may be made or given in connection with any such tax.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_79"></a>79     In this regard Mr Rajah also drew our
                    attention to s 105A(3) which provides that “reference[s]…to the
                    tax position of a person are to his position at <em>any period of
                        time or in relation to any period</em>, <em>unless
                        otherwise stated in the prescribed arrangement in question</em>
                    [emphasis added]”. Mr Rajah pointed out that unlike certain other tax
                    treaties which Singapore had entered into, the Treaty did not contain provisions
                    limiting the temporal scope of the information which could be exchanged under
                    it.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_80"></a>80     Mr Rajah also referred to commentary on the
                    EOI Standard by the OECD Council (see <em>Update to Article 26 of
                        the OECD Model Tax Convention and its Commentary</em> (17 July 2012))
                    which states (at para [10.3]) that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<em>Nothing in this Convention prevents the application of
                            the provisions of the Article to the exchange of information that
                            existed prior to the entry into force of the Convention, as long as
                            assistance with respect to this information is provided after the
                            Convention has entered into force and the provisions of the Article have
                            become effective</em>. Contracting states may find it useful,
                        however, to clarify the extent to which the provisions of the Article are
                        applicable to such information, in particular when the provisions of that
                        convention will have effect with respect to taxes arising or levied from a
                        certain time.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_81"></a>81     In our judgment, both these points make it
                    clear that Parliament had intended to permit the exchange of information
                    relating to <em>any</em> period both before and after the
                    date on which the Treaty was given effect as a “prescribed
                    arrangement” under s 105D(1) of the ITA (<em>ie</em> 14 July 2010) as well as the date on which the 2009
                    amendments to the ITA came into force (<em>ie</em> 9 Feb
                    2010). The point really was that present request could only be made after the
                    Treaty had been given effect as a prescribed arrangement, but once made, the
                    request could relate to information pertaining to an earlier period. Put simply,
                    the temporal scope of information which can be exchanged under the exchange of
                    information regime under the ITA is unlimited save for where a contrary
                    provision is made under the relevant tax treaty. It was noted that this has been
                    done in some tax treaties but not in the present.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_82"></a>82     In the circumstances recourse to the
                    presumption against the retrospective application of legislation was both
                    unnecessary and inappropriate. Mr Sharma’s submissions on this issue
                    therefore did not leave any impression on us.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Was the Making of the Order Justified in the Circumstances of the
                Case?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_83"></a>83     Having considered the relevant legal
                    principles, we come to the core issue arising in this case before us, that is,
                    whether the making of an order for production of the bank statements in terms of
                    the Comptroller’s application was justified in the circumstances of the
                    case.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_84"></a>84     As we alluded to earlier, the
                    Appellant’s contentions in this regard were effectively premised upon this
                    Court being able to substantively review the Letter of Request and go behind the
                    facts stated in it. To this end, we have already said that the Appellant’s
                    contentions were untenable. As we noted at [33]–[48] above the issue of
                    the justification for a request is to be determined on the face of the
                    request.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_85"></a>85     Keeping with those principles we were
                    satisfied that the Letter of Request contained all the information prescribed by
                    the Eighth Schedule. It clearly identified the Appellant as the taxpayer in
                    issue. The purpose of the request was also clearly stated, this being to
                    determine whether the Appellant had failed to declare income from foreign
                    investment funds for the purpose of assessing his income tax. In relation to the
                    bank statements, it was also clearly explained how each of the bank accounts for
                    which statements had been sought were considered relevant to the purpose
                    underlying the request.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_86"></a>86     In the circumstances, because the Eighth
                    Schedule requirements had been met, we were also satisfied that the standard of
                    foreseeable relevance under Art 26(1) of the Treaty had been met. Plainly, it
                    could not be said that the JNTA’s request constituted a fishing expedition
                    on the face of it. Indeed Mr Sharma did not contend that, on the face of the
                    request, there was no nexus between the purpose of the request and the bank
                    statements sought. Rather his main contention was that the information had
                    ceased to be relevant as the JNTA had concluded the Appellant’s tax
                    examination and no longer required the information. In view of the JNTA’s
                    confirmations on 20 May and 16 July 2013 that they still required the
                    information, we found Mr Sharma’s arguments in this respect
                    untenable.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_87"></a>87     There were also no grounds for us to refuse to
                    order the production of information flowing from Art 26(3) of the Treaty. In
                    this regard it sufficed that the Letter of Request included a <em>statement</em> confirming that the JNTA was authorised to obtain the
                    information under Japanese law and a <em>statement</em>
                    confirming that the JNTA had pursued all available means in Japan to obtain the
                    requested information. This was precisely what was stipulated in paragraphs 7
                    and 8 of the Eighth Schedule.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_88"></a>88     It follows that an order for the production of
                    the bank statements for the eight accounts identified in the Letter of Request
                    was justified in the circumstances of the case. However, as we noted at [9]
                    above, the Comptroller’s application in OS 331, and the order of court
                    made below pursuant to it, was in fact wider than this; it applied to bank
                    statements for <em>all</em> accounts held with the Bank by
                    the account holders in question. As stated in s 105J(1)(<em>a</em>)(ii) of the ITA, the Comptroller may only apply for an order
                    from the court pursuant to s 105J(2) “in order to comply with a
                    request [for information]”. Any application therefore cannot go beyond
                    the ambit of the request. When we raised the issue with Mr Rajah, he readily
                    conceded that the terms of the order should be limited to the original request.
                    In our judgment this concession was properly made. We therefore amended the
                    order of court made below to reflect the original request made by the
                    JNTA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_89"></a>89     Finally, we note Mr Sharma’s alternative
                    submission that even if we were not minded to disturb the order of court made
                    below we should grant a stay on its execution until the Japan Proceedings were
                    determined. In our judgment, this submission was misconceived. To begin with, Mr
                    Sharma did not identify any basis, whether statutory or common law, under which
                    we had the power to make such an order which seems to us to be anomalous at
                    first blush and contrary to the scheme for the exchange of information in this
                    context. Moreover, and in line with our discussion at [45]–[48] above, the
                    court’s role under s 105J(3)(a) of the ITA is limited to being satisfied
                    of the justification of the request. Once it is so satisfied, the decision as to
                    whether to transmit the information to the foreign tax authorities lies with the
                    Comptroller and not the court.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The Position of the Other Account Holders on Appeal</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_90"></a>90     This leaves for us to consider the position of
                    the other account holders on appeal. In this regard, Mr Sharma contended that
                    the Judge had wrongly refused the other account holders leave to intervene. This
                    was on the basis that each of their applications raised matters which were
                    peculiar to them. According to Mr Sharma this was a further reason why we should
                    set aside the order of court made below.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_91"></a>91     In our judgment, Mr Sharma was precluded from
                    raising this issue on appeal. If the other account holders were aggrieved by the
                    Judge’s decision to dismiss their applications for leave to intervene,
                    they ought to have appealed that decision. Given their failure to do so there
                    was nothing before us on the point.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_92"></a>92     For all the reasons stated above, we dismissed
                    the appeal with costs save to the extent that the order of court made below is
                    to be varied to reflect the original request made by the JNTA. We also made the
                    usual consequential orders.</p>
