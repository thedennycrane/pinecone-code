</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">In these cross-appeals, the Rams’ right to live in a property at Poole Road owned by Mr Navin (“the Poole Road Property”) is also in issue. We note that <br/>Mrs Ram did not sign the 2006 MOU although she was named as a party to it. Nonetheless, nothing in this judgment turns on that fact.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">3 In our judgment, the core issue in these cross-appeals is the validity of the August 2015 Deed. This is because the August 2015 Deed was a settlement agreement that was intended to resolve the disputes which had arisen between the Rams and the Navins. Consequently, it follows that some of the claims brought by the Rams in the Suit, which were premised<span class="font-italic"> </span>on these disputes, cannot be sustained <span class="font-italic">if </span>the August 2015 Deed is found to be valid. The Judge, however, set aside the August 2015 Deed on the basis that Mr Navin had failed to disclose a material fact. In brief terms, the Judge held that since the August 2015 Deed was a family arrangement, the parties were subject to a duty to disclose material facts. In the present case, Mr Navin had invested Mr Ram’s moneys in bonds (“the Bonds”) from 2010,

</div> although the actual amount invested for <br/>Mr Ram was in dispute. According to the Judge, the material fact which had not been disclosed by Mr Navin was Mr Ram’s share of the sale proceeds from the Bonds (“the sale proceeds”): GD at [79]. The Judge found that Mr Ram had contributed 89.55% of the funds used to purchase the Bonds and that his entitlement was US$3,442,378.29: GD at [197]. This fact was not disclosed by Mr Navin to Mr Ram. The August 2015 Deed was set aside under those circumstances.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">4 Having carefully considered the parties’ submissions, we find that <br/>Mr Navin did <span class="font-italic">not</span> breach any duty of disclosure owed to the Rams. Accordingly, we reverse the Judge’s decision to set aside the August 2015 Deed. In our view, it is also questionable whether the parties owed a duty of disclosure to one another, notwithstanding that the August 2015 Deed was a family arrangement. Nevertheless, we leave that issue for determination on a future occasion as it need not be determined in the present case given our finding that there is no breach of any such duty. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">5 In relation to the remaining findings of the Judge, we are satisfied that the threshold for appellate intervention is not met in the present case.

Mr Navin, on the other hand, is a Singapore citizen and therefore capable of purchasing residential property without regulatory approval. Mr Navin started working in Evergreen from the middle of 1991 after completing his full-time National Service. On <br/>13 March 1993, Mr Navin, then 23 years old, exercised an option to purchase the Poole Road Property for S$2.88m: GD ([1] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>)<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [9] and [11]–[13]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">8 Two days after he did so, Mr Navin applied to the Land Dealings (Approval) Unit (“LDU”) for Mr Ram and him to hold title to the Poole Road Property as tenants in common having a 65% (Mr Ram) and 35% interest <br/>(Mr Navin) respectively.

However, the Rams alleged that in February 2016, the Navins had given the family’s driver and domestic helpers instructions not to serve or help the Rams or to allow them to use the family’s cars. It was also alleged that the Navins had installed locks on common areas of the home, such as the television room, store room and fridge, to prevent access by the Rams, who were effectively confined to their bedroom.

</div> On the part of the Navins, closed-circuit television footage was shown at the trial in an attempt to demonstrate Mr Ram’s allegedly unreasonable behaviour while living at the Poole Road Property. On 12 July 2016, Mrs Navin obtained an expedited protection order against Mr Ram on the basis that there was imminent danger of family violence being committed against her children. This order was later discharged since, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, Mrs Navin had only proven one incident of family violence committed against her, which did not include physical violence, and Mr Ram had confirmed that he would not return to the Poole Road Property while the Navins lived there: GD at [37]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">11 The police were also called on a number of occasions. On 14 July 2016, the police were called, allegedly because Mr Navin’s sister had arranged for a masseuse to visit the Poole Road Property to give Mrs Ram a massage but <br/>Mr Navin did not want illegal helpers working at the Poole Road Property. On 31 July 2016, the police were called again after Mr Ram reacted to something Mr Navin had said by pulling down his pants and exposing himself in front of Mrs Navin and her son. Mr Ram returned the next day, and Mr Navin called the police again. Subsequently, the Rams were arrested and charged with criminal trespass. Allegedly, the Rams have not been able to access the Poole Road Property to retrieve their belongings since then.

</div></div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Mr Navin agreed to the Rams’ request to transfer to Mrs Ram 7,300 shares in an Indian company called Janson Engineering Company Pte Ltd; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) the parties agreed that “from now on, [they would] each retain the assets held in [their] respective names and [would] be free to deal with the same in any manner”.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Decision below</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The August 2015 Deed and the September 2015 Agreement</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 The Rams challenged the validity of the August 2015 Deed on various grounds but succeeded only on the ground of material non-disclosure by <br/>Mr Navin. The August 2015 Deed was therefore set aside by the Judge on that basis. The Judge also set aside the September 2015 Agreement as it merely confirmed that a full and final settlement had been reached under the August 2015 Deed, and it thus stood or fell with the August 2015 Deed: GD at [80]. As this forms the core issue in this judgment, we will examine the Judge’s reasoning in greater detail below. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The 2006 MOU</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 As the Judge set aside the August 2015 Deed, the next issue before the Judge was whether the 2006 MOU was binding on the parties. In gist, the Judge found that the 2006 MOU was binding, and that the parties had the intention to create legal relations: GD at [83]. The presumption that parties have no intention to create legal relations in social and domestic arrangements was rebutted on the facts of the present case: GD at [85]–[90].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 As a result, the Judge ordered that Mr Navin comply with his various obligations under the 2006 MOU, including the payment of the Annual Allowance. Another consequence of the Judge’s upholding of the 2006 MOU was that the Rams had a contractual licence to stay at the Poole Road Property with full comforts for the rest of their lives. However, the Judge held that this was subject to an implied term that they did not misbehave in such a way as would make it unreasonable for them to insist on staying at the Poole Road Property (“the Implied Term”). Mr Ram was found to have breached the Implied Term, and the Judge held that Mr Navin was entitled to revoke Mr Ram’s contractual licence to stay at the Poole Road Property. On the other hand, the Judge found that Mrs Ram had decided on her own not to continue residing at the Poole Road Property, and accordingly, that Mr Navin had not breached the contractual licence in respect of Mrs Ram either: GD at [117] and [118].</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The Poole Road Property</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 Turning to the Rams’ claims relating to the Poole Road Property, the Judge found that while it was Mr Ram who had paid for the Poole Road Property (GD ([1] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) at [98]), there was no evidence of the alleged common understanding for the Rams to have an irrevocable right to live in the Poole Road Property: GD at [109]. Mr Ram’s proprietary estoppel plea was therefore dismissed: GD at [119]. Finally, the Judge dismissed the claims for a declaration that Mr Navin held the Poole Road Property on remedial constructive trust for the Rams as the basis for this claim had not been established: GD at [120]. The Judge also dismissed the claim that the Navins conspired to remove or constructively evict the Rams from the Poole Road Property as the evidence in totality fell short of establishing any conspiracy: GD at [127]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 With regard to the claims for conversion or detinue, the Judge found that the Rams had not produced any evidence that Mr Navin had converted or failed to return certain items which had been left at the Poole Road Property to them, and accordingly dismissed these claims: GD at [129].</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The January 2015 SPA</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 In relation to the January 2015 SPA, the Judge dismissed Mrs Ram’s attempts to rely on undue influence, economic duress, unconscionability, <span class="font-italic">non est</span><span class="font-italic"> factum</span> and misrepresentation to set it aside. Mrs Ram had also contended that there was a lack of consideration under the January 2015 SPA. The Judge held that the January 2015 SPA was a valid sale of Mrs Ram’s shares to <br/>Mr Navin and that Mrs Ram had received valid consideration from Mr Navin amounting to US$1.962m: GD at [209]. The Judge also held that Mrs Ram’s shares were not held on trust for Mr Ram: GD at [208]. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Conclusions reached by the Judge</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 Accordingly, for the reasons above, the Judge reached the following conclusions (GD at [215]):</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The August 2015 Deed was set aside on the ground of material non-disclosure. The September 2015 Agreement was also set aside as it was to be read in conjunction with the August 2015 Deed. Consequently, Mr Ram was ordered to return the sum of US$2m under the August 2015 Deed to Mr Navin, subject to a set-off against amounts that Mr Navin had been ordered to pay Mr Ram;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The 2006 MOU was found to be legally binding and thus:</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(i) Mr Navin was ordered to pay the Rams the arrears of the Annual Allowance and to continue paying the Rams the Annual Allowance as stipulated in the 2006 MOU;</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(ii) Mr Navin was ordered to pay Mrs Ram to the extent of US$1m upon receipt of notice in writing that she desired to acquire a residential property;</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(iii) The Rams had a contractual licence to live in the Poole Road Property with full comforts for the rest of their lives subject to the Implied Term. However, Mr Ram had breached the Implied Term and was not entitled to live in the Poole Road Property. Mrs Ram had chosen not to stay at the Poole Road Property voluntarily. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Mr Navin was found to hold the sum of US$3,442,378.29 being Mr Ram’s share of the sale proceeds on trust for Mr Ram, and was ordered to pay this sum to Mr Ram. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 For completeness, we note that Mr Ram also succeeded on his claim against the Navins for minority oppression under s 216 of the Companies Act (Cap 50, 2006 Rev Ed) in relation to Evergreen and the Navins were ordered to buy out his shares in Evergreen at fair value, with no discount: GD ([1] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) at [215(d)].

There were only two material facts that the Judge ought to have been concerned with: the quantum of the sale proceeds and Mr Ram’s share of those proceeds.

</div>
</div>
</div> we stated as follows at [63]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Both the tendency to uphold family arrangements if they have been entered into fairly, as well as the readiness to invalidate them in the stated circumstances stem from the fact that family arrangements are agreements between members of the same family, and <span class="font-italic">very often, the parties do not deal with each other on a commercial basis or at arm’s length</span>. As Prakash J stated in [<span class="font-italic">Pek</span><span class="font-italic"> Nam Kee v Peh Lam Kong </span>[1994] 2 SLR(R) 750], <span class="font-italic">such arrangements are often “founded on sentiment rather than commerce”</span> (at [108]). The parties to a family arrangement <span class="font-italic">may repose a certain degree of trust</span> in the counterparties to the agreement. Additionally, since family arrangements are ostensibly for the greater good of the family, <span class="font-italic">the parties may be more willing not to insist on their strict legal rights so that the family </span><span class="font-italic">benefits as a whole</span>. Given these circumstances, there is a duty on all the parties to a family arrangement to make full disclosure, before the arrangement is entered into, of all material facts known to them so that no party’s ignorance of the true state of affairs is taken advantage of. [emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 In essence, the law presumes that parties to a family arrangement repose a certain degree of trust and confidence in one another, such that there is an obligation to make full and frank disclosure of all material facts. In such domestic arrangements the contracting parties may be led to believe, simply by virtue of their relationship, that the counterparty can be trusted not to take advantage of their ignorance, and to similarly negotiate on the basis of sentiment and the greater good of the family. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 The question then arises whether a duty of disclosure ought to be imposed on parties to a family arrangement even where there is a lack of trust and confidence between them. We note that the proposition expressed in <span class="font-italic">Halsbury </span>which the Judge relied on, was expressed with a qualification in William Williamson Kerr, <span class="font-italic">A Treatise on the Law of Fraud and Mistake as administered in Courts of Equity </span>(William Maxwell &amp; Son, 1st ed, 1868) (“<span class="font-italic">Kerr</span>”), where it was stated at pp 79–80:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">A party to a compromise who has knowledge of a fact, must not take upon himself to decide that the suppressed fact is immaterial, if it could by any possibility have had any influence on the decision of the other party … If the compromise is a transaction in the nature of a family arrangement, or if, under the circumstances of the case, it was the duty of the one party to see that the nature of the transaction was fully explained to the other, these principles apply with peculiar force … <span class="font-italic">But if the parties to a family arrangement are not on good terms, and are really at arms’ length, the ordinary rules as to disclosure in family arrangements have no place </span>… [emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 As authority for the qualification above, the author cited the decision of the House of Lords in <span class="font-italic">Irvine v Kirkpatrick</span> (1850) 7 Bell 186. <span class="font-italic">Irvine </span>concerned a dispute between siblings. One brother, Charles, had died and was survived by two brothers, Walter and Christopher Irvine, and four sisters. Walter purchased his sisters’ interests in Charles’s estate through two deeds. The House of Lords acknowledged at 208 that these consisted of a family arrangement<span class="font-italic"> </span>between Walter and his four sisters. However, it was stated that there was no issue of non-disclosure given that the parties were negotiating “at arm’s length” and were “not [on] good terms with one another”. In our view, <span class="font-italic">Irvine </span>was an example of a case where there was an absence of trust and confidence between the counterparties. The relevant passage at 209 reads:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The object of this arrangement was, on the part of Walter, to obtain from his sisters the surrender of all right to their share of the personalty of Charles their deceased brother; and the question, and the only question raised by the action was, whether, in order to obtain this benefit for himself, he fraudulently misrepresented or fraudulently concealed matters to induce his sisters to enter into that arrangement, and whether such misrepresentation or concealment, or both, operating upon them, induced them to execute the deeds in question? <span class="font-italic">And here I must stop to remove out of the cause that which has not been dwelt upon except as a topic in argument occasionally, but I which I consider in the circumstances of the case to have little or no place, namely, that this is in the nature of a family arrangement, </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">for I conceive that a family arrangement between parties who were treating really at arm’s length, who were not upon good terms with each other (at least two of the sisters, as they state, were not upon good terms with their brother Walter), has little or no place, and above all where fraud is alleged. That matter, therefore, I at once throw out of the cause.</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>[emphasis added in italics and bold italics]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 For completeness, we note that in S E Williams, <span class="font-italic">Kerr on Fraud and Mistake </span>(Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 6th Ed, 1929), a later edition of <span class="font-italic">Kerr</span>, the italicised sentence at [54] was removed. It is unclear to us why this was done. In our view, nothing turns on this and we are unaware of any decision that has overruled the principle in <span class="font-italic">Irvine</span>.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 The thrust of the foregoing analysis appears to be that where the underlying rationale for the duty of disclosure in family arrangements is not engaged, the duty may not apply. While we did not have the benefit of full arguments from counsel on this point, it would seem, <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span>, that the duty is not engaged where there is no relationship of trust and confidence between the counterparties to the contract. We should, however, stress that the mere fact of family disharmony and disagreement over certain issues does not necessarily mean that a relationship of trust and confidence is absent. While this was not necessary to determine in the present case, we make a number of observations.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 In the present case, the Judge noted that the relationship between the Rams and Mr Navin at the time the August 2015 Deed was signed was “anything but one of trust and confidence”. He explained as follows at [65] ([1] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… The MOU, signed in 2006, did not end the disputes between Ram and Navin. Instead, by the time the [August 2015 Deed] was signed, there was <span class="font-italic">palpable distrust</span> between Ram and Navin as a result of, among other things, the disputes over the non-payment of the Annual Allowance after 2013, the Bonds and the [January 2015 SPA]. As for Mrs Ram, there <span class="font-italic">could not have been any relationship of trust and confidence between her and </span><span class="font-italic">Navin either</span>. By then, there were the disputes over the Annual Allowance and the [January 2015 SPA] (in connection with which she had revoked the [POA]). Braj and Navin’s father-in-law had also been roped in to mediate the disputes. Even the [August 2015 Deed] itself was stated to be a settlement of disagreements which “have created certain disharmony within the family or amongst the individual members”. [emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 We see no reason to disturb this finding of fact. To be clear, this finding was <span class="font-italic">not</span> inconsistent with the Judge’s characterisation of the August 2015 Deed as a family arrangement. Put in another way, while our preliminary view is that a level of trust and confidence is necessary for the duty of disclosure to be engaged, this trust and confidence is not necessary to answer the preceding question, namely, whether a particular agreement is a family arrangement. In this regard, we note that the preamble to the August 2015 Deed expressly states that the parties entered into the August 2015 Deed for the purpose of resolving the issues which had arisen between them, with a view to living together harmoniously:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The Parties hereto, on account of resolving their past and current Issues (including any claim(s) arising thereto) once and for all, and with a view of living together harmoniously and regulating their future affairs and conduct with respect to one another (and also with respect to the affairs/matters of [Evergreen]), have agreed to enter into this Deed on the terms and conditions hereinafter appearing.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 The Judge quite rightly determined that the August 2015 Deed fell within the definition of a family arrangement outlined in <span class="font-italic">Kuek</span><span class="font-italic"> Siang Wei </span>([48] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>)<span class="font-italic"> </span>and <span class="font-italic">Rajabali</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>([48] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>). However, it may be important to distinguish between family arrangements which were negotiated on the <span class="font-italic">basis </span>of existing trust and those which are negotiated with a view to <span class="font-italic">regaining </span>or <span class="font-italic">achieving </span>that trust. It would seem that the August 2015 Deed was of the latter but not the former sort. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 As we have indicated above, we did not have the benefit of full submissions either on whether the duty of disclosure ought to apply to all family arrangements, and more specifically on whether the duty of disclosure applied in this case. The Judge did not consider this issue. In fairness to the Judge, it appears that none of the parties had alerted him to the possibility that the proposition of disclosure in a family arrangement may be qualified where there is no longer any trust and confidence between the parties. Indeed, before us, the Navins initially proceeded on the basis that there was a duty of disclosure by Mr Navin as the August 2015 Deed was a family arrangement. It was only when we questioned this premise at the hearing that their counsel seemed to think that perhaps it was not correct. Indeed, Mr Ram’s counsel candidly accepted that if there was no trust and confidence between the parties, the duty of disclosure on Mr Navin would not seem to apply. On the facts before us, it is not necessary to reach a conclusion as to whether there was a duty of disclosure on Mr Navin because the answer to the next question is in his favour, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, <span class="font-italic">even if </span>there was a duty of disclosure on Mr Navin, he did not breach this duty. We therefore do not come to a firm view on this question and leave this issue for a future occasion where parties may make their submissions with the benefit of the observations we have made. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Whether Mr Navin breached his duty of disclosure</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 We now explain why we are satisfied that even if there was a duty on Mr Navin to disclose material facts, this duty would not have been breached on the evidence. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 At the outset, we note that it was not part of Mr Ram’s pleaded case that Mr Navin had to disclose the <span class="font-italic">extent</span> of Mr Ram’s entitlement<span class="font-italic"> </span>to the sale proceeds. Mr Ram’s pleaded case was specifically that Mr Navin had to disclose “the value of the Trust Bonds and any profits made from the use of the Trust Bonds and/or proceeds from the sale of the same”.

</div> Thus, it was not Mr Ram’s case that Mr Navin was obliged to disclose to him the extent of his entitlement to or share of the sale proceeds. The Judge’s conclusion was outside the scope of Mr Ram’s case. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 In our judgment, it was clear why Mr Ram did not plead that Mr Navin had to disclose the extent of his entitlement to the sale proceeds. This was because Mr Ram’s position, even <span class="font-italic">at the time the August 2015 Deed was </span><span class="font-italic">entered into</span>, was that he was entitled to 100% of the sale proceeds. Accordingly, on <br/>Mr Ram’s case, what Mr Navin claimed to be Mr Ram’s entitlement to the sale proceeds was never a <span class="font-italic">fact</span> that had to be disclosed to begin with, let alone a <span class="font-italic">material </span>fact. Indeed, while the Judge found that Mr Ram was entitled to 89.55% of the sale proceeds, Mr Ram does not accept that “fact” and continued to maintain before us that he was entitled to 100% of the sale proceeds. <span class="font-italic">Even if </span>it was open to Mr Ram to argue that Mr Navin was expected to disclose a “fact” which was in direct contradiction to his primary case, we note that <br/>Mr Ram did not plead in the alternative that <span class="font-italic">if </span>his entitlement was less than 100%, Mr Navin was bound to tell him of the extent of his entitlement. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 In the circumstances, it was unnecessary for the Judge to establish what Mr Ram’s true entitlement was (a conclusion which <span class="font-italic">both </span>Mr Navin and Mr Ram do not accept and continue to dispute). Indeed, the <span class="font-italic">entire purpose</span> of the August 2015 Deed was to settle all the disagreements which had arisen between the parties, which, notably, included Mr Navin’s omission to pay Mr Ram the sale proceeds. Before entering into the August 2015 Deed, both Mr Ram and <br/>Mr Navin had vastly different positions as to what each other’s entitlement to the sale proceeds were. In our view, it is possible that Mr Ram knew his entitlement to the sale proceeds was disputed. Mr Navin gave evidence that before the August 2015 Deed was entered into, he had informed Mr Ram of their respective entitlements to the sale proceeds based on their contributions. On that basis, Mr Navin had said that he was prepared to return $1,474,172.31.

</div>
</div>
</div> This allegation was disputed by Mr Ram whose position was that Mr Navin did not dispute his entitlement to all the sale proceeds. In any event, it is clear that the non-payment of the sale proceeds by Mr Navin remained an issue before the August 2015 Deed was signed. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 For completeness, we note that Mr Ram had contended that Mr Navin also owed a duty of disclosure towards him <span class="font-italic">qua </span>trustee. Nonetheless, it is significant that Mr Ram’s pleaded case on the material facts which should have been disclosed was the same as that set out at [63] above. That is to say, whether or not the duty of disclosure arises from the August 2015 Deed being a family arrangement <span class="font-italic">or </span>Mr Navin’s position as a trustee, the material facts that had to be disclosed on Mr Ram’s case remained the same. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 It is clear that Mr Navin did not breach his duty of disclosure <span class="font-italic">on </span><div class="font-italic"><br/></div><span class="font-italic">Mr Ram’s pleaded cas</span>e. Mr Navin disclosed the approximate value of the Bonds to Mr Ram – even on Mr Ram’s own evidence, Mr Navin had informed him that the sale proceeds of the Bonds were “approximately [S]$4m”. Although <br/>Mr Ram’s counsel mentioned to us that the actual amount was more than S$4m, he did not quarrel with the point that the actual amount was <span class="font-italic">about</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>S$4m. <br/>Mr Ram was thus not misled or unaware of the <span class="font-italic">overall</span> quantum of the sale proceeds.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 Next, turning to Mr Ram’s pleading which alleged that Mr Navin was also obliged to disclose the <span class="font-italic">profits</span> from the sale of the bonds, this was not mentioned in the appeal before us. It would have been a non-starter in any event. Mr Ram had been informed of the approximate amount of the sale proceeds and he had claimed 100% regardless of the profits made. That is to say, the actual profits made on the Bonds had no effect on Mr Ram’s claim for the sale proceeds. That claim was compromised by the August 2015 Deed.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 In the circumstances, the scope of any duty of disclosure on Mr Navin did not include the extent of Mr Ram’s actual entitlement to the sale proceeds. There was thus no breach of any such duty of disclosure in the present case. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 Therefore, the Judge erred in setting aside the August 2015 Deed on the basis of material non-disclosure. The Rams also sought to set aside the August 2015 Deed on the basis of uncertainty, misrepresentation, duress, undue influence, unconscionability and material non-disclosure. Mrs Ram added to this list a plea of <span class="font-italic">non est</span><span class="font-italic"> factum</span>. Notwithstanding the fact that the Judge held that the August 2015 Deed ought to be set aside on the basis of material non-disclosure, he considered at length these other submissions. Nothing the parties have raised on appeal cast any doubt on the Judge’s findings in that regard, and accordingly we hold that the August 2015 Deed was valid and ought to be upheld. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Consequences of upholding the August 2015 Deed</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">71 Having decided that the August 2015 Deed is valid, we turn to the question as to what issues were settled under the August 2015 Deed and what previous agreements were superseded. This has a bearing on the extent to which the 2006 MOU remains relevant, if at all. As the August 2015 Deed was a later document than the 2006 MOU, it would supersede the 2006 MOU unless there were matters in the 2006 MOU which were not covered by the August 2015 Deed.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">72 To the extent that the August 2015 Deed superseded the 2006 MOU, it was immaterial whether the 2006 MOU was legally binding. However, as we elaborate below, there were aspects of the 2006 MOU which were not covered by the August 2015 Deed. To that extent, the question of the binding effect of the 2006 MOU was still relevant. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">73 The Judge gave detailed reasons why he considered the 2006 MOU to be binding on the parties. On appeal, the Navins reiterated their arguments to the contrary. Specifically, it was contended that the 2006 MOU was not legally binding because (a) it was not supported by consideration; and (b) the parties did not intend to create legal relations.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">74 Having considered the evidence and arguments, we are of the view that the Judge’s conclusion was not contrary to the weight of the evidence. As regards the contention that the 2006 MOU was not supported by consideration, we stress that the 2006 MOU formalised Mr Navin’s role in Evergreen and gave him rights as against the Rams to expect managerial control of the company.

</div>
</div> It also stated that Mr Ram was to refrain from undertaking trading activities that would affect Evergreen’s interest in any way. As a shareholder of Evergreen, this would have benefited Mr Navin. We therefore see no reason to set aside the 2006 MOU on the basis of an absence of consideration. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">75 On the intention to create legal relations, the weight of the evidence shows that the parties had not intended for the first recourse upon breach to be to the law, and that they would instead have attempted mediation as the first port of call. However, this does not mean that the agreement itself was never intended to be legally binding. Indeed, it would have been difficult to believe that Mr Ram and Mr Navin took the trouble to enter into a written agreement in the light of their disagreement but did not intend it to be legally binding. In any event, the Judge’s finding that the 2006 MOU was legally binding is not against the weight of the evidence. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">76 For the foregoing reasons, we uphold the Judge’s decision that the 2006 MOU was binding on the parties thereto.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">77 On appeal, the Navins contended that the August 2015 Deed had the effect of revoking and superseding the 2006 MOU in its <span class="font-italic">entirety</span>, such that all the parties’ rights and obligations under the 2006 MOU ceased to exist.

Therefore, reading cl 8 in context, only those parts of the parties’ previous agreements, including the 2006 MOU, which pertained to the issues that had arisen by the time the August 2015 Deed was entered into, have been superseded. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">79 Our interpretation of the August 2015 Deed is consistent with the Judge’s observations at [82] of the GD ([1] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">I should add that even if the [August 2015 Deed] were not set aside, it <span class="font-italic">settled only disputes which had arisen at the time that it was signed.</span> This was because the [August 2015 Deed] settled only the “Issues” as defined in that document, and as defined, the term “Issues” was limited to disagreements which had created disharmony within the family or amongst the individual members.

Prior to the execution of the August 2015 Deed, Mrs Ram had on 26 March 2015 revoked her POA in respect of her shares given under the January 2015 SPA, which in turn caused Mr Navin to register her shares in his name.

</div> It was therefore surprising that, at the hearing of the appeal, Mr Ram’s counsel initially suggested that the only dispute at the time the August 2015 Deed was signed was the Bonds. However, he eventually accepted that Mrs Ram’s shares was also an issue before the August 2015 Deed was signed. This concession negated a number of other arguments the Rams made on appeal. For example, Mr Ram contended that the transfer of Mrs Ram’s shares to Mr Navin pursuant to the SPA was in breach of Article 31 of Evergreen’s articles of association: see [42] above.

</div> However, in the circumstances, it was immaterial if in law or in fact Mr Ram did not receive appropriate notice under Evergreen’s articles of association about the intended transfer of Mrs Ram’s shares to Mr Navin. By the time the August 2015 Deed was signed, Mr Ram was already claiming the shares previously held by Mrs Ram and this was one of the issues settled by the August 2015 Deed. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">84 The same could be said of the suggestion by Mrs Ram’s counsel at the hearing before us that she was unduly influenced by Mr Navin because she sold her shares to Mr Navin at an undervalue under the January 2015 SPA: see [45] above. This was irrelevant. Even if the shares were sold at an undervalue due to undue influence, she had already sought to resile from the January 2015 SPA before the August 2015 Deed was signed. Thus, even if she could have set aside the January 2015 SPA, whether on the ground of undue influence or otherwise, this would in any event be immaterial since we have concluded that the August 2015 Deed is valid. To the extent that Mrs Ram was claiming the return of her shares from Mr Navin, whether in her own right or on behalf of Mr Ram, her claim had arisen before the August 2015 Deed was signed. The rightful ownership of her shares was one of the issues settled by that deed, regardless of whether she was claiming the shares on her own behalf or on behalf of Mr Ram.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">85 Furthermore, we note that under the September 2015 Agreement, which should be read alongside the August 2015 Deed, the parties agreed that “from now on, [they would] each retain the assets held in [their] respective names and [would] be free to deal with the same in any manner”: see [27] above.

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> on the Rams’ assertion that there was a common understanding between the two of them and Mr Navin that the Rams would have a life interest in the Poole Road Property. This life interest apparently meant that they would have an irrevocable right to reside rent-free at the Poole Road Property for life: GD at [105]. The Judge observed that neither Mr Ram nor Mrs Ram adduced in their respective AEICs any evidence of this common understanding, or that it had been discussed. Any <span class="font-italic">expectation</span> on their part that Mr Navin would not deny them the right to stay did not constitute a common understanding. Further, the relief sought (a declaration that the Rams are entitled to a right of occupation of the Poole Road Property for the rest of their lives with full comforts) appeared to relate only to the alleged contractual licence arising out of the 2006 MOU as “full comforts” was not part of the common understanding as pleaded: GD at [105], [107], [109] and [110]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">94 We see no reason to overturn the Judge’s finding of fact on the common understanding. Furthermore, the parties subsequently provided in the 2006 MOU for the right of the Rams to stay in the Poole Road Property, and any prior common understanding they may have had would have been superseded by this agreement. Counsel for Mr Ram also accepted at the hearing of the appeal that even if there had been a common understanding, it would have morphed into the 2006 MOU which the Judge found to be a contractual licence for the Rams to stay at the Poole Road Property. We are thus satisfied on the evidence that the Judge’s finding was not against the weight of the evidence. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">95 Mr Ram relied heavily on the documents submitted to the LDU (see [8] above). However, these documents supported an intention to include a legal interest in the Poole Road Property for the Rams and were equivocal about a right to stay <span class="font-italic">if</span> the Rams were not allowed to have any legal interest in the Poole Road Property. In any event, as mentioned, any common understanding for the Rams to stay at the Poole Road Property was replaced by the 2006 MOU. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">96 Given that the Rams’ arguments on proprietary estoppel and remedial constructive trust were <span class="font-italic">premised</span> on the common understanding, it would follow that such arguments must similarly fail. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">97 For completeness, we note that, in a sense, the Rams’ arguments to the effect that Mr Navin held the Poole Road Property on a remedial constructive trust for the Rams appeared to go beyond a mere claim that they had the right to live in that property. One of the remedies sought on the basis of this claim was an order that the Poole Road Property be sold and the net proceeds or such amount as the court deemed fit be apportioned and distributed to the Rams. The Rams’ claim for a remedial constructive trust therefore appeared to be <span class="font-italic">in some sense </span>one for the <span class="font-italic">ownership </span>of the Poole Road Property. In any event, Mr Ram had said at the hearing below that the only claim he was making with respect to the Poole Road property was a right to stay and nothing more: GD ([1] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>)<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [120]. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(2) Contractual licence</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">98 The next question is whether the Judge was correct to find that the contractual licence under the 2006 MOU was subject to the Implied Term that the Rams did not misbehave in such a way as would make it unreasonable for them to insist on staying at the Poole Road Property: GD at [115]. Again, we see no basis for appellate intervention. It would seem impracticable and unrealistic to expect Mr Navin to continue living with his parents in the Poole Road Property despite behaviour that would have made it unreasonable for all of them to do so. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">99 The Judge found that Mr Ram had breached the Implied Term by acting in an unreasonable manner. Mr Ram submitted that the Judge was incorrect to have relied on selective video recordings of Mr Ram’s conduct in the Poole Road Property. However, it is apparent from the record that the Judge was aware that the recordings were selective.

</div> He had rightly considered this fact but nevertheless concluded that Mr Ram had breached the Implied Term. We see no reason to overturn the Judge’s finding. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">100 As for Mrs Ram, the Judge found that she had not breached the Implied Term. However, Mr Navin had not prohibited her from returning to the Poole Road Property. Instead, Mrs Ram had voluntarily decided not to do so: GD at [118]. On appeal, Mrs Ram’s counsel emphatically argued that there was nothing voluntary when Mrs Ram was brought to a police station with Mr Ram after Mr Navin called the police (see [11] above) and when Mrs Ram was placed in a cell for the night. However, that was not the point. The Judge concluded that she chose to stay with Mr Ram thereafter. We see no reason to disagree with this finding. Indeed, her evidence at trial was that she did not try to return: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Mr Tan:  When you left that night and you were brought by the police to the police station, you were not allowed to return to the house, right?</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">A: They’re saying they called the police and sent us to the jail, <span class="font-italic">we didn’t have courage to go back to the house.</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Court: So you didn’t want to go back or you tried but couldn’t go back?</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Interpreter: <span class="font-italic">No, they didn’t try.</span> </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">101 It appeared that while Mr Ram subsequently went to the Poole Road Property and was allegedly denied entry, Mrs Ram did not attempt to do so. Furthermore, Mrs Ram’s counsel confirmed at the hearing before us that she was not saying that she would still want to live in the Poole Road Property if the Judge’s finding that Mr Ram had breached the Implied Term were upheld. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(3) Conspiracy and conversion/detinue</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">102 Two remaining claims can be briefly dealt with. First, the claim that the Navins had conspired to remove or constructively evict the Rams from the Poole Road Property by lawful or unlawful means. As the Judge observed, their emphasis was on unlawful means conspiracy: GD ([1] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) at [122]. After considering the law and the evidence, the Judge rejected this claim and we see no reason to overturn his decision. While the agreement or combination necessary to find a conspiracy may in some cases be inferred from unlawful acts committed, the evidence does not present any basis to do so in the present case. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">103 Second, the Rams had also brought claims in conversion and/or detinue. This was on the basis that the Navins had converted to their own use chattels that were left in the Poole Road Property at the time of their arrest on <br/>1 August 2016. In the alternative, they claimed that the Navins wrongfully detained the items.

</em>Civil Appeals Nos 202, 203 and 205 of 2018</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">Decision of the Court of Appeal (delivered by Woo Bih Li J):</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: black; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">Outcome:<em> </em>CoA allows Mr Navin Jatia’s appeal in part and reverses the High Court’s decision to set aside the August 2015 Deed on the ground of material non-disclosure. </span></p>
<p><strong><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">Background facts</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">1<span style="white-space:pre;"> </span>Suit No 911 of 2016 (“the Suit”) was commenced by Mr Ram Niranjan (“Mr Ram”) against his son Mr Navin Jatia (“Mr Navin”), daughter-in-law Mdm Samridhi Jatia (“Mrs Navin”), Evergreen Global Pte Ltd (“Evergreen”), and Mr Ram’s wife, Mdm Shakuntala Devi (“Mrs Ram”). Evergreen is a Singapore-incorporated company which was founded by Mr Ram and played a nominal role in the Suit.  While Mrs Ram was named as the fourth defendant, her case was aligned with that of Mr Ram. Mrs Ram also commenced a third party action against the Navins which overlapped substantively with Mr Ram’s claims.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">2<span style="white-space:pre;"> </span>The cross-appeals concerned, in the main, various factual findings made by the High Court judge (“the Judge”) in relation to the validity or legal effect of four instruments, namely:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="white-space:pre;"> </span>(a)<span style="white-space:pre;"> </span>a memorandum of understanding dated 9 December 2006 <span style="white-space:pre;"> </span>between the Rams and the Navins (“the 2006 MOU”);</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="white-space:pre;"> </span>(b)<span style="white-space:pre;"> </span>a sale and purchase agreement dated 2 January 2015 between <span style="white-space:pre;"> </span>Mrs Ram and Mr Navin dated 2 January 2015 (“the January 2015 SPA”); <span style="white-space:pre;"> </span>and</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="white-space:pre;"> </span>(c)<span style="white-space:pre;"> </span>a deed dated 6 August 2015 (“August 2015 Deed”), along with an <span style="white-space:pre;"> </span>agreement dated 1 September 2015 (“the September 2015 Agreement”) <span style="white-space:pre;"> </span>between the Rams and the Navins. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">3<span style="white-space:pre;"> </span>The 2006 MOU was entered into in an attempt to resolve the disputes which had arisen between Mr Ram and Mr Navin. Among other things, Mr Navin was obliged under the 2006 MOU to pay an “Annual Allowance” to the Rams. The 2006 MOU also provided the Rams with a right to stay with full comforts in a property at Poole Road owned by Mr Navin (“the Poole Road Property”) for their entire lives.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">4 <span style="white-space:pre;"> </span>The 2006 MOU did not end the disputes between Mr Ram and Mr Navin. Mr Navin did not pay the Rams the Annual Allowance after October 2013. There were also disputes regarding investments in bonds which Mr Navin had managed using Mr Ram’s moneys (“the Bonds”). The sale proceeds of the Bonds amounted to US$4,270,058.83. While Mr Ram claimed that he was entitled to all the sale proceeds, Mr Navin held onto the entire sum as he wanted to discuss a global settlement with Mr Ram arising from their various disputes. Mr Navin also claimed that he had disputed Mr Ram’s entitlement to all the sale proceeds, as the Bonds were a joint investment between Mr Navin and Mr Ram in about equal shares. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">5<span style="white-space:pre;"> </span>Disputes also arose in relation to the January 2015 SPA which was an agreement for the sale of Mrs Ram’s 25% shareholding in Evergreen to Mr Navin for US$1.962m. While the January 2015 SPA provided that the shares would only be transferred to Mr Navin upon Mrs Ram’s demise, Mr Navin subsequently transferred the shares to himself following Mrs Ram’s revocation of a power of attorney which she had given to Mr Navin in respect of her shares. Mrs Ram had asked Mr Navin to return these shares. Mr Ram also claimed these shares.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">6<span style="white-space:pre;"> </span>These disagreements led to the August 2015 Deed which provided that Mr Ram would be paid US$2m in full and final settlement of the issues between the parties. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">7<span style="white-space:pre;"> </span>Finally, another issue in the Suit was the Rams’ right to live in the Poole Road Property. In 1993, Mr Navin exercised an option to purchase the Poole Road Property for S$2.88m, which effectively functioned as the family home until 2016. The Navins alleged that Mr Ram had behaved unreasonably while living at the Poole Road Property. The Rams, on the other hand, alleged that the Navins had conspired to remove or constructively evict them from the Poole Road Property. On 1 August 2016, the Rams were arrested and charged for criminal trespass. They claimed that they have not been able to access the Poole Road Property to retrieve their belongings since then. In addition, many of their items were missing. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">Decision below</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">8<span style="white-space:pre;"> </span><strong>The August 2015 Deed and the September 2015 Agreement: </strong>The Judge held that since the August 2015 Deed was a family arrangement (<em>ie</em>, an agreement between members of the same family which is intended to be generally and reasonably for the benefit of the family), the parties were subject to a duty to disclose material facts. The Judge found that <br/>
Mr Ram had contributed 89.55% of the funds used to purchase the Bonds and that his entitlement was US$3,442,378.29. However, Mr Navin did not disclose Mr Ram’s share of the sale proceeds from the Bonds. This was a material fact as the August 2015 Deed purported to settle all the existing disputes for US$2m. The August 2015 Deed was thus set aside. The Judge also set aside the September 2015 Agreement as it merely confirmed that a full and final settlement had been reached under the August 2015 Deed. Consequently, Mr Ram was ordered to return the sum of US$2m under the August 2015 Deed to Mr Navin, subject to a set-off against amounts that Mr Navin had been ordered to pay Mr Ram. Mr Navin was found to hold the sum of US$3,442,378.29 being Mr Ram’s share of the sale proceeds on trust for Mr Ram, and was ordered to pay this sum to Mr Ram.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">9<span style="white-space:pre;"> </span><strong>The</strong> <strong>2006 MOU</strong>: The Judge found that the 2006 MOU was binding and the parties had intended to create legal relations. As a result, the Judge ordered that Mr Navin comply with his various obligations under the 2006 MOU, including the payment of the Annual Allowance. Another consequence of the Judge’s upholding of the 2006 MOU was that the Rams had a contractual licence to stay at the Poole Road Property with full comforts for the rest of their lives. However, the Judge held that this was subject to an implied term that the Rams did not misbehave in such a way as would make it unreasonable for them to insist on staying at the Poole Road Property (“the Implied Term”). Mr Ram was found to have breached the Implied Term and the Judge held that Mr Navin was entitled to revoke Mr Ram’s contractual licence to stay at the Poole Road Property. With regard to Mrs Ram, the Judge found that she had decided on her own not to continue residing at the Poole Road Property, and accordingly, that Mr Navin had not breached the contractual licence in respect of Mrs Ram either.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">10<span style="white-space:pre;"> </span><strong>The January 2015 SPA</strong>: The Judge dismissed Mrs Ram’s attempts to rely on undue influence, economic duress, unconscionability, <em>non est factum </em>and misrepresentation to set aside the January 2015 SPA. The Judge also held that Mrs Ram had received valid consideration from Mr Navin under the January 2015 SPA.    </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">11<span style="white-space:pre;"> </span><strong>The Poole Road Property</strong>: The Judge found that there was no evidence of any common understanding for the Rams to have an irrevocable right to live in the Poole Road Property, and therefore dismissed Mr Ram’s proprietary estoppel claim. The Judge dismissed the Rams’ claims for a declaration that Mr Navin held the Poole Road Property on remedial constructive trust as the basis for this claim had not been established. The Judge also found that the evidence fell short of establishing a conspiracy on the part of the Navins to remove or constructively evict the Rams from the Poole Road Property. Neither was there any evidence that Mr Navin had converted or failed to return certain items which had been left by the Rams at the Poole Road Property to them. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">The cross-appeals</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">12 <span style="white-space:pre;"> </span>Civil Appeal No 202 of 2018 was the appeal by Mr Navin, Mrs Navin and Evergreen against the Judge’s decision in respect of the August 2015 Deed and the 2006 MOU. First, the Navins contended that the Judge erred in setting aside the August 2015 Deed on the ground of material non-disclosure. Second, the Navins contended that the Judge erred in finding that there was an intention to create legal relations in respect of the 2006 MOU.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">13<span style="white-space:pre;"> </span>Civil Appeal No 205 of 2018 and Civil Appeal No 203 of 2018 were Mr Ram’s and Mrs Ram’s appeals respectively. These concerned the Judge’s decision on various issues, most notably in respect of his findings concerning the Poole Road Property and the January 2015 SPA. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">The Court’s decision</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">The August 2015 Deed</span></em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">14<span style="white-space:pre;"> </span>The Court observed that it was questionable whether a duty of disclosure arose in all family arrangements. The underlying rationale for imposing a duty of disclosure on parties to a family arrangement is that the law presumes that parties to a family arrangement repose a certain degree of trust and confidence in one another, such that there is an obligation to make full and frank disclosure of all material facts. However, where there is no relationship of trust and confidence between the counterparties to the contract, it would seem, <em>prima facie</em>, that the duty is not engaged (at <strong>[52]–[57]</strong>). </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">15<span style="white-space:pre;"> </span>As the Judge noted, the relationship between the Rams and Mr Navin at the time that the August 2015 Deed was signed was “anything but one of trust and confidence” (at <strong>[58]</strong>). </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">16<span style="white-space:pre;"> </span>Nevertheless, it was not necessary to reach a conclusion as to whether there was a duty of disclosure on Mr Navin because <em>even if </em>there was such a duty, he did not breach this duty. It was not part of Mr Ram’s pleaded case that Mr Navin had to disclose the <em>extent</em> of <br/>
Mr Ram’s entitlement to the sale proceeds. Mr Ram’s position, even at the time the August 2015 Deed was entered into, was that he was entitled to 100% of the sale proceeds. Accordingly, on Mr Ram’s case, what Mr Navin claimed to be Mr Ram’s entitlement to the sale proceeds was never a <em>fact</em> that had to be disclosed to begin with, let alone a <em>material fact</em>. The Court thus held that the August 2015 Deed was valid and ought to be upheld (at <strong>[61]–[64] </strong>and <strong>[70]</strong>).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">Consequences of upholding the August 2015 Deed</span></em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">17<span style="white-space:pre;"> </span>The Court upheld the Judge’s decision that the 2006 MOU was binding on the parties. The parties had intended to create legal relations and the 2006 MOU was supported by consideration (at <strong>[74]</strong>–<strong>[76]</strong>). The Court held that the August 2015 Deed did not have the effect of revoking and superseding the 2006 MOU in its entirety. Rather, the August 2015 Deed only sought to determine the disagreements which had created disharmony within the family or amongst the individual members. Therefore, only those parts of the parties’ previous agreements, including the 2006 MOU, which pertained to the issues that had arisen by the time the August 2015 Deed was entered into, had been superseded (at <strong>[78]</strong>).  </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">18<span style="white-space:pre;"> </span>The Court held that there were four live issues which were settled under the August 2015 Deed. These were the disputes over:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="white-space:pre;"> </span>(a)<span style="white-space:pre;"> </span>the sale proceeds of the Bonds (at <strong>[82]</strong>);</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="white-space:pre;"> </span>(b) <span style="white-space:pre;"> </span>Mrs Ram’s shares transferred to Mr Navin under the January 2015 <span style="white-space:pre;"> </span>SPA (at <strong>[83]–[84]</strong>);</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="white-space:pre;"> </span>(c)<span style="white-space:pre;"> </span>the Annual Allowance (at <strong>[87]–[90]</strong>); and</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="white-space:pre;"> </span>(d)<span style="white-space:pre;"> </span>the ownership of the Poole Road Property (at <strong>[91]</strong>).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">20<span style="white-space:pre;"> </span>As for Mr Ram’s claims of proprietary estoppel and remedial constructive trust, the Court upheld the Judge’s finding that there was no common understanding for the Rams to have a life interest in the Poole Road Property. In any case, any prior common understanding would have been superseded by the contractual license under the 2006 MOU. The claims of proprietary estoppel and remedial constructive trust could not succeed (at <strong>[92]–[96]</strong>). </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">21<span style="white-space:pre;"> </span>The Court upheld the Judge’s finding that the contractual license under the 2006 MOU was subject to the Implied Term that the Rams did not misbehave in such a way as would make it unreasonable for them to insist on staying at the Poole Road Property. There was no reason to overturn the Judge’s findings that Mr Ram had breached the Implied Term and that Mrs Ram had voluntarily decided not to return to the Poole Road Property (at <strong>[98]–[101]</strong>).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">22<span style="white-space:pre;"> </span>The Court held that there was no basis to overturn the Judge’s decision to reject the Rams’ claims for conspiracy as well as for conversion and/or detinue (at <strong>[102]–[103]</strong>). </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">23<span style="white-space:pre;"> </span>Accordingly, the Court made the following orders:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="white-space:pre;"> </span>(a)<span style="white-space:pre;"> </span>Given that the August 2015 Deed was upheld, the Court set aside the Judge’s order for Mr Ram to return the sum of US$2m to Mr Navin (<em>ie</em>, the negotiated sum under the August 2015 Deed) (at <strong>[106]</strong>);</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="white-space:pre;"> </span>(b)<span style="white-space:pre;"> </span>Since the August 2015 Deed settled the issues relating to the Annual Allowance and the Bonds, the Court set aside the Judge’s orders for Mr Navin to pay the Annual Allowance, both as regards the arrears for the years 2014 to 2017, and Mr Navin’s continuing obligation to pay the Annual Allowance. The Court also set aside the Judge’s order for Mr Navin to pay Mr Ram US$3,442,378.29, representing Mr Ram’s 89.55% share of the sale proceeds (at <strong>[107]</strong>)</span></p>
