</div> two of BLL’s sisters (“the Sisters”) applied under s 20 of the MCA for a declaration that BLL was unable to make decisions regarding her property and affairs, and for a consequential order that deputies be appointed to make all decisions regarding such matters on her behalf. OSF 71/2011 was heard at first instance by a senior district judge (“the First Instance Judge”) of the Subordinate Courts (as the State Courts was then known) and her written decision was published as <span class="font-italic">AUR and another v AUT and others </span>[2012] SGDC 489 (“the First Instance GD”). As observed by the First Instance Judge, the crux of the dispute in OSF 71/2011 was the circumstances and events before and after BLL created a particular trust dated 26 October 2010 (“the Trust”) (First Instance GD at [35]). The details of the Trust will be explained more fully below. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">5 OSF 71/2011 was heavily contested by the defendants and BLL herself (as the third defendant in OSF 71/2011), resulting in protracted litigation. At first instance, BLL was found to lack decision-making capacity but this was reversed on appeal by the High Court in Registrar’s Appeal Nos 223 and 224 of 2012. OSF 71/2011 eventually culminated in the Court of Appeal’s decision in CA 27/2014, reported as <span class="font-italic">Re BKR </span>[2015] 4 SLR 81 (“<span class="font-italic">Re BKR (Court of Appeal)</span>”). The Court of Appeal disagreed with the High Court and found that BLL lacked capacity “because of a combination of mental impairment and the circumstances in which she lives” (<span class="font-italic">Re BKR (Court of Appeal) </span>at [207]). Specifically, as to her actual circumstances, the Court of Appeal found that BLL was subject to the undue influence of the defendants and was cut off from people who would otherwise be able to give her advice (<span class="font-italic">Re BKR (Court of Appeal) </span>at [207]). Consequently, deputies were appointed to act on BLL’s behalf. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">6 At the outset, it ought to be highlighted that the Court of Appeal had examined BLL’s capacity “in relation to specific decisions” (<span class="font-italic">Re BKR (Court of Appeal) </span>at [208]). These “specific decisions” were BLL’s decisions to set up the Trust and to transfer her assets held in UBS to DBS. The Court of Appeal held that BLL lacked capacity at the time these decisions were made. The Court of Appeal’s decision will be examined in greater detail below.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Suit No 1085 of 2016</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">7 Four years have passed since the conclusion of OSF 71/2011. In S 1085/2016, BLL, through her deputies, is advancing several claims against the defendants. First, BLL avers that the defendants breached their fiduciary duties owed to BLL, as they were her agents in relation to the Trust. Alternatively, the defendants were fiduciaries because BLL reposed trust and confidence in them in relation to her property and affairs.

</div> BLL’s counsel clarified in the course of submissions that the claim in undue influence was one in tort or equity. For present purposes, it is not necessary to determine if undue influence, which is typically raised as a vitiating factor against contracts, can also give rise to a cause of action in its own right. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">11 The third cause of action advanced by BLL is a claim for an abuse of the fiduciary relationship of influence and/or confidence between BLL and the defendants.

The Trust is dated 26 October 2010 and the relevant documents were signed in November 2010. It was created with DBS and the trustee was a BVI trust company. The trustee had absolute discretion in applying the money in the Trust for the beneficiaries: a company which can be referred to as “B Ltd” and a class of beneficiaries being “Charities to be determined”. The first defendant, BLM, was the protector of the Trust. On 27 July 2012, a deed of understanding was entered between BLL, BLM and the trustee which provided that the moneys in B Ltd were to be used for the exclusive purpose of maintaining BLL during her lifetime (<span class="font-italic">Re BKR (Court of Appeal) </span>at [19]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">13 The Trust identified a class of persons, referred to as Excluded Persons, who were entirely excluded from enjoying any benefits under the Trust. The excluded persons were BLL’s two other children, NG and CK. In addition, BLM, by virtue of her position as protector of the Trust, was also an excluded person, although the Sisters contended in OSF 71/2011 that BLM would fall outside the definition of an excluded person if she relinquished her position as protector. The Trust was later amended to stipulate that BLM would also be an excluded person under the Trust, regardless of her status as protector. However, the provision of a gift of $10m to BLM, if she remained the protector on the date of BLL’s demise, was retained (<span class="font-italic">Re BKR (Court of Appeal) </span>at [20]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">14 Between 8 November 2010 and 15 December 2010, following the creation of the Trust, BLL issued a series of conflicting instructions to her UBS bankers to transfer her assets to DBS, which UBS did not act on (<span class="font-italic">Re BKR (Court of Appeal) </span>at [25]; First Instance GD at [106]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">15 After the creation of the Trust, BLL left Singapore for Hong Kong together with BLM on 28 November 2010. Based on the evidence in OSF 71/2011, it was found that the defendants began to cut off access to BLL once she was brought back to Hong Kong. BLL resided with the defendants and was isolated from her family members, including the Sisters and BLL’s two other children (<span class="font-italic">Re BKR (Court of Appeal) </span>at [202]; First Instance GD at [106]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">16 The Court of Appeal held that BLL lacked capacity at the time she made the decisions to set up the Trust and issued conflicting instructions to UBS (<span class="font-italic">Re BKR (Court of Appeal) </span>at [208]). Subsequently, the deputies pursued legal action in the BVI court to set aside the Trust, which was then set aside with the consent of the defendants. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Summons No 4275 of 2018</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">17 The three preliminary questions brought by consent pursuant to O 33 r 2 of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2014 Rev Ed) (“ROC”) in the present summons concern the doctrine of <span class="font-italic">res judicata</span>: specifically, they relate to issue estoppel and the extended doctrine of <span class="font-italic">res judicata</span>.

</div> This is the approach of the present judgment. The use of “and” within the “and/or” frame as applied to the First and Second Preliminary Issue as drafted within the Third Preliminary Issue must be conjunctive: as explained in the course of this judgment, the Third Preliminary Issue becomes relevant where the First is answered in the positive and the Second is answered in the negative. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">19 In addition, OSF 71/2011 was directed to be heard <span class="font-italic">in camera</span> when the matter was at first instance and the appellate judgments were redacted.

BLL took the view that S 1085/2016 ought to be heard <span class="font-italic">in camera</span> in order to maintain and preserve the confidentiality of OSF 71/2011. The defendants left it to the court to decide. I therefore exercise my discretion under s 8(2) of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act (Cap 322, 2007 Rev Ed) to direct that S 1085/2016 be heard <span class="font-italic">in camera</span>. Under O 42 r 2 of the ROC, this judgment is published on terms that the parties’ names and details are redacted.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">First Preliminary Issue</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">20 With that brief background, I now turn to the First Preliminary Issue which is whether the Court of Appeal, in <span class="font-italic">Re BKR (Court of Appeal)</span>, found that the defendants unduly influenced BLL into deciding to set up, setting up and/or signing the settlement constituting the Trust. While BLL contends that such a finding was made, the defendants take the contrary position and submit that any findings of undue influence were not specific to the setting up of the Trust.

In this section we examine the medical evidence that was led, as well as the evidence that was given by [BLL] herself and by the other factual witnesses. <span class="font-italic">We also examine the evidence in relation to two specific sets of events or </span><span class="font-italic">transactions</span> …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(iv) We then set out our findings on the issue of capacity … and our conclusions and further directions …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">22 The “single core issue” which the Court of Appeal was confronted with was whether BLL had or lacked mental capacity in relation to decisions concerning her property and affairs (<span class="font-italic">Re BKR (Court of Appeal) </span>at [76]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">23 The Court of Appeal first had to determine what the court’s approach ought to be when the person whose capacity to make decisions (“P”) was under consideration: should the court only consider P’s mental impairment or should the court also consider P’s actual circumstances, including her susceptibility to undue influence? On this point, the First Instance Judge held that the court ought to consider P’s actual circumstances and found that BLL was “vulnerable and susceptible to undue influence” and that BLM was “influencing and causing [BLL] to act in a manner that is contrary to [BLL’s] best interests” (First Instance GD at [129]–[130]). On appeal, the High Court Judge disagreed with the First Instance Judge and held that the First Instance Judge’s findings on undue influence were irrelevant for the purposes of determining BLL’s mental capacity (<span class="font-italic">Re BKR </span>[2013] 4 SLR 1257 at [8]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 Taking a contrary view, the Court of Appeal decided that it was proper for the court to consider P’s actual circumstances. In this connection, the First Instance Judge’s findings of undue influence ought not to have been set aside. The relevance of undue influence to the issue of mental capacity was as follows (<span class="font-italic">Re BKR (Court of Appeal) </span>at [125]–[126]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">125 … The proven or potential presence of undue influence is relevant to the issue of mental capacity in at least three ways. The first is that it then becomes material whether P is able to retain, understand or use the information that relates to whether there might be undue influence being applied, for instance whether P can understand that a third person may have interests opposed to his; and if not, whether that inability is caused by mental impairment. The second is that it must be considered whether P’s susceptibility to undue influence is caused by mental impairment; if so, and if the result of such undue influence is that P’s will is so overborne that he is unable to use and weigh information relevant to the decision in question, P would be unable to make decisions “because of” mental impairment. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">126 The third way in which undue influence is relevant is that it might mean that P cannot realistically hope to obtain assistance in making decisions. In such a situation, P may be found to lack capacity because of a mental impairment operating together with that lack of assistance. …</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 The Court of Appeal found that BLL had a mental impairment and that this was something between a condition referred to as Mild Cognitive Impairment and dementia. This resulted in significant memory decline, deterioration in executive functions and the emergence of paranoid and false beliefs (<span class="font-italic">Re BKR (Court of Appeal) </span>at [173]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 The Court of Appeal then subjected to scrutiny “two specific sets of events or transactions” which provided “important insights” on whether or not BLL could make decisions relating to her property and affairs. These were BLL’s decisions to set up the Trust and to transfer all her assets held in UBS to DBS (<span class="font-italic">Re BKR (Court of Appeal) </span>at [131] and [173]). It is the former decision that is of greater relevance to this preliminary hearing. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The decision to set up the Trust </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 The Court of Appeal first noted that objectively, it was difficult to identify any good reason for establishing the Trust. If the Trust was to look after BLL’s material needs, then there was already an existing JPMorgan trust in place. If the Trust was intended for charitable purposes, then a simpler way could have been to make the relevant bequests in a will (<span class="font-italic">Re BKR (Court of Appeal) </span>at [174]). Furthermore, BLL was unable to use and weigh the information relevant to her decision to set up the Trust (<span class="font-italic">Re BKR (Court of Appeal) </span>at [178]). It appeared that BLL believed that had she not established the Trust, her son would have come after her assets and left her bereft. However, this was not a reasonable belief and gave rise to the possibility that BLL’s decision to set up the Trust was “largely if not wholly impelled by a paranoid belief that was caused at least in part by her mental impairment” (<span class="font-italic">Re BKR (Court of Appeal) </span>at [180]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 At this point of the judgment, it appears that the Court of Appeal could have already arrived at the conclusion that BLL lacked capacity and was unable to make decisions relating to her property and affairs. The Court of Appeal stated at [188]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The sum of our reasoning so far is that there is <span class="font-italic">strong basis</span> for saying that [BLL] lacked the ability to make the decision to set up the Trust as well as the decision to transfer all her UBS assets to DBS. <span class="font-italic">But before we draw any firm conclusions on her capacity, we should look at the actual circumstances in which those decisions were made</span>. [emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 Nevertheless, in line with the approach that they had endorsed (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, that it was proper to consider BLL’s actual circumstances, including allegations of undue influence), the Court of Appeal proceeded to consider the actual circumstances in which the decisions (including the decision to set up the Trust) were made. It is this aspect of the judgment that deals with the allegations of undue influence.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The circumstances in which the decision to set up the Trust was made</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 Under the heading of the “Possibility of undue influence”, the Court of Appeal highlighted that one of the Sister’s “main allegations” was that the defendants had “engineered the creation of the Trust” (<span class="font-italic">Re BKR (Court of Appeal) </span>at [189]). The Court of Appeal was of the view that there was “a strong case for inferring that [BLL] was acting under the undue influence of the [defendants] when she established the Trust and transferred her assets to DBS” (at [197]). Parties in this preliminary hearing adopt different interpretations of the Court of Appeal’s findings on undue influence, and the relevant extract is analysed more fully below. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 On the cutting of access, the Court of Appeal found that the evidence strongly suggested that if BLL was completely at liberty to make her own independent decision, she would not have wanted to cut off access and would instead wish to meet and interact with the Sisters and her other children (<span class="font-italic">Re BKR (Court of Appeal) </span>at [200]). Instead, the defendants endeavoured to cut BLL off from these individuals as well as trusted professionals and that <span class="font-italic">fortified the </span><span class="font-italic">Court of Appeal’s conclusion that the defendants were exercising undue influence over BLL </span>(<span class="font-italic">Re BKR (Court of Appeal) </span>at [202]). In the Court of Appeal’s judgment, “it [was] more likely than not that the [defendants] have exercised undue influence over [BLL] and will continue to do so for as long as other people are prevented from seeing her” (<span class="font-italic">Re BKR (Court of Appeal) </span>at [203]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 The Court of Appeal concluded that BLL lacked capacity because of “a combination of mental impairment and the circumstances in which she lives” (<span class="font-italic">Re BKR (Court of Appeal)</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [207]). The statutory test for lack of capacity under the MCA was therefore satisfied. <span class="font-italic"> </span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Analysis</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 It is not disputed that the Court of Appeal made certain findings on undue influence in <span class="font-italic">Re BKR (Court of Appeal)</span>. Essentially, the dispute relates to the <span class="font-italic">specificity </span>of these findings: did the Court of Appeal find that the defendants unduly influenced BLL into deciding to set up the Trust? For the reasons below, I answer the First Preliminary Issue in the positive.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The Court of Appeal’s findings were specific to the Trust</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 The defendants contend that the Court of Appeal’s findings on undue influence were expressed generally in relation to the issue of BLL’s capacity and not in respect of specific transactions such as the Trust.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 In my view, the defendants’ contention has no merit. While it is undoubtedly true that the “single core issue” was whether BLL lacked mental capacity (<span class="font-italic">Re BKR (Court of Appeal) </span>at [76]), the Court of Appeal highlighted that this had to be assessed in the light of BLL’s actual circumstances. Specifically, the Court of Appeal examined two <span class="font-italic">particular decisions</span> of BLL that provided “important insights” in determining whether BLL lacked mental capacity (<span class="font-italic">Re BKR (Court of Appeal) </span>at [131]). The setting up of the Trust was one of these two decisions, and it was precisely in this context that the findings of undue influence were made. They were not made in a vacuum and were plainly directed at the decisions made by BLL. This is borne out simply by looking at the following paragraphs which preface the Court of Appeal’s discussion on undue influence, and the parts highlighted in bold make clear that the findings of undue influence were expressed in connection to specific decisions made by BLL (<span class="font-italic">Re BKR (Court of Appeal) </span>at [188]–[189]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-italic">The circumstances in which the </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">decision</span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">s</span><span class="font-italic"> were made</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">188 The sum of our reasoning so far is that there is strong basis for saying that [BLL] lacked the ability to make the decision to set up the Trust as well as the decision to transfer all her UBS assets to DBS. <span class="font-italic">But before we draw any firm conclusions on her capacity, we should look at the actual circumstances in which those </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">decisions</span><span class="font-italic"> were made</span>. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(1) <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Possibility of undue influence</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">189 It is vigorously asserted by the [Sisters] and those associated with them, especially CK and NG, that [BLL] is subject to the undue influence of the [defendants]. <span class="font-italic">One of their main allegations is that the [defendants] engineered the creation of the Trust </span>…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added in italics and bold italics]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 However, the defendants point out that under the heading of “Our findings”, which is found at the conclusion of the judgment, the Court of Appeal only went so far as to state that BLL “is subject to the undue influence of the [defendants]” (<span class="font-italic">Re BKR (Court of Appeal) </span>at [207]).

</div> The short answer is that these findings are found in other parts of the judgment, which must be read holistically. The section titled “Our findings” was only a summary of the various findings made by the Court of Appeal in other parts of the judgment, which I shall now turn to.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The Court of Appeal’s findings on undue influence were not equivocal</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 A specific link between the findings of undue influence and BLL’s decision to set up the Trust can be found at [197] of <span class="font-italic">Re BKR (Court of Appeal)</span>, which reads as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">197 … we think that <span class="font-italic">there is a strong case for inferring that </span><span class="font-italic">[BLL] was acting under the undue influence of the [defendants] when she established the Trust</span> and transferred her assets to DBS …  As we have found, the establishment of the Trust and the transfer of assets to DBS do not appear to bring any discernable benefit to [BLL]; they occurred without any evidential prompt or reason; the Trust was set up in secrecy and the banking instructions were given with unusual urgency and were … subject to inexplicable (and indeed unexplained) reversals.

</div>
</div> This is because the Court of Appeal had only stated that there was a “strong case for inferring that [BLL] was acting under the undue influence of the [defendants] when she established the Trust”. Furthermore, the Court of Appeal had only “strongly suggest[ed]” that BLL was subject to the undue influence of BLM (<span class="font-italic">Re BKR (Court of Appeal) </span>at [197]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 I accept that the Court of Appeal’s findings appear to be equivocal if one reads [197] of <span class="font-italic">Re BKR (Court of Appeal) </span>in isolation from the rest of the judgment. But such a reading would be artificial. In my view, the Court of Appeal was likely to be reasoning in an inductive manner. Subsequent paragraphs in the judgment reveal that the Court of Appeal were firm and conclusive in their finding that BLL was acting under the undue influence of the defendants when she established the Trust. The passages which go towards showing this are as follows:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) First, after the Court of Appeal was satisfied that the defendants endeavoured to cut BLL off from her Sisters, children and trusted professionals, it was stated that “this fortifies our conclusion that the [defendants] are exercising undue influence over [BLL]” (<span class="font-italic">Re BKR </span><span class="font-italic">(Court of Appeal) </span>at [202]). This was not a reference to the defendants exercising undue influence in a generic sense, or at the time of litigation. As mentioned previously, the findings on undue influence appear in the section when the Court of Appeal was considering the two decisions made by BLL.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Second, the Court of Appeal also added at [203] that “it [was] more likely than not that the [defendants] have exercised undue influence over [BLL] and will continue to do so for as long as other people are prevented from seeing her” (<span class="font-italic">Re BKR (Court of Appeal) </span>at [203]). As explained, the reference to undue influence must have been with reference to the two decisions that BLL made. It should be added that the language used by the Court of Appeal (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, “more likely than not”) is not tentative; indeed, it is a fundamental principle that “[a]nything that is more probable than not [the court] treats as certain” (<span class="font-italic">Mallett</span><span class="font-italic"> v McMonagle, a minor by Huge Joseph McMonagle, his father and guardian ad litem, and Another </span>[1969] 2 WLR 767 at 772).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 When [197] and [202]–[203] of <span class="font-italic">Re BKR (Court of Appeal)</span> are read together and not in isolation, two points become evident. First, the Court of Appeal’s findings on undue influence were expressed in relation to the decisions BLL made, including the decision to set up the Trust and second, these findings were not equivocal. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 The defendants also point to the fact that the Court of Appeal was not concerned with the date on which the documents for the Trust were signed.

</div> This application was resisted by BLL and eventually dismissed. The Trust documents were hence not before the First Instance Judge or any of the appellate judges for that matter. It was only on the last day of the hearing of OSF 71/2011 that the First Instance Judge directed BLL to disclose some of the documents. Even then, the Trust documents were not disclosed for the purpose of determining whether the defendants exerted undue influence on BLL. This line of argument is, however, neither here nor there. It is more pertinent that there was sufficient evidence before the court relating to the <span class="font-italic">circumstances surrounding the setting up of the Trust</span>. The precise details of the Trust were less material and the Trust documents would not have shed any light on the circumstances surrounding the setting up of the Trust. It was the actual circumstances surrounding the setting up of the Trust that gave rise to the inference that the defendants had unduly influenced BLL’s decision to set up the Trust. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 The defendants further submit that they were not aware that they had to run a defence to respond to allegations that they had unduly influenced BLL into setting up the Trust.

</div></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">3.4.5 … [BLL] had made all necessary arrangements to provide financially and more than generously for her own future, and the future of her own flesh and blood she cares for. It is unnecessary and wholly out of character for [BLL] to set up a new trust to be managed solely by [BLM] – especially when she has always been wary of [the defendants]. Moreover, she often told family members, bankers, and others, that [BLN] is very greedy and is a bad influence on [BLM]. As seen from JPMorgan’s recent discovery and independent evidence, [BLL] told them she does not trust [the defendants]. It cannot be a mere coincidence that [BLL] came up with this plan – completely out of character – after prolonged contact with [the defendants]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 In my view, paragraph 3.4 of BL’s eighth affidavit did not raise the Undue Influence Issue. In fact, when read in context, BL’s eighth affidavit states that the Undue Influence Issue was not a central issue in OSF 71/2011. This can be seen from para 2.3, which prefaces the remainder of the affidavit:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">2.3 The Defendants’ repeated attempts in their affidavits to cloud this central issue with <span class="font-italic">unnecessary and inaccurate details of family politics</span> do not detract from these facts. In this Affidavit, I address only some of these inaccuracies where I feel it necessary to set the record straight <span class="font-italic">so that the Court will not be distracted</span>, nor unfairly prejudiced against me or [BLL’s other children]. … [emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 This central issue which is referred to is “whether there is reason to believe [BLL] is now incapable of managing her property and financial affairs on her own because of an impairment of, or a disturbance in the functioning of, her mind and brain”. In support of the Sisters’ case, BL raises three points at para 2.2, which are BLL’s clinical diagnosis of impairment of short-term memory, BLL’s deteriorating mental condition and BLL’s departure from her usual behaviour since she was taken to Hong Kong on 28 November 2010. Notably, there is no reference to the setting up of the Trust, which would have taken place <span class="font-italic">before </span>28 November 2010. The Sisters’ case, as set out in para 2.2, is therefore consistent with para 2.3 which states the other matters in the affidavit are “unnecessary” details which are dealt with so as to “set the record straight” and prevent the court from being “distracted” or “unfairly prejudiced”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 BLL also highlights that the Undue Influence Issue was raised in correspondence prior to the commencement of OSF 71/2011.

</div></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">139. First, it is clear that the idea to set up the [Trust] came from [BLL] herself. When questioned on her reasons for doing so and <span class="font-italic">whether it was [BLM] who planted the idea</span>, her evidence was unequivocal. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">140. Second, the objective evidence shows that [BLM] did not provide any input in setting up or structuring the [Trust] and the formulation of its terms. She merely agreed to be appointed as Protector. … </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">71 Accordingly, notwithstanding that the Undue Influence Issue was only raised in cross-examination, it is clear that substantive submissions were made by the defendants to address it. I therefore do not accept that the Undue Influence Issue was not raised and argued in OSF 71/2011.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(3) The context in which the Undue Influence Issue was raised and argued in OSF 71/2011</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">72 In OSF 71/2011, the “single core issue” was to determine whether BLL had the capacity to make decisions on her property and affairs (<span class="font-italic">Re BKR (Court of Appeal) </span>at [76]). The Undue Influence Issue was therefore argued by the defendants <span class="font-italic">in that context</span>. In S 1085/2016, the Undue Influence Issue is raised as a basis for a breach of fiduciary duties by the defendants and to determine whether the defendants are liable in damages and/or equitable compensation. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">73 Nevertheless, when one considers whether or not the Undue Influence Issue was raised and argued in OSF 71/2011, the mere fact that it arose in a <span class="font-italic">different context </span>does not mean that the doctrine of issue estoppel cannot apply. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">74 As an example of how the doctrine of issue estoppel operates, one can refer to the Court of Appeal’s decision in <span class="font-italic">Lee </span><span class="font-italic">Hiok Tng (in her personal capacity) v Lee Hiok Tng and another (executors and trustees of the estate of Lee Wee Nam, deceased) and others </span>[2001] 1 SLR(R) 771 (“<span class="font-italic">Lee</span>”). In <span class="font-italic">Lee</span>, two brothers, Kheng and Nam were in a partnership (“the Kongsi”). At law, upon the death of Kheng, the partnership in the Kongsi was dissolved and Nam, or the executors/trustees of Nam’s estate, ought to have wound up the affairs of the Kongsi and distributed its assets to those who were entitled to them.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">75 Accordingly, beneficiaries of the Kheng estate sued the executors/trustees of Nam’s estate. The beneficiaries of the Kheng estate contended that Nam and the executors/trustees of Nam’s estate had acted in breach of trust in respect of the partnership assets. In addition, it was alleged that the executors/trustees of Nam’s estate were liable to restore to the Kongsi certain specified shares (including “27 UOB Shares”).  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">76 The High Court held, in a judgment delivered in 1992 (“the 1992 Judgment) that the shares belonged to the Kongsi and that Nam’s estate was to account for the same. Furthermore, Nam and his executors/trustees had committed breaches of trust and an account was ordered to be taken of the Kongsi’s assets in respect of the period after Kheng’s death (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, when the partnership was dissolved) (<span class="font-italic">Lee </span>at [3]–[11]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">77 Seven years later in 1999, the executors/trustees of Nam’s estate commenced a new action. According to one of the executors/trustees of Nam’s estate, Tng, Nam had gifted Tng the 27 UOB Shares in 1962. Therefore, the appropriate portion of the 27 UOB Shares should be treated as belonging to Tng and not the Kongsi. The Court of Appeal referred to this as “the gift question”. Tng also alleged that he was entitled to an indemnity and/or contribution in respect of the <span class="font-italic">costs and expenses incurred by him</span> pertaining to the 27 UOB Shares from Nam’s estate (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, moneys expended by Tng to take up additional UOB shares pursuant to rights issues). The Court of Appeal referred to this as “the reimbursement question” (<span class="font-italic">Lee </span>at [12]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">78 On the gift question, the Court of Appeal held that Tng was not estopped from raising it in the new action, whether through the doctrine of issue estoppel or the extended doctrine of <span class="font-italic">res judicata</span>. The 1992 Judgment did not consider and answer the gift question. However, on the reimbursement question, the Court of Appeal noted that the 1992 Judgment included an order for an account of all bonus and rights issues for the 27 UOB Shares <span class="font-italic">and all moneys expended to take up the shares</span>. The reimbursement question had therefore already been decided in the 1992 Judgment, and Tng was entitled to reimbursement pursuant to the 1992 Judgment. Although Tng chose not to <span class="font-italic">comply</span> with the order in the 1992 Judgment, he was nevertheless bound by it and barred from relitigating the reimbursement question in the new action (<span class="font-italic">Lee </span>at [40]–[44]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">79 Hence, the case of <span class="font-italic">Lee </span>illustrates that the mere fact that an issue was decided in a different context does not preclude the doctrine of issue estoppel from operating, such that the party against whom the estoppel is alleged is barred from relitigating the issue.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Whether the CA Finding was fundamental to the Court of Appeal’s decision</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">80 In order for there to be an identity of subject matter, it must also be shown that the Undue Influence Issue was fundamental and not merely collateral to the Court of Appeal’s decision. This analysis should be approached from a commonsensical perspective (<span class="font-italic">Goh Nellie </span>at [37]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">81 The defendants submit that even if the CA Finding was made, it was not fundamental to the Court of Appeal’s decision. While undue influence was relevant to the issue of whether BLL had capacity, relevance does not amount to necessity.

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">82 In this regard, Menon JC in <span class="font-italic">Goh Nellie </span>drew a distinction between issues which are “no more than steps in a process of reasoning” and those which are “so cardinal” that the decision “cannot stand without them” (<span class="font-italic">Goh Nellie </span>at [37] citing <span class="font-italic">Blair v Curran </span>(1939) 62 CLR 464 (“<span class="font-italic">Blair</span>”). As stated by Dixon J in <span class="font-italic">Blair </span>at 531, “nothing but what is <span class="font-italic">legally indispensable</span> to the conclusion is thus finally closed or precluded” [emphasis added].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">83 In determining whether the CA Finding was fundamental to its decision, I am also guided by the following principles.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">84 First, the CA Finding must have been a necessary step to its decision; it must have been a matter which was necessary to decide, and which was actually decided, as the groundwork of its decision (<span class="font-italic">Carl Zeiss</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at 965, cited by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Lee Tat </span>at [15]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">85 Second, issue estoppel arises only in respect of issues or ultimate facts. It does not apply to evidentiary facts which are found in the process of determining the affirmative or negative of an issue (<span class="font-italic">Brewer v Brewer </span>(1953) 88 CLR 1 at 15; <span class="font-italic">Inhenagwa</span><span class="font-italic"> v Onyeneho </span>[2017] EWHC 1971 (Ch) at [58]; <span class="font-italic">Eastern European Engineering Ltd v Vijay Construction (Proprietary) Ltd </span>[2018] EWHC 2713 (Comm) at [46(i)]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">86 Third, one can consider whether the CA Finding was a condition that had to be fulfilled in order for the Court of Appeal to make a determination that BLL lacked capacity. It is useful to refer to Diplock LJ’s (as he then was) judgment in <span class="font-italic">Thoday</span><span class="font-italic"> v Thoday </span>[1964] 2 WLR 371 at 384–385, a decision which has been cited with approval by the Singapore courts (see <span class="font-italic">Lee Tat </span>at [49]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… There are many causes of action which <span class="font-italic">can only be established by proving that two or more different conditions are fulfilled</span>. Such causes of action involve <span class="font-italic">as many separate issues between the parties as there are conditions to be fulfilled by the plaintiff </span><span class="font-italic">in order to establish his cause of action</span>; and there may be cases where the fulfilment of an identical condition is a requirement common to two or more different causes of action. If in litigation <span class="font-italic">upon one such cause of action any of such separate issues as to whether a particular condition has been fulfilled is determined by a court of competent jurisdiction</span> … neither party can, in subsequent litigation between one another upon any cause of action which depends upon the fulfilment of the identical condition …. deny that it was fulfilled if the court in the first litigation determined that it was. [emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">87 In this regard, it is useful to return to the orders sought in OSF 71/2011. In the originating summons filed by the Sisters, the two orders sought were a declaration that BLL lacked the capacity to make decisions relating to her property and affairs as well as for deputies to be appointed. The Court of Appeal was certainly of the view that the Sisters’ allegations of undue influence were <span class="font-italic">relevant and material</span> to the “single core issue”: that of whether BLL lacked capacity to make decisions relating to her property and affairs (<span class="font-italic">Re BKR (Court of Appeal) </span>at [76]). It does not, however, follow that the CA Finding was <span class="font-italic">necessary </span>in order for it to make the orders sought. In my judgment, the orders granted by the Court of Appeal could still stand even if the CA Finding was not made (<span class="font-italic">Goh Nellie </span>at [37]). Put another way, the CA Finding was not legally indispensable to the orders made by the Court of Appeal (<span class="font-italic">Blair </span>at 531). The Court of Appeal found that BLL was suffering from a mental impairment (<span class="font-italic">Re BKR (Court of Appeal) </span>at [173]) and that BLL was isolated from important members of her family and previously trusted professionals (<span class="font-italic">Re BKR (Court of Appeal) </span>at [202]). These two points alone would have sufficed for the Court of Appeal to grant the orders sought. That is not to say that the findings on undue influence (of which the CA Finding was a part) were irrelevant. However, assuming that there was no finding that the defendants had unduly influenced BLL into setting up the Trust, would BLL’s mental impairment and the defendants’ cutting of access have sufficed for the Court of Appeal to grant the orders sought by the Sisters? The answer, in my view, must be in the positive. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">88 This conclusion is reinforced by the structure of the Court of Appeal’s decision. The Court of Appeal found that BLL suffered from a mental impairment that was situated between Mild Cognitive Impairment and dementia. This resulted in significant memory decline, deterioration in executive functions and the emergence of paranoid and false beliefs (<span class="font-italic">Re BKR (Court of Appeal) </span>at [173]). The Court of Appeal then proceeded to examine BLL’s decision to set up the Trust and her decision to transfer her UBS assets to DBS. On the decision to set up the Trust, the following points were stated by the Court of Appeal:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a)  It was not easy to see any good reason for establishing the Trust, from an objective viewpoint (<span class="font-italic">Re BKR (Court of Appeal) </span>at [174]).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) BLL’s ability to provide reasons for her decision to set up the Trust was deficient; she was unable to use and weigh the information relevant to her decision to set up the Trust (<span class="font-italic">Re BKR (Court of Appeal) </span>at [178]). </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) BLL’s belief that CK would come after her money if she did not set up the Trust was problematic as there was no apparent cause for this belief and there was no factual basis for it. There was a possibility that her decision to set up the Trust was largely if not wholly impelled by a paranoid belief caused in part by her mental impairment (<span class="font-italic">Re BKR (Court of Appeal) </span>at [180]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">89 The Court of Appeal then proceeded to analyse BLL’s decision to transfer her UBS assets to DBS. Thereafter, the following paragraph at [188], which appears <span class="font-italic">before the findings on undue influence</span>, is instructive:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The sum of our reasoning so far is that there is <span class="font-italic">strong basis</span> for saying that [BLL] lacked the ability to make the decision to set up the Trust as well as the decision to transfer all her UBS assets to DBS. <span class="font-italic">But before we draw any firm conclusions on her capacity</span>, we should look at the actual circumstances in which those decisions were made. [emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">90 The appropriate interpretation of [188] could be said to turn upon a fine distinction. It could suggest that even before the findings on undue influence were made (including the CA Finding), there was sufficient basis for the Court of Appeal to declare that BLL lacked the ability to make the decisions relating to her property and affairs. The allegations of undue influence were relevant in so far as they buttressed, supplemented and reinforced the Court of Appeal’s reasoning, but they were not <span class="font-italic">fundamental</span> to the Court of Appeal’s final decision. It could be argued, on the other hand, that the findings on undue influence were not collateral. It formed, on a plain reading of the judgment, a necessary step in the Court of Appeal’s analysis. From the structure of the judgment, it could at first blush be arguably a decisive factor in the Court of Appeal’s conclusion: the point raised at [188] is reiterated at [207], “in other words, she lacks capacity because of a combination of mental impairment and the circumstances in which she lives”. Nevertheless, [188] raises two instances of possible undue influence, the formation of the Trust, which is the subject of the CA Finding, and the transfer of assets from UBS to DBS, which is not and was requested <span class="font-italic">after</span> the formation of the Trust. The conclusion also refers to BLL’s isolation. It is not clear when the isolation started, but the cutting off of access, integral to [188] and [207], was most clear after her move to Hong Kong in late November 2010. Therefore, even if a larger finding on undue influence and isolation could be said to be, in fact, a necessary step to the Court of Appeal’s decision, the specific CA Finding, which relates to the formation of the Trust, was only a component of that wider ground. In and of itself, the CA Finding was collateral to the conclusion as a whole.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">91 Could it be said that the above turns upon too fine a distinction?

If it was a central issue, one would have expected it to be raised by the Sisters in the summons or affidavits, and not for the first time through cross-examination. Even then, cross-examination on the Undue Influence Issue was not extensive, especially when compared to the medical evidence, and was mainly limited to the extracts reproduced at [65]–[66]. That the Undue Influence Issue was not a central issue can be attributed to the overarching inquiry in OSF 71/2011, which was to determine if BLL had capacity under the MCA. This was referred to by the Court of Appeal as the “single core issue” in OSF 71/2011 (<span class="font-italic">Re BKR (Court of Appeal) </span>at [76]). It was not to seek damages or equitable compensation from the defendants by reason of any alleged undue influence specific to the setting up of the Trust.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">93 This analysis leads to a related point, that the issue in this proceeding is not, in any event, precisely the same issue as the CA Finding, and I turn to it. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Does the CA Finding traverse the same ground as the present proceedings?</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">94 In <span class="font-italic">BOM v </span><span class="font-italic">BOK and another appeal </span>[2019] 1 SLR 349 (“<span class="font-italic">BOM</span>”), the Court of Appeal delineated the requirements of actual undue influence at [101(a)] as such: (i) that the defendant had the capacity to influence; (ii) the influence was exercised; (iii) its exercise was undue; and (iv) its exercise brought about the transaction. It follows from my positive finding on the First Preliminary Issue that the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Re BKR (Court of Appeal) </span>answered (i) to (iii) in the positive. What about (iv)? </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">95 Counsel for BLL argued that the Court of Appeal must have considered causation answered in the positive as well, because they made the CA Finding. Counsel for the defendants argued that it must be in the negative, because the Court of Appeal did not specifically consider the requirements. In my view, (iv) is in issue, because causation is not an immutable concept, but one that must be <span class="font-italic">considered in the context of its cause of action</span>. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">96 To explain, in the present proceedings, BLL is claiming for damages and/or equitable compensation for the defendants’ breach of fiduciary duties. Counsel for BLL clarified in the course of the hearing that the claim rested on three causes of action which are predicated on the CA Finding: as a breach of the defendants’ fiduciary duties, in equity, and in tort. For liability to arise under these causes of action, the question of causation must be examined. While the test for causation for the breach of fiduciary duties may not be a fully settled legal question in Singapore (see <span class="font-italic">Maryani</span><span class="font-italic"> Sadeli v Arjun Permanand Samtani and another and other appeals</span> [2015] 1 SLR 496 at [11], where the Court of Appeal left open the question whether but-for causation was necessary for breach of fiduciary duty), BLL has the legal burden to prove but-for causation in any event. This is because, in so far as BLL’s second cause of action (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>the “claim for undue influence”) lies also in <span class="font-italic">tort</span> (assuming, for present purposes, that such a tort exists), then BLL will have to prove that <span class="font-italic">but for </span>the defendants’ undue influence, the alleged loss which she now seeks to claim would not have arisen. In contrast, in proceedings involving the MCA, the court looks to a range of factors resulting in a lack of mental capacity, one of which would be the undue influence of persons close to the patient. In other words, the Court of Appeal’s finding was that the exercise of undue influence on the part of the defendants was causative <span class="font-italic">in the </span><span class="font-italic">sense that</span> it contributed to BLL’s lack of capacity in setting up the Trust. The causation required for the purposes of OSF 71/2011 was <span class="font-italic">not</span> that of but-for causation in the setting up of the Trust, <span class="font-italic">which is </span><span class="font-italic">the issue at hand in this case</span>, and which I refer to in the rest of this judgment as the “Causation Issue”. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left"> Whether the Causation Issue was answered in OSF 71/2011 </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">97 It is clear that none of the parties in OSF 71/2011 canvassed arguments with regard to the Causation Issue as I have defined it at [96]. There was no necessity to do so. The question is whether it can be said that the Court of Appeal (or the High Court or Subordinate Courts, as the case may be) through its reasoning and conclusions, made an implicit finding that BLL would not have decided to set up the Trust but for the defendants’ undue influence. According to the defendants, the basket of findings in OSF 71/2011 does not deal squarely with the issue of causation. Unsurprisingly, BLL adopts the contrary position.   </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">98 The defendants’ likely defence, as highlighted in the course of oral submissions, is that at the material time, BLL’s mental impairment resulted in a paranoid belief that her son CK would come after her money. Furthermore, BLL was also professionally advised by Mr Z, Mr L and Ms D. Therefore, it is contended that BLL would still have proceeded to set up the Trust even without<span class="font-italic"> </span>the defendants’ undue influence: she was labouring under a paranoid belief and did receive professional advice to set up the Trust.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-Heading-5 text-left">(1) Professional advisers</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">99 As regards the advice BLL received from Mr Z, Mr L and Ms D, all of whom did not testify in OSF 71/2011, this is not inconsistent with the Court of Appeal’s finding that the defendants <span class="font-italic">exercised</span><span class="font-italic"> undue influence</span> on BLL’s decision to set up the Trust. Indeed, at [205] of <span class="font-italic">Re BKR (Court of Appeal)</span>, the Court of Appeal stated that:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">We accept that [BLL] has been receiving assistance from those professionals and that this assistance is likely to remain available to her. However, the fact that such assistance was apparently made available to [BLL] at the relevant time did not prevent her acting to establish the Trust and to transfer her UBS assets to DBS. We have found that [BLL] lacked the ability to make those decisions, notwithstanding the assistance she apparently received. …</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">100 Implicit in the Court of Appeal’s judgment was that the independent advice received by BLL did not have an emancipating effect on the undue influence exercised by the defendants on BLL (see Nelson Enonchong, <span class="font-italic">Duress, Undue Influence and Unconscionable Dealing </span>(Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 2nd Ed, 2012), para 12–008; <span class="font-italic">Law Society of Singapore v Wan Hui Hong James </span>[2013] 3 SLR 221 at [17]; <span class="font-italic">Pek</span><span class="font-italic"> Nam Kee and another v Peh Lam Kong and another </span>[1994] 2 SLR(R) 750 at [123]). In other words, the Court of Appeal was not satisfied that the advice was “relevant and effective to free [BLL] from the impairment of the influence on [her] free will and to give [her] the necessary independence of judgment and freedom to make choices with a full appreciation of what [she] was doing” (see <span class="font-italic">Niersmans</span><span class="font-italic"> v Pesticcio </span>[2004] EWCA Civ 372 at [23]). This is not to suggest that BLL’s advisers were negligent: indeed, in <span class="font-italic">Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp Ltd </span><span class="font-italic">v Tan Teck Khong and another (committee of the estate of Pang Jong Wan, mentally disordered) and others </span>[2005] 2 SLR(R) 694 at [24], the High Court stated that an adviser who exercises due care might still not be able to detect undue influence. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">101 However, the defendants are not simply asserting in S 1085/2016 that BLL received professional advice in deciding to set up the Trust. The defendants are arguing that it was Mr Z “who first gave BLL the idea [to set up] the [Trust]”, rather than the defendants themselves.

</div>
</div>
</div> In other words, Mr Z did not merely advice BLL in relation to the Trust, but <span class="font-italic">planted the idea of the Trust</span> in BLL. This point was neither investigated nor decided in OSF 71/2011 and it has, in my view, a material impact on the Causation Issue. Put simply, if the <span class="font-italic">genesis of the idea of the Trust</span> could be attributed to Mr Z, and BLL already decided in principle to set up the Trust, it is arguable that she would have proceeded to do so even if there was no undue influence exercised by the defendants. Therefore, even if the defendants unduly influenced BLL’s decision to set up the Trust, it would not be correct to say BLL would not have made her decision but for their undue influence. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">102 The findings in OSF 71/2011 on the role of the professional advisers therefore only go towards showing that the independent advice did not have an emancipating effect on the undue influence exercised by the defendants. They are, however, not sufficient to deal with the Causation Issue. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-5 text-left">(2) BLL’s paranoid belief</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">103 The defendants are also seeking to argue in S 1085/2016 that the defendants’ undue influence was not causative as BLL was labouring under a paranoid belief at the material time. Indeed, the Court of Appeal recognised this at [180] of <span class="font-italic">Re BKR (Court of Appeal)</span>, stating that there was a “possibility that [BLL’s] decision to set up the Trust was largely if not wholly impelled by a paranoid belief that was caused at least in part by her mental impairment”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">104 That being said, and as I have found in respect of the First Preliminary Issue, this statement of the Court of Appeal must be read in context. It is clear that the Court of Appeal was reasoning inductively and by the end of the judgment, there was a finding that the defendants had unduly influenced BLL into deciding to set up the Trust. But the point that is relevant here is that the defendants wish to pursue the still open question as to whether BLL would have set up the Trust because of her paranoid belief, <span class="font-italic">independent</span> of any undue influence exercised on her by the defendants. Such a defence was not run in OSF 71/2011, for the simple reason that the defendants (and BLL herself) were operating under the premise that BLL did indeed have capacity when she decided to set up the Trust. If they ran a defence based on BLL’s paranoid belief in OSF 71/2011, that would have completely undermined the foundation to their case in OSF 71/2011: that BLL had capacity and decision-making ability at the material time when the Trust was set up.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">105 Of course, the converse point may also be made, that the paranoid delusion furnished the defendants with an opportunity which they exploited. This link between physical infirmity and undue influence was acknowledged by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">BOM </span>(see [171])<span class="font-italic">. </span>The First Instance Judge neatly encapsulated how these findings could support each other at [130] of the First Instance GD:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">I find that [BLM], a psychiatrist, who has lived for years with [BLL], knows and understands [BLL], and is influencing and causing [BLL] to act in a manner that is contrary to [BLL’s] best interests. [BLM], with whom [BLL] stays, has effectively cut off [BLL]’s access to her family members since late 2010 and early 2011 and [BLL] has been led or allowed to believe that her family members no longer care for her, that her other daughter NG has left the country with her family and her son CK is behind this action as they are only interested in benefitting from her wealth … [The defendants] would stand to gain financially by maintaining the appearance that [BLL] has mental capacity whilst influencing [BLL] to inject all her assets into the [Trust] …</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">This connection is also very much alive in the Court of Appeal’s judgment, where it was held that the defendants were “positive hindrances to her decision-making independence in that she [was] cut off from people who would otherwise be able to give her advice” (<span class="font-italic">Re BKR (Court of Appeal</span><span class="font-italic">) </span>at [207]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">106 I do not consider, however, that the point was adequately pleaded or argued, nor would the above dicta be sufficient for the purposes of issue estoppel. A relevant point is that the First Instance Judge was of the view that the isolation started in late 2010. The Trust documents were not produced in OSF 71/2011, and the Court of Appeal was of the view that while the Trust was dated 26 October 2010, it was likely signed on 6 or 26 November 2010. It was even later, on 28 November 2010, that BLL left for Hong Kong to live with the defendants. The comments of the Court of Appeal would also have to be seen with this time sequence in mind. The issue is a relevant one for trial if parties wish to litigate it.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-5 text-left">Conclusion on the Causation Issue</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">107 Accordingly, the Causation Issue was not answered in OSF 71/2011, whether expressly or implicitly. Relevant questions, such as whether Mr Z prompted BLL to set up the Trust, and BLL’s reaction to this advice, were not decided by any of the three courts, and it would have been unnecessary to do so. Furthermore, the question of whether BLL would have decided to set up the Trust in any event because of her paranoid belief was also not argued by the defendants in OSF 71/2011 because that would have contradicted their case in OSF 71/2011. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Conclusion on the Second Preliminary Issue</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">108 The Second Preliminary Issue centres on whether there was an identity of subject matter between OSF 71/2011 and S 1085/2016. I found that the Undue Influence Issue was raised and argued in OSF 71/2011, albeit that it was only raised in the course of cross-examination. Furthermore, the fact that it was raised and argued in a different context (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, to determine if BLL had mental capacity) did not preclude the doctrine of issue estoppel from operating. Nevertheless, I hold that the CA Finding is not binding because it was not fundamental to the Court of Appeal’s decision and the orders made. It also did not traverse precisely the same grounds as S 1085/2016 but a smaller one. BLL will have to prove the Causation Issue for the defendants to be liable in damages or equitable compensation. While the practical effect of litigating the Causation Issue would result in relitigation of the Undue Influence Issue (in so far as both issues arise out of the same underlying facts), such relitigation is necessary because the issues of undue influence specific to S 1085/2016 are not identical to OSF 71/2011, as I have explained at [96]. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Third Preliminary Issue</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">109 The doctrine of issue estoppel not applying, the question then remains whether there is any abuse of process nonetheless. Hence, there is the need to consider the Third Preliminary Issue, which is whether the defendants are precluded by the extended doctrine of <span class="font-italic">res judicata</span> from arguing that they did not unduly influence BLL into deciding to set up, setting up and/or signing the settlement constituting the Trust. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The extended doctrine of </span><span class="font-weight-bold">res judicata</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">110 The extended doctrine of <span class="font-italic">res judicata</span> can be attributed to the foundational authority of <span class="font-italic">Henderson v Henderson </span>(1843) 3 Hare 100, where it was said at 114–115 that:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… [W]here a given matter becomes the subject of litigation in, and of adjudication by, a Court of competent jurisdiction, the Court requires the parties to that litigation to bring forward their whole case, and will not (except under special circumstances) permit the same parties to open the same subject of litigation in respect of matter which might have been brought forward as part of the subject in contest, but which was not brought forward, only because they have, from negligence, inadvertence, or even accident, omitted part of their case. The plea of <span class="font-italic">res judicata </span>applies, except in special cases, not only to points upon which the Court was actually required by the parties to form an opinion and pronounce a judgment, but to every point which properly belonged to the subject of litigation, and which [the] parties, exercising reasonable diligence, might have brought forward at the time. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">111 In <span class="font-italic">TT International</span> at [102], the Court of Appeal explained that the extended doctrine has also been referred to as the doctrine of abuse of process and the purpose behind the doctrine is to limit <span class="font-italic">abusive and duplicative litigation</span>. The concern which underlies the extended doctrine is reflected in the following passage from the Court of Appeal’s decision in <span class="font-italic">Lim </span><span class="font-italic">Geok Lin Andy v Yap Jin Meng Bryan and another appeal </span>[2017] 2 SLR 760 (“<span class="font-italic">Andy Lim</span>”) at [44]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">It seems to us that the common thread linking the decisions relating to the doctrine of abuse of process is the <span class="font-italic">courts’</span><span class="font-italic"> concern with managing and preventing multiplicity of litigation so as to ensure that justice is achieved for all</span>. In our judgment, the rule in <span class="font-italic">Henderson </span>is applicable where some connection can be shown between the party seeking to relitigate the issue and the earlier proceeding where that essential issue was litigated, <span class="font-italic">which would make it unjust to allow that party to reopen the issue</span>. [original emphasis removed; emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">112  In determining whether there is an abuse of process, the court ought to look at all the circumstances of the case, and the following are some non-exhaustive factors (<span class="font-italic">Goh Nellie </span>at [53]):</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) whether the later proceedings are in substance nothing more than a collateral attack upon the previous decision;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) whether there is fresh evidence that might warrant relitigation;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) whether there are <span class="font-italic">bona fide </span>reasons why an issue that ought to have been raised in the earlier action was not; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) whether there are any special circumstances that must justify allowing the case to proceed.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">113 Accordingly, and unlike cause of action estoppel and issue estoppel, the inquiry for the extended doctrine of <span class="font-italic">res judicata </span>is a broad-based one that takes into account all the facts and circumstances of the case. The absence or existence of the non-exhaustive factors stated above is not decisive. The court should remain guided by the balance to be found in the tensions between ensuring that a litigant who has a genuine claim or defence is allowed to put his case before the court and recognising that there is a point at which repeated litigation becomes unduly oppressive to the other party (<span class="font-italic">Goh Nellie </span>at [53]). There is an underlying public interest in ensuring finality in litigation and the private interest of a party not to be twice vexed in the same matter (<span class="font-italic">Johnson v Gore Wood &amp; Co </span>[2001] 2 WLR 72 (“<span class="font-italic">Johnson</span>”) at 90). These interests reflect the competing considerations between the administration of justice being brought into disrepute and the unfairness to a party on the other (<span class="font-italic">Hunter v Chief Constable of the West Midlands Police &amp; O</span><span class="font-italic">thers </span>[1981] 3 WLR 906 (“<span class="font-italic">Hunter</span>”) at 909). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">114 In so far as the burden of proof is concerned, the onus of proving an abuse of process lies on the party who alleges it, which would be BLL in the present case (<span class="font-italic">Kwa Ban Cheong v </span><span class="font-italic">Kuah Boon Sek and others </span>[2003] 3 SLR(R) 644 at [29]; <span class="font-italic">Johnson </span>at 118; <span class="font-italic">Bragg v </span><span class="font-italic">Oceanus Mutual Underwriting Association (Bermuda) Ltd </span>[1982] 2 Lloyd’s Rep 132 (“<span class="font-italic">Bragg</span>”) at 138). The test of whether there is an abuse of process has been referred as one that is “exacting” (<span class="font-italic">Caylon</span><span class="font-italic"> v Michailaidis &amp; Ors (Gilbraltar) </span>[2009] UKPC 34 at [37]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">115 Furthermore, in determining whether the extended doctrine of <span class="font-italic">res judicata </span>ought to apply, the court ought to disregard the prospects of success of the claim or defence that is sought to be relitigated or raised in the new proceedings. If it is thought that the defence is one that is “hopeless”, then it is liable to be struck out, but that is a separate enquiry from whether there is an abuse of process (<span class="font-italic">Stuart v Goldberg Linde (a firm) and others </span>[2008] 1 WLR 823 at [57]; K R Handley, <span class="font-italic">Spencer Bower and Handley: Res Judicata </span>(LexisNexis, 4th Ed, 2009) (“<span class="font-italic">Spencer Bower</span>”) at para 26.11).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Analysis</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">116 I have decided, in the context of the First Preliminary Issue, that the Court of Appeal did find that the defendants unduly influenced BLL into deciding to set up the Trust. I have also found that the Undue Influence Issue was sufficiently raised and argued for the CA Finding to be made. Turning then to the range of concerns expressed in the broad inquiry, the question that follows is whether abuse of process would arise here, where the <span class="font-italic">practical effect</span> of the defendants seeking to litigate the Causation Issue would result in litigation again of the evidence which resulted in the CA Finding. The plaintiff would be, in this sense, twice vexed by the Undue Influence Issue, by the very persons whom the Court of Appeal previously considered responsible for undue influence. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">117 In assessing the Third Preliminary Issue, two questions are particularly important to the case at hand:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Are there genuine reasons to allow the defendants to adduce evidence that they could have adduced at the prior proceedings?</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) If so, how should a risk of findings inconsistent with the CA Finding be viewed?</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">118 I deal with these two questions in turn.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Evidence that warrants relitigation</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">119 One factor to be taken into account by the court in determining whether there is an abuse of process is if there is fresh evidence that might warrant relitigation (<span class="font-italic">Goh Nellie </span>at [53]). The defendants contend that the Undue Influence Issue should be relitigated as key witnesses were not called in OSF 71/2011, namely, Mr Z, Mr L and Ms D. BLL points out that this evidence was available at the last hearing. According to BLL, the defendants made a conscious decision not to call Mr Z, Mr L and Ms D as witnesses in OSF 71/2011.

</div>
</div>
</div> Therefore, they should not be allowed to use the fact that they were not called as a reason for relitigating the Undue Influence Issue. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">120 In my view, the defendants’ failure to call these key witnesses must be seen in the context of the nature of the proceedings in OSF 71/2011, which were to determine if BLL had mental capacity. It was plainly not a civil trial to determine if they should be held liable for a breach of fiduciary duties by reason of undue influence exercised on BLL, in which case one would have expected the defendants to call all material witnesses to support their case. Furthermore, BLL herself did not see the need in OSF 71/2011 to call Mr Z, Mr L and Ms D, which would have resulted in more time and expenses incurred. In the circumstances, there were reasonable grounds for not calling these professionals.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">121 Once it is established that there were reasonable grounds for not calling the Mr Z, Mr L and Ms D in OSF 71/2011, it becomes apparent that the <span class="font-italic">quality of evidence </span>in S 1085/2016 will be significantly improved in the present suit with the addition of these material witnesses. Pleadings and discovery may be properly focused on the relevant issues. The other witnesses who were called in OSF 71/2011 will likewise be available to testify in S 1085/2016. BLL, who in any event was found to lack capacity at the material time she gave evidence in OSF 71/2011, is now acting by her deputies and will not be vexed with cross-examination. This is thus a factor that weighs in favour of allowing the Undue Influence Issue to be relitigated.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Other circumstances justifying relitigation</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">122 There are also other circumstances that justify allowing relitigation on the Undue Influence Issue.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">123 First, the Undue Influence Issue was only raised in the course of cross-examination in OSF 71/2011. It was not raised directly in the summons or affidavits. While I find that the Undue Influence Issue was in fact argued by the defendants, I can see some force in their contention that they were not aware that they had to run a defence to respond to the Sisters’ allegations of undue influence.

</div> The examination of the Undue Influence Issue in S 1085/2016 will therefore be facilitated by clearer pleadings and proper discovery.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">124 Second, now that it has been established that BLL did not have capacity at the material time, and was in fact operating under a paranoid belief that the Trust was necessary to prevent CK from coming after her money (<span class="font-italic">Re BKR (Court of Appeal) </span>at [180]), this allows the defendants to mount a new argument<span class="font-italic"> </span>that was presented in the course of this preliminary hearing: that BLL’s decision to set up the Trust was due to this paranoid belief and that there was no undue influence. This argument was not open to the defendants in OSF 71/2011 as it would have undermined their case that BLL had capacity at the material time.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">125 Third, the Causation Issue will in any event have to be litigated in S 1085/2016. There were reasonable grounds for the Causation Issue not to be raised in OSF 71/2011 as it was never a live issue. The allegations of undue influence only went towards whether undue influence was <span class="font-italic">exercised </span>on BLL: it was not necessary for the courts to consider causation as they would in a case where undue influence is invoked as a vitiating factor against a contract. Accordingly, since the Causation Issue will have to be addressed at trial (and this was the initial position taken by counsel for BLL during the hearing on 29 April 2019),

<div class="FootnoteRef text-justify">  1st and 2nd defendants’ further skeletal arguments (preliminary hearing on undue influence issues) para 18b.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> As observed in <span class="font-italic">Spencer Bower </span>at para 26.15, “a defendant is in a better position to resist a finding of abuse”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">128 Two English decisions are relevant in this regard. The first is <span class="font-italic">Conlon and another v Simms </span>[2008] 1 WLR 484 (“<span class="font-italic">Conlon</span>”). In <span class="font-italic">Conlon</span>, the defendant, Simms, was a solicitor who was in partnership with the claimants. In 2004, the Solicitors Disciplinary Tribunal (“the Tribunal”) pronounced that Simms was guilty of misconduct and he was struck off the roll. The Tribunal found that Simms was actively involved in making, promoting or facilitating transactions which were bogus and had made deceitful representations to third parties in promoting these transactions. Simms’s appeal to the Divisional Court was dismissed. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">129 Thereafter, an action was commenced by the claimants, alleging <span class="font-italic">inter alia </span>that Simms had fraudulently refrained from disclosing matters which might affect his status as a solicitor. The particulars pleaded in the statement of claim were, essentially, the charges against Simms which the Tribunal had found to be made out. Simms denied the allegations against him and contended that the Tribunal’s findings were inadmissible. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">130 The English Court of Appeal held that it was <span class="font-italic">not </span>an abuse of process for Simms to deny the allegations against him in the new action and that there was a principled distinction which could be made between plaintiffs and defendants in the context of the extended doctrine. At [146] of <span class="font-italic">Conlon</span>, Jonathan Parker LJ stated that:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… there is force in Mr Simms’s submission that in denying the allegations of dishonesty made against him in the present action he is doing no more than continuing to protest his innocence of the charges brought against him by the Law Society, albeit he is doing so in the face of the adverse findings of the [Tribunal] and the Divisional Court: to use his own words, <span class="font-italic">he has initiated nothing</span>. … <span class="font-italic">in general the court should be slower in preventing a party from continuing to deny serious charges of which another court has previously found him guilty than in preventing such a party from initiating proceedings for the purpose of </span><span class="font-italic">relitigating the question whether he is guilty of those charges</span>. [emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">131 To a similar effect, Ward LJ also stated at [178]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">... When deciding whether it is an abuse of the process for [Simms] to continue to demand that the case brought by others in a different context be proved, it seems to me that the essential question is whether it is more unfair on the claimants to require them to prove very serious charges of fraud … than it is unfair on the defendant to prevent him altogether from defending himself in these new and unconnected proceedings. <span class="font-italic">I am uncomfortable with the result … that a man facing serious charges of fraud is not able to defend himself again, and I conclude that he suffers a greater unfairness than do the claimants.</span> [emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">132 A few principles can be distilled from <span class="font-italic">Conlon</span>. First, where the party who is seeking to relitigate a point is the defendant in <span class="font-italic">both </span>the previous and current actions, the court should be slow to find that there is an abuse, as compared to a situation involving a claimant in both proceedings, or where the defendant in the earlier action <span class="font-italic">initiates </span>the new proceedings. Second, it appears that the court will also consider the point that is sought to be relitigated: the more serious the charge against the defendant, the more it will be in the interests of fairness and justice for him to be allowed to assert his defence in the new proceedings. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">133 The next relevant English case is that of <span class="font-italic">OMV </span><span class="font-italic">Petrom SA v Glencore International AG </span>[2014] EWHC 242 (“<span class="font-italic">Glencore</span>”). In <span class="font-italic">Glencore</span>, a company, Petex, commenced arbitral proceedings against the defendant, Glencore, in 2003 for breach of contract and/or fraud. The arbitral tribunal found that Glencore was in breach of contract. The tribunal, however, found that Petex suffered no actionable loss. Following these events, another company, Petrom, sued Glencore, relying on the same conclusions reached by the arbitral tribunal to find a breach of contract. Petrom alleged that it would be an abuse of process for the same issues determined by the tribunal to be relitigated. Rejecting Petrom’s contentions, Justice Blair held at [30] that:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The position in my view is analogous to that in <span class="font-italic">Conlon v Simms</span>, ibid, where it was held that the court should be slower in preventing a party from continuing to deny serious charges of which another court has previously found him guilty than in preventing such a party from initiating proceedings for the purpose of relitigating the question whether he was guilty of those charges. … The same point applies in the present case in my view, and I would regard it as sufficient to decide the application against Petrom.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">134 This factor is not, of course, decisive. In <span class="font-italic">Then </span><span class="font-italic">Khek Koon and another v Arjun Permanand Samtani and another and other suits</span> [2014] 1 SLR 245 (“<span class="font-italic">Then </span><span class="font-italic">Khek Koon</span>”), for example, the defendants<span class="font-italic"> </span>were precluded from denying that they were in breach of their fiduciary duties owed to the plaintiff, due to the extended doctrine of <span class="font-italic">res judicata </span>(<span class="font-italic">Then </span><span class="font-italic">Khek Koon </span>at [101]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">135 In <span class="font-italic">Then </span><span class="font-italic">Khek Koon</span>, the plaintiffs were subsidiary proprietors of flats in a condominium known as Horizon Towers. The defendants were members of the sale committee in charge of a collective sale, which the plaintiffs objected to. In the <span class="font-italic">prior proceedings</span> (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, <span class="font-italic">Ng </span><span class="font-italic">Eng Ghee and others v Mamata Kapildev Dave and others (Horizon Partners Pte Ltd, intervener) and another appeal </span>[2009] 3 SLR(R) 109 (“<span class="font-italic">Ng </span><span class="font-italic">Eng Ghee</span>”), the Court of Appeal had upheld the plaintiffs’ objections and set aside the collective sale. Although there were costs orders made in favour of the plaintiffs, the Court of Appeal did not accept all of the plaintiffs’ submissions on costs. This resulted in a margin between what the plaintiffs recovered under the costs orders and the amount paid to their solicitors. In the <span class="font-italic">later proceedings </span>(<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, <span class="font-italic">Then </span><span class="font-italic">Khek Koon</span>), the plaintiffs therefore sought equitable compensation equivalent to their unrecovered costs on the ground of the defendants’ breach of fiduciary duties (<span class="font-italic">Then </span><span class="font-italic">Khek Koon </span>at [1]–[5]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">136 The Court of Appeal, in the <span class="font-italic">prior proceedings</span>, had found that the sale committee breached its duties to the subsidiary proprietors by, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, failing to disclose that the defendants had an undisclosed potential conflict of interest. The defendants sought to argue, on various grounds, that these findings were not binding on the <span class="font-italic">later proceedings</span>, which arose in the context of determining whether the defendants were liable to compensate the plaintiffs in equity. Vinodh Coomaraswamy J rejected the defendants’ contentions, and stated as follows at [102] of <span class="font-italic">Then </span><span class="font-italic">Khek Koon</span>:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The Court of Appeal set aside the collective sale order because it was satisfied that the [sale committee’s] breaches of fiduciary duties meant that the collective sale was not a transaction in good faith … Although it arises in a different context, the question before me on breach of fiduciary duties is the same question which the Court of Appeal considered and answered in [<span class="font-italic">Ng </span><span class="font-italic">Eng Ghee</span>]. The defendants’ invitation to me to decide afresh whether they were in breach of their fiduciary duties is in fact an invitation to me to ignore findings of fact by the Court of Appeal which were essential to its decision in [<span class="font-italic">Ng </span><span class="font-italic">Eng Ghee</span>]. That invitation is an abuse of process. I am unable to accept it. I am therefore bound by the decision in [<span class="font-italic">Ng </span><span class="font-italic">Eng Ghee</span>] to hold that the defendants were in breach of their fiduciary duties to the plaintiffs. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">137 In coming to the conclusion that there was an abuse of process, Coomaraswamy J’s reasons were as follows. First, he found that the Court of Appeal’s findings in <span class="font-italic">Ng </span><span class="font-italic">Eng Ghee </span>of the various breaches in fiduciary duties were “essential step[s]” for them to arrive at their decision to set aside the collective side order (at [101]). Second, the defendants had “every opportunity to put their side of the story forward” in the prior proceedings, but chose not to do so. In <span class="font-italic">Ng </span><span class="font-italic">Eng Ghee</span>, the alleged breaches of fiduciary duties were front and centre from the inception of the action. It was these breaches of fiduciary duties on the part of the sale committee which formed the very basis of the objecting subsidiary proprietors’ attempt to set aside the collective sale. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">138 The comparison between <span class="font-italic">Then </span><span class="font-italic">Khek Koon </span>and the case at hand show that the broad-based inquiry as to whether or not there is an abuse of process is an intensely fact-specific exercise. While there were good reasons the defendants in the present suit did not fully litigate the present issues in the prior proceedings, the same could not be said of <span class="font-italic">Then </span><span class="font-italic">Khek Koon. </span>Like the courts in <span class="font-italic">Conlon</span> and <span class="font-italic">Glencore</span>, I consider that there will be a greater degree of unfairness on the part of the defendants if they are not provided the opportunity to defend themselves against serious accusations which have been levelled against them. In S 1085/2016, BLL is seeking to hold the defendants liable for their alleged breaches of fiduciary duties: such liability was plainly not the subject of OSF 71/2011.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Collateral attack and inconsistent findings</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">139 In the light of the foregoing, it is clear that the defendants’ wish to relitigate does not amount to <span class="font-italic">nothing more </span>than a collateral attack upon OSF 71/2011. As a final matter I consider the related issue of a risk of inconsistent findings. This is a factor that weighs against allowing the issue to be relitigated (<span class="font-italic">Antariksa</span><span class="font-italic"> Logistics Pte Ltd and others v Nurdian Cuaca and others </span>[2018] 3 SLR 117 at [104]–[105]). It follows from my reasons at [94]–[96], because causation is considered in the context of its cause of action, that any undue influence findings to be made in S 1085/2016 would likely be different in nature and composition to the CA Finding. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Conclusion on the Third Preliminary Issue</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">140 In conclusion, any concern about relitigating the Undue Influence Issue must be balanced against the following points:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) It cannot be said that the current proceedings are nothing more than a collateral attack on the CA Finding;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) There are, in the present case, genuine reasons for relitigating the Undue Influence Issue:</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(i) Key witnesses, namely Mr Z, Mr L and Ms D, were not called in OSF 71/2011, and will have to be called in any event in S 1085/2016 to address the Causation Issue;</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(ii) The Undue Influence Issue was only raised in cross-examination and not in the summons or affidavits;</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(iii) The defendants are seeking to argue that BLL’s decision to set up the Trust was due to her paranoid belief rather than any alleged exercise of undue influence: this argument would not have been available to them in OSF 71/2011.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) In this context, the failure to raise the issue of BLL’s paranoid delusion, call all necessary witnesses or bring to the fore all the necessary defences cannot be attributed to the defendants. The various issues were not central to their case in the prior proceedings, although they became significant as the case progressed. In this context, the court should be slow to find an abuse on the part of a defendant who continues to deny the plaintiff’s accusations in new and different proceedings, where now liability is sought to be imposed as a result. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) The risk of inconsistent findings, while present, may be balanced against the fact that the nature and composition of any undue influence findings in S 1085/2016 do not traverse the same ground as the CA Finding.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">141 Accordingly, I find that the extended doctrine of <span class="font-italic">res judicata</span> does not apply to preclude the defendants from relitigating the Undue Influence Issue. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">142 To conclude, I have answered the Preliminary Issues as follows:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) For the First Preliminary Issue, I hold that the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Re BKR (Court of Appeal)</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>did find that the defendants unduly influenced BLL into deciding to set up the Trust;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) For the Second Preliminary Issue, issue estoppel does not apply as there is no identity of subject matter; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) For the Third Preliminary Issue, the extended doctrine of <span class="font-italic">res judicata </span>does not apply because there is no abuse of process in the present case.   </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">143 I shall hear counsel on costs. </div><div class="Judg-Sign text-left">Valerie Thean   <br/>Judge  </div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Chin Li Yuen Marina, Alcina Lynn Chew Aiping, Muk Chen Yeen Jonathan, Chan Yi Zhang, Pang Hui Min and Cha Meiyin (Tan Kok Quan Partnership LLP) for the plaintiff;<br/>Poon Kin Mun Kelvin, Zhu Ming-Ren Wilson and David Isidore Tan (Rajah &amp; Tann Singapore LLP) for the defendants.</div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div><div class="Judg-Quote-List text-justify"> </div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
