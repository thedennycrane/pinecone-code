The purpose of the Incentive Plan was to provide eligible directors and/or employees of the plaintiff and ACP (“Plan Participants”) the opportunity to participate in the returns generated by ACP’s investments, by way of incentive awards. Under the Incentive Plan, certain fund investments which ACP undertakes are pooled and aggregated for the calendar year in which the binding subscription to the investment is issued, each calendar year being referred to as “the Vintage Year”. ACP generally receives a certain fee for the investments made during each Vintage Year (“Performance Fee”) according to a performance fee agreement. Thereafter, ACP may in its discretion assure Plan Participants of a certain individual percentage of the Performance Fee it receives in respect of each Vintage Year (“Incentive Award”). Plan Participants are notified of the grant of an Incentive Award for a particular Vintage Year through a certificate which also informs them of the various vesting periods of their Incentive Awards (“Award Notice”).

</div> Therefore, this issue would also fall within the ambit of the Employment Contract. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 Having considered the plaintiff’s submissions, I was unable to agree with the plaintiff’s characterisation of the dispute as one that arose out of the Employment Contract. Instead, I agreed with the defendant that the dispute in OS 1215 was quite plainly a dispute arising from the LTIP, which was a separate agreement, distinct and independent from the Employment Contract. To my mind, the core of the dispute concerned the parties’ differing interpretations of the <span class="font-italic">LTIP</span> with regard to the term “retirement” and the manner in which discretion was exercised in determining the defendant’s Leaver status.

</div>
</div> This was plainly distinguishable from a dispute arising from the <span class="font-italic">Employment Contract</span> concerning the parties’ rights and obligations or how any of its terms might operate. Indeed, OS 1215 does not on its face engage any dispute arising out of or in relation to the Employment Contract. The declarations sought in OS 1215 specifically concerned the determination of the defendant’s Leaver status for the purpose of the LTIP which relatedly involved the determination of whether the defendant had “retired” under the Employment Contract or the LTIP. Therefore, the crux of the dispute did not directly engage the Employment Contract, but rather wholly concerned the interpretation of the LTIP and the defendant’s rights thereunder. Any reference to the Employment Contract would be ancillary at best, to aid in the interpretation of the terms of the LTIP. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 I turn now to consider the plaintiff’s second argument. The plaintiff argued that even if the dispute in OS 1215 was construed as arising out of the LTIP and not the Employment Contract, the EJC contained in the latter ought to be given a broad and generous interpretation to cover disputes arising from both the Employment Contract and the LTIP.

</div> In accepting this proposition in SUM 308, the AR was guided by the Court of Appeal’s decision in <span class="font-italic">Bunge SA and another v Shrikant </span><span class="font-italic">Bhasi and other appeals </span>[2020] 2 SLR 1223 (“<span class="font-italic">Bunge</span>”) which cited with approval the English case of <span class="font-italic">Fiona Trust &amp; Holding Corporation</span><span class="font-italic"> and others v Privalov and others </span>[2007] 4 All ER 951 (“<span class="font-italic">Fiona Trust</span>”). In <span class="font-italic">Bunge</span>, the court observed at [37] that: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">In more recent times, however, the courts have recognised an important overarching principle – that the wording or arbitration and <span class="font-italic">jurisdiction clauses should be given a broad or generous interpretation</span>, based on the presumption that rational businessmen are likely to have intended that all the questions which arise out of the relationship which they have entered into or purported to enter into, are to be submitted to the same forum … [emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 At the outset, some appreciation of the context behind the application of this principle of broad and generous construction (the “<span class="font-italic">Fiona </span><span class="font-italic">Trust </span>principle”) in <span class="font-italic">Bunge </span>and <span class="font-italic">Fiona Trust </span>is required. The common thread running through both these cases is that the courts were tasked to determine whether a certain dispute arose out of a contract such as to fall within the scope of the respective jurisdiction or arbitration clauses contained in the <span class="font-italic">same</span> contract.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 In <span class="font-italic">Fiona Trust</span>, the House of Lords was concerned with the scope and effect of identical arbitration clauses in eight charterparties in the Shelltime 4 form. The owners alleged that the charters were procured by bribery and purported to rescind them on this ground. The owners commenced court proceedings while the charterers applied for a stay in favour of arbitration under s 9 of the Arbitration Act 1996 (UK). The relevant dispute resolution clause in the charterparties read as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">41. (a) This charter shall be construed and the relations between the parties determined in accordance with the laws of England. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(b) Any dispute arising under this charter shall be decided by the English courts to whose jurisdiction the parties hereby agree.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, but without prejudice to any party’s right to arrest or maintain the arrest of any maritime property, either party may, by giving written notice of election to the other party, elect to have any such dispute referred … to arbitration in London … </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 As observed by the court at [4], cl 41(b) was a jurisdiction clause in respect of “any dispute arising under this charter” which was then incorporated by reference – by the words “any such dispute” – in the arbitration clause in cl 41(c). Accordingly, the anterior question was whether cl 41(b) referred the question of whether the charters were procured by bribery to the jurisdiction of the English court. If it did, then a party may elect under cl 41(c) to have that question referred to arbitration. Lord Hoffmann, with whom the other Lordships agreed, held that the language of cl 41 did not exclude disputes concerning the validity of the contract and that t<span style="color: rgba(33,33,33,1)">he construction of an arbitration clause should start from the assumption that the parties, as rational businessmen, are likely to have intended any dispute arising out of the relationship into which they have entered or purported to enter to be decided by the same tribunal: see </span><span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(33,33,33,1)">Fiona Trust </span><span style="color: rgba(33,33,33,1)">at [13] and [15].</span><span style="color: rgba(33,33,33,1)"> </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 In <span class="font-italic">Bunge</span>, the claims in the proceedings arose out of a merchanting trade structure between the Bunge Group and Advantage Overseas Private Limited that involved three back-to-back contracts per transaction (a “string sale”). Not all of the string sale contracts had the same governing law and exclusive jurisdiction clauses. The question before the court was whether the phrase “arising out of or in connection with” contained in the exclusive jurisdiction clauses adopted in each of the individual string sale contracts was broad enough to encompass disputes arising from pre-contractual conduct. On the authority of <span class="font-italic">Fiona Trust</span>, the Court of Appeal held that the phrase was not temporally specific and that as a matter of contractual interpretation, the phrase was in principle broad enough to cover disputes arising from a legal relationship derived from specific pre-contractual conduct that may have led to parties entering into the contract that contained a dispute resolution clause with this wording (at [38]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 It can therefore be seen that the relevant clauses in <span class="font-italic">Bunge </span>and <span class="font-italic">Fiona Trust</span> were interpreted broadly solely to expand the temporality of the clauses in a single contract to cover within their ambit disputes in relation to pre-contractual conduct (in <span class="font-italic">Bunge</span>) and the validity of the contract (in<span class="font-italic"> Fiona Trust</span>).

</div>
</div> Singapore courts have yet to extend the <span class="font-italic">Fiona Trust</span> principle to multi-contract disputes to determine whether an exclusive jurisdiction clause contained in one agreement is wide enough to cover disputes arising from another agreement. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 Helpfully, the English courts have had the opportunity to consider such situations involving multi-contract disputes and extended the <span class="font-italic">Fiona Trust</span> principle to deal with them: see, for example, <span class="font-italic">Altera Absolute Global Master Fund v Sapinda Invest SARL</span> [2018] 1 All ER (Comm) 71 (“<span class="font-italic">Altera</span>”) and <span class="font-italic">Etihad Airways PJSC v </span><span class="font-italic">Flöther</span> [2020] 2 WLR 333 (“<span class="font-italic">Etihad Airways</span>”). In <span class="font-italic">Terre </span><span class="font-italic">Neuve SARL (a company incorporated in France) and others v Yewdale Ltd and others </span>[2020] EWHC 772 (Comm) (“<span class="font-italic">Terre </span><span class="font-italic">Neuve</span>”), the court took stock of the authorities and provided guidance as to when a jurisdiction agreement contained in one contract may, on its proper construction, extend to a claim that is made under another contract (at [30]). I shall refer to this principle as the “extended <span class="font-italic">Fiona Trust </span>principle”. I note that <span class="font-italic">Terre </span><span class="font-italic">Neuve</span> was not cited at the hearing before the AR, but I found the observations concerning the extended <span class="font-italic">Fiona Trust </span>principle as set out in <span class="font-italic">Terre </span><span class="font-italic">Neuve</span> at [31] to be instructive. I reproduce them at length below:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(1) The principle is based on the construction of the relevant jurisdiction clause (… contained in “Contract A”): it is not based on an implication or implied incorporation of the jurisdiction clause from Contract A into a related contract (henceforth known as “Contract B”). </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(2) As a matter of contractual construction, the wording of the clause in Contract A must be fairly capable of applying to disputes in Contract B. For example, a clause which stated that “any dispute <span class="font-underline">under this contract</span> shall be referred to arbitration” may not apply to disputes arising out of a (related) Contract B.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(3) It is not legally or commercially odd or improbable that an agreement should have no jurisdiction clause. Equally an agreement may have no jurisdiction clause <span class="font-italic">and</span> not be covered by a jurisdiction clause in a different agreement. … However, the absence of any <span class="font-italic">competing </span>jurisdiction clauses in any agreements within a particular set of agreements concluded by the parties for the same purpose, at the same time, and with the same subject matter, can be a relevant consideration (<span class="font-italic">Etihad </span>at [102(v)]). </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(4) The principle normally applies where the parties to Contract A and Contract B are the same. This arises from the fact that the Extended Fiona Trust Principle ultimately involves an exercise in contractual construction. One would normally expect the parties to Contract A to intend that their dispute resolution mechanism be binding upon the parties to Contract A rather than also applying to persons who were not party to that contract at all. … The effect of Fiona Trust is that fragmentation of disputes under one agreement is unlikely to be what the parties intended. However, it is perfectly possible that there may be fragmentation of the resolution of disputes across several agreements (although whether this was the parties' intentions is to be considered when construing the contracts).</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(5) The Extended Fiona Trust Principle normally applies where Contract A and Contract B are interdependent (Point (5a)), or have been concluded at the same time as part of a single package or transaction (Point (5b)), or (if concluded at different times) dealt with the same subject-matter (Point (5c)).</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(6) A jurisdiction agreement in Contract A will generally apply to Contract B where that contract was entered into at the same or a similar time as Contract A. In this regard:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(a) In <span class="font-italic">Etihad </span>at [104], the judge noted that jurisdiction agreements in Contract A generally did not apply to a different agreement (Contract B) which had been concluded <span class="font-italic">prior to </span>the jurisdiction agreement coming into existence … </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(b) Further, if Contract B was concluded prior to Contract A and the Contract A parties intended for the jurisdiction clause to deal with disputes under Contract B, one would normally expect Contract A to deal expressly with jurisdiction under Contract B. Quite apart from anything else the parties already know about Contract B's existence.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(c) If Contract A was concluded prior to Contract B, and a jurisdiction clause in Contract A was intended to cover Contract B, one might expect Contract B to cross-refer back to Contract A (albeit that ultimately what one is construing for present purposes is Contract A and on normal principles of contractual construction it stands to be construed at the date on which it was entered into). It is also to be borne in mind that it may be more difficult to conclude that parties to a particular jurisdiction agreement intended for that agreement to apply to disputes arising out of contracts that have not been concluded yet, particularly if such future contracts are not being discussed as part of the same package of agreements, or if the future contracts are in fact separated by a significant period of time from the conclusion of the jurisdiction agreement.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis in original]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 In summary, the key observations in relation to the extended <span class="font-italic">Fiona Trust</span> principle which I found to be apposite in the present case are as follows:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) As a matter of contractual interpretation, the wording of the clause in Contract A must be fairly capable of applying to disputes in Contract B.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The extended <span class="font-italic">Fiona Trust </span>principle normally applies where: </div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(i) the parties to Contract A and Contract B are the same; </div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(ii) Contract A and Contract B are interdependent;</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(iii) Contract A and Contract B were concluded at the same time as part of a single package or transaction; and/or</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(iv) Contract A and Contract B dealt with the same subject matter (if concluded at different times).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 Taking into account the observations espoused above in <span class="font-italic">Terre </span><span class="font-italic">Neuve</span>, I found that the extended <span class="font-italic">Fiona Trust</span> principle had no application in the present case. It could not be relied upon to broaden the ambit of the EJC in the Employment Contract such as to cover the present dispute arising under the LTIP. Consequently, the plaintiff had not demonstrated there was a good arguable case that the present dispute fell within the EJC in the Employment Contract. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 First, as a matter of contractual construction, it was difficult to accept that the wording of the EJC in cl 7.3 of the Employment Contract was fairly capable of applying to disputes arising out of the LTIP. The EJC stipulates that any dispute arising from “<span class="font-italic">this</span> Agreement” [emphasis added] (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the Employment Contract) is to be referred to the Singapore courts for determination under Singapore law. It was also clear from reading the EJC in context of the entire Employment Contract that issues and disputes concerning the Incentive Plan were to be governed by separate agreements and <span class="font-italic">not</span> by the Employment Contract. This was evidenced by cl 2.5 of the Employment Contract which made reference to the Incentive Plan:

The defendant entered into the Employment Contract with the plaintiff on 19 October 2009.

</div> While I accepted that the Incentive Plan and the corresponding Incentive Awards arose out of the defendant’s employment with the plaintiff, the subject matter of the LTIP clearly governed a specific <span class="font-italic">part</span> of their employment relationship which the parties had thought fit to carve out and address separately in a subsequent agreement extraneous to the Employment Contract.

</div>
</div> In <span class="font-italic">Altera</span>, the claimant exercised an option requiring the defendant to buy back 7.66m shares in a company called RNTS pursuant to a written agreement (“First Option Agreement”). In breach of contract, the defendant failed to complete the purchase. The claimant was able to sell slightly under 1.3m of the shares on the market, reducing its total holding in RNTS to 6,360,631 shares. On 26 August 2016, an oral agreement was concluded between the parties, where the defendant agreed to buy 1,360,631 RNTS shares (“the Sale Agreement”). Subsequently on 31 August 2016, the parties executed another written agreement which gave the claimant the option to sell to the defendant the remaining 5m shares, at a fixed share price (“Second Option Agreement”). Both the First and Second Option Agreements contained identical jurisdiction clauses providing that the English courts had non-exclusive jurisdiction to settle any dispute or claim that arises out of or in connection with the Agreements or their subject matter or formation. The defendant issued a challenge to the English court’s jurisdiction to hear the claim relating to the Sale Agreement. The court held that the claim for breach of the Sale Agreement was sufficiently connected with the Second Option Agreement so as to fall within its jurisdiction clause. In particular, the court noted at [21] that the “two agreements were interdependent”. In support of this, it was observed that: (a) the Sale Agreement and the Second Option Agreement were discussed simultaneously and to that extent were “in respect of the same package”; (b) both agreements arose from the breach of the First Option Agreement which remained in place until both agreements had been entered into; (c) the two agreements together dealt with the balance of the shares remaining unsold under the breached First Option Agreement; and (d) the claimant’s agreement to enter into the Second Option Agreement was conditional upon the purchase of the 1,360,631 shares under the Sale Agreement: see <span class="font-italic">Altera </span>at [20]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 It is clear from the decision in <span class="font-italic">Altera</span> that whether two contracts are interdependent requires an appreciation of the context behind the agreements. In the present case, the Employment Contract and the LTIP were certainly not interdependent in the manner contemplated in <span class="font-italic">Altera</span>. As noted above, the contracts were wholly independent in that they were concluded at different times and concerned different subject matter. Nor was there the same sense of conditionality in relation to a particular transaction/subject matter as in <span class="font-italic">Altera</span>. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 In <span class="font-italic">Etihad Airways</span>, the claimant agreed to advance €350m to a German airline in which it was a major shareholder (“the Facility Agreement”). The Facility Agreement was governed by English law and contained a jurisdiction clause providing for the exclusive jurisdiction of the English court. This was stated to be for the benefit of the claimant only, who was accordingly entitled to take proceedings in other jurisdictions. The claimant also provided the airline with a comfort letter, which did not contain a jurisdiction clause, in which it confirmed its intention to continue to provide the airline with financial support for 18 months from the date of the letter (“the Comfort Letter”). The airline subsequently commenced insolvency proceedings and ceased operations. The defendant, the airline’s insolvency administrator, commenced proceedings in Germany against the claimant for breach of the Comfort Letter. The key issue before the court was whether the exclusive jurisdiction clause in the Facility Agreement applied to the dispute in respect of the breach of the Comfort Letter. The court ultimately held that there was no reason in principle why the jurisdiction clause in the Facility Agreement should not extend to disputes arising in relation to the Comfort Letter (at [69(a)]). In arriving at this decision, the court observed, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, that both the Facility Agreement and the Comfort Letter were part of an overall support package which was provided by the claimant and the commercial background linking them was very closely connected (at [72] and [83]). Importantly, the court found that the claimant had a good arguable case that the Comfort Letter did not in and of itself create legally binding obligations and should be viewed as ancillary or linked to the Facility Agreement (at [84]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 It is evident from the court’s observations in <span class="font-italic">Etihad Airways</span> that the Facility Agreement and the Comfort Letter were thus highly interdependent. This was quite unlike the present case where it was not disputed that the Employment Contract and the LTIP were both separate legally binding agreements, with neither derived from nor ancillary to the other. Further, as canvassed previously, the Employment Contract and the LTIP were not part of the same package or transaction (see [38] above).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 Fifth, the parties to both the Employment Contract and the LTIP appear to be different. On one hand, the Employment Contract was expressed as being between the plaintiff (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, Allianz Capital Partners GmbH, Singapore Branch) and the defendant. On the other hand, the LTIP was expressed to have been concluded between “Allianz Capital Partners GmbH” (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, ACP) and the defendant.

</div> It is accepted that a local branch office is considered an extension of its foreign parent company and is not to be considered a separate legal entity: see <span class="font-italic">TMT Co Ltd v The Royal Bank of Scotland plc (trading as RBS</span><span class="font-italic"> Greenwich Futures) and others</span> [2018] 3 SLR 70 at [53]. However, the Employment Contract itself appears to treat ACP and the plaintiff as separate parties. For instance, a distinction is made between “the COMPANY” (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the plaintiff) and “ACP” as seen in cl 2.5 (see [37] above). This to my mind indicated that the LTIP was intended to be administered and governed by ACP and not the plaintiff. Moreover, incentive payments under the LTIP were borne by ACP and not the plaintiff.

</div> Therefore, disputes arising out of the LTIP and the Incentive Plan managed by ACP, the foreign parent company of the plaintiff, were unlikely to have been intended to be resolved in accordance with the EJC in the Employment Contract which was concluded between the plaintiff and the defendant based in Singapore. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 Based on the foregoing analysis, it was unnecessary for me to examine the second issue of whether the defendant had shown strong cause to justify a stay of proceedings notwithstanding the EJC.

Moreover, the defendant had not explained why the evidence of any of the potential witnesses could not be given via video-link: see <span class="font-italic">JIO </span>at [69].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 In relation to the Witness Compellability Factor, I note that a Singapore court cannot compel a foreign witness to testify in a Singapore court (see O 38 r 18(2) of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2014 Rev Ed)). Therefore, the fact that the members of the ACP Management Board and the ACP Compensation Committee are predominantly (and presumably) resident in Germany was a factor that pointed towards Germany being the natural forum. The plaintiff observed that one of the ACP Management Board members, Mr Schlafer, had indicated his willingness to testify in a Singapore court.

The Discretion Issue concerned the exercise of the ACP Management Board and ACP Compensation Committee’s contractual discretion to confer on the defendant Good Leaver status.

</div> Instead, she is seeking a review of the contractual discretion exercised by the relevant bodies, where one of the relevant considerations would be whether they had exercised their discretion in a discriminatory fashion.

The special form of German labour law involves a myriad of rules of interpretation which would be very unfamiliar to other civil law courts and certainly, common law courts. …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">41. In the area of equal treatment and anti-discrimination, the level of complexity is more significant. Almost the entire legal framework is based on EU law and EU Directives, which must also be taken into account in the interpretation. In addition, the impact of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the EU must be taken into account. The European Convention on Human Rights will potentially also have to be taken into account. … </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 In <span class="font-italic">Ivanishvili, </span><span class="font-italic">Bidzina and others v Credit Suisse Trust Ltd</span> [2020] 2 SLR 638 at [106], the Court of Appeal observed that the governing law of the relationship between the parties is not only a relevant consideration in general, but a particularly significant consideration where it arises explicitly from choice of law clauses. In my judgment, the choice of German law expressed in cl 8.9 of the LTIP was indeed a significant connecting factor which pointed towards Germany as the appropriate forum. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(5) Existence of proceedings elsewhere</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 For completeness, at the time the matter was heard, there were no related proceedings taken out. As such, the question of <span class="font-italic">lis</span><span class="font-italic"> alibi pendens</span> was not engaged. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 Having considered the factors in the round, I therefore found that Germany was clearly more appropriate than Singapore for the hearing of the present dispute. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Second stage of the Spiliada test</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 Finally, I move on to consider the second stage of the <span class="font-italic">Spiliada</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>test. The plaintiff had not raised any personal or juridical advantage that it would lose if the Singapore proceedings were stayed. Neither has the plaintiff pointed to any reason why substantial justice would not be achieved in Germany, the <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> natural forum: see <span class="font-italic">Halsbury’s</span> at para 75.096. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">71 While I did not accept that the defendant would necessarily be prejudiced by having to defend OS 1215 in Singapore, I saw no compelling reason to refuse a stay. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">72 To summarise, the plaintiff had failed to demonstrate a good arguable case that the present dispute fell within the EJC in the Employment Contract. The Retirement Issue and the Discretion Issue centred on the parties’ differing interpretations of the LTIP in relation to the term “retirement” as well as the manner in which discretion was exercised in determining the defendant’s Leaver status. They thus wholly arose from the LTIP and not the Employment Contract. Further, having assessed the relevant connecting factors, I was of the view that the defendant had demonstrated that Germany was clearly the more appropriate forum for the dispute to be heard. I therefore allowed the appeal and granted a stay of the proceedings in OS 1215. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">73 Accordingly, I awarded the costs of the appeal to the defendant at $12,000, inclusive of disbursements. </div><table class="table table-sm table-borderless"><tbody><tr><td><div class="txt-body text-left">See Kee Oon<br/>Judge of the High Court</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-left"></div></td></tr></tbody></table><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Christopher James de Souza, Lee Junting Basil and Yan Chongshuo (Lee &amp; Lee) for the plaintiff;</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Pillai Pradeep G, Simren Kaur Sandhu and Wong Shi Rui Jonas (PRP Law LLC), for the defendant.</div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
