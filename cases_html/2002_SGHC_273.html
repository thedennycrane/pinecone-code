<p xmlns="">  Court in England, in which judgment was given in its favour; (b) the legal costs incurred

  by it in defending proceedings brought against one of its partners before the Singapore

  Public Accountancy Board, in which judgment was given in its favour; and (c) the legal

  costs incurred by it in defending proceedings brought against it by BFS in the High Court

  in England, in the event that judgment was given in its favour. D&amp;T Singapore also

  contended that all sums payable to it in respect of the indemnity referred to in (c) are

  payable out of the assets of BFS in priority to all other claims or, as an expense of the

  liquidation in priority to the claims of all creditors entitled to prove in the

  liquidation. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">Article 110 provided that every director or other officer of the

  Company shall be entitled to be indemnified out of the assets of the Company against all

  losses or liabilities, which he may sustain or incur in or about the execution of the

  duties of his office or otherwise in relation thereto. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">Three issues arose in this application: Firstly, whether Article 110

  was incorporated into the contract between BFS and D&amp;T Singapore; secondly, whether or

  not Article 110 covered the costs of successfully defending legal proceedings; and

  thirdly, whether the indemnity element in respect of D&amp;T Singapore’s costs for

  the BFS action should be treated as an Expense claim and accorded priority. </p>
<b xmlns="">
<p>Held, dismissing the motions:</p></b><font face="Arial" size="2" xmlns="">
<blockquote>
</blockquote></font><font size="3" xmlns=""><p align="justify">BFS’s Articles of Association were not part

  of the contract between BFS and D&amp;T Singapore. The established position at law is that

  the Memorandum and Articles of Association bind only the company and its members inter se

  and not third parties including auditors. Though generally the articles may be a source of

  the terms of engagement, it was not right to assume that they are incorporated into the

  engagement of every auditor (See [24] and [26]). </p>
<p align="justify">In this case, it cannot be reasonably concluded from the two letters of

  6 and 15 October 1986 that Article 110 was incorporated into the contract of engagement.

  Firstly, the letter of 6 October was a formal request to seek D&amp;T Singapore’s

  consent to be appointed as auditors. Although BFS enclosed its Memorandum and Articles of

  Association under the cover of the 6 October letter, it had to be noted that the Articles

  were sent ‘for the information’ of D&amp;T Singapore. The more important letter

  was that of 15 October, in which there was no reference to the earlier letter of 6

  October, let alone the Memorandum and Articles of Association. (See [22] and [25]).</p>
<p align="justify">Article 110 was not intended to cover the expenses incurred by D&amp;T

  Singapore in defending proceedings against it. This was because Article 110 was amended

  from its equivalent, which was Article 113 in Table A of the Fourth Schedule to the

  Companies Act, to remove the original wording in Article 113 that expressly provided for

  indemnification of the costs for successfully defending proceedings. As a result of the

  amendment, Article 110 was couched in general language which cannot cover indemnification

  of expenses incurred in defending legal proceedings. Costs incurred by D&amp;T Singapore

  in defending legal proceedings brought against it for acts which would be against its duty

  to do, were not losses or liabilities sustained by it in or about the execution of its

  duties to BFS or otherwise in relation thereto (See [30] – [37]). </p>
<p align="justify">For a debt accruing post-liquidation but under a pre-liquidation

  contract to be elevated in priority based on the "liquidation expenses"

  principle, it had to be shown that the debt was incurred for the benefit of the estate.

  The costs incurred by D&amp;T Singapore in defending the proceedings and BFS’s

  liability for the same (if any) under a pre-liquidation contractual obligation could not

  be described as expenses incurred by BFS for the benefit of the estate. It was undeniable

  that the potential liability to D&amp;T Singapore’s costs under Article 110 was a

  risk which had been imposed on the BFS liquidations by the pre-liquidation contract and

  was certainly not incurred for the benefit of the estate (See [43]). </p>
<p align="justify">D&amp;T Singapore should not be awarded indemnity costs by the English

  court in the BFS action to reflect the Article 110 contractual entitlement, as that would

  upset the priorities in the liquidation of BFS which was under the supervision of the

  Singapore courts. D&amp;T Singapore would not be entitled to "super-priority" in

  respect of the indemnity element of any costs awarded on an indemnity basis solely to

  reflect D&amp;T’s contractual entitlement under Article 110. The indemnity element of

  costs under Article 110 should accordingly not be treated as an Expense claim (See [44]). </p>

        Massive losses were incurred as a result of the

criminal and fraudulent activities of a rogue trader in Baring Futures (Singapore) Pte Ltd

("BSF"). The funds were provided by its parent, Barings PLC ("PLC") of

London, and the losses brought about the collapse of the Barings group. PLC, BSF and their

related company Bishopscourt (BS) Limited, formerly known as Barings Securities Limited

("BSL"), acting by their respective liquidators, instituted or continued with

legal proceedings to recover damages from Deloitte &amp; Touche, Singapore ("D&amp;T

Singapore") and Coopers &amp; Lybrand, Singapore ("C&amp;L Singapore") and

Cooper &amp; Lybrand, London ("C&amp;L London"). D&amp;T Singapore and C&amp;L

Singapore were successively auditors of BFS. The claims against D&amp;T Singapore and

C&amp;L Singapore are essentially for negligence in the audit of the accounts of BSF and

also in the audit of BFS’s consolidation schedules under the United Kingdom auditing

standards for group accounts. The proceedings in the High Court in London against D&amp;T

Singapore have proceeded to an advanced stage. But I was told that it was estimated to

continue into the first half of 2003. The liquidators of BSF could continue with their

litigation against D&amp;T Singapore because of the escrow funds which were set aside out

of the settlement sums paid by C&amp;L Singapore and C&amp;L London who settled with the

Barings group. The settlement will be elaborated later in this judgment. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">2

        However, the amount of legal expenses which

D&amp;T Singapore had incurred is, according to them, in the order of some 30 million

and, in the circumstances, both the liquidators of the three companies and D&amp;T

Singapore are very keen to have a determination from this court, notwithstanding what I

had stated in my judgment which was reported in <nobr>[2002] 1 SLR 370</nobr>. Both parties agreed that

I should make my determination and set out my views on the issues raised.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">3

        I have two motions before me. They are

predicated on the assumption that D&amp;T Singapore eventually succeeds before the courts

in London in defending the claims for negligence. In these applications, D&amp;T Singapore

claim, in effect, that their legal costs calculated on an indemnity basis, and not merely

on the standard basis, should as a matter of priority rank in the liquidation of all three

companies as an expense, by reason of either or both of the estate costs rule and the

liquidation expenses principle, whatever is the appropriate categorisation.</font></p>

        D&amp;T Singapore was appointed auditor of BSF

on 15 October 1986 by a resolution of the directors of BSF. As usual in the appointments

of auditors, the firm was re-appointed to the office of auditor for each successive year

until 1994. In and from that year, C&amp;L Singapore was appointed the auditor and was an

officer of BSF from that date until about July 1994. </font></p>

        The various actions against C&amp;L Singapore

and C&amp;L London (collectively referred to as "C&amp;L") were settled in

October 2001. C&amp;L paid 65 million in settlement of the claims brought against it by

BSF, PLC and BSL. BSF’s share was 28 million. After that settlement BSF had 38.2

million, out of which it contributed 35.75 million towards the settlement of the

creditors’ claims against the Barings group. BFS retained the balance to fund

liquidation costs. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">10

        Under an Escrow Agreement reached, the sum of

32.5 million was set aside to fund the continuation of the actions against D&amp;T

Singapore. Of this amount, the sum of 24 million constituted the "Costs Escrow

Account", intended to meet any costs in favour of D&amp;T Singapore and the sum of

8.5 million funded the "Litigation Escrow Account" which was intended to meet

the costs of the BFS, PLC and BSL liquidators as to 6 million for BFS and as to 2.5

million for PLC and BSL combined. The Litigation Escrow Account is to be used for

specified purposes which included the BFS, PLC and BSL liquidators’ costs of

continuing the action against D&amp;T Singapore in London. The Costs Escrow Account was

put in place because BFS accepts that, as a matter of general principle, any adverse cost

orders made against BFS would be a liquidation expense ranking above all other liquidation

expenses save for those incurred in getting in, maintaining and realising the assets of

the company.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">11

        The action against D&amp;T Singapore brought by

PLC and BSL was struck out by order of Evans-Lombe J in December 2001. The appeal to the

Court of Appeal is, I am told, stayed.</font></p>
<b xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">D&amp;T Singapore two motions</font></p></b>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">12

        By a Motion in this Winding-Up petition D&amp;T

Singapore asked that the decision of the liquidators of BFS made on 5 December 2001, in

rejecting the Proof of Debt dated 22 November 2001 in the liquidation be reversed and that

it be ordered that the Proof of Debt be admitted in full. The first Proof of Debt included

(a) its indemnity costs of the PLC action amounting to 3,286,901.35, which was a

contingent claim; (b) its indemnity costs of the PAB proceedings amounting to 850,000

which was an actual claim for costs already incurred; (c) BFS’s contribution

liability in the third party action brought by D&amp;T Singapore against BFS in the PLC

action said to amount to a maximum of approximately 1.77 billion<b>, </b>a contingent

claim; and (d) its costs of the BFS action amounting to a maximum of approximately

25,935,733.06 which was in part actual but mostly contingent. With regard to claims (a)

and (b) D&amp;T Singapore have accepted that these would be ‘proof’ claims

ranking together with all other unsecured creditors of BFS and in respect of which a

dividend would be payable on a pari passu basis. As regards claim (c) it was rejected by

the liquidators of BFS on the ground, amongst others, that it related to a tortious

unliquidated claim which is not proveable in liquidation.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">13

        D&amp;T Singapore also asked that another

decision of the liquidators of BFS in rejecting the Proof of Debt dated 7 December 2001 be

reversed and that the said Proof of Debt be ordered to be admitted in full. In support of

its application, D&amp;T Singapore referred to the fact that it had incurred liabilities

in respect of legal costs in defending proceedings brought by PLC and BSL in the High

Court of England, Chancery Division and by the Singapore Public Accountancy Board

("the PAB proceedings"), in which judgment had been given in favour of D&amp;T

Singapore in both sets of proceedings. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">14

        D&amp;T Singapore further pointed out that it

had incurred and continued to incur liabilities in respect of legal costs in defending

proceedings brought by BFS in the High Court of England, Chancery Division. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">15

        D&amp;T Singapore contended that as

‘officer’ of BFS it was entitled to be indemnified out of the assets of the

company pursuant to Article 110 of BFS’s Articles of Association ("Article

110") in respect of any losses or liabilities that D&amp;T Singapore may sustain or

incur in or about the execution of the duties of its office or otherwise in relation

thereto. It was further contended that the indemnity provided by Article 110 extended to

costs incurred by it in defending proceedings in which judgment is given in its favour

arising out of the execution of its office as auditor.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">16

        The primary case of D&amp;T Singapore is that

it is entitled to an indemnity in respect of the costs incurred by it in the legal

proceedings in London instituted by BFS and that such indemnity ranks for payment in full

as an expense of the liquidation of BFS. In the alternative, D&amp;T Singapore’s

entitlement to an indemnity in respect of the costs of that action is a provable debt and

that the liquidators of BFS were wrong to have rejected its Proof of Debt dated 7 December

2001.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">17

        By the other Motion filed at the same time,

D&amp;T Singapore asked for a declaration that it is entitled, pursuant to Article 110 to

an indemnity out of the assets of BFS in respect of:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">(a) the legal and other costs

    incurred by it in defending proceedings brought against it by PLC and BSL in the High

<blockquote xmlns="">

<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">(b) the legal and other costs

<blockquote xmlns="">

<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">(c) the legal and other costs

</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">18

        Further, D&amp;T Singapore also sought a ruling

as to the priority of its claims to the indemnity in the liquidation. The same grounds

were relied upon. It sought a declaration that all sums payable to it in respect of the

indemnity referred to in paragraph 15(c) above are payable out of the assets of BFS in

priority to all other claims, including that of the liquidator for his own legal costs and

remuneration, alternatively as an expense of the liquidation in priority to the claims of

all creditors entitled to prove in the liquidation: (a) in the event that costs are

awarded against BFS by the trial judge in the High Court in London on the indemnity basis

(whether in order to reflect D&amp;T Singapore’s contractual entitlement under

Article 110 or otherwise); and/or (b) in the event that costs are awarded against BFS by

the trial judge in that action on the standard basis, such that D&amp;T Singapore’s

entitlement to an indemnity arises solely under Article 110.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">19

        Article 110 provides as follows:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">"Every Director or other

    the Act), which he may sustain or incur in or about the execution of the duties of his

    office or otherwise in relation thereto, and no such Director or other officer shall be

    liable for any loss, damage or misfortune which may happen to be incurred by the Company

    in the execution of the duties of his office or in relation thereto. But this Article

    shall only have effect in so far as its provisions are not avoided by the Act."</font></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<b xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Incorporation</font></p></b>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">20

        The first issue is whether Article 110 was

incorporated into the contract between BFS and D&amp;T Singapore. The first point to note

is that on the terms of their letter of engagement dated 15 October 1986, as quoted above,

the letter set out "the terms of our engagement which will continue to apply until

varied by a subsequent letter". In <i>Re City Equitable Fire Insurance Company</i>

[1925] Ch 407, there were no written terms of engagement between the auditors and the

company but the auditors were found to have contracted on the footing of the articles. It

was there recognised, and it is common ground in this case, that the articles constitute a

contract between the company and its members but not as between the company and its

auditors. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">21

       D&amp;T Singapore, however, made the following points

in relation to the letter of 15 October 1986. First, it pointed out that the letter is a

post-appointment document and is a confirmation of the terms of an appointment already

accepted. Secondly, it was submitted on its behalf that the letter did not purport to be a

comprehensive record of the terms of contract between BFS and D&amp;T Singapore. As the

range of services of an auditor was very wide, the fact that D&amp;T Singapore specified

its services is no reason to infer an intention to detract from "terms otherwise

incorporated generally into the contract". Lastly, D&amp;T Singapore also pointed out

that the letter was not a comprehensive record of the terms of contract between BFS and

D&amp;T Singapore, given in particular the absence of any reference to regulatory audit

functions required of D&amp;T Singapore. In response, BFS submitted that the first point

raised irrelevant matters which did not disprove the fact that the accepted terms of the

contract of appointment as expressly confirmed did not incorporate the Articles of BFS.

The second point was, according to BFS, based on a flawed premise that there are other

terms (namely, the Articles) generally incorporated into the contract. In relation to the

last point, BFS contended that the absence of any reference to the regulatory audit

functions of D&amp;T Singapore was a neutral matter and did not advance the contentions of

D&amp;T Singapore in any way. Those functions, as a matter of contract, would be implied

on the basis of necessity and making the contract of engagement work. That implication of

the term as to audit functions is quite different from implying the contract under which

BFS would indemnify D&amp;T Singapore. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">22

        D&amp;T Singapore further stressed the fact

that BFS enclosed its Memorandum &amp; Articles of Association under cover of their letter

of 6 October 1986. On that fact, it submitted that the Articles were incorporated into the

contract of appointment and relied on the case of <i>John v Price Waterhouse</i> [2001] All ER (D) 145 (Jul) where at paragraph 26 of the judgment Ferries J considered that

"comparatively little will be required to satisfy the court that in particular cases,

the indemnity provided for by regulations 136 and 118 is incorporated in the contract

which is made when the company appoints a director or an auditor." In the context of

this case, it has to be noted that the Memorandum and Articles of Association were sent <b>‘<i>for

the information’</i></b> of D&amp;T Singapore. The short letter stated the wish of

BFS to appoint it as its auditors and the letter was a formal request to seek its consent.

The letter went on to "enclose each of the following documents <i><b>for your

information</b></i>:- 1. Certificate of Incorporation (Form 9); 2. Memorandum and Articles

of Association; 3. Form 49 showing the particulars of the directors" (emphasis

added).</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">23

        D&amp;T Singapore further called in aid of

their submission that Article 110 was incorporated into the contract by pointing out that

the appointment to of a person to the office of auditor is an appointment to an office

‘the attributes of which are (without more) defined in and subject to the applicable

companies legislation and any applicable terms of the Memorandum and Articles of

Association of the company’. It further noted that ‘the appointment of an

auditor necessarily carried with it certain attributes (including obligations and rights)

that are to be found other than the specific terms of appointment.’</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">24

        But must the attributes of the office be

defined by and subject to the applicable terms of the Memorandum and Articles of

Association? The general assertions of D&amp;T Singapore as set out in the preceding

paragraph may not be consistent with the established position at law that the Memorandum

and Articles of Association bind only the company and its members inter se and <i><b>not</b></i>

third parties including auditors. Admittedly, it is possible that a director or auditor

may be employed by a company on the terms of its articles. In that case the articles will

form part of the contract between the director or auditor and the company. This was the

position in <i>Re City Equitable Fire Insurance Company</i> [1925] Ch 407, where there was

no written terms of engagement between the auditors and the company but the auditors were

found to have contracted <i><b>on the footing </b></i>of the articles. Warrington LJ at

p527 pointed out that where "auditors are engaged without any special terms of

engagement…then if the articles contain provisions relating to the performance by

them of their duties and to the obligations imposed upon them by the acceptance of the

office, I think it is quite plain that the articles must be taken to express the terms

upon which the auditors accept their position. <i>Of course, if the terms of their

employment are expressed in a separate document, then that document must be taken to

define the conditions of their engagement, and it would not be proper to assume any

implied terms either from the provisions of the articles or elsewhere."</i></font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">25

        Both D&amp;T Singapore and BFS agreed before me

that all the evidence they had about the circumstances of the appointment of D&amp;T

Singapore are reflected in the two letters. On the basis of the two letters can one

reasonably conclude that Article 110 was incorporated into the contract of engagement? In

my view, the first letter was a ‘formal’ letter. The more important letter is

the letter of 15 October 1986 quoted above. It should be noted that there is no reference

to the earlier letter of 6<sup>th</sup> October, let alone the Memorandum &amp; Articles

of Association. Secondly, this letter was signed by Mr Po’ad Mattar who was the

managing partner and not by Mr Owen Lee to whom the first formal letter was addressed by

the solicitors of BFS.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">26

        I am persuaded by the submissions advanced on

behalf of BFS and conclude that the articles were not part of the contract between it and

D&amp;T Singapore. The articles of a company constitute a contract between the members of

the company inter se and between each of them and the company but, in the words of Ferries

J in para 26 in the case of <i>John &amp; Others v Price Waterhouse and another (supra)</i>,

"do not, without more, constitute a contract between the company and its directors or

auditors." Though generally the articles may be a source of the terms of engagement,

it is not right to assume that they are incorporated into the engagement of every auditor.

There was not, in this case, sufficient material to conclude that BFS had agreed to confer

on D&amp;T Singapore the indemnity in terms of Article 110. The letter of 6 October 1986

signed by Mr Mattar was, in my view, not capable and did not incorporate the indemnity

into the contract. </font></p>
<b xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Scope of Article 110</font></p></b>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">27

        I now turn to the second issue, namely whether

Article 110 does not cover costs of successfully defending proceedings. BFS contended that

D&amp;T Singapore is not entitled to an indemnity in respect of its costs of the legal

proceedings which its auditors had taken against it or the PAB proceedings. The reasons

are these. First, and forcefully, BFS asserted that such costs are not losses or

liabilities sustained or incurred by D&amp;T Singapore in or about the execution of its

duties to the company or otherwise in relation thereto. In addition or alternatively, it

is argued on behalf of BFS that it was never intended by the parties that Article 110

would provide an indemnity for such costs. BFS expanded on these two cumulative or

alternative bases in support of their proposition.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">28

        BFS relied on <i><b>Rowland &amp; Ors v Gulpac

Limited</b></i> [1999] Lloyd’s Rep. Bank 86 (decided in 1995 but reported only in

1999). The Commercial Court in London considered, in the context of a Mareva injunction,

an indemnity action brought by directors including Rowland against <i><b>Gulfpac</b></i>

based on an article in <i><b>Gulpac’s</b></i> articles in the following terms:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">"Subject to the provisions

    of the Act (viz the Companies Act 1985 of UK) <i><b>every director, or other officer or

    auditor </b></i>of the company, or person acting as an alternate director <i><b>shall be

    entitled to be indemnified out of the assets of the Company against all </b></i>costs,

    charges, expenses, <i><b>losses or liabilities which he may sustain or incur in or about

    the execution of his duties to the Company or otherwise in relation thereto." </b></i>(Emphasis

    added to show the similarity to BFS’s Article 110).</font></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">29

        Rix J (as he then was) considered that Rowland

and the other directors could not establish a good arguable case for an indemnity from <i><b>Gulfpac</b></i>

under Article 31 against any liability which they might incur as a result of proceedings

being taken against them by <i><b>Gulfpac’s</b></i> parent company, Gulf USA

("the Idaho proceedings") concerning (as the Judge found) "not…their

role as directors of <i><b>Gulfpac</b></i>, but only...their role as directors or offices

of Gulf USA". He then addressed the question whether the directors were entitled to

an indemnity as regards costs in the Idaho proceedings. After concluding that there was no

indemnity for the liability complained of, he observed that it should follow that there

would be no indemnity for costs, noting that the case of costs was "a fortiori".

Rix J continued at p 93 lhc:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">"If the costs which are to

    be considered are costs ordered against the directors, then that might be viewed as a

    liability ancillary to the principal liability. In such a case costs and liability plainly

    go together. But <i><b>costs incurred as an expense</b></i>, as occurs in the United

    States, where it is common there are no adversarial orders for costs, or in England as

    part of the directors’ own English proceedings, <i><b>are costs incurred in defending

    or prosecuting actions and are not, </b></i>it seems to me,<i><b> costs incurred or

    sustained in or about the execution of a director’s duties </b></i>to <i><b>Gulfpac</b></i>
<i><b>or otherwise in relation thereto.</b></i>" (emphasis added)</font></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">30

        In paras 69 to 71 of its submissions D&amp;T

Singapore sought to distinguish the case by arguing that the above dicta was made by Rix J

in the context of the actions against <i><b>Gulfpac’s</b></i> directors being in

connection with those directors’ duties to <i><b>Gulfpac’s</b></i> parent

company and did not have anything to do with the execution of those directors’ duties

to <i><b>Gulfpac</b></i> itself. I agree with BFS that that was not a correct reading of

the case. Clearly, Rix J was speaking in general of costs and held that costs incurred as

an expense were costs incurred in defending or prosecuting actions and were not costs

incurred or sustained in or about the execution of duties of the officer or otherwise in

relation thereto.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">31

        Rix J stated that his view was fortified by two

other considerations: see last paragraph on p 93 lhc and following. In referring to the

first consideration, he said:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">"The first arises out of the

    terms of Section 310(3)(b) of the Companies Act 1985. Section 310(1) and (2) provides that

    any provision contained in a company’s articles or in any contract with the company

    indemnifying an officer of the company from any liability in respect of any negligence,

    default, breach of duty or breach of trust, is to be void. However, section 310(3) then

    provides as follows:</font></p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">‘This section does not

      prevent a company…</font></p>

<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">(i) in defending any proceedings,

      whether civil or criminal, in which judgment is given in his favour or he is

      acquitted…’</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">It seems to me that that <i><b>subsection

    emphasises both by its function and by its language a liability for costs incurred in the

    successful defence of any proceedings is something different from a liability for costs

    sustained or incurred in the execution of the directors’ duties to a company or,

    indeed, in relation thereto."</b></i> (emphasis added).</font></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">32

        It should be noted that the UK Section 310

referred to above is equivalent to Section 172 of the Singapore Companies Act which

provides as follow:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">"172 (1) Any provision,

    whether in the articles or in any contract with a company or otherwise, for exempting any

    or breach of trust of which he may be guilty in relation to the company, shall be void.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">(2) Notwithstanding anything in

    this section, a company may pursuant to its articles or otherwise indemnify any officer or

    connection with any application in relation thereto in which relief is under this Act

    granted to him by the Court."</font></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">33

        To distinguish <i><b>Gulfpac</b></i>, D&amp;T

Singapore submitted that it is not applicable because the wording of Article 110 is

materially different from that in <i><b>Gulfpac</b></i> and that Rix J’s comments

were unnecessary for deciding the case before him where the facts were different. BFS, of

course, asserted that <i><b>Gulfpac </b></i>is directly applicable to the present case and

is very persuasive authority. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">34

        In relation to the second consideration, Rix J

continued as follows:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">"The second matter which

    seems to me to fortify the conclusion to which I have arrived concerning "good

    arguable case" arises from the authority of <i><b>Tomlinson v Adamson</b></i> (1935)

    prosecution for fraud does not easily come within a different version of an article 31

    type indemnity. </b></i>Whether or not the analysis in that authority is close, and

    granted that the wording of the provision there is probably narrower than article 31, the

    case does illustrate the <i><b>difficulty of providing by general language for the

    indemnifying of a successful defendant.</b></i>" (emphasis added).</font></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">35

        I agree with BFS that D&amp;T Singapore faced

the same difficulty. Article 110 was amended from its equivalent in Table A of the

Companies Act, to <i><b>remove</b></i> the original wording in the article in Table A that

<i><b>expressly </b></i>provided for indemnification of costs for successfully defending

proceedings. Article 113 in Table A in the Fourth Schedule of the Companies Act under the

heading "Indemnity" reads as follows: Every Director...auditor…shall be

indemnified out of the assets of the company <i><b>against any liability incurred by him

in defending any proceedings, whether civil or criminal, in which judgment is given in his

favour or in which he is acquitted</b></i> or in connection with any application under the

Act in which relief is granted to him by the Court in respect of any negligence, default,

breach of duty or breach of trust." (emphasis added). It should be noted that Table A

was expressly excluded from BFS’s Articles of Association. Further, the statutory

words expressly providing for an indemnity against "liability incurred in defending

any legal proceedings in which judgment is given in his favour or in which he is

acquitted" were also excluded. There was accordingly no intention behind Article 110

to cover such expenses.<i><b> </b></i>At this stage, I should also note that Article 110

as a result of the amendments is couched in general language that cannot accommodate the

meaning which D&amp;T Singapore sought to ascribe to it.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">36

        In <i><b>Tomlinson v Adamson </b></i>(supra)

the article in question was in the following terms:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">"Every Director…of the

    Company shall be indemnified by the Company against … all costs, losses, and expenses

    which any such Director … may incur or become liable to by reason of any contract

    entered into, or act or deed done by him as such Director…in any way, in the

    discharge of his duties, including travelling expenses."</font></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">37

        In that case, the claimant director relied on

the article and lodged with the liquidator a claim for his expenses in defending himself

in criminal proceedings wherein he had been charged with issuing a fraudulent prospectus

and fraudulently misapplying the company funds. He was acquitted of these charges. The

liquidators rejected his claims. The director appealed to the court and maintained that he

was entitled to be indemnified against the expenses (1) in virtue of the indemnity clause

in the company articles, and (2) in any event at common law, as the expenses were incurred

in consequence of acts done by him as agent of the company. The House of Lords, affirming

the First Division, held that he was not entitled to his expenses. Lord Tomlin in the

House of Lords stated in his judgment on p 6 as follows:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">"Here the allegation against

    the agent was that he had done something which he did not in fact do, and which would have

    been against his duty to do, are expenses incurred by him by reason of any act done by him

    as a director in the discharge of his duty. <i><b>Upon the true construction of the

    article I am unable to see how that can possibly be maintained. In my view the expenses

    incurred by reason of the allegations made against (the director), being allegations of

    matters which would have been a breach of his duty and which were held to be disproved or

    non-proven, are not expenses incurred by him by reason of any act done by him as a

    director in the discharge of his duties.</b></i></font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">If the cases does not

    fall, as I think it does not fall, within the language of article 160 of the articles of

    association, it is difficult to see upon what principle it can possibly be brought within

    the common law rule. My conclusion is that this appeal fails, and I recommend to your

    Lordships that it be dismissed with costs". (emphasis added)</font></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">38

        D&amp;T Singapore asserted in para 60 of its

submissions that there is a direct causal link between the execution of its duties as

auditor and the costs incurred by it in defending proceedings based on an alleged breach

of those duties, so that such costs constitute a liability (if outstanding) or loss (if

paid) incurred or sustained "in the execution" of D&amp;T Singapore’s dues

as much as any expenses incurred by it in doing so. Even if this argument is wrong,

D&amp;T Singapore went on to say that such costs would have been undoubtedly incurred

"otherwise in relation thereto" to the execution of its duties as auditor.

D&amp;T Singapore relied on the underlying proposition that if D&amp;T Singapore was found

to have breached its duties to BFS then there would be liability within the opening

sentence of Article 110. In response, BFS pointed out with considerable force that it is

quite clear from <i><b>Tomlinson </b></i>that any liability of D&amp;T Singapore would <i><b>not

</b></i>fall within the opening sentence of Article 110 because the relevant acts of

D&amp;T Singapore would not be within D&amp;T Singapore’s duty to do and therefore

would not be acts done by D&amp;T Singapore in discharge of its duty. Accordingly, any

liability arising therefrom would not have been "incurred or sustained in the

execution of D&amp;T Singapore’s duties or otherwise in relation thereto". </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">39

        I now turn to D&amp;T Singapore’s reliance

on the words in parentheses in Article 110 to distinguish the <i><b>Gulfpac </b></i>case.

I am of the view that there is no difference in the distinction drawn. The words in

parentheses are all qualified by the requirement that the liabilities of the officer be

‘<i><b>sustained or incurred in or about the execution of the duties of his office or

otherwise in relation thereof.’</b></i> </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">40

        Lastly, D&amp;T Singapore sought to invoke the

spirit of Article 110. It relies on <i><b>Re Famatina </b></i>[1914] 2 Ch 271 for the

proposition that at common law there is no doubt that costs incurred by an agent in

successfully resisting claims brought against it as a consequence of executing its duties

are covered by the indemnity available to an agent under the general duty owed by a

principal to its agent at law. D&amp;T Singapore pointed out that the indemnity expressly

permitted in Section 172(2) of the Companies Act is an aspect of this general duty. I do

not think there is substance in this approach. It has been rightly pointed out that <i><b>Re

Famatina </b></i>did not involve the agent having incurred the costs of successfully

resisting proceedings brought by the principal itself. Secondly, House of Lords accepted

the distinction between <b><i>Re Famatina</i> </b>and <b><i>Tomlinson</i> </b>on the facts

and I also agree with BFS that the facts in <b><i>Tomlinson</i> </b>are analogous to the

present case to the extent that both cases involve the officer/agent having to defend

proceedings brought against them for acts which would be against their duty to do. The

director in <i><b>Tomlinson </b></i>had to defend himself against charges of fraud and

D&amp;T Singapore is defending against allegations of negligence.</font></p>

<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Priority</font></p></b>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">41

        Finally, I address the question whether the

indemnity element in respect of D&amp;T Singapore’s costs for the BFS action should

or should not be treated as an Expense claim and accorded priority. D&amp;T Singapore

pointed out that BFS’s liability to D&amp;T Singapore in respect of the costs of the

BFS action will have been incurred by reason of the actions of the liquidators taken

solely for the purpose of the winding up. It suggested that the simplest way to test this

is to compare the situation at the commencement of the liquidation with the situation

current in September this year. At the date of BFS’s liquidation, whilst the

indemnity provided by Article 110 existed, absolutely nothing was owing under it. As at

September 2002, I was told, some 30 million is owned under it.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">42

        D&amp;T Singapore argued that the indemnity

under Article 110 survived the winding up of BFS on the basis of the estate costs rule or

as the liquidation cost. There is, I am told, no Commonwealth authority where in an

unsuccessful legal proceedings an order for indemnity costs were ordered against the

liquidator. In my view I think that such an order would be wrong in principle; it would be

an unwarranted departure from the pari passu rule. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">43

        If D&amp;T Singapore were to succeed on this

third and final issue, it would be on the basis of the estate costs rule or not at all.

The liquidation expense rule, historically, was always meant to cover the usage of

property by a liquidator. It has never been applied to costs. In this connection D&amp;T

Singapore relied <i><b>re Atlantic Computer Systems PLC </b></i>[1992] Ch. 505. BFS relies

on <i><b>Kahn &amp; Anor v Commissioners of Inland Revenue </b></i><nobr>[2002] UKHL 6</nobr>, which

disapproved of <b>Re Atlantic Computer Systems Inc. </b>It is clear from what was

traversed in <i><b>Kahn &amp; Anor</b></i> that for a debt accruing post-liquidation but

under a pre-liquidation contract to be elevated in priority based on the "liquidation

expenses" principle, it has to be shown that the debt was incurred for the benefit of

the estate. Accordingly, costs payable to BFS’s solicitors and experts incurred as a

result of BFS choosing to bring proceedings against D&amp;T Singapore could be said to

have been incurred for the benefit of the estate of BFS. But the costs incurred by D&amp;T

Singapore in defending those proceedings is another matter altogether. I agree with BFS

that it is not permissible to describe those costs of D&amp;T Singapore, and BFS’s

liability for the same (if any) under a pre-liquidation contractual obligation, as

expenses incurred by BFS for the benefit of the estate. It is undeniable that potential

liability to D&amp;T Singapore’s costs under Article 110 should BFS lose its action

against D&amp;T Singapore is a risk which has been imposed on the BFS liquidators by the

pre-liquidation contract and is certainly not incurred for the benefit of the estate. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">44

        I am persuaded to the view that D&amp;T

Singapore should not be awarded indemnity costs by the English Court in the BFS action to

reflect the Article 110 contractual entitlement as that would upset the priorities in the

liquidation of BFS which is under the supervision of the Singapore Courts. I have also

concluded that D&amp;T Singapore would not be entitled to "super-priority" in

respect of the indemnity element of any costs awarded on an indemnity basis solely to

reflect D&amp;T’s contractual entitlement under Article 110. I need hardly say that

if the claims in the BFS action had been or would be misconducted (of which there is no

evidence whatsoever) that would be entirely for the discretion of the trial Judge in

London to consider awarding costs on an indemnity basis. But that is an entirely different

matter, of which there is not a whiff of a suggestion that it would be in prospect.

Accordingly, the indemnity element of costs under Article 110 should not be treated as an

Expense claim. </font></p>
