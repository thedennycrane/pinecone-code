        Lai Siu Chiu J:</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       This was a claim by William Cheng (“the
                    plaintiff”) in his capacity as the sole remaining administrator (as well
                    as a beneficiary) of the estate of Louise Cheng (“the estate”) his
                    late mother, against DBS Bank Ltd (“the defendant”). The plaintiff
                    claimed compensation arising from allegedly unauthorised transfers of moneys out
                    of the estate’s bank account maintained with the defendant. The plaintiff
                    had a co-administrator in his brother Robert Cheng (“Robert”)
                    until 11 May 2006, when Robert was adjudged a bankrupt. Robert met an
                    untimely death on or about 4 April 2009 after he was involved in a road
                    accident in Malaysia.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The facts</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       Louise Cheng (“the deceased”)
                    passed away on 1 September 1984. On or about 10 May 1986, in their
                    capacities as joint administrators of the estate, the plaintiff and Robert
                    opened an account with the defendant for the estate under account number
                    001-XXXXXX-X (“the account”). Both administrators were signatories
                    to the account and the mandate to the defendant was that both signatures were
                    required to operate the account. However, because the plaintiff was then working
                    in Taiwan, it was agreed between the siblings that Robert would be responsible
                    for managing the estate and monitoring the account.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       According to the instructions received by the
                    defendant when the account was opened, the bank statements for the account were
                    to be sent to No 17 Jalan Senandong (“the property”) which
                    was then Robert’s residence. The property was also the main asset of the
                    estate.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       Although the deceased died intestate, the two
                    administrators as well as their four sisters were aware of her wishes, which she
                    had written out in Mandarin in a document dated 28 August 1984.
                    Essentially, it was the intention of the deceased that the estate was to be
                    divided into three shares with one share each going to the plaintiff and Robert
                    while the remaining share was to be used for the funeral expenses of the
                    deceased and the cost and upkeep of her gravesite.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       In or about October 2001, the property was sold
                    for $4.3m and the net sale proceeds less expenses amounting to $3,874,681.77
                    (“the sale proceeds”) were deposited into the account. After the
                    sale was completed, Robert moved to Block 12,Toh Yi Drive #02-389, Singapore
                    590012 (“Robert’s house”). On or about 9 October 2001,
                    Robert instructed the defendant to change the mailing address of the account
                    from the property to Robert’s house. The defendant complied with his
                    instructions.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       On 22 October 2001, DBS cheque no. 243341
                    for $1m was drawn in favour of the plaintiff as part of the plaintiff’s
                    one-third entitlement (equivalent to $1.3m) to the sale proceeds of the
                    property. On 23 October 2001, DBS cheque no. 243343 dated 22 October
                    2001 for $1m was drawn in favour of Madam Long Lee Choo (“Robert’s
                    wife”) representing part of Robert’s one-third share of the sale
                    proceeds. Robert made a gift of the sum to his wife.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       In December 2001, Robert and the plaintiff
                    discussed the balance $1.3m of the sale proceeds. It far exceeded what was
                    required to maintain their parents’ temporary gravesite in Taipei. Robert
                    decided to and did consult a lawyer. He was verbally advised by a solicitor
                    (OSH) that neither he nor the plaintiff were legally bound to hold the sum of
                    $1.3m to maintain their parents’ temporary gravesite. OSH subsequently
                    rendered a written opinion to both brothers on 12 March 2002 (at
                    1AB561-564) to confirm his views. Robert duly conveyed OSH’s oral advice
                    to the plaintiff and after discussion, the plaintiff and Robert agreed that $1m
                    from the balance one-third share would be shared equally between them leaving
                    $300,000 for maintenance of their parents’ gravesite.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       On 6 January 2002, the plaintiff and his
                    wife visited Robert’s house. Robert suggested to the plaintiff that $1m
                    from the one-third share for the gravesite maintenance be placed in a fixed
                    deposit account in Malaysia as the sum was lying idle in the account. Moreover,
                    the interest earned on Malaysian Ringgit (“MR”) deposits would be
                    higher than the interest rates offered by Singapore banks for fixed deposits.
                    The plaintiff agreed to Robert’s suggestion. The plaintiff signed DBS
                    cheque no. 243346 for $1m (“the first cheque”) in favour of the
                    estate. A separate DBS cheque no. 243347 for $50,000 (“the second
                    cheque”) was issued in favour of the plaintiff who claimed (according to
                    Robert’s affidavit of evidence-in-chief [“AEIC”]), to have
                    incurred expenses for the maintenance of their parents’ temporary
                    gravesite in Taiwan.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       Robert had previously been informed by a
                    Malaysian bank officer that there could be certain issues with regard to using a
                    cheque to transfer a large sum of money from a Singapore bank account to an
                    account in Malaysia. After discussing these issues, the plaintiff signed DBS
                    cheque no. 243348 (“the third cheque”) in blank as a contingency
                    method of payment to effect the transfer of monies from the account to a MR
                    account in Malaysia should Robert encounter problems in the transfer. The date,
                    payee, amount and Robert’s signature were missing from the third cheque.
                    The plaintiff returned to Taiwan on the following day.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     The conversion of $1m into MR was to be
                    arranged by Robert’s daughter (Vivienne) who worked as a finance director
                    for a Malaysian public listed company.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     On 8 January 2002, Robert forwarded to
                    the plaintiff a fax that Robert had received from Vivienne on the then
                    prevailing exchange rate between the MR and the Singapore dollar applicable to
                    $1m. Subsequently, Robert forwarded to the plaintiff another fax he had received
                    from Vivienne on 14 January 2002 wherein Vivienne advised that a person
                    called Robert Yong (“Yong”) wanted US$542,000 (equivalent to
                    S$995,112) in exchange for MR2,059,600. Yong wanted a draft in the sum of
                    US$542,000 to be handed to his Singapore private banker Jessie Heng in exchange
                    for MR2,059,600. Robert deposed in his AEIC that he had discussed Yong’s
                    offer with the plaintiff who agreed to accept the same and that Robert should
                    carry out the transaction.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     Accordingly, Robert visited the Bukit Timah
                    Plaza branch of the defendant (“the branch”) on the morning of
                    21 January 2002 to purchase a draft for US$542,000. Robert was handed a
                    demand draft application form (“the application form”) which he
                    completed, signed and presented to the branch’s staff for processing. He
                    was told the application form was not acceptable as the same only had one
                    signature whereas the mandate also required the plaintiff’s signature. In
                    response, Robert showed to the staff the third cheque and said he would be using
                    the same to pay for the draft. He filled in the blanks in the third cheque,
                    signed it and handed the same to the staff. Shortly thereafter, Robert received
                    the draft for US$542,000 (“the first draft”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     Robert proceeded to Jessie Heng’s office
                    and handed her the first draft. However, Jessie Heng informed him that the first
                    draft was not in order as the beneficiary should be Yong and not herself. Robert
                    informed her he would rectify the mistake.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     Robert rushed back to the branch. He explained
                    to a staff of the branch that the beneficiary should be Yong and not Jessie
                    Heng. A member of the staff then crossed out Jessie Heng’s name in the
                    application form and inserted Yong’s name. Robert was then asked to
                    initial and verify the amendment which he did. Robert then received a new draft
                    no. 00160D2004017 (“the second draft”) in Yong’s name for
                    US$542,000. He returned to Jessie Heng’s office and handed the second
                    draft to her.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     On the same day, the estate received
                    RM2,059,600 into its Malaysian account maintained with Hong Leong Bank Berhad
                    (“the HL account”) which sum was placed in fixed deposit
                    (“the fixed deposit”). It subsequently transpired that the third
                    cheque was not used to purchase the first or second drafts. Instead, the
                    defendant debited the account with the sum of $995,112 together with
                    administrative charges of $100 and $10.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     In his AEIC, Robert said he subsequently
                    received the balance of $300,000 of his $1.3m share of the sale proceeds by a
                    DBS cheque no. 300052 dated 15 April 2002 (“the fourth
                    cheque”). Robert deposed the fourth cheque was jointly signed by him and
                    the plaintiff and issued in favour of Robert’s wife. Although the
                    plaintiff also sued the defendant in relation to the fourth cheque, the
                    plaintiff did not refer to the fourth cheque at all either in his AEIC or in his
                    supplemental AEIC. The first mention by the plaintiff of the fourth cheque
                    (admitted by him in court) was in his statement of claim (<em>infra</em><a href="#p1_30">[30]</a>). I will return to this observation
                    when I look at the evidence adduced from the plaintiff in cross-examination (at
                    N/E 106-107).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     On 6 May 2002, the plaintiff sent a fax
                    to Robert containing the following message:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The amount from the Estate that was paid in Ringgit deposit was for 3
                        months only. Please give me an update and have the amount returned to the
                        Estate account right away.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">In his AEIC (at para 21), the plaintiff explained that he
                    scribbled the above note out of extreme anger with Robert because Robert had
                    sent him a fax about title to their parents’ gravesite, amongst other
                    things.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     After his return to Singapore for good in June
                    2002, the plaintiff started familiarising himself with the estate’s
                    matters as well with the estate of his sister Daisy. The plaintiff alleged that
                    Robert was not cooperative in this respect as which result he wrote to the
                    defendant on 3 March 2003 with a request that monthly statements of the
                    account be sent to his address (No. 25 Kew Drive).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     On 13 May 2003, the plaintiff received
                    the March 2003 statements from the defendant. He wrote to the defendant on
                    15 May 2003 to request for future statements of the account to be sent to
                    him.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     On 22 May 2003, the plaintiff received
                    the defendant’s letter informing him that his request for a change of
                    mailing address in <a href="#p1_18">[18]</a> could not be
                    processed because Robert’s signature was required.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     The plaintiff replied to the defendant on
                    27 May 2003 to inquire when the change of address from the property to
                    Robert’s house was effected and whether his signature was obtained as
                    required by the defendant. The defendant replied on 9 June 2003 to say the
                    plaintiff’s inquiry would be forwarded to the defendant’s department
                    in charge of address updating. The plaintiff claimed that in a subsequent
                    telephone conversation with one Julie Chow of the defendant on 24 March
                    2004, he was told the change of address from the property to Robert’s
                    house had been an “oversight”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     The plaintiff heard nothing further from the
                    defendant regarding his inquiry in <a href="#p1_21">[21]</a>
                    until his receipt of the defendant’s solicitors’ letter dated
                    22 April 2008 enclosing a copy of the defendant’s request form for
                    change of address signed by Robert only.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     In March 2004, the plaintiff finally received
                    from the defendant statements of the account for the period July 2001 to
                    February 2004. He perused the statements and was puzzled by the debit entry of
                    $995,112 on 21 January 2002 in the statement for January
                2002.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     On 16 March 2005, the plaintiff wrote to
                    the defendant requesting a copy of the outward draft advice in respect of the
                    debit entry of $995,112 on 21 January 2002. The plaintiff received a copy
                    of the advice on 26 May 2005. After making further inquiries of and
                    receiving additional documents from the defendant, the plaintiff uncovered the
                    following facts:</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(a)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">a sum of $995,112 was remitted out of the account
                            on 21 January 2002 based on the third cheque dated 14 January
                            2002 purportedly signed by Robert and himself;</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(b)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">the application form for the first draft had been
                            signed by Robert only; and</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(c)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">the request for change of mailing address from
                            the property to Robert’s house was also signed by Robert only but
                            was accepted by the defendant.</div>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     Consequently, on 12 September 2006, the
                    plaintiff wrote to the defendant enclosing copies of, the third cheque, the
                    application form (original and amended copies) and sought <em>inter alia</em> clarification on whether and when the third cheque
                    was presented to the defendant and why the mandate of two signatures had been
                    waived by the defendant in relation to the application form. The defendant
                    responded to the plaintiff’s queries on 26 October 2006 pointing out
                    that:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_25-p2_a"></a>(a)     It was not disputed the plaintiff
                        had signed the third cheque and he had admitted at a meeting he had with the
                        defendant in July 2005 that he had signed the third cheque for the purpose
                        of buying US dollars which transaction Robert had indeed carried
                    out.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_25-p2_b"></a>(b)     The plaintiff
                        had raised his queries in relation to the application form in May 2005,
                        which was more than a year after the relevant statements of account were
                        furnished by the defendant in April 2004, in breach of cl 7 of the
                        Terms and Conditions (see <a href="#p1_79">[79]</a> below)
                        governing the account.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_25-p2_c"></a>(c)     the plaintiff’s conduct was consistent with the
                        fact that the defendant had carried out the transaction properly and
                        reasonably.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     The plaintiff denied he had signed the third
                    cheque in blank. He maintained he had signed only one cheque <em>viz</em> the first cheque. He also disclaimed knowledge of the fixed
                    deposit and the HL account. He had assumed that no fixed deposit was placed
                    because he had not been asked to sign any documents for the opening of a
                    Malaysian bank account for the estate. Notwithstanding his receipt of
                    Vivienne’s fax dated 14 January 2002 from Robert at [11], it was the
                    plaintiff’s case that he was unaware of the placement of the fixed deposit
                    because he had heard nothing further from Robert after 16 January
                    2002.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     In fact, the plaintiff claimed he came to know
                    of the fixed deposit and the HL account only when he sued Robert in Suit
                    No 386 of 2005 (“the 2005 suit”) to recover the sum of
                    $995,112. Robert had there filed an affidavit in an (unsuccessful) attempt to
                    set aside the judgment in default of pleadings that the plaintiff had obtained
                    against him under O 19 of the Rules of Court. When Robert could not/did not pay
                    the judgment sum in the 2005 suit, the plaintiff made him a bankrupt on
                    11 May 2006 in Bankruptcy No 956 of 2006. It was in the course of
                    proceedings in the 2005 suit that the plaintiff discovered that the HL account
                    had been opened by Robert as far back as 10 July 1995. The plaintiff
                    believed his signature on the HL account opening form was forged.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     The plaintiff claimed he met the
                    defendant’s representative one Bertilla Chea at its Parkway Parade branch
                    on 12 December 2006 who then showed him the original of the third cheque.
                    The plaintiff noted therefrom that his signature was signed in blue ink whereas
                    the remaining handwritten portions which appeared to be written by Robert were
                    in black ink. The plaintiff’s signature on the first cheque on the other
                    hand was in black ink. The plaintiff reiterated that he only signed the first
                    cheque and no others on 6 January 2002; he believed Robert had forged his
                    signature on the third cheque.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The pleadings</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     On 18 January 2008, the plaintiff
                    commenced this action. In his statement of claim the plaintiff repeated his
                    contention that he was unaware of and did not sign the third cheque. He alleged
                    that the defendant used the third cheque to pay or issue the second draft in
                    favour of Yong and thereby debited the account in the sum of $995,112 (being the
                    amount of the third cheque) as well as two additional sums of $100 and $10.00.
                    The plaintiff contended he did not authorise the drawing of the third cheque and
                    he did not apply or sign the application form or the amendments thereto in
                    respect of the first and second drafts respectively. Consequently he contended,
                    the defendant had no authority to debit the account with the aforesaid three
                    sums on 21 January 2002 or at all.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     The plaintiff further alleged that unbeknownst
                    to him until March/April 2004, the defendant had, in breach of its mandate,
                    changed the mailing address of the account from the property to Robert’s
                    house.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     As a result of the defendant’s breaches,
                    the plaintiff alleged that the defendant was negligent and in breach of contract
                    in relation to the account. The plaintiff also alleged that the
                    defendant’s negligence caused him to sign the fourth cheque which sum was
                    debited to the account on 18 April 2002.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     In its defence and counterclaim (amendment
                    No.1), the defendant denied it had been negligent and averred that the plaintiff
                    and Robert had both signed the third cheque as authorised signatories to the
                    account which third cheque the defendant utilised in payment of the two drafts.
                    The defendant asserted that the application for and amendments to the first and
                    second draft respectively had been validly authorised by the plaintiff and
                    Robert. If indeed the drawing of the third cheque was unauthorised (which was
                    not admitted), the defendant contended that the plaintiff had facilitated such
                    unauthorised withdrawal and the application for and amendments to the two drafts
                    by signing the third cheque without taking proper safeguards such as indicating
                    on the third cheque the purpose for which it was signed, and by making the third
                    cheque available for the use of Robert who was a signatory of the account. The
                    defendant relied on cl 16 of the Terms and Conditions governing the
                    operation of the account to say it was not liable to the plaintiff in such an
                    event.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     The defendant averred that the plaintiff knew
                    of the fixed deposit in the HL account, relying <em>inter
                        alia</em> on the fax (in <a href="#p1_17">[17]</a>)
                    sent by the plaintiff to Robert on 6 May 2002.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     The defendant added that the plaintiff could
                    not in any case challenge the validity of the application for and/or the
                    amendments to the first and second drafts respectively and/or payment of the
                    third cheque to the defendant and payment of the fourth cheque, by reason of
                    cl 7(b)(iii)(bb) of the Terms and Conditions governing the
                account.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     The defendant pointed out that the application
                    for and amendments to the first and second drafts respectively and/or payment of
                    the third and fourth cheques were reflected as entries in the statements that
                    were periodically issued by the defendant. Further, pursuant to the
                    plaintiff’s request, the defendant had on or around 3 April 2004
                    provided the plaintiff with statements of the account for the period September
                    2000 to February 2004. The statements expressly informed the holder of the
                    account that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It is your duty to check all entries in this statement and unless errors
                        are reported to the bank within fourteen (14) days after receipt, the
                        entries will be considered correct and you will be bound by them.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     The defendant averred that it was only by way
                    of a letter dated 16 June 2005 which was more than 14 days after the
                    plaintiff’s receipt of the statements that the plaintiff sought to raise
                    to the defendant objections to the application for and/or amendments to the
                    first and second drafts and/or payment of the fourth cheque. In fact, until the
                    defendant was served the statement of claim on 20 May 2008, the plaintiff
                    had not raised any objections to the debit from the account of the sum of
                    $300,000 in the fourth cheque.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     In the event the defendant was found to be
                    liable to the plaintiff, the defendant counterclaimed for a declaration that it
                    was entitled to a contribution or indemnity from the plaintiff in his capacity
                    as an administrator of the estate and/or co-signatory of the account, pursuant
                    to s 15 of the Civil Law Act (Cap 43, 1999 Rev Ed)(“the
                    Civil Law Act”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     In his reply and defence to the counterclaim,
                    the plaintiff pleaded for the first time that he and Robert had agreed that a
                    sum of $1m from the account would be placed in an account to be opened in
                    Malaysia in the name of the estate, for a period of three months only and which
                    would be operated jointly by both of them. The plaintiff contended that the
                    third cheque was never reflected in any of the defendant’s statements
                    forwarded to the plaintiff or shown to have been cleared through the account
                    maintained with the defendant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     The plaintiff averred that the documentation
                    pertaining to the two drafts was only shown to him on or about 11 July 2005
                    after the plaintiff had queried the transaction while the original of the third
                    cheque was only shown to him on or about 12 December 2006.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     The plaintiff denied he had authorised Robert
                    to amend the application form on his behalf. The plaintiff alleged that the
                    defendant failed to contact him when there were persistent amendments made by
                    Robert to the application form, in breach of the mandate granted to the
                    defendant. The plaintiff denied he had contributed to or assisted in the
                    application form and/or in the subsequent amendments to the application form for
                    the drafts.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     The plaintiff contended that by reason of the
                    defendant’s wrongful and/or unauthorised change of the mailing address to
                    which monthly statements were sent, the plaintiff was unaware of the
                    unauthorised and/or un-mandated withdrawals. Had the plaintiff known of the
                    discrepancies in the account, the plaintiff averred he would have stopped any
                    further issuance of cheques in relation thereto. He contended that by its
                    conduct the defendant was estopped from relying on any of the exclusion clauses
                    in relation to the operation of the account.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     On the first day of trial, the plaintiff
                    applied by Summons No 3424 of 2009 (“the plaintiff’s
                    application”) to amend the reliefs in the statement of claim to include:
                    (i) a declaration that the defendant was not entitled to debit the account with
                    the amounts of $995,112, $100 and $10 and (ii) a claim for restitution to the
                    plaintiff of all sums wrongfully debited against the account. The defendant
                    opposed, and I dismissed the plaintiff’s application for the reason that,
                    a claim for restitution is a necessary corollary to a claim for unjust
                    enrichment but such a claim was not pleaded by the plaintiff.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     The defendant also had an application on the
                    first day of trial, by way of Summons No 3111 of 2009 (“the
                    defendant’s application”) for Robert’s AEIC to be received in
                    evidence at the trial despite the fact that his demise meant Robert could not be
                    cross-examined. I overruled the objections of counsel for the plaintiff and
                    granted an order in terms of the defendant’s application, with the caveat
                    that the probative value of Robert’s written testimony must factor in the
                    lack of opportunity by counsel for the plaintiff to cross-examine Robert and
                    (with the agreement of counsel for the defendant) that the principle in
                        <em>Browne v Dunn</em> (1893) 6 R 57 would
                    apply.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The evidence</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     The plaintiff was the only factual witness for
                    his case. The defendant also had only one factual witness in its employee Ho
                    Siew Fong (“Ho”) in the light of Robert’s demise. Ho at the
                    material time was a customer service officer (“CSO”) at its Bukit
                    Timah branch. Both sides also had an expert witness. In the plaintiff’s
                    case, his expert was William Pang Chan Kok (‘Pang”) who is a
                    private handwriting and forensic document examiner while the defendant’s
                    expert Yap Bei Sing (“Yap”) is a senior forensic scientist from
                    the Health Science Authority’s Document Examination unit. Each side
                    roundly criticised the opposing party’s expert’s testimony as well
                    as his expertise. There was even a suggestion in the plaintiff’s closing
                    submissions that Yap was a biased witness because he had had sight of
                    Pang’s report when Yap prepared his report.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">(i)   The plaintiff’s case</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     The plaintiff’s testimony has been
                    outlined in the facts set out above (save where the same came from
                    Robert’s AEIC). I therefore turn to the plaintiff’s
                    cross-examination for the additional evidence that was adduced from him by
                    counsel for the defendant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     Contrary to the assertions made in his AEIC,
                    the plaintiff changed his stance in cross-examination and made the following
                    significant admissions:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_46-p2_a"></a>(a)     he knew from the two faxes in
                            <a href="#p1_11">[11]</a> that he received from Robert
                        that $1m from the account would be withdrawn, converted into MR and
                        transferred to an account in Malaysia;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_46-p2_b"></a>(b)     his fax to Robert at <a href="#p1_17">[17]</a> showed he was aware of the fixed deposit of
                        RM2,059.600;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_46-p2_c"></a>(c)     the fourth cheque in <a href="#p1_16">[16]</a> was meant for
                        Robert’s balance share of the estate. The plaintiff disavowed his
                        signing of the fourth cheque because he felt that Robert had taken more than
                        his share of the estate;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_46-p2_d"></a>(d)     the plaintiff was aware that the property had been sold
                        in October 2001 and that statements for the account could no longer be sent
                        there. The plaintiff did not take any steps to effect the change of mailing
                        address nor did he ask Robert if the mailing address had been
                        changed;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_46-p2_e"></a>(e)     prior
                        to March 2003, the plaintiff did not request the defendant for past
                        statements for the account for the period 2001-2002;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_46-p2_f"></a>(f)     after the plaintiff signed the first
                        cheque (for $1m) he had discussed with Robert the latter’s proposal to
                        convert $1m of the estate’s money into MR as well as Vivienne’s
                        proposal of a better deal for the estate by doing an exchange of Singapore
                        dollars for MR with a private individual (initially with the sister of one
                        Vincent Tan and eventually with Yong);</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_46-p2_g"></a>(g)     he left it to Robert to carry out the transaction of
                        converting $1m into MR although Robert was required to keep him informed of
                        the process;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_46-p2_h"></a>(h)     he
                        signed four cheques on 6 January 2002 which included DBS cheque no.
                        243345 for $20,000 (at 2AB20). Just like the third cheque, the plaintiff
                        signed this cheque in blue ink whereas the rest of the handwriting was in
                        black ink.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     I turn next to portions of the
                    plaintiff’s testimony which contradicted his case and/or his AEIC.
                    Although the plaintiff had pleaded in his Further &amp; Better Particulars of
                    the statement of claim (filed on 24 July 2008) that he did not sign the
                    third cheque to the best of his knowledge, information and belief, he was more
                    certain in his AEIC as there (in para 31) he said:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I wish to say that I did not sign the cheque no. 243348 dated
                        14 January 2002 for $995,112. I signed only one cheque [the first
                        cheque], for $1 million on 6 January 2002. By 14 January 2002, I had
                        returned to Taiwan and was not in Singapore. I also did not sign the cheque
                        in blank.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     The plaintiff’s reasoning that he could
                    not have signed the third cheque in blank was based purely on its date of
                    14 January 2002. However, his reasoning was flawed – the second
                    cheque for $50,000 issued to him (at 1AB61) was also not dated 6 January
                    2002. Confronted with the second cheque, the plaintiff (at N/E 76/77) sought to
                    explain the date by stating he left Singapore for Hong Kong on 7 January
                    2002, he returned to Taiwan therefrom on 11 January 2002 and he posted the
                    second cheque back to his Singapore bank (Keppel Tat Lee Bank) on
                    12 January 2002 for crediting to his account. He then excused himself with
                    the remark “so long ago” when he was asked to confirm that the
                    second cheque was dated 12 January 2002 even though he signed it in
                    Singapore on 6 January 2002. I find it strange that a person in the
                    plaintiff’s position (a Permanent Secretary of two ministries and chairman
                    of the Central Provident Fund Board before his retirement and posting to Taiwan
                    in 1979 to set up Singapore’s trade office) would venture to say that the
                    dates in cheques necessarily evidenced when they were actually
                signed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     The defendant’s submissions criticised
                    the plaintiff’s action of bringing the second cheque back with him to
                    Taiwan and then posting it back to Singapore as illogical and unlikely. It was
                    the defendant’s submission that it was more likely than not (with which I
                    agree) that the plaintiff and Robert signed four cheques in blank on
                    6 January 2002; the second cheque was one of them. Robert was entrusted
                    with the four cheques and it was Robert who filled in the particulars in all the
                    cheques including those on the second cheque and its date of 12 January
                    2002 and credited it to the plaintiff’s Singapore bank account for him.
                    Consequently the dates of the four cheques have no significance and even less
                    consequence. The plaintiff’s testimony ignored the common practice of
                    backdating or postdating cheques.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     The defendant’s submissions also gave a
                    reason why the plaintiff’s case that he did not sign the third cheque has
                    no merit. As stated earlier in <a href="#p1_21">[21]</a>, the
                    plaintiff had previously sued and obtained judgment against Robert in the 2005
                    suit. In an affidavit filed on 3 August 2005 in the 2005 suit, the
                    plaintiff had (in para 10) said he signed the third cheque which he
                    disavowed in these proceedings.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     However, subsequently, in a later affidavit
                    (at para 14) that he filed (on 27 September 2005) in the 2005 suit,
                    the plaintiff did a <em>volte face</em> and claimed that he
                    did not sign the third cheque. The plaintiff explained his change of heart on
                    the basis that he had mistaken the third cheque for the first cheque he signed
                    on 6 January 2002 and he only realised his mistake when he obtained a copy
                    of the third cheque from the defendant. The plaintiff’s explanation was
                    unconvincing according to the defendant. The defendant pointed out that by
                    3 August 2005 (when the plaintiff filed his first affidavit acknowledging
                    he signed the third cheque) the plaintiff had already seen the third cheque as a
                    copy thereof was exhibited in Robert’s affidavit filed on 29 July
                    2005 in the 2005 suit.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     The defendant submitted that it was
                    unbelievable that the plaintiff could have confused the third cheque with the
                    first. Granted the amounts stated in both cheques were the same <em>ie</em> $1m. However, the payee in the first cheque was the
                    estate whereas the third cheque had no payee until Robert filled in the
                    defendant’s name (the cheque itself was dated 14 January 2002). The
                    defendant added that it was also logical for the third cheque to be signed in
                    blank since the payee and amount details were not known until 22 January
                    2002. It was only on that day that Robert could write the precise Singapore
                    dollar amount for US$542,000 in the cheque.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     I note that in the statement of claim, the
                    plaintiff pleaded that the third cheque was used to purchase a draft in favour
                    of Yong. This was in accordance with the discussions reached between the
                    plaintiff and Robert on 6 January 2002 and reflected in the fax of
                    14 January 2002. The plaintiff did not deny receiving this fax nor
                    Robert’s earlier fax of 8 January 2002. The plaintiff had even made a
                    handwritten notation of <em>16/01/02</em> on the fax of
                    14 January 2002 to indicate Thursday 16 January 2002 was the likely
                    date the transaction with Yong would be concluded. If indeed he disagreed with
                    Robert’s proposed transaction with Yong, why did the plaintiff not object?
                    Instead, there was a fax from him to Robert (set out at <a href="#p1_17">[17]</a>), implicitly acknowledging the fixed deposit in
                MR.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     It is puzzling why the plaintiff would send
                    such a fax to Robert out of extreme anger. As counsel for the defendant as well
                    as the court pointed out to the plaintiff (at N/E 24 and N/E 146 respectively)
                    which the plaintiff conceded, the text of the fax did not reflect any anger the
                    plaintiff may have felt towards Robert. On a plain reading of the fax dated
                    6 May 2002, the plaintiff wanted to have an update from Robert. It was no
                    coincidence (according to the defendant) that the fax to Robert was sent on
                    6 May 2002 as that was exactly three months from the date (6 January
                    2002) the two brothers had discussed the placement of the fixed deposit in
                    MR.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     In re-examination, the plaintiff sought to
                    explain (at N/E 153) that Robert had provoked him by asking for $300,000
                    urgently to buy a piece of land at Desaru, Johor. The plaintiff said he acceded
                    to Robert’s request by signing a cheque and sending it to Robert by
                    courier service only to receive in return certain complaints from Robert. I
                    disallowed this line of re-examination further as this turn of events was
                    unrelated to the plaintiff’s fax of 6 May 2002 (at
                AB72).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     The plaintiff had also claimed that his
                    signature on the signature card of the HL account (N/E 28) was a forgery.
                    However, apart from a bare assertion, the plaintiff conceded that he had no
                    other evidence to support his belief as his own expert Pang did not verify the
                    plaintiff’s signatures on HL’s signature card.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     It would appear from the plaintiff’s
                    pleadings and his AEIC that his premise for saying the third cheque was not used
                    in the purchase of the bank draft was based on the fact that the bank statement
                    of the account for January 2002 (at AB183) showed the cheque was not cleared
                    through the banking system but the account was instead debited. I shall return
                    to this observation later.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">(ii)   The defendant’s case</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a>58     I turn next to the evidence of Ho Siew Fong
                    (“Ho”), the CSO who attended to Robert when he visited the branch
                    (twice) on 21 January 2002 to procure the two drafts. Ho was then the most
                    senior staff available at the branch that morning as neither the service nor
                    branch managers were in. Robert had initially been attended to by one Sandy Neo
                    and thereafter by Norita Bte Johar. The two persons were unsure whether the
                    application form could be processed as the document contained only
                    Robert’s signature whereas two signatures were required to operate the
                    account.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a>59     When the matter was referred to her, Ho
                    informed Robert that two signatures were required to process the application
                    form. Robert suggested that a cheque be made out to the defendant for the sum
                    required in the draft and handed the third cheque to her. Ho examined the third
                    cheque and verified the two signatures on the cheque with the sample signatures
                    in the defendant’s computer system. She noted the payee of the third
                    cheque was the defendant and the foreign exchange contract number CF 02004856-01
                    (“the forex contract”) was also inserted. Ho accepted the third
                    cheque and approved the application form on that basis.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a>60     Ho deposed that the words “ok By
                    TRSVNJJ that appeared on the third cheque (see 2AB38) were the initials of Miss
                    Ng Jean Jane (“Ng”) who used to be a treasury manager at the
                    branch. Ng no longer worked for the defendant and Ho did not know her
                    whereabouts.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a>61     In cross-examination Ho indicated it was
                    unlikely that a foreign exchange (‘forex”) contract in excess of
                    US$500,000 would have been concluded at the counter when Robert called at the
                    branch. It was more likely that Robert contracted with one of the
                    defendant’s foreign exchange dealers <em>ie</em> Ng
                    as reflected in the forex contract (at AB661). Ho testified there was a bit of
                    commotion when Robert was at the branch. While Ho was doing some back room
                    transactions, she heard Robert talking loudly before she came out to attend to
                    him. Robert insisted on the branch processing the application form as there was
                    a forex contract and he had the third cheque with which to make payment. Ho
                    telephoned the defendant’s treasury department to obtain its approval to
                    use the third cheque for the forex contract before she herself approved the
                    application form.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_62"></a>62     Robert’s AEIC (admitted into evidence on
                    the first day of trial) came in for intense criticism in the plaintiff’s
                    closing submissions. The plaintiff not surprisingly argued that Robert was an
                    unreliable witness lacking in credibility, based on past inconsistent affidavits
                    that he had filed (which documents referred to in her submissions by counsel for
                    the plaintiff were not in any of the bundles used in this trial). The plaintiff
                    pointed out that in Robert’s affidavit filed on 30 August 2005 to set
                    aside the default judgment in the 2005 suit, Robert had deposed to the following
                    facts:</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(a)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">on 6 January 2002, he and the plaintiff had
                            agreed to place $1m in a Malaysian account to earn better interest, for
                            which purpose the third cheque was signed;</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(b)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">he was subsequently told that the third cheque
                            would take time to clear and the exchange rate would not be
                            favourable;</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(c)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">shortly thereafter, Robert struck a deal with
                            Yong to purchase RM2,059,600 in exchange for US$542,000;
                        and</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(d)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">Robert informed the plaintiff of the intended
                            transfer of funds and the third cheque was signed, suggesting that the
                            third cheque was signed after 6 January 2002.</div>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_63"></a>63     The plaintiff then submitted that in Suit
                    No 28 of 2007 (“the 2007 suit”) where Robert’s trustee
                    for his bankrupt estate sued Robert’s wife, Robert had alleged in an
                    affidavit (filed on 14 May 2007) that the plaintiff was the cause of his
                    earlier bankruptcy. When the plaintiff took issue with this allegation, Robert
                    withdrew it claiming it was a mistake. This statement was erroneous – I
                    note from the affidavit filed by Robert’s wife in the 2007 suit that this
                    allegation was not made by Robert but by Robert’s wife in her affidavit).
                    According to the plaintiff, before 2006, Robert and Robert’s wife had been
                    adjudged bankrupts in Bankruptcy Nos 4800 of 1986 and 3228 of 1986
                    respectively by the same judgment creditors. These bankruptcies were however
                    discharged in 1995/1996.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_64"></a>64     It was submitted by the plaintiff (without
                    elaboration) that Robert had also refused to cooperate with the plaintiff in the
                    administration of their sister Daisy’s estate. Although this fact was
                    completely irrelevant to this suit, the plaintiff’s submission also
                    volunteered the information that Daisy’s bequest to Robert in her Will was
                    declared void because Robert’s wife had witnessed Daisy’s
                    Will.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_65"></a>65     Having read the affidavits for the 2007 suit
                    (to which the defendant understandably objected in its counsel’s letter to
                    the court subsequent to the trial at <a href="#p1_106">[106]</a> <em>infra</em>), I disagree with and reject the
                    plaintiff’s submission that Robert lacked credibility and his AEIC should
                    be rejected. On the contrary, there were no inconsistencies in Robert’s
                    testimony vis-a-vis his several affidavits filed in the 2005 suit and this suit,
                    unlike the inconsistencies between the plaintiff’s pleaded case and his
                    evidence as highlighted earlier.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The expert testimony</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_66"></a>66     As stated earlier (at <a href="#p1_44">[44]</a>), each side had an expert witness of whom the other side
                    was highly critical. I start my review by looking at the testimony of the
                    plaintiff’s expert.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_67"></a>67     Pang (PW2) who is the sole-proprietor of his
                    own firm (Handwriting and Document Examiner) was instructed by counsel for the
                    plaintiff to conduct a comparative examination of the plaintiff’s
                    signature in the third cheque with those in the first and fourth cheques and in
                    DBS cheque no. 243345 for $20,000 with those in six other cheques issued by the
                    defendant and in 28 cheques issued by Keppel Tat Lee Bank (hereinafter referred
                    to collectively as “the specimen signatures”). Pang’s task
                    was to determine whether the plaintiff signed the third cheque.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_68"></a>68     Pang carried out a microscopic and macroscopic
                    examination to assess the structure, features and writing quality of all the
                    signatures followed by a comparative examination of the similarities and
                    differences between the signature in the third cheque and the specimen
                    signatures.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_69"></a>69     While the plaintiff’s signature in the
                    third cheque was pictorially similar to the specimen signatures, Pang opined
                    that there were seven differences between them as which result he concluded that
                    the plaintiff did not write the signature in the third cheque.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_70"></a>70     Both Pang’s credentials and his report
                    came in for heavy criticism from the defendant in its closing submissions. The
                    defendant pointed out that unlike Yap who had 20 years’ experience in the
                    field of forensic documentation, who had handled more than 3,900 cases and
                    testified in court on more than 70 occasions as an expert witness, Pang only
                    started two years of formal apprenticeship under one Chris Anderson in 2004 and
                    received certification as a forensic examiner in 2006. Therefore Pang had no
                    more than three years’ experience as a certified forensic document
                    examiner. By his own admission during cross-examination, the bulk of
                    Pang’s experience was in graphology. Further, Pang continued to be
                    mentored by Chris Anderson in all aspects of document examination and in his
                    casework. (Chris Anderson was originally scheduled to be the plaintiff’s
                    expert together with Pang by Order of Court dated 21 November
                2008).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_71"></a>71     The defendant criticised as flawed
                    Pang’s finding that the plaintiff’s signature on the third cheque
                    was likely to be a forgery. Essentially, Pang’s methodology was to compare
                    the specimen signatures with that in the third cheque. The defendant contended
                    that his seven differences between the specimen signatures and that in the third
                    cheque were in fact within the range of natural variations of the
                    plaintiff’s signatures and actually supported the defendant’s view
                    that the plaintiff did sign the third cheque. Pang’s opinion was said to
                    be not impartial. The court was urged to disregard his report as the evidence to
                    suggest forgery of the plaintiff’s signature in the third cheque was not
                    cogent enough. The defendant argued that the plaintiff had failed to meet the
                    requisite standard of proof to make out his case that his signature on the third
                    cheque was forged.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_72"></a>72     The plaintiff not surprisingly similarly
                    criticised the defendant’s expert Yap who had opined (in his first report)
                    that it was highly probable that the writer of the 15 sample signatures he was
                    given was the signatory in the third cheque. The plaintiff not only complained
                    of Yap’s lackadaisical approach to preparation and presentation in his
                    reports (which contained no explanation of his methodology), but also attacked
                    his lack of integrity for failing to disclose that counsel for the defendant had
                    given him a copy of Pang’s first report to answer when Yap prepared his
                    second report.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_73"></a>73     Yap was cross-examined in great detail and the
                    plaintiff’s closing submissions dealt <em>in
                        extenso</em> on his non-disclosure. Counsel for the plaintiff alleged
                    (at N/E 466) that Yap’s second report was targeted at Pang’s report.
                    Yap was further criticised for his scanty first report and for accepting at face
                    value the 15 sample signatures of the plaintiff that were given to him by the
                    defendant (five of which were extracted from letters while six were hardly
                    contemporaneous) unlike Pang who gathered the specimen signatures (all from
                    cheques) himself in a professional manner.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_74"></a>74     It was pointed out in the plaintiff’s
                    submissions that during cross-examination (at N/E 465), Yap had admitted that he
                    brought up ten points in his second report to discredit Pang’s seven
                    points and that was his “trump card”. The plaintiff therefore
                    submitted that the omissions in Yap’s report were not
                    “accidents” and his evidence should be viewed with suspicion
                    because he was not an independent witness and lacked impartiality.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_75"></a>75     I should point out that in his second report,
                    Yap was given for comparison with the signature in the third cheque, the
                    specimen signatures that Pang had extracted from 28 Keppel Tat Lee cheques of
                    the plaintiff. Conversely, in Pang’s second report, he was given six of
                    the 15 sample signatures relied on in Yap’s first report and which were
                    identified by Yap as S1, S11 to S15. S1 was the defendant’s signature card
                    signed by the plaintiff and Robert when the account was opened on 10 May
                    1986 while the other sample signatures of the plaintiff came from five letters
                    he had written to the defendant between 23 August 2005 and 9 February
                    2007. Both experts’ views remained unchanged in their respective second
                    reports.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_76"></a>76     Having gone to the trouble of calling Pang as
                    an expert witness, it was surprising to find (in para 178) the following
                    passage in the plaintiff’s closing submissions:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The plaintiff’s position remains that on the totality of the
                        evidence, whether or not [the plaintiff’s] signature was forged on the
                        [third] cheque is not relevant because the [third] cheque was never
                        presented and never used. The debiting of the Account was direct – it
                        was not based on the cheque.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The Issues</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_77"></a>77     Based on the facts and the plaintiff’s
                    pleaded case, the following issues arose for determination in this suit:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_77-p2_a"></a>(a)     Did the defendant breach the mandate
                        for the operation of the account (which required two signatories’
                        authority) when it accepted Robert’s instructions to change the
                        mailing address from the property to Robert’s
                    house?</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_77-p2_b"></a>(b)     Did the
                        defendant similarly breach the mandate when it accepted the application form
                        signed by Robert for the purchase of the bank draft and entered into the
                        forex contract?</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_77-p2_c"></a>(c)     What was the basis of the forex contract?</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_77-p2_d"></a>(d)     Was the plaintiff’s signature on the third
                        cheque a forgery?</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_77-p2_e"></a>(e)     If the defendant is liable to the estate for breach of mandate, is it
                        entitled to a contribution or indemnity from the plaintiff due to his
                        negligence?</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The submissions</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_78"></a>78     Before I set out my findings, it would be
                    useful to first look at the closing submissions tendered by the
                parties.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_79"></a>79     The defendant had relied on two clauses of the
                    Terms and Conditions governing the account in denying liability. The first was
                    cl 7(b)(iii)(bb) which reads as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>Customer’s Duty</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The customer is under a duty:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">to examine all debit and credit entries in the Statement of Account and
                        updated passbooks, statements, transaction advices, deposit advices and
                        records (Transaction Records”) and to report any omission from or
                        debits/credits wrongly made or made without authority to or inaccurate
                        entries in such Statement of Accounts and/or Transaction Records. Unless the
                        debit or credit entries or omissions or any other inaccuracies therein are
                        objected to within 14 days after the customer’s receipt of his
                        Statement of Account or his Transaction Records, such entries made in the
                        Statement of Account or Transaction Records shall be deemed correct and
                        shall be conclusive without further proof as against the customer that such
                        Statement of Account or Transaction Records contain all credits that should
                        be contained therein and no debits that should not be contained therein and
                        further the customer shall be bound by the Statement of Account and the
                        Transaction Records and the Bank shall be free from all claims in respect of
                        any and every debit or credit item shown in the Statement of Account and the
                        Transaction Records. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Bank reserves the
                        right upon notice to the customer to add and/or alter the entries in the
                        Statement of Account and Transaction Records in the event of incorrect or
                        missing entries or amounts stated therein.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_80"></a>80     The second clause relied upon by the defendant
                    was cl 16; it reads:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>No liability for loss</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(a)    the Bank shall not be liable for any loss, damage
                            or expense suffered or incurred by the customer (whether as a result of
                            computer breakdown, forgery of signatory’s signature, material
                            alteration of withdrawal requests or other reasons of any kind
                            whatsoever) through no fault of the Bank.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(c)    If in any event described in paragraph (a) or (b)
                            above the Bank has debited the customer’s account in reliance on a
                            withdrawal or payment request on which the signature of the customer or
                            his authorised signature was forged, the Bank shall not be liable to
                            reverse the debit or pay or compensate the customer in respect of the
                            amount so debited.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_81"></a>81     It was the plaintiff’s case that the
                    defendant was not entitled to rely on cl 16 to exclude its liability
                    because it had breached the mandate for the account. The defendant however
                    maintained that even if there was such a breach (which it did not admit), the
                    defendant was not liable, relying on <em>London Intercontinental
                        Trust Ltd v Barclays Bank Ltd</em> [1980] 1 Lloyds LR 241
                        (“<em>London
                    Intercontinental</em>”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_82"></a>82     In <em>London
                        Intercontinental</em>, the plaintiff customer of the defendant bank
                    complained that the latter acted in breach of its mandate when it paid out on
                    two cheques (totalling £195,000) that contained only the signature of one
                    instead of two authorised signatories as required. Slynn J held the
                    defendant was not liable as he found that Mr Ross the sole signatory of the
                    two cheques had actual authority to direct the transfer of the moneys. As such
                    the defendant was entitled to act on the cheques drawn on his sole signature and
                    those cheques were not invalidated by the fact that the defendant had a mandate
                    requiring two signatures.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_83"></a>83     The defendantcontended that Robert had actual
                    authority from the plaintiff to transfer the sun of US$542,000 from the account
                    to Yong; there was therefore no breach of mandate.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_84"></a>84     Moreover the defendant argued, the law
                    required a high standard of proof for an allegation of forgery, fraud and/or
                    criminal conduct, citing the Court of Appeal’s decision in <em>Yogambikai Nagarajah v Indian Overseas Bank</em> [1997]
                    1 SLR(R) 258 (“<em>Yogambikai</em>”) and
                    this was reiterated in <em>Chua Kwee Chen, Lim Chah In v Koh
                        Choon Chin</em> [2006] 3 SLR(R) 469.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_85"></a>85     In <em>Yogambikai</em>,
                    the appellant appealed against the trial judge’s decision in: (i)
                    dismissing her claim that her mandate signature was forged and that a letter to
                    the respondent bank purportedly containing her instructions to transfer moneys
                    from her fixed deposit to one Valli’s account was not signed by her and
                    that (ii) moneys held in her account with the respondent bank were held on trust
                    for the benefit of Valli and Valli’s infant daughter.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_86"></a>86     The appellant failed in her appeal. In
                    affirming the judgment of the trial judge, the appellate court opined that the
                    more serious the allegation made by one party, the higher was the standard of
                    proof it had to satisfy, following the UK Court of Appeal’s decision in
                        <em>Hornal v Neuberger Products</em> [1957] 1 QB
                    247.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_87"></a>87     The defendant pointed out that the plaintiff
                    had failed to discharge the requisite high standard of proof set out in
                        <em>Yogambikai</em> for his allegation that his
                    signature on the third cheque had been forged.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_88"></a>88     The defendant contended (in para 269 of
                    its closing submissions) that the change of mailing address did not cause the
                    plaintiff to sign the fourth cheque or to suffer any loss.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_89"></a>89     Not surprisingly, the plaintiff disagreed with
                    the defendant. His counsel sought to distinguish <em>London
                        Intercontinental</em> from this case on the basis that there, even
                    though the cheques bore only one signature (that of Mr Ross) when the
                    mandate required two, there were letters sent to the defendant bank confirming
                    the transactions. That was why the court found that Mr Ross had actual
                    authority to transfer the sums of money. It was pointed out that Slynn J
                    had opined (at p 249) that as a result of its failure to observe the
                    discrepancy, the defendant took a risk in honouring the cheque that Mr Ross was
                    not in fact authorised although ultimately the court held he was.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_90"></a>90     Here, in allowing the first draft to be
                    issued, knowing full well that the mandate was not fulfilled, the defendant had
                    indeed taken the risk upon itself that Robert was not authorised. After all, Ho
                    had confirmed she was not aware of the purpose for which the first draft was
                    required.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_91"></a>91     Counsel for the plaintiff added that the
                    defendant should not be allowed to rely on cl 7 of the Terms and Conditions
                    set out at <a href="#p1_84">[84]</a> above. She pointed out that
                    the defendant’s submission meant that the clause would apply even though
                    the monthly statements were furnished to the plaintiff some two years after the
                    transactions. That ran counter to the plain meaning of the clause that it would
                    only apply to current statements issued by the defendant and not to statements
                    received some years later as in this case. No objections were raised by the
                    defendant to the plaintiff’s late complaints on the monthly statements nor
                    did it place reliance on cl 7 until three years later in the
                    defendant’s letter dated 26 October 2006 (referred to at <a href="#p1_25">[25]</a> above). In any event, the plaintiff’s
                    recollection was that he had signed a cheque in the sum of $1m whilst the third
                    cheque was for $995,112. Consequently, the plaintiff could not be criticised for
                    being confused or for not immediately reporting a fraud.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_92"></a>92     The plaintiff’s counsel also argued that
                        <em>Yogambikai</em> did not apply as the course of
                    action the defendant took was not justifiable.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_93"></a>93     The plaintiff criticised the defendant’s
                    witness pointing out that Ho’s evidence was not helpful. The defendant
                    failed to call Ng, a more relevant witness, to testify. Neither did the
                    defendant call anyone to explain why the account’s mailing address was
                    changed upon Robert’s sole signature in the request form. Bertilla Chea
                    (see [28] was also not called to testify. The court was asked to draw an adverse
                    inference against the defendant for its failure to call witnesses other than
                    Ho.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_94"></a>94     I noted that the plaintiff’s submissions
                    dealt exclusively (apart from the expert testimony) on the defendant’s
                    breach of mandate as set out in <a href="#p1_77">[77]</a>(a), (b)
                    without addressing the issue of the consequences that resulted from the
                    defendant’s breach (if it was found to be so liable). I shall return to
                    this observation later.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The findings</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">(i)   Was there a breach of mandate in the change of mailing
                address without the plaintiff’s authority/consent?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_95"></a>95     It is trite law that a bank must comply
                    strictly with the terms of the mandate from its customer. It was not disputed by
                    the defendant that the account required the joint signatures of the plaintiff
                    and Robert for its operation. Consequently, the defendant was in breach of that
                    joint mandate when it acted only on Robert’s sole signature in the request
                    form dated 9 October 2001 to change the mailing address of the account from
                    the property to Robert’s house.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_96"></a>96     However, it bears remembering in this regard
                    that the plaintiff did not return to Singapore until June 2002 whereas the
                    property was sold in October 2001. Had Robert not changed the mailing address of
                    the account to Robert’s house after the completion of the sale of the
                    property, the statements and correspondence relating to the account would have
                    been returned to the defendant by the purchaser of the property or thrown away,
                    unless Robert had requested (and the purchaser had agreed) that mail be
                    forwarded to Robert’s house (which would mean the statements still ended
                    up at Robert’s house). It was more likely than not that had he been asked
                    by Robert, the plaintiff would have consented to the change of mailing address
                    from the property to Robert’s house as they then had a good relationship.
                    In any case, the plaintiff did not offer any alternative to Robert’s house
                    as the new mailing address of the account after October 2001.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_97"></a>97     The unauthorised change of mailing address was
                    tied to the plaintiff’s complaint that had he received the statements for
                    the account, he would not have signed the fourth cheque. However, the fourth
                    cheque for $300,000 was for the balance of Robert’s share of $1.3m of the
                    sale proceeds of the property. I fail to see the connection between the
                    plaintiff’s non-receipt of the statements for the account due to the
                    change of mailing address and his signing of the fourth cheque to settle
                    Robert’s entitlement to a one-third share. Even before October 2001, the
                    plaintiff was not receiving the monthly statements of the account as they were
                    received by Robert at the property.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">(ii)   Was the plaintiff’s signature on the third cheque
                forged?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_98"></a>98     It is an established principle of law that the
                    standard of proof required for forgery is very high (see <em>Yogambikai</em> and restated in <em>Chua Kwee Chen,
                        Lim Kah Nee and Lim Chah In v Koh Choon Chin supra</em><a href="#p1_84">[84]</a>). I find that the plaintiff failed to
                    discharge the burden of proof in this regard.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_99"></a>99     If indeed the plaintiff’s signature on
                    the third cheque had been forged, s 24 of the Bills of Exchange Act
                    (Cap 23, 2004 Rev Ed) (“the BE Act”) becomes relevant.
                    The section reads:-</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>Forged or unauthorised signature</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">24. —(1) Subject to the provisions of this Act, where a signature on
                        a bill is forged or placed thereon without the authority of the person whose
                        signature it purports to be, the forged or unauthorised signature is wholly
                        inoperative, and no right to retain the bill or to give a discharge therefor
                        or to enforce payment thereof against any party thereto can be acquired
                        through or under that signature, unless the party against whom it is sought
                        to retain or enforce payment of the bill is precluded from setting up the
                        forgery or want of authority.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(2) Nothing in this section shall affect the ratification of an
                        unauthorised signature not amounting to a forgery.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_100"></a>100    A forgery of the plaintiff’s
                    signatures on any of the four cheques meant the defendant would have had no
                    defence to the plaintiff’s claim under the above section of the BE
                    Act.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_101"></a>101    However, I disbelieve the plaintiff’s
                    claim (and reject Pang’s testimony in that regard) that he only signed one
                    cheque <em>viz</em> the first cheque and not the third or
                    other two cheques on 6 January 2002. I find that the third cheque was
                    signed by the plaintiff at Robert’s house that day together with the
                    second and fourth cheques. Seen in tandem with his fax to Robert dated
                    6 May 2002 set out at <a href="#p1_17">[17]</a>, the
                    plaintiff had not only signed the third cheque but had expressly authorised
                    Robert to enter into the forex transaction with Yong. There can be no other
                    logical conclusion this court can arrive at, based <em>not</em> on the AEIC of Robert (which I was well aware was not tested
                    by cross-examination) but on the plaintiff’s own inconsistent testimony
                    observed earlier at <a href="#p1_45">[45]</a> to <a href="#p1_53">[53]</a>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_102"></a>102    Earlier (at <a href="#p1_16">[16]</a>), I had commented on the plaintiff’s total silence in
                    his AEIC on the signing of the fourth cheque. His only reference to the same was
                    in para 9 of his statement of claim where he pleaded that the
                    defendant’s negligence caused him to sign the fourth cheque. Not
                    surprisingly, the defendant requested Further and Better Particulars of such a
                    cryptic pleading. However, the Particulars rendered by the plaintiff were
                    singularly unhelpful. The plaintiff merely repeated his allegation that the
                    mandate for the account required two signatures but the defendant acted only on
                    Robert’s signature in changing the mailing address from the property to
                    Robert’s house. No answer was provided on how the defendant’s
                    breach in this respect caused the plaintiff to sign the fourth
                cheque.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">(iii)   Was there a breach of mandate in the defendant’s
                acceptance of the application form without the plaintiff’s
                signature?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_103"></a>103    A finding on this second breach necessitates
                    a recapitulation of what transpired on 21 January 2009 as set out earlier
                    at <a href="#p1_12">[12]</a> to <a href="#p1_15">[15]</a>. Despite the defendant’s defence and submissions to
                    the contrary, the application form (according to Ho’s own testimony)
                    required the signature of the plaintiff besides that of Robert. What is also
                    clear is the fact that Robert had in his hand the third cheque signed in blank
                    by the plaintiff. Robert wanted to use the third cheque to pay the defendant
                    when he was informed by Ho that the application form lacked the
                    plaintiff’s signature and could not therefore be processed for purposes of
                    debiting the account for the cost of purchase of the first draft. Consequently,
                    the third cheque should have been accepted in payment by the defendant and
                    should have been reflected in the defendant’s January 2002 statement for
                    the account.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_104"></a>104    It is not disputed that the third cheque was
                    not cleared by the defendant. Hence, the plaintiff’s complaint that the
                    defendant, despite rejecting the application form, nonetheless acted on the same
                    and deducted the forex amount from the account, and thereby breached the
                    mandate. The plaintiff’s submissions made much of the defendant’s
                    omission in this regard and argued that its waiver of the requirement of the
                    plaintiff’s signature amounted to a breach of the mandate for the account
                    and hence, a breach of contract. The plaintiff’s complaint was borne out
                    by the account’s January 2002 statement. However, for the reasons that
                    follow, the defendant’s breach in this regard does not advance the
                    plaintiff’s case.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_105"></a>105    Incidentally, the plaintiff’s
                    submissions had raised as an issue (at para 20[b]) whether the defendant
                    had breached its mandate in entering into the forex contract. This issue however
                    was not pleaded in the plaintiff’s statement of claim or reply and will
                    accordingly be ignored.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_106"></a>106    At this juncture I need to digress. Counsel
                    for the plaintiff had raised strenuous objections to the Reply submissions of
                    the defendant on the Counterclaim complaining (in her letter dated
                    20 August 2009) that the same exceeded the parameters of this court’s
                    directions on submissions. In particular, counsel asked that paragraphs 1-61 of
                    the Reply submissions be disallowed arguing that the paragraphs amounted to a
                    reply to the plaintiff’s submissions on his claim for which the defendant
                    had no right of reply. The plaintiff contended that the defendant could/should
                    have addressed in its submissions filed on 20 July 2009, the issue of the
                    forex contract as well as the plaintiff’s reference to documents not
                    referred to at the trial.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_107"></a>107    In response to the plaintiff’s
                    solicitors’ complaint, counsel for the defendant pointed out that the
                    plaintiff did not deny that its claim that the forex contract was unauthorised
                    was not pleaded. The defendant accused the plaintiff of blatantly attempting to
                    include in its submissions a new and unpleaded cause of action in relation to
                    the forex contract, not to mention that the plaintiff referred to affidavits
                    that were never raised in examination-in-chief, cross-examination or
                    re-examination nor related to this suit. It was obvious that the
                    plaintiff’s tactic in objecting to paras 1-61 of the defendant’s
                    reply submissions was to mask the lacuna in his pleaded case. Consequently, his
                    counsel’s objections are without merit and are hereby
                dismissed.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">(iv)   What was the basis of the forex contract?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_108"></a>108    The plaintiff’s allegation of the
                    forex contract being unauthorised even if pleaded, would not have succeeded
                    because it was clear on the evidence (based on the two faxes he received from
                    Robert at <a href="#p1_11">[11]</a> and his own fax to Robert at
                        <a href="#p1_17">[17]</a>) that the plaintiff knew of and had
                    authorised the forex contract even though he did not sign the application form.
                    Consequently, the transaction itself being authorised (as in <em>London Intercontinental</em>) it mattered not that the process by
                    which the transaction was effected <em>viz</em> by the
                    application form, was not signed by the plaintiff in accordance with the mandate
                    for the account. Nor did it matter that the defendant omitted to clear the third
                    cheque and instead (wrongly according to the plaintiff) debited the sum of
                    $995,112 to the account based on the application form. It should be noted that
                    the estate suffered no loss for which the defendant can be liable – the
                    forex contract for $995,112 was transacted with the plaintiff’s knowledge
                    and approval and the estate did receive in exchange the equivalent sum of
                    RM2,059,600.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_109"></a>109    As I found earlier in <a href="#p1_101">[101]</a> that the third cheque was indeed signed by
                    the plaintiff, it would not be necessary to address the expert testimony of the
                    parties.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_110"></a>110    However, in the event my findings on the
                    plaintiff’s testimony are wrong, I would accept the evidence of Yap in
                    preference to that of Pang, <em>viz</em> that the third
                    cheque was likely to have been signed by the plaintiff. Granted, the
                    plaintiff’s criticism of Yap’s cavalier and/or lackadaisical
                    attitude was not without justification. Even so, notwithstanding whatever
                    shortcomings in his first report and in his approach to being a court expert,
                    Yap’s analysis of the plaintiff’s handwriting is to be preferred,
                    despite Pang’s diligence and more professional approach in gathering the
                    specimen signatures. The court cannot overlook the fact that Yap’s
                    expertise and experience in forensic documentation far exceeded that of
                    Pang.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_111"></a>111    I disagree with Pang’s opinion that
                    the seven differences between the plaintiff’s signature in the third
                    cheque and the specimen signatures meant that the plaintiff did not sign the
                    third cheque. I prefer Yap’s opinion that those differences were within
                    the range of natural variations.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_112"></a>112    In the light of my findings, it would not be
                    necessary to address the issue of whether the defendant would not have been
                    liable to the plaintiff in any event based on cll 7(b)(iii)(bb) and 16 of
                    the Terms and Conditions governing the account.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_113"></a>113    I have two observations to make before I
                    conclude this judgment. First, although he repeatedly asserted his signatures in
                    the third and fourth cheques were forged, the plaintiff was careful not to
                    identify the person who allegedly forged his signature. On the evidence, the
                    alleged forger could only have been Robert if the allegation had been true which
                    I find it was not.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_114"></a>114    Secondly, the plaintiff never mentioned the
                    fate of the HL account. According to the defendant’s reply submissions (at
                    para 121), Robert had unilaterally withdrawn moneys from the HL account
                    after 21 January 2002. That would explain the plaintiff’s unhappiness
                    with Robert and his disclaimer of knowledge of the HL account (which I
                    disbelieve). The plaintiff’s allegation that his signature on the
                    signature card for the HL account was forged was not established in any case as
                    it was not corroborated by Pang (see <a href="#p1_56">[56]</a>).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_115"></a>115    Consequently, I dismiss the
                    plaintiff’s claim with costs to the defendant to be taxed (on a standard
                    basis) unless otherwise agreed. In the light of my dismissal of the
                    plaintiff’s claim, the defendant’s counterclaim for a contribution
                    from the plaintiff under s 15 of the Civil Law Act based on his negligence does
                    not arise for consideration. The counterclaim is similarly dismissed with costs
                    which are fixed at $2,000, as no evidence was led on the counterclaim at all,
                    the issue of contribution being a question of law.</p>
