This appeal (Magistrate’s Appeal No 14 of 2017) is the Appellant’s appeal against conviction for causing damage to a water main under s 47A(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>), read with s 56A of the Public Utilities Act (Cap 261, 2002 Rev Ed) (“the Act”). In this case, the damage to the water main arose in the course of drilling works carried out by a subcontractor engaged by the Appellant. The main issue in this appeal is whether a main contractor can be held liable for a s 47A(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) offence committed by a subcontractor, by virtue of s 56A of the Act which extends criminal liability to persons other than the primary offender (“secondary liability”). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 After considering the submissions of the parties, I am of the view that the Appellant is not liable under s 56A and that the appeal should be allowed.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Facts</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">3 The Appellant was awarded a contract (“the main contract”) by the Public Utilities Board (“PUB”) to carry out soil investigation works for the Deep Tunnel Sewerage System Phase 2 project (“the DTSS Project”).

PUB had notified the Appellant that there were PUB water mains located in the vicinity of the site of investigation works for the DTSS Project. The Appellant was given a copy of a PUB service plan (“PUB Plan”) which showed the approximate locations of PUB water mains and also a document on the “Dos and Dont’s” on the Prevention of Damage to Water Mains (“the Guide”). The Appellant did not ascertain the exact alignment of the Water Main and merely instructed GIS to conduct a trial hole and manual hand auger. Contrary to the requirement set out in the Guide, the Appellant also failed to consult PUB when the water mains that were shown in the PUB plan to be in the vicinity of the borehole were not detected when the trial hole was carried out. The offence was therefore committed due to the negligence of the Appellant.

Where the purpose of the statute in question as discerned from the language used in the enactment clearly supports one interpretation, reference to extraneous material may be had for a limited function, <span class="font-italic">viz</span>, to confirm but not to alter the ordinary meaning as purposively ascertained.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 The court first interprets the statute by deciphering the plain and ordinary meaning of the legislative provision. In <span class="font-italic">Lam Leng Hung</span>, Andrew Phang JA described, at [76], the ordinary meaning of a word or phrase as the “‘proper and most known signification’ … which <span class="font-italic">comes to the reader most naturally</span> by virtue of its <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">regular or conventional usage</span><span class="font-italic"> in the English language</span> and in the light of the <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">linguistic context</span><span class="font-italic"> in which that word or phrase is used</span><span class="font-italic">.</span>” [emphasis in original]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 The court then ascertains the legislative purpose of the provision. This may be discerned from the language used in the provision and from extraneous material where appropriate. In identifying the legislative purpose of the statute, a distinction is to be drawn between the specific purpose of the provision being interpreted and the general purpose underlying the statute as a whole. The court must begin by presuming that the statute is a coherent whole and therefore that the specific purpose is aligned with the general purpose. Thus, individual statutory provisions must be read, as far as possible, consistently with both the specific and general purposes (see <span class="font-italic">Tan Cheng Bock</span> at [40]-[41]; <span class="font-italic">Lam Leng Hung</span> at [69]).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Interpretation of s 56A of the Act </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 It is useful at this juncture to set out again s 56A of the Act. The provision reads: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Liability for offence committed by agent or employee </span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">56A. </span>Where an offence under this Act is committed by any person acting as an agent or employee of another person, or being otherwise subject to the supervision or instruction of another person for the purposes of any employment in the course of which the offence was committed, that other person shall, without prejudice to the liability of the first-mentioned person, be liable for that offence in the same manner and to the same extent as if he had personally committed the offence unless he proves to the satisfaction of the court that the offence was committed without his consent or connivance and that it was not attributable to any neglect on his part. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Precedents </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 I note at the outset that this is the first time that the High Court is being called upon to interpret s 56A of the Act as there is no authority that has previously dealt with this issue since the introduction of the section in 2012. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 In the absence of precedents on the proper interpretation of s 56A of the Act, the Appellant cited the case of <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v </span><span class="font-italic">Khian Heng Construction (Private) Ltd</span> [2012] SGDC 9 (“<span class="font-italic">Khian</span><span class="font-italic"> Heng Construction</span>”) in which s 85(3) of the Electricity Act (Cap 89A, 2002 Rev Ed) (“Electricity Act”) was considered. Section 85(3) of the Electricity Act establishes secondary liability for a s 85(2) offence of damaging any high voltage electricity cable. Section 85(2) reads: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Notwithstanding subsection (1), any person who, in the course of carrying out any earthworks, damages or suffers to be damaged any high voltage electricity cable in the transmission network belonging to or under the management or control of an electricity licensee shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding $1 million or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 5 years or to both.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 Section 85(3) of the Electricity Act reads: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Where an offence under subsection (2) is committed by any person acting as the agent or servant of another person, or being otherwise subject to the supervision or instructions of another person for the purposes of any employment in the course of which the offence was committed, that other person shall, without prejudice to the liability of the first-mentioned person, be liable under that subsection in the same manner and to the same extent as if he had personally committed the offence unless he proves to the satisfaction of the court that the offence was committed without his consent or connivance or that it was not attributable to any neglect on his part. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 The District Court in <span class="font-italic">Khian</span><span class="font-italic"> Heng Construction</span> found that the primary offender that damaged the electricity cable was an independent contractor which had contracted to provide piling services for the defendant. The defendant was the main contractor in the project. Based on the finding that the primary offender was an independent contractor, the District Court rejected the main contractor’s contention that the charge against the main contractor should have been brought under s 85(3) as opposed to s 85(2) (see <span class="font-italic">Khian</span><span class="font-italic"> Heng Construction</span> at [23]). On appeal, the district judge’s conviction of the main contractor under s 85(2) was overturned as the High Court found that the elements of the offence under s 85(2) were not made out (see <span class="font-italic">Khian</span><span class="font-italic"> Heng Construction (Pte) Ltd v Public Prosecutor</span> [2012] 4 SLR 134).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 I was of the view that the analysis in <span class="font-italic">Khian</span><span class="font-italic"> Heng Construction</span> was of limited usefulness to the determination of the present case, since that case concerned the interpretation of a different statute, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the Electricity Act. In addition, while the district judge was of the view that secondary liability under s 85(3) did not extend to a main contractor for an offence carried out by an independent contractor that it had hired, I note that this was not expressly affirmed or rejected by the High Court on appeal as it was not necessary for the disposal of the case. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 In this regard, s 56A of the Act has to be interpreted without the benefit of any previous authority on the appropriate interpretation of the section. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Ordinary meaning of s 56A</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 The Appellant argued that the title of s 56A which reads “Liability for offence committed by agent or employee” lends credence to its submission that secondary liability under s 56A of the Act only applies to two categories of individuals, <span class="font-italic">ie</span><span class="font-italic">,</span> principals and employers.

</div> The Prosecution argued that s 56A extends liability to a third category of individuals which includes main contractors, for offences committed by their subcontractors. This is by virtue of the inclusion of the phrase “or being otherwise subject to the supervision or instruction of another person for the purposes of any employment” under s 56A. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 In the alternative, the Appellant accepted that s 56A extended liability to a third class of persons separate from principals and employers by virtue of the phrase “or being otherwise subject to the supervision or instruction of another person for the purposes of any employment”. However, main contractors were not included under the third category. According to the Appellant, the third category would capture the direct supervisor of the primary offender, who worked for and was employed by the same entity as the primary offender, and who gave instructions to the primary offender. In the present factual matrix, the Appellant argued that the phrase would allow a charge to be brought against the GIS supervisor, <span class="font-italic">ie</span><span class="font-italic">,</span> Gam Shawng who supervised the GIS driller who damaged the Water Main,<span class="font-italic"> </span><span class="font-italic">ie</span>, Parvez Masud.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 It is settled law that marginal notes can be used as an interpretative aid in statutory interpretation (see <span class="font-italic">Tee Soon Kay v </span><span class="font-italic">Attorney-General</span> [2007] 3 SLR(R) 133; <span class="font-italic">Ratnam</span><span class="font-italic"> Alfred Christie v Public Prosecutor</span> [1999] 3 SLR(R) 685; <span class="font-italic">Algemene</span><span class="font-italic"> Bank Nederland NV v Tan Chin Tiong and another</span> [1985-1986] SLR(R) 1154). However, as I noted in <span class="font-italic">Ezion</span><span class="font-italic"> Holdings Ltd v Teras Cargo Transport Pte Ltd</span> [2016] 5 SLR 226 at [18], the title, header or marginal note to a section is not determinative of its contents as it is intended only to summarise the contents of sections for ease of reference and is not always precise or exhaustive. As the Court of Appeal also noted in <span class="font-italic">Tee Soon Kay v </span><span class="font-italic">Attorney-General</span> [2007] 3 SLR(R) 133 (at [41]): </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">While we note that it is now well established that marginal notes can be used as an aid to statutory interpretation, ultimately, the meaning to be given to any statutory provision must be gleaned from <span class="font-italic">the actual statutory language as well as the context. </span>For example, if despite the marginal note of s 8 [of the Pensions Act (Cap 225, 2004 Rev Ed)] itself which reads, “Pensions, etc., not of right”, s 8(1) had gone on to state the direct opposite, for example, that an officer has <span class="font-italic">a</span> right to a pension, the courts would derive little or no help from the marginal note which states the direct opposite of what was said within the provision itself. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis in original] </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 In the present case, I find that the title of the section does not limit the actual statutory language used in the section. It is rather only a broad summary of the contents of the section. In particular, the title of s 56A does not necessitate that s 56A be read as extending liability for offences committed by agents or employees only. One must look beyond the title and consider the wording of the section itself.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 While the title of the section only includes two categories of persons, <span class="font-italic">ie</span> agents and employees, on a plain reading of the text of s 56A, I find that secondary liability under the section extends to an offence committed by three categories of individuals: </div><div class="mb-3"><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(a) a person acting as an agent of the accused (“first limb”); </div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(b) a person acting as an employee of the accused (“second limb”); and </div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(c) a person being otherwise subject to the supervision or instruction of the accused for the purposes of any employment (“third limb”).</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 The first and second limbs extend liability to principals and employers respectively for acts carried out by the primary offender. This is undisputed. Contrary to the submissions of the Appellant as set out at [37] above, I find that the inclusion of the words “or being otherwise subject to the supervision or instruction of another person for the purposes of any employment” extends liability to a third class of individuals, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, to persons who supervise or instruct the primary offender in the context of an employment. That is, it extends liability to personnel of the principals and employers who are interposed between the primary offender and the principals or employers, or the directing mind and will of the latter. It covers managers, foremen and the like. Secondary liability under s 56A can thus be broken down into three categories in the manner shown in the following diagram:</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 It is undisputed that GIS was neither an agent nor an employee of the Appellant and thus neither fell within the first nor the second limb of s 56A. It was not an agent as the Appellant was not vested with the authority to act on behalf of the Appellant <span class="font-italic">vis-à-vis</span> third parties. Likewise, it was undisputed that the nature of the relationship between GIS and the Appellant was not one of employer and employee.

</div> The question that falls to be determined is whether GIS was otherwise subject to the supervision or instruction of the Appellant for the purposes of any employment in the course of which the offence was committed. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 The Prosecution argued that the phrase “for the purposes of any employment” under the third limb should be read broadly to include the performance of a subcontract. There is no need for an employment relationship to exist in the third limb between the accused and the primary offender, as such a requirement would render this limb otiose.

</div>
</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 In my judgment, there is no requirement that the accused must be a direct employer of the primary offender in order to be liable under the third limb. Such a requirement would render the third limb otiose. Where the accused is the employer of the primary offender, liability under s 56A is extended by virtue of the second limb, not the third. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 That said, the third limb does require that the offence committed by the primary offender be committed under the supervision or instruction of the accused for the purpose of any employment. Where the primary offender is the subcontractor of the accused, based on a plain reading, I find that it is not subject to the supervision or instruction of the accused for the purposes of any employment. The subcontractor is liable to the main contractor and receives instructions or supervision from the main contractor, if any, pursuant to the contract of services between the parties. The subcontractor is thus not acting for the purposes of any employment, <span class="font-italic">vis</span><span class="font-italic">-a-vis</span> the main contractor, in performing its obligations under the subcontract. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 I also observe that it was open to Parliament to include the term “subcontractor” in s 56A in order to extend secondary liability to a main contractor for an offence committed by its subcontractor. As that term has not in fact been included and in the light of the plain meaning of the third limb, the court cannot then read in the word “subcontractor” into the statute. The court cannot add or take away from statutory language, which remains the domain of Parliament. As noted by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Lim Meng </span><span class="font-italic">Suang and another v Attorney-General and another appeal and another matter </span>[2015] 1 SLR 26 (at [189]): </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The court <span class="font-italic">cannot</span> – <span class="font-italic">and must not</span> – assume <span class="font-italic">legislative</span> functions which are necessarily beyond its remit. To do so would be to efface the very separation of powers which confers upon the court its <span class="font-italic">legitimacy</span> in the first place. If the court were to assume legislative functions, it would no longer be able to sit to assess the legality of statutes from an <span class="font-italic">objective</span> perspective.

</div>
</div> However, there is no indication from the language used in the provision that the yardstick of control was intended to be determinative of who is subject to liability under s 56A. I am of the view that in enacting s 56A, Parliament did not intend to impose a wider liability based on control as envisaged by the Prosecution, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, on any person acting in a supervisory or controlling capacity in relation to the offender. Instead, in inserting the phrase “for the purposes of any employment”, Parliament intended to limit secondary liability under s 56A to those with a certain proximity to the primary offender by virtue of the nature of the relationship,<span class="font-italic"> </span><span class="font-italic">ie</span>, one which falls within the three limbs, rather than to base secondary liability on the yardstick of control. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 I do not think that by including the third limb of s 56A, Parliament had intended to cover offences carried out by subcontractors. If that was the intention, one would have expected Parliament to have included an explicit reference to subcontractors, especially given that the liability of hirers of independent contractors has generally been excluded under the tortious doctrine of vicarious liability.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Legislative purpose based on extraneous materials </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 As I have noted above, the legislative purpose of a statutory provision may be ascertained not just from the language of the statute, but also from a consideration of relevant extraneous material. Such extraneous material includes official records of Parliamentary debates on the legislative provision. In <span class="font-italic">Tan Cheng Bo</span><span class="font-italic">ck</span>, the Court of Appeal, reaffirming the principles in <span class="font-italic">Ting Choon Meng</span>, summarised three points of consideration in relation to the use of Parliamentary records as an interpretative aid (at [52]): </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(a) The statements made in Parliament must be clear and unequivocal to be of any real use. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(b)  The court should guard against the danger of finding itself construing and interpreting the statements made in Parliament rather than the legislative provision that Parliament has enacted. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(c)  Therefore, the statements in question should disclose the mischief targeted by the enactment or the legislative intention lying behind any ambiguous or obscure words. In other words, the statements should be directed to the very point in question to be especially helpful. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">These principles ensure that only relevant Parliamentary records are considered in ascertaining the legislative purpose of the statute. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 In addition, except in the limited circumstances prescribed under s 9A(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the Interpretation Act, extraneous material is relied on to confirm the ordinary meaning of a legislative provision, rather than to depart from it. Where Parliament’s actual legislative intention differs from that conveyed by the plain meaning of the statute, such legislative intention should be given effect through an express amendment to the wording of the statute rather than through Parliamentary statements suggesting a meaning different from that conveyed by the plain wording.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 In order to construe the legislative intention of s 56A of the Act, the Appellant relied on Parliamentary debates on the introduction of other statutes containing a provision with similar wording to s 56A of the Act, including in particular, the Health Products Act (Cap 122D, 2008 Rev Ed) (“Health Products Act”).

The District Judge was of the view that since the Parliamentary statement showed that under s 76(2A), secondary liability extended to a main contractor for an offence of damaging electrical cables committed by its subcontractor, thus Parliament likewise intended to extend secondary liability to main contractors for offences committed by subcontractors under s 56A of the Act.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 I did not find the Parliamentary statements made in relation to the Health Products Act and what is now s 85(3) of the Electricity Act particularly useful in ascertaining the legislative purpose s 56A of the Act. The court will generally refrain from referring to the Parliamentary statements concerning a particular statute, to construe the legislative objective of another statute. Transposing Parliamentary statements made in relation to one statute to another in such a manner is likely to result in Parliamentary speeches yielding unintended effects. Notwithstanding any similarity in wording, the difference in the background and context in which separate statutes are drafted renders it unhelpful to refer to the extraneous material of one statute to construe the legislative purpose of another. The fact that similar phrases may have been imbued with a particular legislative objective under one statute does not, in the absence of the express adoption of the earlier Parliamentary speeches, translate into a similar objective for a provision under another act. That would give far too much weight to Parliamentary speeches that may have but remote connection to the present statute, and too little weight to the plain words of the provision being scrutinised. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 In this regard, the only potentially relevant extraneous material that needs to be considered in the present case is the explanatory statement to the Public Utilities (Amendment) Bill (No 7 of 2012) which introduced s 56A of the Act. The relevant section of the explanatory statement reads: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Clause 22 inserts a new section 56A to make a principal or an employer liable for an offence committed by his agent or employee, unless the principal or employer proves to the satisfaction of the court that the offence was committed without his consent or connivance and was not attributable to any neglect on his part. This provision previously applied only in relation to section 40 (Licensing of water service worker) and is now applicable generally to all offences under the Act. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 Section 40(5) of the Public Utilities Act 2001 (No 8 of 2001) (“PUA 2001”) which has since been repealed read: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Licensing of water service worker</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(5) Where an offence is committed under this section by any person who is the agent, employee or sub-contractor of another person, that other person shall be liable under this section in the same manner and to the same extent as if he had personally committed the offence unless he proves that the offence was committed without his knowledge and that he exercised all due diligence to prevent the commission of the offence. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 The Prosecution submitted, and the District Judge agreed, that the explanatory statement, read with the repealed s 40(5) of PUA 2001 confirms that s 56A of the Act extends liability for the offences committed by persons other than the accused’s employee or agent including, among others, subcontractors whom the accused had supervised or instructed.

</div> The Appellant on the other hand, argued that the explanatory statement lends credence to its position that the enactment of s 56A of the Act was intended to make only a principal or an employer liable for an offence committed by its agent or employee.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 In my view, the explanatory statement addresses the issue of which offences under the Act attract secondary liability, rather than whom secondary liability extends to. I do not find that the explanation that s 56A is intended to extend the application of what was s 40 to all offences under the Act supports the position that Parliament’s intention was for subcontractors to be subsumed under the third limb of s 56A. In fact, a comparison of the text of s 56A of the Act with the repealed s 40(5) of PUA 2001, reveals that it was in fact open to Parliament, if they had intended secondary liability under s 56A to extend to the same classes of individuals as under s 40(5), to use the same wording as s 40(5), <span class="font-italic">viz</span><span class="font-italic">, </span>“agent, employee or sub-contractor of another person”. The use of different language in s 56A of the Act from s 40(5) of PUA 2001 suggests that in stating that “this provision previously applied only in relation to section 40 (Licensing of water service worker) and is now applicable generally to all offences under the Act”, Parliament was addressing the offences to which secondary liability applies, rather than the persons to whom secondary liability extends. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 Therefore, I am of the view that the explanatory statement is of limited usefulness in determining which classes of individuals Parliament intended secondary liability for offences under the Act to extend to. It neither confirms nor calls into question the ordinary meaning of s 56A. The legislative purpose of s 56A is thus solely to be determined by the language of the statute, which I have found confirms the ordinary meaning.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Application to facts</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 It was undisputed that the Appellant had subcontracted part of its work under the main contract with PUB to GIS through a contract of services. In the performance of its obligations under the contract with the Appellant, GIS – in particular, one of GIS’s employees – had caused the Water Main to be damaged. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 The District Judge found that GIS was a subcontractor of the Appellant but found nevertheless that the Appellant had supervised or instructed GIS for the purpose of employment.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 Based on my views on the proper interpretation of s 56A as outlined above, I am unable to agree with the District Judge’s holding on the liability of the Appellant under s 56A. Based on the statutory interpretation as outlined above, neither GIS nor the driller employed by GIS, Parvez Masud, were instructed or supervised by the Appellant for the purposes of employment. Accordingly, I find that the Appellant is not liable under s 56A read with s 47A(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the Act.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 Since liability does not extend to the Appellant under s 56A, there is no need to consider whether the Appellant would be able to, though <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> liable, “[prove] to the satisfaction of the court that the offence was committed without his consent or connivance and that it was not attributable to any neglect on his part”. Based on the wording of the statute, the existence of consent, connivance or neglect on the part of the accused is not an alternative ground to the three limbs to found liability. Instead, in order for a charge under s 56A to be established, it must be established that the accused falls within one of the categories of persons caught under s 56A, <span class="font-italic">and</span> the accused must be unable to prove the statutory defence. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68  Therefore, even if the offence was committed by GIS with the consent or connivance of the Appellant, or attributable to the neglect of the Appellant, the Appellant cannot be found to be liable under s 56A because it was not supervising or instructing GIS for the purposes of employment.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 For the reasons set out above, I allow the appeal on conviction and acquit the Appellant of the charge.
