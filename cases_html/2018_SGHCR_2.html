The Defendant, who was travelling in the opposite direction, made a right turn at the intersection and collided with the side of the Plaintiff’s motorcycle, causing her to fall. Immediately after the accident, the Plaintiff was conveyed to Changi General Hospital where she was hospitalised for 1.5 months.

At the close of the hearing, Mr Hassan Esa Almenoar (“Mr Almenoar”), counsel for the Defendant, sought leave to put in further evidence on the cost of corrective surgery (see items 2.1 and 2.2 of the table). I declined to give leave at that stage because it was not clear whether the additional evidence would be forthcoming, or what form the evidence would take. Instead, I granted the Defendant liberty to apply for further directions once it became clear what evidence his client intended to adduce. However, no such application was made.

As the Court of Appeal said in <span class="font-italic">ACB v Thomson Medical</span><span class="font-italic"> Pte Ltd </span>[2017] 1 SLR 918, the quantification of damages for intangible injuries – such as pain and suffering – is an exercise that is fraught with difficulty, for it involves the ascription of a “monetary value to matters which do not lend themselves easily to pecuniary expression” (at [137]). I bear this well in mind. I bear in mind, also, that the “sensible way forward” in the assessment of damages for pain and suffering is to use the awards made in precedent cases as guides, but to remember that each case turns on its own particular facts (see <span class="font-italic">Tan Siew Bin Ronnie v Chin Wee Keong </span>[2008] 1 SLR(R) 178 (“<span class="font-italic">Ronnie Tan</span>”) at [11]). This is particularly important here because many of the precedents cited were unreported cases in respect of which no detailed grounds were issued. As has been said in a different context, unreported cases – while useful in giving a sense of the broad range of possible awards – should be treated with caution. Even when the facts of these unreported cases are summarised in a digest, there is simply not enough particularity to allow intelligent comparisons to be made (see <span class="font-italic">Luong Thi Trang Kathleen v P</span><span class="font-italic">ublic Prosecutor </span>[2010] 1 SLR 707 at [21]). For these reasons, I do not propose to discuss all of the cases cited by the parties (although I have considered all of them carefully), but will confine myself only to those which I consider to be the most germane.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Right 2nd toe distal phalanx amputation</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">10  In justifying his client’s claim for $18,000 for this head of loss, Mr Thiruchelvan (“Mr Thiru”), counsel for the Plaintiff, relied chiefly on the recent decision of the Singapore High Court in <span class="font-italic">Tan Shi Lin v Poh Che Thiam </span>[2017] SGHC 219 (“<span class="font-italic">Tan Shi Lin</span>”), which also concerned the assessment of damages following a road accident. In that case, the plaintiff claimed damages for, among other things, the full amputation of her big toe and the partial amputation of her second toe. Relying on the guidelines set out in <span class="font-italic">Guidelines for the Assessment of General Damages in Personal Injury Cases</span> (Academy Publishing, 2010) (“<span class="font-italic">Guidelines for the Assessment of General Damages</span>”), the court awarded damages of $30,000 for the complete amputation of the big toe and $25,000 for the partial amputation of the second toe (at [31] and [34]). In the light of this, Mr Thiru submits that the sum of $18,000 claimed by the Plaintiff is “very reasonable”.

In that case, the plaintiff was a motorcyclist whose left foot was run over by a bus driven by the defendant, causing her to suffer from severe crush injuries. The plaintiff then brought both a general claim for pain and suffering arising from the crush injury to her left foot <span class="font-italic">as well as</span> distinct claims for the amputations of her toes. In that section of the judgment referred to by Mr Almenoar, the court was considering whether the plaintiff was <span class="font-italic">entitled</span> to a separate award of damages for the amputations <span class="font-italic">on top of </span>the award of $90,000 for pain and suffering which it had already awarded for the crush injury. It was in relation to that specific issue that Lai Siu Chiu SJ made reference to the particular disabilities occasioned by the amputations (and the extent to which the plaintiff’s daily activities had been curtailed) and held that the general award made in respect of the crush injury would be inadequate and that separate awards were required.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">12 Read fairly and in context, it is clear that the sum of $25,000 awarded for pain and suffering for the partial amputation in <span class="font-italic">Tan Shi Lin</span> was not in any way exceptional or contingent on proof of special disability. Instead, Lai SJ had relied on <span class="font-italic">general </span>guidelines (chiefly, the range provided in the <span class="font-italic">Guidelines for the Assessment of General Damages </span>which provides for a range of between $15,000 and $25,000 for “severe toe injuries” like partial amputations) in arriving at the figure of $25,000. Against this background, and having regard to the other cases cited, it seems to me that the sum of $18,000 claimed by the Plaintiff here is reasonable, and I so order. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Right 5th metatarsal shaft fracture</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">13 In submitting for an award of $8000 for this head of loss, Mr Thiru relies chiefly on the <span class="font-italic">Guidelines for the Assessment of General Damages</span>, which prescribes a range of $2000 – $8000 for metatarsal fractures (at p 55), as well as the 1998 decision of the Singapore High Court in <span class="font-italic">Aw Ang Moh v OCWS Logistics Pte Ltd </span>[1998] SGHC 167 (“<span class="font-italic">Aw Ang Moh</span>”), where a sum of $8000 was awarded as compensation for the fracture of two metatarsals.

That figure lies at the very highest end of the range provided in the <span class="font-italic">Guidelines for the Assessment of General Damages</span>, which applies to cases involving multiple fractures, and there is nothing on the facts that suggests that the single fracture in this case is so grievous that it warrants an exceptional award. I accept Mr Almenoar’s argument that a discount should be applied to the figures in the precedent cases on account of the fact that those awards were made in relation to cases where there were multiple fractures. However, I do not accept – as Mr Almenoar’s submission assumes – that there is a linear relationship between the number of fractures and the quantum of the award, such that it would be appropriate simply to divide the figures in the past cases to derive an award for this case. Having regard to the precedents, and bearing in mind that those cases were decided more than 20 years ago and an upward adjustment should be made to account for inflation (see <span class="font-italic">Ronnie Tan</span> at [18]), I consider that an award of $4,500 would be appropriate in this case.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Right 5th metacarpal fracture</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">15 To justify his submission that a sum of $5,000 be awarded for this head of loss, Mr Thiru relies on the case of <span class="font-italic">Shao Hai v Cao Yong Hui and others </span>[2003] SGDC 181 (“<span class="font-italic">Shao Hai</span>”), where the plaintiff was awarded a global sum of $8,500 for pain and suffering for a multitude of injuries to his hand (which included, among other things, a fracture of the 5th metacarpus, a shortening of his left little finger, and soft tissue injury) following an industrial accident.

From my review of the digests of the cases in Carrie Chan <span class="font-italic">et al</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span><span class="font-italic">Practitioner’s Library – Assessment of Damages: Personal Injuries and Fatal Accidents </span>(LexisNexis, 3rd Ed, 2017) (“<span class="font-italic">Assessment of Damages</span>”), it appears that sums between $3000 (see <span class="font-italic">Wong Kwok Keong v Zee Lee Sieh (administratix of the estate of Khong Yung Yew Aloysius, deceased) and another </span>(Unreported, High Court Suit No 913 of 1999) and $7000 (see <span class="font-italic">Wu Xue Liang v Wyndham Construction (Pte) Ltd </span>(Unreported, District Court Suit No 4789 of 2002)<span class="font-italic"> </span>(“<span class="font-italic">Wu Xue Liang</span>”)) have been awarded for single metacarpal fractures. Having regard to these precedents, and bearing in mind that a higher award was made in <span class="font-italic">Wu Xue Liang </span>to account for the possibility of osteoarthritis, I consider that $4,500 would be a fair award, and I so order. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Right knee and right thigh laceration</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">17 In respect of this claim, Mr Thiru relies on <span class="font-italic">Yip Kok Meng Calvin (a minor) v Lek Yong Han (Yip Ai Puay, third party)</span> [1993] SGHC 21 and <span class="font-italic">Ting Heng Mee v Sin Sheng Fresh Fruits </span>[2004] SGHC 43, where sums of $8000 and $7000, respectively, were awarded, to support his submission that damages be assessed in the sum of $5000. However, I agree with Mr Almenoar that both cases are readily distinguishable. In the former, the plaintiff did not suffer any knee lacerations (he suffered, instead, from fractures and abrasions); in the latter, a <span class="font-italic">global award </span>of $7000 was made for a <span class="font-italic">multitude </span>of injuries.

I do not think that an award at the lowest end of the scale is appropriate, given that the Plaintiff had suffered not one, but two lacerations to different parts of her leg. Taking into account the various precedents cited by Mr Almenoar (where awards of between $1,000 and $1,800 were granted per laceration), I consider that an award of $3,500 would be fair. This is broadly consistent with <span class="font-italic">Koh Chwee Seng (next friend of Koh Chee Kheng) v Chew Thong Huat </span>(Unreported, District Court Suit No 1 of 1988), where the plaintiff was awarded $3000 for two knee lacerations.

Dr Seah referred to this injury as the “large scooped out scar”, and described it as “ugly and in a conspicuous part of her body which is normally exposed”. The surface of the scar is discoloured and wrinkled, and it is clear – even from a cursory review of the photos which were annexed to Dr Seah’s report – that her right leg is visibly different from her left because of the obvious lack of tissue beneath the surface of the scar. Dr Seah also noted that the Plaintiff’s right knee was only covered by a skin layer of skin that was prone to breaking.

</div> During the hearing, he elaborated at length on what this entailed. He explained that a minimum of two surgeries, and possibly three, would be required. During the first surgery, which he described as a “technically challenging operation” that would last for about 10–12 hours and can only be performed with the assistance of another plastic surgeon, a “DIEP [deep inferior epigastric perforator] flap” would be created to transfer skin and fat from the lower abdomen to the knee to improve soft tissue padding, as well as the function and appearance of her leg.

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> This suggestion was vigorously refuted by Dr Seah, who explained that the principal difference between cosmetic surgery and reconstructive surgery – which was what he said this was – is that the object of cosmetic surgery is the enhancement of a person’s <span class="font-italic">appearance</span>, while the goal of reconstructive surgery is the <span class="font-italic">restoration of normal function</span>, which has been lost as a result of defects or deformities. Dr Seah’s evidence was that the “scar” in question was properly classed as a “deformity” that was of such severity that “any plastic surgeon” would classify it as posing a reconstructive problem that ought to be addressed.

</div>
</div> In short, the purport of Dr Seah’s evidence is that the proposed surgery was not elective and cosmetic, but necessary and therapeutic. The Defendant did not call any witnesses of his own to offer a contrary view, and there is therefore nothing to controvert Dr Seah’s evidence, which I accept without reservation. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 In any event, Mr Almenoar no longer pursues this line of argument in his submissions. Instead, he advances two other arguments in contending that the Plaintiff’s claim should be dismissed in its entirety. First, he submits that the Plaintiff’s claim is a “mere afterthought and should be disallowed”, as she “never mentioned nor claimed … during the trial on liability that she had … an intention” to seek corrective surgery for her scars. He argues that the Plaintiff should at least have obtained an initial estimate before the trial on liability instead of “ambushing” the defendant with this claim at the assessment stage.

</div>
</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 I cannot agree with either of these arguments. As a starting point, it is important to recall that the trial in the State Courts was on the issue of <span class="font-italic">liability </span>alone (see the State Courts GD at [2]). I cannot see – and Mr Almenoar did not explain the basis for this submission – why the Plaintiff would have an obligation to inform the Defendant in advance of the heads of loss she would seek to recover at the<span class="font-italic"> assessment of damages </span>stage (let alone why she was required to obtain an “initial estimate” of the cost of the surgery), even before judgment had been granted in her favour. This case is to be distinguished from one in which interlocutory judgment is entered <span class="font-italic">by consent </span>between the parties on terms that an assessment would be carried out in respect of certain agreed heads of damages. In such a case, there might be scope for arguing that the non-disclosure of a head of claim constitutes an actionable misrepresentation of a sort that would justify the setting aside of the consent judgment. However, there is none of that here, for this matter was contested from the outset.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 Insofar as the law is concerned, the position appears to me to be clear. The general rule is that a claimant is entitled to damages for all medical expenses reasonably incurred as a result of the injury (see <span class="font-italic">Ng Chee Wan v Tan Chin Seng </span>[2013] SGHC 54 (“<span class="font-italic">Ng Chee Wan</span>”) at [13]). It does not matter, for this purpose, whether the expenses have already been incurred at the time of assessment or whether they are prospective (save only that the former must be pleaded as special damages; the latter as general damages): see Harvey McGregor, <span class="font-italic">McGregor on Damages</span> (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 19th Ed, 2014) (“<span class="font-italic">McGregor</span>”) at para 38-181. Thus, it seems to me that it was perfectly open for the Plaintiff to have decided, as she did in this case, to have waited before consulting a plastic surgeon to discuss possible treatment options. In fact, the evidence is that this was a medically reasonable course of action. During the hearing, Dr Seah explained that scars need some time to “mature”, so he would not have been able to do anything if the Plaintiff had come to see him one year after the accident. He said that by the time he saw her in 2016 (which was about five years after the incident), the scar had stabilised, he was then able to properly assess the treatment options available to her.

At the outset, I would reject Mr Almenoar’s submission that the Plaintiff’s failure to seek a second opinion must – without more – entail the wholesale rejection of her claim. While it is true that Dr Seah had advised that the Plaintiff seek a second opinion, he never said that the validity of his opinion was contingent on her doing so. Dr Seah explained during the hearing that he had advised the Plaintiff to seek a second opinion to explore the full range of treatment options available to her (because different surgeons might have “slightly different opinion[s]”); but he never suggested that his opinion “cannot … be relied upon” if a second opinion were not sought.

On this, the evidence would appear to be as follows. First, it is not disputed that the scars were the direct result of the accident. Second, it is also not disputed that the scars have affected the Plaintiff’s quality of life (see [20] above). Third, the Defendant does not now challenge – and in any event I have found in favour of the Plaintiff on this point – that the contemplated surgery is a therapeutic treatment that is aimed at restoring the Plaintiff to the state she was in before the accident. In conclusion, therefore, it seems to me that it is entirely reasonable for the Plaintiff to elect for corrective surgery and the only point that the Defendant can take issue with is the <span class="font-italic">quantum </span>of the award. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 But therein lies the rub.

</div> This may well be so, but even if it was not possible for the Defendant to have procured a second opinion, there were other things he could have done. For instance, he could have adduced some<span class="font-italic"> </span>evidence on the cost of corrective surgery at a public hospital (perhaps from publicly available sources), whether in the form of general fee guidelines or otherwise. Or even if such information was not readily available, it would have been open for the Defendant to submit the report prepared by Dr Seah to another doctor for an evaluation and assessment. Neither of these alternatives would have been ideal, but they would at least have provided the court with some basis for assessing the reasonableness of the figures put forward by Dr Seah. As matters stand, Dr Seah’s evidence is all that the court has to go on.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 Turning to the subject of the sum to be awarded, Dr Seah’s evidence is that a minimum of $130,000 would be required because at least two surgeries will have to be performed; and that this figure would rise to $180,000 if three surgeries are needed (see [25] above). However, he did not explain when a third surgery would be required, nor did he explain why a third surgery might be required if provision was already going to be made for additional work to be done in the form of the 15% contingency fee he proposed. I therefore assess the damages on the basis that two surgeries will be performed, but I am willing to go with the suggestion that a 15% contingency fee be added to this in the event that further work is necessary. In the premises, I award the Plaintiff $150,000 (which is approximately 115% of 130,000) for this head of claim. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Treatment for hepatitis C</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 Dr Tan, who was the only expert who took the stand to give evidence on this claim during the trial, explained that Hepatitis C is a blood borne viral infectious disease which affects the liver and may be transmitted through the sharing of needles, sexual contact, or through exposure to contaminated blood products or bodily fluids.

</div> This is a considerable period of time, and the Plaintiff has not adduced any direct evidence linking the transfusions (which took place over 4 days in 2011) with the Plaintiff’s contraction of Hepatitis C. The second difficulty is the multiplicity of possible causes. It is undisputed that Hepatitis C can be transmitted through various means and – critically – the Plaintiff works as a nurse and might have contracted it due to a workplace accident.

</div> While the Plaintiff has sought to address this through her evidence on the incident reporting system and the general precautions taken to prevent the spread of infection in the hospital, she has not led any evidence of the relative risks of contracting Hepatitis C from a contaminated blood transfusion as against other possible sources of infection. The third difficulty is state of the evidence. During the hearing, Dr Tan was asked about the likelihood that the Plaintiff had contracted Hepatitis C on account of the blood transfusions she had received, but expressly declined to express any view:

In my judgment, as matters stand, the Plaintiff only shown that there is a<span class="font-italic"> possibility </span>that she had contracted Hepatitis C as a result of the transfusions; but she has fallen short of showing on a balance of <span class="font-italic">probabilities </span>that this was so.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 The case of <span class="font-italic">Surender Singh s/</span><span class="font-italic">o Jagdish Singh and another v Li Man Kay and others </span>[2010] 1 SLR 428, which Mr Thiru cited in argument, is readily distinguishable. In that case, a patient underwent a surgical procedure during which her left renal artery was secured through the use of a surgical clip. After the surgery, the surgical clips used to secure her left renal artery slipped, and she lost 1600ml of blood before passing away. One of the issues which had to be decided by the court was whether the patient had passed away due to post-operative blood loss, as the plaintiff contended, or whether she had passed away due to an unrelated underlying medical condition (small vessel artery disease), as the defendant contended. In that case, the court was aided by a great deal of evidence, in the form of the testimony of three medical experts as well as citations from relevant medical literature, that compared the risk of exsanguination from the loss of 1,600ml of blood against the risk of death from small vessel artery disease. In particular, the court placed considerable reliance on a report prepared by a forensic pathologist, who was aware of the two possible causes of death and gave detailed and cogent reasons for concluding that the patient had passed away due to blood loss.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 By contrast, the present case does not involve a binary choice between two possible causes nor is there that temporal proximity between cause and effect that there was in <span class="font-italic">Surender Singh.</span>  As I have noted above, there is no direct evidence linking the transfusions with the Plaintiff’s contraction of Hepatitis C nor do I think that the Plaintiff has gone far enough to establish this link by a process of elimination. The Plaintiff’s evidence on the precautionary measures taken in the hospital comes the closest, but, alone, it is not enough.  In order for her to make something of this, she would have to lead evidence on the comparative risks of contracting Hepatitis C from the various sources (<span class="font-italic">eg</span>, the<span class="font-italic"> </span>ambient risk of contracting Hepatitis C for the general population; the occupational risk of contracting Hepatitis C faced by the Plaintiff as a nurse; and the specific risk of contracting Hepatitis C from contaminated blood transfusions as a patient) to show that it was more likely than not that the transfusions were to blame. In saying this, I do not meant to suggest that the Plaintiff has to rule out all the other possibilities. However, it is the Plaintiff burden to show – on a balance of probabilities – that she had contracted Hepatitis C on account of the blood transfusions and in my assessment, she has not crossed the requisite evidential threshold. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 For the foregoing reasons, I dismiss the Plaintiff’s claim for the cost of Hepatitis C treatment. Given this, I do not need to go further to consider the Defendant’s alternative submissions that: (a) that the contraction of Hepatitis C from a tainted blood transfusion is damage of a sort that is too remote to be recoverable and (b) if the Plaintiff had indeed contracted Hepatitis C as a result of the transfusions, the medical treatment administered by the hospital must have been so grossly negligent as to constitute a <span class="font-italic">novus actus interveniens</span>.

In <span class="font-italic">Tan Yu Min Winston (by his next friend Tan Cheng Tong) v Uni-Fruitveg Pte Ltd </span>[2008] 4 SLR(R) 825 at [44], the High Court held that in order for one to succeed in a claim for loss of earning capacity, the risk of loss of employment “must be real and substantial, not speculative or fanciful”. In my assessment, the Plaintiff’s evidence falls far short of this standard.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 On the facts of the present case, it does not appear that the Plaintiff faces any risk of losing her job. In fact, it seems to me that the evidence is quite the opposite. Before the accident, the Plaintiff was a staff nurse who drew a base monthly salary of $1,763. On 1 July 2017, shortly before the hearing, she was promoted to a senior staff nurse, a position with a base monthly salary of $3,792.

In the short run, it seems to me to be clear that she is at no risk of losing her job, for she was just promoted, and there is no evidence to suggest that her employment will be terminated soon. In the medium to long run, the evidence appears to be that the Plaintiff – who has continued to improve herself – will have little trouble retaining her job. This is quite unlike the case of <span class="font-italic">Winston Tan</span>, where the injuries were severe enough that the disabilities caused by the accident caused the plaintiff to face a real risk of losing his job, his avowed desire to succeed notwithstanding. Thankfully, it seems that the injuries in this case are minor enough and the Plaintiff’s will to succeed great enough that the accident has not had any appreciable impact on her career. It is also unlike <span class="font-italic">Samuel Chai</span>, where the plaintiff – who was engaged in part-time employment as a physiotherapist and was paid hourly rates – was in a far more precarious employment situation (at [37]). By contrast, the Plaintiff is presently in stable employment, and her evidence is that her employer has mapped out career paths for nurses such as herself, and she appears for all intents and purposes to have hit the milestones that she is expected to have hit at this stage.

Thus, in order to put the other side on notice of the case it has to meet, a plaintiff in an action for personal injuries is statutorily required to serve, with his statement of claim, a statement of the special damages claimed (see O 18 rr 12(1A) and 12(1C) of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2014 Rev Ed). In the ordinary case, a plaintiff will not be entitled to recover special damages which he has failed to plead, unless no prejudice has thereby been occasioned to the other side (see <span class="font-italic">Lee Mui Yeng </span>at [66], citing <span class="font-italic">Ng Bee Lian v Fernandez and another </span>[1994] 2 SLR(R) 179 at [30]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 In the statement of special damages which she annexed to her statement of claim, the Plaintiff identified eight distinct heads of loss.

First, I have omitted all amounts which were fully paid by the Plaintiff’s employer, because it is settled law that expenses which are paid for by a third party which the plaintiff is under no obligation to repay are not recoverable (see <span class="font-italic">Mukhtiar Singh v Balwyndarjeet Singh </span>[1993] 2 SLR(R) 694 at [52] and <span class="font-italic">McGregor </span>at para 38-187). There is no evidence that the Plaintiff has to repay her employer for any of the sums which it paid on her behalf (which, I should add, are considerable), so she cannot mount a claim for them. Second, I have included all amounts paid out of the Plaintiff’s Medisave account because the money in there – being part of her Central Provident Fund account – is hers, and she is fully entitled to recover all sums paid out of it (see, <span class="font-italic">eg</span>, <span class="font-italic">Mark Amaraganthan Selvaganthan v Cheung Man Wai </span>[2015] SGHC 253 at [60]–[62]). Third, I have also included the amounts paid by Medishield because the Plaintiff is bound to pay over the sum of $5559.98 she recovers from the Defendant to the Medishield Fund. In this regard, reg 15(1) of the Medishield Life Scheme Regulations 2015 (S 622/2015) provides as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Reimbursement by another person</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">15.—(1) Where —</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(a) an insured person’s claim under the Scheme in respect of any approved medical treatment or services received by the insured person has been paid from the Fund; and</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(b) another person, who is under an obligation (contractual or otherwise) to pay or reimburse the insured person for charges incurred in respect of the approved medical treatment or services, has made the payment or reimbursement, </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">an amount computed in accordance with the following formula becomes due and payable to the Fund by the insured person on the date such payment or reimbursement is made by that other person:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-center">X + Y – Z,</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">where X is the total amount of the payment or reimbursement made by that other person;</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Y is the total amount of the claim paid from the Fund under the Scheme; and</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Z is the total amount of the charges incurred by the insured person.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 In summary, a beneficiary under the Medishield Life Scheme who obtains compensation from a third party in respect of any medical expenses which were paid for by Medishield is statutorily obligated to reimburse the Medishield Life Fund. While the Medishield Life Scheme Act 2015 (Act 4 of 2015) had yet to be passed at the time of the accident, this makes no difference, because the same obligation of reimbursement applied under the old Medishield Scheme (see reg 57 of the Central Provident Fund (Medishield Scheme) Regulations (Cap 36, Rg 20) and <span class="font-italic">Ong Bin Wah v Quek Teng Pong and Another </span>[2003] SGHC 279 at [20]–[22]). I therefore award the Plaintiff the sum of $22,760 for this head of claim.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Transport expenses</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 The Plaintiff claims $193.10 for transport expenses incurred in the immediate aftermath of the accident, when she had to make her way to and from the hospital. Her evidence consisted of two printed pages of taxi receipts which were reproduced at pages 172 and 173 of her bundle of documents.

</div> In principle, she should be entitled to recover all travelling expenses that arise out of the accident. However, the amounts in these receipts (and I note that there is one duplicate receipt for $8.10, which may be found at page 172) do not add up to $193.10, but only to $115.20, which is the sum I award for this head of claim.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Repair of motorcycle</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 In support of her claim for this head of claim, the Plaintiff referred to a surveyor’s report dated 15 October 2011 in which the costs of repairing her motorcycle were assessed to be $2,900.

</div> However, there is no evidence that any repairs were carried out as no invoice or written documentation of any kind was tendered to prove this fact. When she was questioned on this, the Plaintiff testified that she had sold her motorcycle for approximately $3400 after the accident, and she was not sure if any repairs had been carried out before the sale.
