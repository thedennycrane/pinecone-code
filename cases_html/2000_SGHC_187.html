<strong>JUDGMENT:</strong>
</font>
</p>
<p xmlns=""><font color="#804040" face="Times New Roman" size="3"><strong>Grounds of Judgment</strong></font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">1. This is a claim for accounts under an

agreement for the employment of the plaintiff ("Mr Tay") by the defendant

("Kah Motor Co" or "Company"). On 8 March 2000 I intimated that there

would be judgment for Mr Tay and that I would see counsel in Chambers as to the reliefs

claimed. I subsequently heard further arguments and on 22 May 2000 gave judgment for Mr

Tay for certain accounts to be taken. Kah Motor Co has given notice of appeal and these

are my written grounds.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">2. Kah Motor Co is a Malaysian company

which carries on in Singapore the business of dealing in cars. It is the local distributor

of Honda cars. As its general manager Ms Tan Kheng Hwee said in her first affidavit some

time in mid 1996 it decided to start a trade-in/used car department to promote the sales

of new Honda cars by providing an in-house trade-in service for used Honda cars for its

customers. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">3. Mr Tay was employed by the Company in

1979 as one of its sales representatives. He remained in that position until July 1996.

For the period 1991 to July 1996 his remuneration comprised a fixed monthly salary of $200

and a commission in respect of cars sold through him. He also received an annual bonus at

the discretion of the Company. In all he earned about $29,000 a year in that period

working for Kah Motor Co. He said under cross-examination that in addition he received a

commission from finance companies and insurers and also from used car dealers for business

he introduced to them. He said that he earned about $100,000 a year from these outside

sources in the same period.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">4. On or about 8 July 1996 Ms Tan spoke to

him. She told him that Kah Motor Co intended to set up a used car department and that she

required someone to run it. She asked if he was interested. This was not totally

unexpected by Mr Tay. About a month earlier he had learned about Ms Tan’s plans from

Mr Say the assistant marketing manager and that Mr Say would recommend him to Ms Tan as

the person to take charge of the used car department.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">5. Mr Tay said in his second affidavit

that he initially refused to be recommended for the position because among other reasons

he would be "depriving the Company’s sales representatives of the income that

they received as commissions and kickbacks from dealers" but I think he was more

concerned about his own loss of income. I have no reason to doubt that he was earning

about $100,000 a year from these outside sources as he said and all this could be lost on

the setting up of a used car department and his promotion. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">6. Mr Tay must have expressed some

interest though as he was further interviewed by Ms Tan on more than one occasion. He said

in his second affidavit that it was on the occasion of one of these interviews on or about

11 July 1996 that he was told by Ms Tan that he would be promoted to the position of

senior executive in the used car department. He said he was also told that he would be

receiving a fixed monthly salary of $3,000 and in addition certain benefits under a

"profit sharing scheme" and a "sales volume incentive scheme" and a

year end performance bonus. He did not say when he was to start work as a senior executive

but he continued to turn up for work and on an occasion a few days later he was directed

by Ms Tan to check the prices of used Honda cars.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">7. It is not disputed that Mr Tay was

promoted. By letter dated 1 August 1996 Kah Motor Co said that with immediate effect he

was promoted to the position of senior executive in the trade-in department reporting

directly to Ms Tan. The expressions "trade-in department" and "used car

department" or "used car division" have been used by the parties

interchangeably and I shall refer to it as "UCD" for convenience. Mr Tay said

that he received this letter in the beginning of the fourth week of July 1996. Nothing

turns on the precise date when he received it except that it was given to him quite close

to the date of the letter if not on the day itself. The letter mentions the fixed monthly

salary of $3,000 and the year end performance bonus but is silent as regards either of the

two schemes. $3,000 a month or $36,000 a year would be substantially less than what he was

receiving or had received from the outside sources alone.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">8. On 7 August 1996 Mr Tay saw Ms Tan on

two occasions. The first was in the morning and the second in the early evening. On the

first occasion Ms Tan produced a memorandum which was in two pages. "KH Tan 7 Aug

96" was printed at the top of each page. Ms Tan said under cross-examination that she

did not hand this to Mr Tay. She had it on the table when she saw him and he must have

taken it. She said she did not give him permission to do so but if he had asked she would

have.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">9. The memorandum is an agreed document.

Ms Tan was the author. Her name and the date of the memorandum are printed on it. It sets

out details of a profit sharing scheme. She produced it at the interview. The scheme was

what she said she discussed with Mr Tay. Mr Tay said it was given to him but the scheme

was not discussed apart from his saying that it had to be revised. I think it was intended

to be delivered to Mr Tay and it was in fact taken by him. It does not matter how it was

delivered to him. It was clearly a memorandum from Ms Tan to him.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">10. On the second occasion in the early

evening the same day when Mr Tay saw Ms Tan she produced another memorandum. I shall refer

to this as the "second memorandum" and the document delivered earlier as the

"first memorandum". The second memorandum was in five pages and again "KH

Tan 7 Aug 96" was printed at the top of each page. It is also an agreed document. It

deals with the profit sharing scheme but in greater detail than the first memorandum and

in addition it also deals with the sales volume incentive scheme. Ms Tan said under

cross-examination that Mr Tay "must have taken it" at the end of the interview

and that she did not "specifically" give him permission to do so. I think it was

intended to be delivered to Mr Tay and it was in fact taken by him and it was clearly a

memorandum from Ms Tan to Mr Tay. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">11. The UCD was set up in due course and

by late August or early September 1996 it had put through the first of the transactions in

the new business. What the Company did in this business was to buy a used Honda car from a

customer at a price that was attractive to him and at the same time sell him a new Honda

car. The Company would then sell the used car to a used car dealer or another customer. Mr

Tay continued to be employed as the senior sales executive in the UCD and he was paid his

increased monthly salary of $3,000 but only until December 1996. From January 1997 he was

promoted to assistant manager of the UCD with a further increase in his monthly salary to

$3,300. He was also paid his benefits under the sales volume incentive scheme but only

until December 1996. He was not paid anything at all under the profit sharing scheme.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">12. On 4 February 1999 Kah Motor Co gave

Mr Tay a letter terminating his employment. He was given a month’s salary in lieu of

notice. No reasons were given for the termination. He instructed solicitors and not having

received any satisfactory response to his demands he commenced this action.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">13. When Mr De Souza opened the case for

Mr Tay para 3 of the statement of claim alleged that it was orally agreed between Mr Tay

and Ms Tan for Kah Motor Co that Mr Tay would be paid under two incentive schemes:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">(a) sales volume incentive scheme under

  which he would be paid $40 for each new car sold over and above 140 new cars each month;</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">(b) profit sharing scheme under which he

  would be paid certain percentages of "over-trade savings" the percentage varying

  with the number of new cars sold each quarter;</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">and that the agreement was contained in

the second memorandum. Particulars of the over-trade savings were given. It was also

alleged that the oral agreement was made on or about 11 July 1996. At the close of the

case I allowed an amendment to allege in the alternative that the oral agreement was made

on or about 7 August 1996.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">14. In its defence Kah Motor Co denies

that any agreement was made on or about 11 July 1996 to pay Mr Tay under the sales volume

incentive scheme or the profit sharing scheme as alleged. As regards the sales volume

incentive scheme it says that this was only discussed between Mr Tay and Ms Tan on or

about 7 August 1996 and "was subsequently implemented" in respect of the period

August to December 1996. Mr Low said that the Company’s case was that there was a

contract for Mr Tay to be paid in accordance with the sales volume incentive scheme and

that such scheme was only for the period ended 31 December 1996 and that the contract was

orally made between Mr Tay and Ms Tan on or about 12 August 1996. As regards the profit

sharing scheme Kah Motor Co says that on 7 August 1996 Ms Tan had only "raised the

possibility of introducing that scheme" in her discussion with Mr Tay. It says in the

alternative that the scheme as alleged was unenforceable as its terms were "too

uncertain". Finally it is alleged that "[Mr Tay] is estopped from relying on the

alleged breach by reason of his waiver thereof in continuing in his employment with [Kah

Motor Co] without demanding performance of the alleged agreement".</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><i><b> </b></i></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">Agreement</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">15. Mr Tay said in his second affidavit:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">"24. On or about 11 July 1996, Ms Tan

  called me to her office at Ubi Centre. She told me that I would be promoted to the

  position of senior executive in the UCD. She further told me as follows:-</font></p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">24.1 I would receive the following

    remuneration:-</font></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">(a) a basic salary of $3,000 per month;</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">(b) $40 for each new car sold by the

      Company and registered with the Land Transport Authority (‘LTA’) in excess of

      140 cars a month;</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">(c) a percentage of the over-trade

      allowance that I would manage in my discretion and which were not utilised;</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">(d) year end performance bonus.</font></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">25. Ms Tan also said that if the

  remuneration that I would be receiving was ‘not enough’, she would look into

  other ways to remunerate me. I told her that I was already receiving a lot and did not

  need anything more. I also said that my English was not good and I would appreciate it if

  she could put in writing the remuneration that I would be receiving. She said she would do

  so."</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">He produced his diary which had an entry

for 11 July 1996 with a brief record of his having seen Ms Tan that day. He did not say

what Ms Tan said as regards the "over-trade allowance" or the

"percentage" or how his remuneration would be ascertained in this respect.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">16. Under cross-examination Mr Tay said:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">"Q: Tay (2). Para 24. As of 11/7/96

  defendant’s plan for UCD at very preliminary stage?<br/>

  A: Yes</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Q: 11/7/96. Discussions between you and Ms

  Tan concerning your remuneration also in preliminary stage? Discussions on or about

  11/7/96?<br/>

  A: Yes. Still in initial stage.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">….</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Q: Tay (2). Para 29. AT-4. Ms Tan handed

  to you?<br/>

  A: Yes.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Q: Draft?<br/>

  A: Should be because not in detail. Only stated over-trade amount in respect of Honda

  Civic."</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">AT-4 is the first memorandum dated 7

August 1996.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">17. Ms Tan did not say in any of her

affidavits if she interviewed Mr Tay on or about 11 July 1996 or what transpired between

them if she did but under cross-examination she said that prior to 7 August 1996 she had

not discussed any "incentives" with him and had only discussed his salary. By

"incentives" she said she meant the sales volume incentive scheme and the profit

sharing scheme as described in the second memorandum.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">18. I think Ms Tan did see Mr Tay on 11

July 1996 and I think incentives were mentioned. Mr Tay knew that his income from the

outside sources would be quite seriously affected or even lost altogether. If Ms Tan had

not brought up the subject herself Mr Tay would have raised it. I think in the course of

the interview Ms Tan would have mentioned that in addition to the fixed monthly salary

there would be other benefits. Mr Tay’s remuneration package at that time already

included a commission on sales and Ms Tan had interviewed Mr Tay to take charge of the UCD

only a few days earlier.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">19. However on Mr Tay’s evidence

alone I would have thought that what the parties did at that interview did not go beyond

merely discussing benefits other than the fixed salary. These benefits were not fully

developed. The terms lacked certainty particularly in regard to the "percentage of

the over-trade allowance that [he] would manage in [his] discretion and which were not

utilised". This was a substantial part of the total remuneration package for Mr Tay

to consider to make up for what he could lose on the income from the outside sources. The

discussions were only at a preliminary stage as he said and it was only on 7 August 1996

that a draft was produced. In my judgment no agreement was made on or about 11 July 1996

to pay him under the sales volume incentive scheme or the profit sharing scheme. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">20. On or about 1 August 1996 the Company

gave Mr Tay a letter which says that he was promoted senior executive in the trade-in

department (or UCD) with a monthly salary of $3,000. Until then he was only a $200 a month

sales representative. He was now to be a senior executive in a newly established

department reporting directly to the general manager. He would have different duties. He

would have been told what these were and I think in the course of the interviews in July

1996 Ms Tan would have spoken to him about these matters. The letter does not call for an

acceptance and there is no evidence that Mr Tay accepted the promotion on the terms stated

in the letter at the time when it was given to him.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">21. Mr Tay knew or was told what he was

expected to do as senior executive in the UCD and he knew as I have found that his income

from the outside sources would be adversely affected or lost altogether and the increase

in the fixed salary would not cover the loss of such income. I think he would have been

expecting something more than the promotion letter or what is stated in it. He said in his

second affidavit that when he saw Ms Tan on or about 11 July 1996 he asked Ms Tan "if

she could put in writing" and she agreed to do so and I think Ms Tan did agree to do

so. She agreed to put down in writing the incentives that she had mentioned. These

incentives were not in the promotion letter. Mr Tay also said that when he was given the

promotion letter Ms Tan told him she was still working out his remuneration package. In

her second affidavit she agreed that she was still working out the incentives then.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">22. Ms Tan did put something down in

writing. On 7 August 1996 she called Mr Tay up and produced the first memorandum. It was

given to him. He said in his affidavit that he told her it would need to be revised and

that she agreed. She did revise it. Later the same day she called him up again and she

produced the second memorandum. As in the case of the first memorandum it was not signed

by her or by anyone else but it was nevertheless a memorandum to him from her as I have

found and she was clearly writing on behalf of the Company. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">23. The second memorandum is headed

"Kah Motor Trade-in Scheme" and is in 10 parts which with the assistance of

counsel I have numbered Parts 1 to 10. Parts 1 to 5 give a description of the

"Maximum OT Allowable" in respect of 5 models of Honda cars listed according to

the dates of registration. "OT" stands for "over-trade". In a trade-in

transaction the UCD would buy-in a used car from a customer and sell him a new car. The

Company would sell-out the used car to a used car dealer or another customer. The sell-out

price would be determined by agreement between the used car dealer or that other customer

and the Company. To make the trade-in terms attractive to the customer the Company was

willing to buy-in at a price in excess of the sell-out price. The excess was the

"over-trade" and the "Maximum OT Allowable" was the limit of the

excess for the particular model for the particular date of registration.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">24. Part 6 is a statement of the objective

of the scheme which was "to attract buyers of new cars by offering excellent prices

for customer’s current used car". Part 7 states:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">"IMPORTANT</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Main objective is to sell as many cars as

  we can with excellent customer service. Save on overtrade if we can but if we need to give

  the maximum to close a sale, we must do so.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Our sales goal for 1996 is to be No. 2

  after Toyota. We must be at least No. 3. If we do not achieve at least No. 3 position, the

  whole exercise will be considered a failure."</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">25. Part 8 describes the method of

operation. All sales representatives had to show Mr Tay the used car for valuation and to

propose a sell-out price for his approval. The buy-in price would be negotiated between

the sales representative and the customer but if a transaction could not be done unless a

buy-in price that would result in the over-trade allowance being exceeded could be agreed

then the sales representative would have to refer to Mr Tay who had authority to offer

such higher price.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">26. Part 9 states:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">"Profit Sharing Scheme for [Mr Tay]:<br/>

  (Subject to change based on changing market conditions)</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">.1 If less than the maximum overtrade is

  used, a share of profits will be paid out.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">.2 For example, we take in a 6/93 Civic

  ESi:</font></p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Kah Motor buys from customer at $73,000<br/>

    Kah Motor sells to dealer or direct customer at $71,000<br/>

    Therefore, overtrade used = $2,000<br/>

    Overtrade saved = $(6,000 – 2,000) = $4,000</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">A profit share based on the saved amount

  of $4,000 will be paid out.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">.3 Profit sharing will be paid out at the

  end of the year.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">.4 If registration for the quarter (3

  mths) is at least ….</font></p>
<blockquote>

<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">540 units Profit share is 3% of overtrade

<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">660 units Profit share is 4% of overtrade

<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">Only the second memorandum describes the

describe the profit sharing scheme.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">30. Under cross-examination Ms Tan said:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">"Q: Between 1/8/96 and 7/8/96 you had

  A: About 1/8/96.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Q: What about incentives?<br/>

  A: Profit sharing scheme had not yet been finalised. Only finalised during week commencing

  up to December 1996.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Q: When told him?<br/>

  A: Around week beginning 12/8/96.</font></p>

  A: During week beginning 12/8/96 I confirmed with Alan Tay I would pay him according to

<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">(To court): I had told him about it before

    but not confirmed until week beginning 12/8/96.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">7/8/96. We had discussion when I showed

    him draft memo of 7/8/96 and I described profit sharing scheme and sales volume incentive

    scheme that I was considering implementing for UCD."</font></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">The "draft memo of 7/8/96" is

the second memorandum. Ms Tan admitted that contrary to what she had said in her affidavit

the sales volume incentive scheme under which Mr Tay had been paid for the period ended 31

December 1996 was documented and was described in the second memorandum.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">31. Later Ms Tan said under continued

cross-examination:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">"Q: What you discussed during [second

  meeting on 7/8/96]?</font></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">A: Emphasized what is on AB-8 item 7. Our

  sales goal for 1996. Emphasized whole exercise and whole profit sharing scheme I wanted to

  implement would be considered failure if we did not achieve No 3 position. Emphasized that

  was objective. At least No 3 in 1996. Also discussed method of operation and item 8.2

  (AB-8) highlighted as something not feasible. Meeting concluded I would give whole method

  and scheme further thought and would confirm everything after COE results announced on

  10/8/96." </font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">AB-8 is the second memorandum and item 7

mentions the sales goal. Item 8.2 is part of the description of the method of operation

about sales representatives having to show the used car to Mr Tay. The second memorandum

was taken away by Mr Tay. Ms Tan did not "specifically" give him permission to

do so but as I have found it was no less a memorandum from Ms Tan to Mr Tay.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">32. On 12 August 1996 the Company issued a

memorandum to all sales representatives concerning a profit sharing scheme. As in the case

of the "Profit Sharing Scheme For [Mr Tay]" described in the second memorandum

it was also based on savings of the over-trade but the "Maximum OT Allowable"

and the percentages to be paid out were different. Mr Tay would not participate in this

scheme as he was to be a senior executive in the UCD and not a sales representative. There

is also another difference. The memorandum of 12 August 1996 states:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">"Terms and Conditions:</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">1. Share of the profits will be paid out

  as a lump sum at the end of 1996."</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">Part 9 of the second memorandum states

that the profit share would be paid "at the end of the year" and not "as a

lump sum at the end of 1996".</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">33. The question is whether any agreement

was reached between the parties on the second occasion they met on 7 August 1996 as

regards the two benefit schemes. The second memorandum was produced by Ms Tan. It was a

revision of the one given to Mr Tay earlier that day. It sets out the two schemes. It was

amended and the amendments were written in by Ms Tan. The amendments raised the over-trade

limit and would benefit Mr Tay. He would lose out on the income from the outside sources

if he accepted the promotion on the terms of the letter of 1 August 1996 without the

benefits under the two schemes. When the meeting concluded he took away with him the

second memorandum which is a memorandum from the Company to him. The second memorandum

does not contain anything to suggest that it is a draft or that the terms in it are

subject to confirmation or acceptance. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">34. I think Ms Tan must have explained the

terms of both the first memorandum and the second memorandum to Mr Tay. His English was

not good as he said and they conversed only in simple English. She said she told him that

she would give "it" further thought and inform him later. She did not explain

what "it" was. It could be anything in the preceding passage in this part of the

affidavit but I assume "it" was a reference to what she had in mind. She said

under cross-examination that when the meeting concluded she would give the whole method

and scheme further thought and would confirm everything but the evidence is not that she <i>told</i>

Mr Tay she would do so. If what she said under cross-examination reflected what she said

in her affidavit then "it" could also refer to the whole method and scheme.

There were two occasions on 7 August 1996 when Ms Tan saw Mr Tay and on each occasion a

memorandum setting out incentives was produced.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">35. Ms Tan referred to the second

memorandum and said that it was the first time Mr Tay heard from her regarding the

mechanics of the schemes. It could not be. The first time would have been when the

"mechanics" of the profit sharing scheme described in the first memorandum was

produced. Mr Tay said in his second affidavit that he wanted it revised and she agreed and

it was subsequently revised. In relation to the first memorandum there would have been an

occasion for Ms Tan to have said that she would give "it" further thought

whether "it" meant what she had in mind or the whole method and scheme. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">36. If what Ms Tan said was in relation to

the second memorandum then Mr Tay must have already accepted it when according to her he

said "whatever [she] decided was fine with him". In that event there would have

been no occasion to give "it" further thought and to inform him later unless

"it" was a reference to "other ways to remunerate him". Mr Tay said in

his second affidavit that during the interview on or about 11 July 1996 she had said that

if the remuneration was "not enough" then "she would look into other ways

to remunerate [him]". In this case the "other ways" would have to be an

improvement for the remuneration to be "enough".</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">37. If what Ms Tan said was in relation to

the second memorandum and not in regard to the "other ways" notwithstanding that

there was no occasion to do so then it must be made clear to a reasonable person in the

position of Mr Tay and in the surrounding circumstances including what she knew about Mr

Tay that she was really saying "No. You cannot say it is fine with you. This is only

a draft. It is not to take effect as a proposal until I confirm it." She knew that Mr

Tay’s English was not good and she conversed with him in simple English. What

according to her evidence she said to Mr Tay was I think far removed from it.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">38. The second memorandum was amended and

if further thought was to be given to it and if it was yet to be confirmed I think Ms Tan

and any reasonable person in her position would have taken the second memorandum back or

marked it as subject to confirmation or in some other appropriate manner. That would

particularly have been the case if he had said it was "fine with him". She wrote

the amendments in but she did not take the second memorandum back. She did not mark it in

any way consistent with what she said it was.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">39. It was not at any time put to Mr Tay

that she told him that she would give "it" further thought and inform him later

whatever "it" was. At the same time she was not cross-examined to any great

extent on what she said to him. Having regard to all the evidence before me and with the

advantage of having observed both Mr Tay and Ms Tan and of having read their affidavits

and heard their oral testimony I think she did not tell Mr Tay that she would give

"it" further thought or that she would inform him later and I find accordingly.

She did not tell him that on the occasion when the second memorandum was produced.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">40. I ask myself what a reasonable person

in Mr Tay’s position would have understood the second memorandum to be having regard

to all the surrounding circumstances and I can come to no conclusion other than that it

was intended to set out the terms of two benefit schemes forming part of the remuneration

to be paid to him upon his promotion to the position of senior executive in the UCD in

accordance with the Company’s letter dated 1 August 1996. He took the second

memorandum away with him. He did not say that it should be revised as he did with the

first memorandum. Ms Tan did not say that she would give "it" further thought

and inform him later as I have found. Even if she did what she said was not sufficient in

the circumstances to qualify the second memorandum. Mr Tay said that it was handed to him

"for implementation". I think he accepted it and in my judgment an agreement was

made on 7 August 1996 for the Company to pay him the benefits under the two schemes as

part of his remuneration upon his promotion. </font></p>
<p xmlns=""><i><b> </b></i></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">Sales volume incentive scheme</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">41. As I have observed the second

memorandum does not say that the sales volume incentive scheme is to come to an end on 31

December 1996 or at any time at all. When it was given to Mr Tay Ms Tan did not say when

the scheme was to come to an end but the Company’s case is that on or about 12 August

1996 an oral contract was entered into and under this contract the Company would pay Mr

Tay the benefits under the scheme for 1996 only. It is not the Company’s case that a

contract had been made earlier and that the scheme under such contract was varied in this

respect. The scheme is as described in the second memorandum. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">42. In her affidavits Ms Tan gave no

evidence of any agreement made on or about 12 August 1996. Under cross-examination she

said she had told Mr Tay about this scheme on 7 August 1996. That would be on the occasion

when the second memorandum was produced. The first memorandum does not mention any such

scheme. She said she confirmed it in the week beginning 12 August 1996. I have earlier

given the text of the relevant passage of the transcript of her evidence.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">43. Mr Tay said under cross-examination:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">"Q: Sales volume incentive scheme.

  Offered to you on or about 12/8/96?<br/>

  A: No.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Q: Offered to you at some other time?<br/>

  A: Written in 2nd memo of 7/8/96. Orally on 11/7/96 this was made to me and I accepted

  that."</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">His evidence is that it was not <i>offered</i>

to him on or about 12 August 1996. It was in answer to the question in the way it was put

to him. It was not put to him that the incentive was <i>confirmed</i> on or about 12

August 1996 or in the week following.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">44. I have found that the agreement to pay

the benefits under both schemes was made on 7 August 1996. It was not subject to

confirmation and there was nothing to be confirmed. That sufficiently disposes of the

defence. Kah Motor Co cannot unilaterally vary the agreement made earlier in a manner that

adversely affects Mr Tay. That is not even its case. It remains for me to find as I do

that Ms Tan did not confirm with Mr Tay that she would pay him according to the sales

volume incentive scheme up to December 1996 as she alleged in her evidence.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">45. On 12 August 1996 the Company issued a

memorandum to all sales representatives describing benefits based on over-trade savings

and one of the terms was that the benefits would be "paid out as a lump sum at the

end of 1996" suggesting that the scheme operated only for that year. I have earlier

referred to this memorandum. The scheme did not apply to Mr Tay. The second memorandum is

different in that no date or year is mentioned. There was no memorandum or other written

confirmation after 7 August 1996 as to either of the two schemes which did or would have

applied to him. There was nothing in writing to confirm that only one of the two schemes

was to operate and further that it was to operate only for 1996. In my judgment there was

no agreement that the sales volume incentive scheme operated only for 1996.</font></p>

<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Profit sharing scheme</font></p>

<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">46. The Company’s case is that the

agreement in relation to this scheme is void for uncertainty. I have heard no submission

on this but I have read the description of this scheme in the second memorandum and I am

unable to see in what way any of its provisions can be said to be void for uncertainty. In

my judgment the agreement in relation to the profit sharing scheme as contained in or

evidenced by the second memorandum is not void for uncertainty.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><i><b> </b></i></p>

  employment with the defendants without demanding performance of the alleged

</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">Paragraph 3.1 refers to the sales volume

incentive scheme and denies that any agreement was made on or about 11 July 1996 and

alleges that on or about 7 August 1996 Ms Tan only "discussed offering [Mr Tay] the

scheme which was to apply from August 1996 up to December 1996" and that he had been

"duly paid his entitlement". Apart from what is alleged in para 7 no particulars

of the waiver are given.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">48. Mr Low referred to <i>Chitty on

<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">He then referred to Treitel, <i>The Law of

  legal rights."</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">49. The Company’s case is that in

March 1997 Mr Tay knew that he had not been paid his benefits under the profit sharing

scheme and when he went to see Ms Tan with the intention of bringing this up he was told

that the sales volume incentive scheme only operated up to December 1996. He continued in

employment without making any claim until after his employment was terminated in February

1999. Mr Low referred to <i>UMW Toyota (M) Sdn Bhd v</i> <i>Chow Weng Thiem</i> <nobr>[1996] 5 MLJ 678</nobr>.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">50. In the <i>UMW Toyota</i> case Chow was

employed as manager of one of the company’s branches. There were, as the learned

judge said, two contracts of employment. Under the 1977 contract three months’ notice

was required to terminate his employment but under the 1984 contract the period of notice

was one month. The 1984 contract also conferred on Chow additional benefits and an

increase in salary. He was dismissed by the company and he claimed damages for wrongful

dismissal to be assessed on the basis of the salary and benefits under the second contract

and the requirement of three months’ notice under the first contract. Abdul Malik

Ishak J said at p 685:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">"Having enjoyed the fruits of the

  second contract for [4 years 10 months 25 days], the respondent had lost the right to

  by the respondent of the second contract." </font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">I am unable to see that this case is of

any assistance. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">51. Mr De Souza referred to <i>Gold Coin

Ltd v Tay Kim Wee</i> <nobr>[1986] SLR 68</nobr> where Lai Kew Chai J (delivering the judgment of the

Court of Appeal) said at p 74:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">"… counsel for the employers

  submitted that if an officious bystander were to have asked the parties whether the

  contract to pay a quantum meruit was still binding, the parties would have answered in the

  negative. We do not think so at all. Mr Tay who had not given the matter a moment’s

  thought would probably have said yes. Certainly, the employers would have answered yes. Mr

  Arnet, the Managing Director of the employers, in fact had honestly affirmed that he would

  have ‘done something about it’, that is, he would have paid Mr Tay his due, if

  he had known about it. It has to be stressed again that Mr Tay was not only totally

  devoted to his work; he did not much care about his entitlements. On the question of

  bonuses, he had always left it to Mr Arnet, as the latter frankly admitted in evidence. In

  these circumstances, it seems to us that the selfless inactivity of one party and the

  ignorance of the other party are very poor foundation to support any implied consensual

  variation of the contractual term to pay a quantum meruit." </font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">The "inactivity" was over a

period of about 15 years. The defence was variation of the contract and not as in the case

before me the equitable defence of waiver by estoppel but there is probably "no

essential juridical difference between waiver and variation". See <i>Banning v Wright

(Inspector of Taxes)</i> [1972] 1 WLR 972 at p 991 per Lord Simon of Glaisdale. </font></p>

<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">53. In para 4 of its defence the Company

says that a trade-in profit sharing scheme covering the period August 1996 to December

1998 and a prestige division profit sharing scheme covering the period September 1996 to

June 1997 applied for the equal benefit of Mr Tay and a Mr Chng and that "these were

the two incentive schemes applicable to both [Mr Tay] and [Mr Chng] in the UCD save that

by a prior agreement referred to at paragraph 3.1.2 above [Mr Tay] was given an additional

incentive scheme which was to apply to him until the end of 1996". Mr Chng was

transferred to the UCD in late August 1996 and appointed to his position there on 11

September 1996. The two schemes were based also on savings in the over-trade.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">54. Mr Tay admits in his reply that he and

Mr Chng participated in the two schemes but he says that they were in addition to the two

schemes under which he claims. It is not disputed that there was no inconsistency between

either of the two schemes which applied to both Mr Tay and Mr Chng and either of the two

schemes which applied to Mr Tay alone and participation in one was not inconsistent with

participation in any of the others. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">55. Ms Tan said in her first affidavit:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">"After [Mr Chng] was transferred to

  the UCD, I continued to conduct regular meetings with [Mr Chng] and [Mr Tay] on the

  mechanics of the UCD operations and the scheme of incentives to be paid to the UCD

  department. It was at one of these meetings that I <i>decided on</i> (italics added) the

  UCD trade-in incentive scheme after discussion with [Mr Tay] and [Mr Chng]."</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">Under cross-examination she corrected her

statement in the affidavit and replaced "decided on" with "confirmed".

She also said that the meeting when she confirmed the scheme took place at the end of

August 1996. Her evidence was:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">"Q: Told them earlier?<br/>

  A: Yes.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Q: When?<br/>

  A: Not together. Told Alan Tay around week beginning 12/8/96. Told Ricky Chng would say

  around mid-August as well. Alan Tay first.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Q: If already told Alan Tay in week

  commencing 12/8/96 why necessary to confirm at end August 1996?<br/>

  A: Because I wanted to make sure they knew how their profit sharing was to be calculated.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Q: What you told Alan Tay on 12/8/96

  different from what you told Alan Tay and Ricky Chng at end August 1996?<br/>

  A: No."</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">The last answer is not likely to be true

if as she had testified in the week commencing 12 August 1996 she had confirmed with Mr

Tay the sales volume incentive scheme which was applicable to him only. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">56. There were four separate schemes of

incentives Mr Tay was entitled to. There were the two schemes under which he claims and

there were also the two schemes admitted on the pleadings and which applied to him and to

Mr Chng. Under the profit sharing scheme payment was to be made at the end of the year.

Under the sales volume incentive scheme time for payment was not stated in the second

memorandum but by its terms the amount to be paid could only be ascertained at some time

after the end of the relevant month. Time for payment under the trade-in profit sharing

scheme and prestige division profit sharing scheme was not expressly stipulated. Mr Tay

has been paid under the last two schemes. The question is whether he has waived his strict

rights under the profit sharing scheme for which he has not been paid at all and under the

sales volume incentive scheme under which he has only been paid for the period down to

December 1996.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><i><b> </b></i></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">Conduct</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">57. It is said that for estoppel to be

effective for the defence of waiver by estoppel it must be clear and unequivocal. See the

passage in <i>Chitty on</i> <i>Contracts</i> cited. In <i>Bremer Handelsgesellschaft mbH v

Vanden Avenne-Izegem PVBA</i> [1978] 2 Lloyd’s Rep 109 Lord Salmon said at p 126:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">"To make an unequivocal

  representation or waiver it is not necessary for the buyers to say, ‘We hereby waive

  it’. It is quite enough if they behave or write in such a way that reasonable sellers

  would be led to believe that the buyers were waiving any defect there might be in the

  notice and were accepting it as effectively extending the date for delivery in accordance

  with the provisions of cl 22." </font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">That was a sale of goods case but I think

the principle applies equally to a case between an employer and employee. What was Mr

Tay’s conduct and in the circumstances would a reasonable employer be led to believe

that the employee was waiving the employer’s breach of contract in not paying him

under the two benefit schemes? </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">58. Ms Tan produced all the relevant

vouchers and a summary of the payments made to Mr Tay. Benefits under the sales volume

incentive scheme were paid to Mr Tay with his salary in respect of August and September

1996. For each of the three months from October to December 1996 he was paid about three

weeks into the following month. The vouchers describe these benefits as

"Commission" or "S/Comm" which presumably is short for "Sales

Commission". The first payment under the trade-in profit sharing scheme appears

according to the summary to have been made on 29 November 1996 but the voucher describes

the benefit as "Sales Commission". The next payment was on 15 April 1997 for

part of the benefit for the period to November 1996 and 16 July 1997 for the balance for

the period to December 1996. The vouchers describe the earlier payment as "Oct &amp;

Nov Partial" and the later payment as "Balance of Oct–Dec 96 Profit

Sharing". Subsequent vouchers describe the benefits variously as "Sales

Commission", "Comm" and "Profit Sharing". The benefits under the

prestige division profit sharing scheme were paid with the February 1997 salary in respect

of the period to December 1996 and on 8 August 1997 for the period to June 1997.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">59. Mr Tay said in his second affidavit:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">"In March 1997 or so, I happened to

  meet Ms Tan at the 2nd floor of Ubi Centre and I enquired about the Sales Volume Incentive

  Scheme and the other remuneration that had been agreed when I had accepted the position of

  executive in charge of the UCD. She said that the Sales Volume Incentive Scheme was

  implemented only for 1996. She made no mention of the other benefits. I was shocked at her

  reply and kept quiet."</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">Under cross-examination he said:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">"Q: Financial controller. You checked

  with him at any time your AT OT allowance?<br/>

  A: I have.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Q: When?<br/>

<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Q: What he told you?<br/>

<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Q: You did so?<br/>

  A: Yes.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Q: What she told you?<br/>

  31/12/96. By ‘unit incentive scheme’ I mean scheme under which I was to get $40

  about my AT OT allowance.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Q: When this conversation took place?<br/>

  A: March 1997.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Q: Question of your AT OT allowance. Never

  brought up with defendant? Other than reference to financial controller?<br/>

  A: Agree."</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">"AT OT allowance" refers to the

benefits under the profit sharing scheme described in the second memorandum.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">60. Mr Tay did not bring up the matter of

his entitlement under the profit sharing scheme with the Company after the occasion in

February or March 1997 when he spoke to the financial controller. He did not bring up the

matter of his entitlement under the sales volume incentive scheme which Ms Tan told him he

would not enjoy after December 1996. He continued to work for the Company. He received his

benefits under the trade-in profit sharing scheme and the prestige division profit sharing

scheme. He carried on in the employment of the Company in this way until February 1999

when his employment was terminated.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">61. Mr Tay was employed by the Company in

1979 and until August 1996 he was only a sales representative earning a monthly salary of

$200. Of course as pointed out above he also received a commission on sales and he

received a substantial sum from the outside sources but all the income was tied to his

employment. Ms Tan described him as a mediocre sales representative. She interviewed him

and she must have thought that he could nevertheless perform as senior executive for

$3,000 a month and later as assistant manager for $3,300 a month with the benefits under

the schemes which applied to him but his employment could be terminated on one

month’s notice or on payment of only a month’s salary as in fact it was. Mr

Tay’s English was not good and as he said in his second affidavit he needed someone

like Mr Chng to assist him in his new position. He had a number of years of experience in

the business of selling cars but there is no evidence that he had any qualifications or

skills which could serve him outside of the car sales business. His employment was

insecure and if he lost it he was ill equipped for any other employment.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">62. In January 1997 Mr Tay received his

benefit under the sales volume incentive scheme for December 1996. He did not receive

anything under any of the other schemes. In February 1997 he received his benefit under

the prestige division profit sharing scheme. He received it with his salary for the month

and it would have been at the end of the month as the voucher states. He did not receive

anything under the other schemes. He went to see the financial controller and he was told

to see Ms Tan. The financial controller would have known whether the accounts were ready

for the Company to ascertain the amount to pay him. He said this was in February or March

1997 but I think it would have been after he received his February 1997 salary.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">63. Mr Tay said in his second affidavit

that when he happened to see Ms Tan at Ubi Centre (where the Company carried on business)

he "enquired about the sales volume incentive scheme and the other remuneration that

had been agreed when [he] had accepted the position of executive in charge of the

UCD" and was told that the sales volume incentive scheme was "implemented only

for 1996". Under cross-examination he said he "dared not ask her about [his] AT

OT allowance". He was not asked why he dared not. I accept his evidence and I think

he would have been very troubled by what he heard about the sales volume incentive scheme.

He had only just been promoted to assistant manager. I think he as he said "dared not

ask her about [his] AT OT allowance".</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">64. On 15 April 1997 Mr Tay received

$15,000. This is the payment which the voucher describes as "Oct &amp; Nov

Partial". There is a signature on the voucher for acknowledgment of receipt although

there is no direct evidence as to its being his. There is no evidence that he was told

what it was for or what he thought it was for at the time it was received by him. It is

not disputed now that it was for the benefit under the trade-in profit sharing scheme

applicable to him and Mr Chng. In the course of the subsequent months down to February

1999 he received his monthly salary and from time to time other sums under the two schemes

applicable to him and Mr Chng but again there is no evidence that he knew what each of

these other sums was for.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><i><b> </b></i></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">Belief</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">65. Mr Tay continued in his employment

until it was terminated. He turned up for work. He carried on as assistant manager in the

UCD to which position he had been promoted from January 1997. There is no evidence of any

change in his position. There is no evidence of any change in his duties. There is no

evidence that he was given less work to do or that he did less work than in the first few

months of 1997 or at any time. He not only continued in his employment but he continued to

carry out his duties under the terms of his employment. What he did by continuing in his

employment was what he was contractually bound to do under the terms of his employment. It

was not different and it was not less. I do not think that a reasonable employer would at

any time at all be led by Mr Tay’s continuing in his employment in these

circumstances to believe that he was waiving any breach by the Company in respect of its

failure to pay under the two benefit schemes.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">66. This disposes of the case as pleaded

but I have heard evidence as to one other matter which has to be considered. Mr Tay took

no action to insist on his rights apart from the instances when he raised the matter with

the financial controller and with Ms Tan but was there anything that he could do without

putting his employment and with it his future at risk? If he made a claim he could lose

his job and he would still have to prosecute his claim - the more so if he in fact lost

his job. In the event he lost his job and soon after he asked for his benefits. The

benefits under the profit sharing scheme were payable at the end of the year. For 1996 he

should have been paid in the first few months of 1997. For 1997 and 1998 he should have

been paid in 1998 and 1999. There was accordingly no delay in respect of 1998 and a delay

of two years and one year in respect of 1996 and 1997. A reasonable employer would not at

any time at all be led to believe that Mr Tay was waiving any breach by the Company of its

obligations to pay under the two benefit schemes. There was no reason to insist on his

rights in the circumstances. There was every reason to hold back on any action that he

might have taken.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">67. I have taken all the circumstances

into consideration. I have considered them separately and I have considered them together

and I have considered them at intervals of time as Mr Tay continued in his employment. In

my judgment Mr Tay has not waived any breach by the Company. Although this is sufficient

to dispose of the defence of waiver or waiver by estoppel as pleaded I will go on to

consider briefly the other requirements for such a defence to succeed.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><i><b> </b></i></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">Act on belief</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">68. It has to be shown that Mr Tay

intended that the Company should act on the belief that the strict rights arising under

the benefit schemes would not be insisted upon. His intention can only be gathered from

his conduct in the circumstances. He delayed taking any action. There was an explanation

for this. He continued in his employment. He was merely doing what he was contractually

bound to do. It has also to be shown that the Company did act on the belief. No

particulars have been pleaded but on the evidence all that the Company did was to continue

to employ Mr Tay and to continue in the breach ie to continue not to pay him under the two

benefit schemes. The breach had occurred before the conduct which is relied upon as having

led to the belief. It was not a case of waiver of a right to be paid before any breach of

the obligation to pay in which case subsequent non-payment would be strong evidence of

acting on the belief. In my judgment it has not been shown that Mr Tay had the necessary

intention or that the Company acted on the belief.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><i><b> </b></i></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">Inequitable </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">69. The Company has not paid. It has not

altered its position in any way even if it had acted on any belief that the strict rights

would not be insisted upon. There is no evidence that acting on the belief it has

conducted its affairs in any particular way or that having regard to the way it has acted

it would be inequitable for Mr Tay to insist upon his rights. It is true that both benefit

schemes are "subject to change based on changing market conditions" but the

Company’s case as pleaded is that it made no agreement to pay under either of the two

benefit schemes and no evidence was adduced as to such changes as the Company might have

made. I see no reason for coming to any conclusion that it would be inequitable for Mr Tay

to insist upon his strict rights to be paid under the two benefit schemes.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">70. At the close of submissions I

intimated that there would be judgment for Mr Tay and invited counsel to address me as to

the reliefs claimed. Counsel were unable to offer any assistance on the basis of their

instructions and in the event I gave judgment for accounts to be taken as prayed for.</font></p>
