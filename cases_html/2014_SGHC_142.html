<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       This is an application by the Plaintiff, YTL
                    Construction (S) Pte Ltd, to set aside an adjudication determination dated 11
                    December 2013 made pursuant to the Building and Construction Industry Security
                    of Payment Act (Cap 30B, 2006 Rev Ed) (“the SOP Act”). Under the
                    adjudication determination, the Plaintiff was directed to pay the Defendant
                    $754,111.22 (inclusive of Goods and Services Tax (“GST”)). This
                    was the amount certified and payable by the Plaintiff to the Defendant for the
                    work done and materials supplied.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Facts</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Background</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The Adjudication between the parties arose out
                    of a project for the construction of three 30,000 tonne cement silos and a
                    four-storey office building with associated services at the existing Jurong Port
                    Cement Terminal, Pulau Damar Laut, Singapore (“the
                        Project”).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> The Plaintiff was appointed as the main
                    contractor for the Project on 15 December 2011. Subsequently, the Plaintiff
                    entered into a sub-contract agreement with the Defendant for the Defendant to
                    supply labour, machinery and equipment to install and complete structural works
                    (“the Subcontract”). The original agreed value of the works to be
                    executed by the Defendant was about $9m.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The payment claim and payment response</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       On 6 September 2013, the Defendant served on the
                    Plaintiff a payment claim for progress payment for work done under the
                    Subcontract in August 2013 pursuant to s 10(1) of the SOP Act. The payment claim
                    stated that the cumulative value of the work done by the Defendant from the
                    start of the Project till August 2013 was $6,152,032.37. The payment claim did
                    not specify the amount claimed for the month of August 2013.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       Nevertheless, the Plaintiff subsequently served
                    its payment response on the Defendant on 30 September 2013 pursuant to s 11(1)
                    of the SOP Act. The payment response certified that the cumulative value of the
                    work done to be $5,608,268.53. It also provided that the payment amount
                    certified for August 2013 was $695,370.76 (exclusive of GST).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       Under cl 17 of the Subcontract, the Defendant
                    was required to prepare a tax invoice amount based on the response amount as
                    stated in the payment response in order to obtain payment. On 9 October 2013,
                    the Defendant issued its tax invoice to claim $744,046.71. However, the
                    calculations in this tax invoice did not include the GST. Upon the
                    Plaintiff’s request, the Defendant subsequently issued a revised tax
                    invoice for $897,889.83 on 10 October 2013. This amount was set off against the
                    Plaintiff’s cross invoice for $143,778.61. Hence a net sum of $754,111.22
                    (inclusive of GST) was payable to the Defendant.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_5" id="Ftn_5_1"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The adjudication application</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       The due date for payment of the $754,111.22 was
                    14 November 2013. When the Plaintiff failed to make payment by that date, the
                    Defendant wrote to the Plaintiff on 15 November 2013 to give notice to the
                    Plaintiff of its intention to apply for adjudication in relation to the payment
                    claim (“the Notice”) in accordance with s 13(2) of the SOP Act. In
                    the Notice, the Defendant indicated that it is claiming the invoice amount of
                    $897,889.83 and for the dispute details it ticked the item “[p]aid amount
                    disputed (including nil payment by the payment due date)”. The Defendant
                    further described the dispute in the Notice as “[n]o payment received on
                    the payment due date of 14 November 2013”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_6" id="Ftn_6_1"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       On 20 November 2013, the Defendant lodged its
                    adjudication application with the Singapore Mediation Centre
                    (“SMC”). In its adjudication application, the Defendant indicated
                    the nature of dispute as “[p]aid amount disputed (include nil
                        payment)”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_7" id="Ftn_7_1"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span> However, the Defendant indicated the
                    “Claimed Amount” to be $1,328,536.83, a sum higher than the
                    payment response of $695,370.76 (exclusive of GST).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_8" id="Ftn_8_1"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span> This higher amount
                    was the original amount that the Defendant was claiming from the Plaintiff in
                    the payment claim and the adjudication application. As the original payment
                    claim did not specify the claimed amount for August 2013, the Defendant had
                    added handwritten notations to the original payment claim to derive a claimed
                    amount of $1,328,536.83 from the cumulative value of work done indicated in the
                    original payment claim.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_9" id="Ftn_9_1"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span> Instead of the original payment claim,
                    the Defendant then lodged this amended payment claim together with its
                    adjudication application.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       On 26 November 2013, the SMC informed both the
                    parties that Mr Tan Keok Heng George had been appointed to act as the
                    adjudicator for the adjudication.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_10" id="Ftn_10_1"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span> The
                    Plaintiff subsequently lodged its adjudication response, a summary sheet and a
                    bundle of supporting documents with the SMC on 28 November 2013 after receiving
                    the adjudication application on 21 November 2013.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_11" id="Ftn_11_1"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The adjudication determination</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       At the adjudication proceedings, the Plaintiff
                    argued that the payment claim was invalid because the original payment claim
                    failed to specify the claimed amount for the reference period, ie, August 2013.
                    The claimed amount of $1,328,536.83 was only provided for in the amended payment
                    claim which was lodged together with the adjudication application on 20 November
                    2013.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     The Plaintiff also argued that the claimed
                    amount in the adjudication was for $1,328,536.83. This sum is higher than the
                    amount stipulated in the payment response. Therefore, the Defendant was
                    essentially disputing the payment response instead of disputing non-payment of
                    the amount stated in the payment response as indicated in its adjudication
                    application. This meant that, in accordance with s 12(2)(a), s 12(5) and s
                    13(3)(a) of the SOP Act, the 7-day time limit for the Defendant to lodge an
                    adjudication application began after 8 October 2013. This is the date when the
                    Defendant was first entitled to make an adjudication application after the
                    expiry of the 7-day “dispute resolution period” which began after
                    the receipt of the payment response on 30 September 2013. Therefore, the last
                    day for the Defendant to lodge its adjudication application was 15 October 2013
                    and the adjudication application lodged by the Defendant on 20 November 2013 was
                    lodged out of time.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     The Plaintiff then submitted that the
                    Defendant failed to include a complete copy of the payment response in its
                    adjudication application as required by reg 7(2)(e) of the Building and
                    Construction Industry Security of Payment Regulations (Cap 30B, Rg 1, 2006 Rev
                    Ed) (“SOPR”). In its adjudication application, the Defendant only
                    included one out of four printed pages of the payment response served on it by
                    the Plaintiff.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     For these three reasons, the Plaintiff urged
                    the adjudicator to reject the adjudication application. The adjudicator agreed
                    with the Plaintiff’s submissions that the payment claim was not in order,
                    that the adjudication application was filed out of time and that the
                    adjudication application failed to include a complete payment response. However,
                    the adjudicator also took cognisance of the fact that the Plaintiff conceded in
                    its adjudication response that the lower certified amount of $695,370.36
                    (exclusive of GST) stated in the payment response was payable to the Defendant.
                    Therefore, the adjudicator only rejected the part of the claim of $1,328,536.83
                    that was in excess of $695,370.36 (exclusive of GST). He found that part of the
                    claim should be allowed because the Plaintiff had, in relation to the sum of
                    $695,370.36 (exclusive of GST), waived the formal requirements relating to the
                    payment claim and adjudication application under the SOP Act.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     The Defendant also expressed concern during
                    the adjudication that the adjudication determination may have had to be rendered
                    by 5 December 2013 within 7 days after the commencement of the adjudication in
                    accordance with s 17(1)(a)(ii) of the SOP Act. This was because s 17(1)(a)(ii)
                    would have applied if the adjudicator found the dispute to be one which
                    concerned the failure to make payment in accordance with the payment response.
                    However, the adjudicator found that as the original claim in the adjudication
                    application was for an amount higher than the payment response, s 17(1)(b) of
                    the SOP Act applied which allowed him a 14-day time limit to issue the
                    adjudication determination. Therefore, he found that he only had to issue the
                    adjudication determination by 12 December 2013.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     Consequently, the adjudicator, in his
                    adjudication determination dated 11 December 2013, held that the Plaintiff
                    should pay the Defendant $695,370.36 (exclusive of GST) which translated to
                    $754,111.22 after GST was included. He also ordered that interest on the sum of
                    $754,111.22 be paid to the Defendant. The adjudication costs were ordered to be
                    borne equally by the parties.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     The Plaintiff was dissatisfied with the
                    adjudication determination and therefore made this application seeking to set
                    aside the adjudication determination.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The plaintiff’s submissions</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     The Plaintiff submitted that the adjudication
                    determination should be set aside for the following reasons:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_16-p2_a"></a>(a)     That the payment claim failed to
                        comply with s 10(3)(a) of the SOP Act by stating the claimed amount
                        calculated by reference to the period to which the payment claim relates
                        instead of the outstanding unpaid amount;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_16-p2_b"></a>(b)     That the adjudication application was lodged out
                        of time and should have been rejected by the adjudicator in accordance with
                        s 16(2)(a) of the SOP Act;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_16-p2_c"></a>(c)     That there was a failure by the adjudicator to comply
                        with the principles of natural justice as required under s 16(3)(c) of the
                        SOP Act;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_16-p2_d"></a>(d)     That
                        the adjudication determination was rendered out of
                time.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Court’s decision</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The court’s role in a setting aside application</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     In deciding whether or not to set aside an
                    adjudication determination it is not the court’s role to scrutinise the
                    decisions of the adjudicator. However, an invalid appointment of the adjudicator
                    will nullify an adjudication determination. There are also certain legislative
                    provisions in the SOP Act that are so important that their breach may affect the
                    validity of the adjudication determination. These are the observations made by
                    the Court of Appeal in <em>Lee Wee Lick Terence (alias Li Weili
                        Terence) v Chua Say Eng (formerly trading as Weng Fatt Construction
                        Engineering) and another appeal</em> [2013] 1 SLR 401 ("<em>Chua Say Eng</em>”) at [66]–[67]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">66    Turning now to the court's role in a setting-aside
                            action, we agree with the holding in <em>SEF
                                Construction</em> ([14] <em>supra</em>)
                            that the court should not review the merits of an adjudicator's
                            decision. The court does, however, have the power to decide whether the
                            adjudicator was validly appointed. If there is no payment claim or
                            service of a payment claim, the appointment of an adjudicator will be
                            invalid, and the resulting adjudication determination would be null and
                            void.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">67    Even if there is a payment claim and service of
                            that payment claim, the court may still set aside the adjudication
                            determination on the ground that the claimant, in the course of making
                            an adjudication application, has not complied with one (or more) of the
                            provisions under the Act which is so important that <em>it is the legislative purpose that an act done in breach of the
                                provision should be invalid</em>, whether it is labelled as an
                            essential condition or a mandatory condition. A breach of such a
                            provision would result in the adjudication determination being invalid.
                            [emphasis in original]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     Therefore, the crux of the matter lies in the
                    legislative intent behind the provisions. Regardless of whether the word
                    “shall” is used, the court must always ask itself whether it was
                    Parliament’s intent to have adjudication determinations that are made in
                    violation of certain requirements set aside. Certain factors would have to be
                    considered in answering such a question. As stated by Woo Bih Li J in <em>Australia Timber Products Pte Ltd v A Pacific Construction &amp;
                        Development Pte Ltd</em> [2013] 2 SLR 776 (“<em>Australia Timber</em>”) at [75]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It seems to me that a number of considerations ought to influence the
                        determination of whether a particular provision of the Act or the SOPR is a
                        legislatively important provision. These considerations would include the
                        overarching purpose of the Act, the degree of difficulty in ascertaining
                        compliance with that provision, the fact that curial intervention is
                        permitted in the Act's adjudication mechanism, and the practical realities
                        of the construction industry and its operation. I hasten to add that this is
                        not an exhaustive list.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     Bearing these considerations in mind, I
                    proceed to examine the Plaintiff’s submissions.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The payment claim</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Is the payment claim valid?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     Section 10(3)(a) of the SOP Act states

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     Regulation 5(2) of the SOPR also provides
                    that:</p>

                                    claimed amount is derived.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     The purpose for having these requirements was
                    enunciated by the Court of Appeal in <em>Chua Say Eng</em>
                    at [74]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… It seems to us that the legislated formal requirements for
                        payment claims are designed to ensure that specified items of information
                        are made available to the respondent before the claimant's rights under the
                        Act are engaged. The emphasis is therefore not on the claimant's intention
                        but on the respondent being given notice of certain information about the
                        claim (such as the amount claimed, the contract under which the claim is
                        made and a breakdown of the items constituting the claim). …</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>Bearing in mind the purpose of such requirements, the Court of
                        Appeal concluded at [78]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… the correct test for determining the validity of a payment claim
                        is whether a purported payment claim satisfies all the formal requirements
                        in s 10(3)(<em>a</em>) of the Act and reg 5(2) of the
                        SOPR. If it does, it is a valid payment claim. …</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     Nonetheless, although a payment claim that
                    satisfies all the formal requirements in s 10(3)(a) of the Act and reg 5(2) of
                    the SOPR is a valid payment claim, the converse cannot be said to be true. As
                    stated by Woo Bih Li J in <em>Australia Timber</em> at
                    [30]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In my view, therefore, the two-step analysis proceeds as follows. If a
                        purported payment claim complies with s 10(3)(<em>a</em>) of the Act and reg 5(2) of the SOPR, it is a valid
                        payment claim and no further question arises as to its validity, although an
                        argument based on estoppel against the claimant can still be made (<em>Chua Say Eng</em> at [33], [73] and [78]). If, however,
                        the purported payment claim does not comply with these statutory provisions,
                        it is not necessarily rendered invalid and the adjudication determination is
                        not automatically invalidated. The court should instead proceed to examine
                        whether any of the provisions which were not complied with was so important
                        that it was the legislative purpose that an act done in breach of the
                        provision should be invalid, so that non-compliance with such a provision
                        would invalidate the adjudication determination (<em>Chua Say
                            Eng</em> at [67]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     For the purposes of determining the validity
                    of the payment claim, I shall only consider the original payment claim served on
                    the Plaintiff on 6 September 2013. I shall comment on the amended payment claim
                    annexed with the Defendant’s adjudication application later on. The
                    Defendant does not dispute that the payment claim served on the Plaintiff on 6
                    September 2013 for progress payment for work done under the Subcontract in the
                    month of August 2013 did not state the specific amount claimed for the reference
                    period which is the month of August 2013. It only stated the cumulative value of
                    the work done from the start of the Project till the end of August 2013. The
                    Plaintiff would not know the actual amount claimed from the original payment
                    claim until the payment claim was amended with handwritten entries subsequently.
                    This amended payment claim was lodged by the Defendant together with its
                    adjudication application stating the amount claimed. Therefore, when the
                    Plaintiff was served with the payment claim on 6 September 2013, it would not
                    know how much the Defendant was actually claiming. The Defendant argued that the
                    payment claim was in order as the SOP Act does not specify what constitutes a
                    claim amount and what does not. Furthermore, the Defendant submitted that the
                    Plaintiff is estopped from disputing the validity of the payment claim. The
                    Defendant also argued that the Plaintiff did its own calculation and in its
                    payment response issued interim Payment Certificate 12 approving payment to the
                    Defendant for $695,370.76. This was on 30 September 2013.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     How important is the payment claim under the
                    SOP Act? This requires a close perusal of s 10 of the SOP Act, particularly s
                    10(3) that deals with payment claim:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">10(3) A payment claim —</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(a) shall state the claimed amount, calculated by reference to the period
                        to which the payment claim relates; and</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(b) shall be made in such form and manner, and contain such other
                        information or be accompanied by such documents, as may be
                        prescribed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     From the above wordings it is clear that
                    Parliament had mandated that the payment claim must state the claimed amount.
                    This is a basic requirement because the respondent, and later on the
                    adjudicator, will want to know what is being claimed. After all, the main
                    purpose of the SOP Act is to facilitate easy and quick processing of claims in
                    the construction industry. It is the payment claim that initiates the claim
                    protocol under the SOP Act. Therefore the payment claim must clearly state what
                    the claim amount is. It is very unfortunate that the Defendant had failed to
                    indicate the exact amount it was claiming for the month of August 2013. This is
                    a series of serious errors made by the Defendant. Later, when no payment was
                    forthcoming despite the Plaintiff certifying the amount of $695,370.76
                    (exclusive of GST), the Defendant served the Notice of Intention to apply for
                    adjudication on the Plaintiff on 15 November 2013. It did not indicate
                    $695,370.76 (exclusive of GST) as the claimed amount but $897,889.83 instead.
                    When the Defendant lodged its adjudication application, it once again claimed a
                    different amount. This time the Defendant claimed $1,328,536.83. What then is
                    the actual amount that the Defendant was claiming? At the hearing before me the
                    Defendant submitted that it was claiming $695,370.76 (exclusive of GST) but this
                    was not apparent when the Defendant initiated the claim proceedings under the
                    SOP Act.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     It is common sense that for any claim or
                    adjudication procedure to advance expeditiously and efficiently, the claimed
                    amount must be made known in the payment claim pursuant to s 10(3)(a) of the SOP
                    Act. If that is not the case, it would be difficult for the respondent to serve
                    a proper payment response. How would one be able to decide on how much to pay
                    another if he does not even know how much is demanded? Further, if there is a
                    dispute as to the payment response, the respondent will be unable to negotiate
                    with the claimant since he is unaware of the claimant’s position. The
                    adjudication process will then not be able to proceed in accordance with the
                    envisioned framework of the SOP Act.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     Here, it was not a situation whereby the
                    figures provided in the payment claim would allow a person to logically
                    ascertain what the actual claimed amount was at that point in time. There was no
                    indication of the amount claimed. It was later at the adjudication application
                    that figures were hand written and labelled as “Amount approved
                    previously” and “Retention 10%”. These were added on in the
                    amended payment claim. The amounts also did not correspond with any of the
                    numbers in the Plaintiff’s payment response. Thus the Plaintiff would not
                    have known the Defendant’s claimed amount for the month of August 2013. In
                    short, it was impossible for the Plaintiff to have figured out what the
                    Defendant’s actual claim in its payment claim. This explains why
                    subsequently when the Plaintiff lodged its adjudication response at section B
                    under “Contract type” it ticked the box “Disputed payment
                    response” and for “Nature of Dispute” it ticked the boxes
                    “Disputed payment response” and “Paid amount disputed
                    (including nil payment)”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_12" id="Ftn_12_1"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span>. In
                    this case when the Plaintiff certified $695,370.76 (exclusive of GST) on 30
                    September in response to the payment claim, it did so from its own calculation
                    and understanding of the amount outstanding for the month of August 2013. It did
                    not and could not do so based on the Defendant’s understanding since the
                    Defendant’s payment claim failed to stipulate the claimed amount in breach
                    of s 10(3) of the SOP Act. Hence, I find that the non-compliance with s 10(3)(a)
                    rendered the Defendant’s payment claim invalid.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">May the invalidity of the payment claim be waived?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     Despite the Defendant’s failure to state
                    the amount claimed in its payment claim, the Defendant turned the table and
                    argued that the Plaintiff is estopped or had waived the claim requirement under
                    the SOP Act. Is this a valid argument when it is the Defendant who had failed to
                    comply with the SOP Act in its pursuit of its claim under the same
                Act?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     As held by Judith Prakash J in <em>Chip Hup Hup Kee Construction Pte Ltd v Ssangyong Engineering &amp;

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">43    Considering the
                            authorities cited by each party, it appeared at first that they could
                            not be reconciled. On the one hand, it was declared by high authority
                            that parties could not be estopped from contesting jurisdiction and, on
                            the other hand, there were numerous cases in which exactly that seemed
                            to have happened. There was, however, an answer to the quandary and it
                            was provided by the claimant. The claimant pointed out that the
                            confusion arose from the way in which the word "jurisdiction" was used
                            by the respondent. Agreeing that parties could not confer or waive
                            "jurisdiction" as explained in the authorities cited by the respondent,
                            the claimant averred that that was the case when "jurisdiction" was used
                            in its narrow meaning of "competence to hear". When "jurisdiction" was
                            used in a wider sense, <em>ie</em>, in reference to
                            the manner in which the court's power was exercised then waiver or
                            estoppel could be relied on. The distinction between the two meanings of
                            the word appears clearly from the following passage of the judgment of
                            Deane J in <em>Then Kang Chu v Tan Kim Hoe</em>
                            [1925] SSLR 4:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">By the jurisdiction of a Court is meant the authority which the Court
                            has to decide matters litigated before it or to take cognizance of
                            matters presented in a formal way for its decision. Its limits are
                            defined in the Statute, Charter or commission constituting the Court and
                            must be sought for there.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">The last point to be dealt with is the argument that defendant having
                            appeared in the lower Court and taken no objection to the jurisdiction

                            application of estoppel in such cases are well stated in Spencer Bower
                            on 'Estoppel by Representation' at page 187, 'Even the most plain and

                            representation may be implied, such as to give rise to an estoppel,
                            cannot confer judicial authority on any of His Majesty's subjects not
                            (18) already invested with such authority by the law of the land, or add
                            to the jurisdiction lawfully exercised by any judicial tribunal'. ... On
                            the other hand, 'where it is merely a question of irregularity of
                            procedure, or of a defect in "contingent" jurisdiction or non-compliance
                            with statutory conditions precedent to the validity of a step in the
                            litigation, of such a character that, if one of the parties be allowed

                            no new jurisdiction is thereby impliedly created, and no existing

                            boundaries, the estoppel will be maintained, and the affirmative answer
                            of illegality will fail'.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">44    Thus, it seemed that when what was being alleged
                            was an absolute lack of jurisdiction on the part of a particular
                            tribunal or court to hear a particular dispute, "jurisdiction" being
                            used in the strict sense of capacity to hear, then if the tribunal
                            concerned does not have such jurisdiction, any party to the dispute may
                            assert the lack of jurisdiction at any stage and can never be held to be
                            estopped from doing so or to have waived its right of protest. On the
                            contrary, when it is a question of irregularity of procedure or
                            contingent jurisdiction or non-compliance with a statutory condition
                            precedent to the validity of a step in the litigation, such irregularity
                            or non-compliance can be waived because the effect of the waiver would
                            not be to create or confer any jurisdiction that did not previously
                            exist.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     Therefore, in such an instance, the question
                    would then depend on whether the irregularity pertaining to the requirements of
                    making a valid payment claim relates to “jurisdiction” in the
                    narrow sense or the wider sense. In relation to non-compliance with s 10(3) of
                    the SOP Act, Quentin Loh J held in <em>Admin Construction Pte Ltd
                        v Vivaldi (S) Pte Ltd</em> [2013] 3 SLR 609 at [59]–[60]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">59    … In
                            discussing <em>TPX Builders</em> [Woo Bih Li J]
                            said that a payment claim made in breach of the Act would undermine the
                            jurisdiction of the adjudicator and therefore the validity of his
                            rendered determination: at [35]. Accordingly neither s 15(3) of the
                            [SOP] Act nor estoppel should preclude a respondent from challenging the
                            validity of the payment claim in an action for setting aside. Woo J
                            pointed to <em>Terence Lee</em> at [64]-[65] for
                            the proposition that a dispute over the validity of the payment claim
                            was an issue to be determined by the court and not the adjudicator and
                            repeated this reasoning in the recent case of <em>Australian Timber Products Pte Ltd v A Pacific Construction &amp;
                                Development Pte Ltd</em> [2013] 2 SLR 776 at
                        [36]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">The formal validity of a payment claim under s 10(3) of the Act is
                            therefore not a matter on which an adjudicator is entitled to decide;
                            and in this regard, it would be superfluous to raise for the
                            adjudicator's consideration any objection to validity stemming from the
                            lack of detail in a purported payment claim. No question of any estoppel
                            can arise, given that the adjudicator cannot decide on the point even if
                            it is brought up for his consideration.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">60     I agree that in <em>Terence
                            Lee</em>, the Court of Appeal definitively clarified that a
                        challenge to the validity of a payment claim amounts to a challenge to the
                        validity of the appointment of the adjudicator, <em>ie</em>, a challenge to the adjudicator's jurisdiction rather
                        than the exercise of such jurisdiction (see [21] above) …</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     Therefore, given that the irregularity here
                    related to “jurisdiction” in the strict sense, such that it
                    affected the validity of the appointment of the adjudicator and his competence
                    to hear the adjudication, no defence of waiver or estoppel may be relied upon by
                    the Defendant. Woo Bih Li J also found that non-compliance with s 10(1) of the
                    SOP Act could not be waived in <em>JFC Builders Pte Ltd v
                        LionCity Construction Co Pte Ltd</em> [2013] 1 SLR 1157 at [43].
                    Accordingly, I find that non-compliance with s 10(3) of the SOP Act cannot be
                    waived as well. I would also like to point out that the adjudicator could not
                    have decided on the issue of waiver in his adjudication determination since he
                    did not have the power to decide on issues related to the validity of his own
                    appointment.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     In any event I do not think that the Plaintiff
                    had waived compliance with s 10(3)(a) or had been estopped from complaining
                    about it at any point in time of the adjudication. The Plaintiff was never aware
                    of the actual claim of $1,328,536.83 until the time the amended payment claim
                    was lodged together with the adjudication application and forwarded to it by the
                    SMC. Upon discovery of this unexpected amount, the Plaintiff then began to mount
                    its complaints. The serving of the payment response on the Defendant cannot be
                    taken to mean that the Plaintiff had forgone its legal rights since it was all
                    the Plaintiff could have done at that point in time other than refusing to
                    respond to the Defendant. The Plaintiff could not have challenged its validity
                    because there was no forum for the Plaintiff to do so at that point in time.
                    This also applies to all the previous instances where the Defendant served a
                    payment claim for an unspecified amount and subsequently accepted the
                    Plaintiff’s payment response.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     Therefore, when SMC appointed George Tan as
                    the adjudicator for this case it was unaware of the invalidity of the payment
                    claim. Hence this had affected the validity of the adjudicator’s
                    appointment. He would then have no jurisdiction or competence to make an
                    adjudication determination. This itself is sufficient for the setting aside of
                    the adjudication determination. However, I shall proceed to consider the other
                    grounds of setting aside raised by the Plaintiff.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The adjudication application</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Was the adjudication application filed out of time?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     The Plaintiff submitted that as the Defendant
                    claimed for $1,328,536.83 in its adjudication application, an amount higher than
                    that stated in its payment response, the Defendant was in fact disputing the
                    payment response provided by the Plaintiff. Furthermore, the Defendant had
                    indicated in the Notice that it was claiming $897,889.83. Thus, both these
                    amounts claimed were higher than the payment response of $695,370.36 (exclusive
                    of GST). In such a scenario, the time for the Defendant to lodge an adjudication
                    application is determined in accordance with s 12(2) and s 12(5) of the SOP
                    Act which state that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">12(2) Where, in

                            respondent does not provide the payment response, as the case may
                            be.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">…</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">12(5)  In this section, “dispute settlement

                                the payment response is required to be provided under section
                                11(1).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     In this case, the Plaintiff served the payment
                    response on the Defendant on 30 September 2013. The “dispute settlement
                    period” therefore started on 1 October 2013 and ended on 7 October 2013.
                    Therefore, the Defendant was entitled to lodge an adjudication application from
                    8 October 2013 onwards. The time limit for lodging an adjudication application
                    would then be within 7 days after 8 October 2013 in accordance with s 13(3)(a)
                    of the SOP Act which states that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">13(3) An adjudication

                                …</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     The last day for the Defendant to lodge its
                    adjudication application was on 15 October 2013. However, in this case, the
                    adjudication application was only lodged with the SMC on 20 November 2013. Thus
                    it was lodged out of time.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     However, the Defendant submitted that the
                    nature of the dispute was not in relation to the payment response but was
                    instead based on the failure of the Plaintiff to pay the amount of $695,370.36
                    (exclusive of GST) stated in its payment response. This was despite the fact
                    that the Defendant had indicated its claimed amount as $1,328,536.83 which was
                    higher than the Plaintiff’s payment response amount. In the Notice, the
                    claimed amount of $897,889.83 is also higher than the response amount.
                    Notwithstanding these facts, the Defendant relies on the fact that in both the
                    Notice and its adjudication application, it had ticked the boxes beside the
                    phrases “Paid amount disputed (including nil payment by the payment due
                    date)” and “Paid amount disputed (include nil payment)”
                    respectively. The boxes ticked indicated the nature of the dispute in both
                    forms. The Defendant submitted that it did not tick the boxes with the phrases
                    “Payment response disputed (applicable to construction contracts
                    only)” and “Disputed payment response” in the Notice and
                    its adjudication application respectively.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     According to the Defendant’s
                    submissions, it was entitled to lodge its adjudication application on the day
                    after the payment date for $695,370.36 (exclusive of GST) on 14 November 2013
                    had passed. Section 12(1) of the SOP Act states that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">12(1) Subject to subsection (2), a claimant who, in
                            relation to a construction contract, fails to receive payment by the due
                            date of the response amount which he has accepted is entitled to make an
                            adjudication application under section 13 in relation to the relevant
                            payment claim.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     Given that the Defendant was only entitled to
                    lodge its adjudication application on 15 November 2013, the last day for lodging
                    its adjudication application would be 22 November 2013. Therefore, since the
                    adjudication application was lodged by the Defendant on 20 November 2013, it was
                    lodged within time.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     I cannot accept the Defendant’s
                    submission. Its adjudication application was clearly based on a dispute as to
                    the Plaintiff’s payment response. Although it kept insisting that the
                    dispute was in relation to “[p]aid amount disputed”, it never
                    unequivocally abandoned or withdrew the claim of $1,328,536.83. Although the
                    Defendant agreed that Plaintiff should pay it $695,370.36 (exclusive of GST),
                    this did not mean that the Defendant was not claiming in excess of $695,370.36
                    (exclusive of GST) as well. The Defendant did not adduce any evidence that it
                    had “accepted” the payment response, as required by s 12(1) of the
                    SOP Act, such that it has agreed to accept the payment response in satisfaction
                    of its payment claim in its entirety. On the contrary, the Defendant had
                    indicated that it was claiming for higher amounts in both the Notice and the
                    adjudication application. Furthermore, if the Defendant was truly only claiming
                    for $695,370.36 (exclusive of GST) and nothing in excess of the payment
                    response—which would render it a dispute as to the payment
                    response—it could have applied to the adjudicator to amend its
                    adjudication application by correcting the claimed amount such that it reflected
                    $695,370.36 (exclusive of GST) only. This is permitted under reg 7(2A) of
                    the SOPR which states that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">7(2A) The adjudicator appointed under section 14
                            of the Act may, at any time before the making of the determination and
                            on such terms as to costs or otherwise as he thinks just, allow such
                            amendments to be made to an adjudication application as he thinks
                            fit.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     However, the Defendant did not attempt to make
                    any amendment to its adjudication application. This was despite it knowing of
                    the problem with the claimed amount before the adjudication determination was
                    issued on 11 December 2013. It is peculiar that the Defendant could make
                    submissions to the effect that the dispute was one as to “[p]aid amount
                    disputed” but could not make an application to amend its adjudication
                    application. The Defendant clearly wanted to have its cake and eat it. It
                    claimed for a higher amount while insisting on timelines that only applied if it
                    claimed for the payment response amount only. Even if the higher claimed amount
                    was a clerical mistake, the Defendant made no attempt to correct the mistake. By
                    not abandoning or withdrawing the higher claimed amount, the Defendant took a
                    risk. It kept alive the possibility that it could receive a determination for a
                    sum greater than $695,370.36 (exclusive of GST). However, at the same time, it
                    gave rise to the possibility that its adjudication application could be found to
                    be lodged out of the time. This was what happened in this case. By claiming for
                    a higher amount, the Defendant in effect disputed the payment response. It
                    should have lodged its adjudication application by 15 October 2013 but failed to
                    do so. Therefore, I find that the Defendant had lodged its adjudication
                    application out of time and failed to comply with s 13(3)(a) of the SOP
                    Act.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Must an adjudication determination premised on an out of time

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     Section 16(2)(a) of the SOP Act states

                    (LexisNexis, 2nd Ed, 2013) at para 9.52:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Of the requirements stipulated under section 13(3), those under paragraphs
                        (a), (b) and (c) are particularly important because section 16(2)(a)
                        provides that ‘an adjudicator shall reject … any adjudication
                        application that is not made in accordance with section 13(3)(a), (b) or
                        (c)’: Given the mandatory wording of the subsection, as long as a case
                        for non-compliance with any of these three requirements has been made, the
                        adjudicator is obliged to dismiss the adjudication application.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     Although the Court of Appeal did not express
                    an opinion as to whether an adjudication determination premised on an out of
                    time adjudication must be set aside in <em>Chua Say
                        Eng</em> at [61], subsequent cases have answered the question in the
                    affirmative. In <em>RN &amp; Associates Pte Ltd v TPX Builders
                        Pte Ltd</em> [2013] 1 SLR 848, Andrew Ang J held at [54]

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">54    Besides, s 16(2) of the SOP Act circumscribes the
                            jurisdiction of an adjudicator by laying out the circumstances wherein

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">55     The SOP Act has chosen the grounds under s

                        circumscribe the adjudicator's jurisdiction in relation to an adjudication

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     I agree with the above two decisions in
                    relation to s 16(2)(a) of the SOP Act which makes it mandatory for an
                    adjudicator to reject an adjudication application that does not comply with ss
                    13(3)(a), (b) or (c). This is especially the case for s 13(3)(a) of the SOP Act
                    which deals with timelines, an essential factor in ensuring a fast and fluid
                    cash flow within the building and construction industry. As stated by Mr Cedric
                    Foo Chee Keng, then Minister of State for National Development, during the
                    second reading of the Building and Construction Industry Security of Payment
                    Bill 2004 (Bill 54 of 2004) ("the SOP Bill"), which was later enacted as Act
                    57/2004, <em>Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official
                        Report</em> (16 November 2004) vol 78 at col 1112:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The SOP Bill will preserve the rights to payment for work done and goods
                        supplied of all the parties in the construction industry. It also
                        facilitates cash flow by establishing a fast and low cost adjudication
                        system to resolve payment disputes. Affected parties will have the right to
                        suspend work or withhold the supply of goods and services, if the
                        adjudicated amount is not paid in full or not paid at all.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     The timelines under the SOP Act are therefore
                    very tight so as to facilitate “cash flow by establishing a fast and low
                    cost adjudication system”: <em>W Y Steel Construction Pte
                        Ltd v Osko Pte Ltd</em> [2013] 3 SLR 380 (“<em>W
                        Y Steel</em>”) at [25]. The importance of observing such tight
                    timelines was elaborate by McDougall J in the Australian decision of <em>Chase Oyster Bar v Hamo Industries</em> [2010] NSWCA 190
                        (“<em>Chase Oyster</em>”) at
                    [208]–[209]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">208    Further, the <em>Security of
                                Payment Act</em> operates in a way that has been described as
                            “rough and ready” or, less kindly, as
                            “Draconian”. It imposes a mandatory regime regardless of
                            the parties’ contract: s 34. It provides extremely abbreviated
                            time frames for the exchange of payment claims, payment schedules,
                            adjudication applications and adjudication responses. It provides a very
                            limited time for adjudicators to make their decisions on what,
                            experience shows, are often extremely complex claims involving very
                            substantial volumes of documents (see, for example, my decision in
                                <em>Laing O’Rourke Australia Construction v
                                H&amp;M Engineering and Construction</em> [2010] NSWSC 818 at
                            [8]).</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">209    The <em>Security of Payment
                                Act</em> gives very valuable, and commercially important,
                            advantages to builders and subcontractors. At each stage of the regime
                            for enforcement of the statutory right to progress payments, the
                                <em>Security of Payment Act</em> lays down
                            clear specifications of time and other requirements to be observed. It
                            is not difficult to understand that the availability of those rights
                            should depend on strict observance of the statutory requirements that
                            are involved in their creation.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     Hence, the legislative intent was for the
                    7-day timeline in s 13(3)(a) to be observed strictly such that the
                    adjudicator must, without any room for discretion, reject an adjudication
                    application lodged out of time. This would also mean that there is no room for
                    waiver of the formal requirements by the parties to the adjudication. Even
                    though this may seem draconian, the observations by the Court of Appeal in
                        <em>W Y Steel</em> at [22] must be borne in
                    mind:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Statutory adjudication of building and construction disputes takes the
                        concept one step further. Interim payment claims <em>per
                            se</em> are not granted temporary finality under the adjudication
                        scheme. Instead, the parties enter into an expedited and, indeed, an
                        abbreviated process of dispute resolution in which payment claims and
                        payment responses must be made within the stipulated deadlines to an
                        adjudicator, who is himself constrained to render a quick decision. As a
                        species of justice, it is admittedly somewhat roughshod, but it is fast; and
                        any shortcomings in the process are offset by the fact that the resultant
                        decision only has temporary finality. The party found to be in default has
                        to pay the amount which the adjudicator holds to be due (referred to in the
                        Act as the "adjudicated amount"), but the dispute can be reopened at a later
                        time and ventilated in another more thorough and deliberate forum.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     Therefore the adjudicator should have rejected
                    the adjudication application as required by s 16(2) which circumscribes the
                    adjudicator’s jurisdiction. There is no exception to this obligation. The
                    Plaintiff also succeeds on this ground of setting aside.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Was there a failure by the adjudicator to comply with the principles
                of natural justice as required under s 16(3)(c) of the SOP Act</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     The Plaintiff submitted that after the
                    adjudicator found that the Defendant had failed to comply with the requirements
                    of the SOP Act, the adjudicator concluded that the Plaintiff, through its
                    conduct, had waived the strict compliance with the requirements of the SOP Act
                    in favour of the Defendant. The Plaintiff argued that it had not waived the
                    strict compliance of the SOP Act as it opposed the Defendant’s claim. The
                    Plaintiff took issue with the fact that the adjudicator had not solicited the
                    Plaintiff’s view on this issue of waiver and thus the Plaintiff was denied
                    the opportunity to address the adjudicator. In my view this ground for setting
                    aside the adjudication determination is unmeritorious.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     Section 18 of the SOP Act permits an aggrieved
                    respondent to seek a review of the adjudication determination. The Plaintiff
                    chose not to seek an adjudication review in this case. In <em>AM
                        Associates (Singapore) Pte Ltd v Laguna National Golf and Country Club
                        Ltd</em> [2009] SGHC 260, Judith Prakash J opined that the Court would
                    not lightly interfere with an adjudication determination on the ground of
                    natural justice as the aggrieved respondent could seek a review of the
                    adjudication determination under s 18 of the SOP Act. The Court held at [26]
                    that :</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The principles of natural justice are concerned with the provision of a
                        fair hearing to contending parties. They do not mandate any particular
                        result. As long as the parties have been given a fair hearing, the decision
                        cannot be set aside for failure to comply with natural justice. A party who
                        is dissatisfied with the decision on its merits cannot use the principles of
                        natural justice to have the decision set aside. In the scheme for
                        adjudication set out by the SOP Act, a respondent who is dissatisfied with
                        an adjudication determination can ask for a review adjudicator or review
                        adjudication panel to be appointed to review the determination. If this is
                        done, then the evidence can be revisited on the review and the review
                        adjudicator may, if he sees fit, make a different decision from that made by
                        the adjudicator. The SOP Act has provided a means for dissatisfied
                        respondents to be reheard and that is the review adjudication; it is not the
                        application to court for setting aside under s 27(5). The court cannot be
                        asked under cover of an allegation of breach of natural justice to review
                        the merits of the adjudicator’s decision.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     I am of the view that the Plaintiff was given
                    a fair opportunity to be heard. There is no evidence to suggest that he was
                    denied an opportunity to be heard. Thus there was no breach of natural
                    justice.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The adjudication determination</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Was the adjudication determination rendered out of time?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     As stated by s 17(1) of the SOP
                    Act:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">17(1) An adjudicator

<p class="Judg-QuoteList-3">(ii)   has failed to pay the response amount,
                                    which has been accepted by the claimant, by the due date;

                                and the respondent.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     In accordance with s 16(1) of the SOP Act, an
                    adjudication is deemed to have commenced after the 7-day time limit for the
                    respondent to file an adjudication response stipulated in s 15(1) has expired.
                    Section 15(1) of the SOP Act provides that the respondent has to file an
                    adjudication response within 7 days after it receives the adjudication
                    application. Since the Plaintiff received the adjudication application on 21
                    November 2013, the last day for filing an adjudication response is 28 November
                    2013.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     The Plaintiff submitted that if the
                    Defendant’s argument that the dispute fell under s 12(1) of the SOP Act
                    (see [37] above), such that it was a dispute as to failure to make payment, then
                    the deadline for the rendering of the adjudication determination would be 7 days
                    after 28 November 2013 (the deadline for filing the adjudication response) in
                    accordance with s 17(1)(a)(ii) of the SOP Act. Therefore, the deadline would be
                    5 December 2013. The adjudication determination rendered on 11 December 2013
                    would be rendered out of time.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     However, as I have rejected the
                    Defendant’s argument that the dispute concerned the failure to make
                    payment (see [40] above), the correct provision to apply would be s 17(1)(b)
                    since this is a dispute as to the payment response itself. Therefore, the
                    deadline would be 14 days after 28 November 2013, which would then be 12
                    December 2013. Therefore, I find that the adjudication rendered on 11 December
                    2013 was within time.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     I would like to further add that s 17(1)(b) of
                    the SOP Act allows the adjudicator to request for more time to submit his
                    adjudication determination with the agreement of the parties. In this case the
                    Defendant had emailed the adjudicator on 5 December 2013 asking whether the
                    adjudicator required more time as it thought that s 17(1)(a) was the operative
                    provision, <em>ie</em> the adjudicator had only 7 days to
                    issue the adjudication determination. The adjudicator was of the view that this
                    case involved a disputed payment response. Thus s 17(1)(b) applied, giving the
                    adjudicator 14 days to issue his adjudication determination. This was
                    communicated to the parties in the adjudicator’s email dated 6 December.
                    The Plaintiff did not express a contrary view. If it did, I am certain that the
                    adjudicator would have requested for more time from the parties. It is
                    therefore, not right for the Plaintiff to now complain that the adjudication
                    determination was rendered out of time.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a>58     Although the adjudication determination was
                    rendered within time, the Defendant’s payment claim is invalid. The
                    Defendant’s adjudication application was also lodged out of time. These
                    are valid grounds for setting aside the adjudication determination and I
                    accordingly allowed the Plaintiff’s application. I would like parties to
                    address me on the issue of costs.</p>
