<p align="justify">Facts</p></b>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">The deceased, Koh Ngiap Yong, a taxi driver, was found in some bushes

along Chestnut Avenue with a number of stab wounds in his chest and neck. A handcuff key

with a metal ring was recovered by police officers at the scene. Following police

investigations, the three appellants were arrested on 15 October 2000. A bayonet was

recovered from the first appellant’s locker at Cathay Bowl at Choa Chu Kang. The

police also found a Smith &amp; Weston revolver, a Colt semi-automatic pistol, three pairs

of handcuffs and a bunch of handcuff keys in his flat. Tests confirmed that the first

appellant’s bayonet had bloodstains and that the blood was that of the deceased. The

handcuff key recovered from the scene of the crime was found to be similar in composition,

make-up, design and dimension to the handcuff keys seized from the first appellant’s

flat. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">It was determined that on 8 August 2000, the three appellants had met

at a coffee shop at West Mall to plan a robbery. During the meeting, the second and third

appellants were each given a bag containing weapons by the first appellant. The appellants

required a vehicle to ferry them away from the scene of the robbery. After failing to find

an unattended vehicle, they flagged down a taxi plying along Bukit Batok. The second

appellant sat on the front seat beside the taxi driver while the other two appellants sat

on the back seats of the taxi, with the third appellant seated directly behind the taxi

driver. The taxi driver was asked to proceed to Chestnut Avenue. At the destination, the

taxi driver was asked to stop the taxi some 200 metres away from the PUB Waterworks main

gate and ordered to get out. The third appellant tapped a bayonet on the taxi

driver’s left side but the latter remained in his seat, saying "I pay, I

pay". The first appellant then pointed his pistol at the taxi driver, who alighted

from the taxi and started to run. However, the third appellant caught hold of him,

handcuffed him and dragged him to the bushes. The third appellant stabbed the taxi driver

in the chest and the neck, after which he removed the handcuffs and stole the taxi

driver’s wallet. The second appellant then ferried his accomplices in the taxi to

Woodlands. Later at Jurong East, they aborted their plan to rob the targeted shop when

they realised that it was fitted with a closed circuit television camera. The second and

third appellants had a haircut to prevent recognition. The taxi was parked in a

multi-storey car park at West Mall. The three appellants then watched a movie, after which

they shared the money in the taxi driver’s wallet and coin box. All the weapons were

returned to the first appellant and the appellants parted ways at the Bukit Batok MRT

station. The trial judge found all the appellants guilty of murder in furtherance of a

common intention, punishable under s 302 read with s 34 of the Penal Code and accordingly

sentenced them to death. The first appellant withdrew his appeal while the second and

third appellants proceeded with their appeal against conviction and sentence. The third

appellant claimed that he was not guilty of murder because he would not have killed the

taxi driver if the first appellant had not pointed a pistol at him and asked him to

"finish off" the victim. The second appellant claimed that his role was solely

to act as the driver of the getaway car to be used during the planned robbery. He did not

know of the presence of the bayonet before the killing nor that the taxi driver would be

killed.</p>
<b xmlns="">
<p align="justify">Held, </p></b>dismissing the second and third appellants’ appeal :

<ol xmlns="">
<li>The trial judge had rightly noted that the question of duress had not been raised in any

    of the third appellant’s statements to the police. He had also aptly pointed out that

    duress is not a defence in the case of murder. The stabbing of the taxi driver with the

    bayonet is certainly within the ambit of s 300 of the Penal Code. Each of the stab wounds

    inflicted on the taxi driver was, by itself, sufficient in the ordinary course of nature

    to cause the taxi driver’s death. As the third appellant intended to inflict the

    fatal injuries on the taxi driver, he was rightly held to be guilty of murder (see ¶

    14-15).</li>
<li>The common intention of the three appellants was to seize a taxi in order to use it as a

    getaway vehicle in their planned robbery. It was also their common intention to rob the

    driver of the taxi of his money. The third appellant’s act of stabbing the victim

    several times was consistent with the three appellant’s common intention of robbing

    the victim of his taxi and his monies. It was in furtherance of their common intention as

    it enabled them to make off with the taxi and the monies without fear of being identified

    by the victim later on (see ¶ 19-20).</li>
<li>Section 34 is applicable even if the second appellant did not witness the commission of

    the crime. Physical presence for the purposes of s 34 includes a situation whereby the

    person stands guard by a gate outside ready to warn his companions about any approach of

    danger or waits in a car on a nearby road to facilitate their escape (see ¶ 21); PP v

<p align="justify"></p></font>1.    The first appellant, Wan Kamil bin Md

Shafian, the second appellant, Ibrahim bin Mohd, and the third appellant, Rosli bin Ahmat,

were jointly tried for the offence of murder. The charge against them was as follows:

<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">That you, Wan Kamil bin Md Shafian, Ibrahim Bin Mohd and Rosli bin

  Ahmat, are charged that you, on or about the 8<sup>th</sup> day of August 2000, at or

  about 11.45 am, along Chestnut Avenue leaving to Bukit Timah Nature Reserve, Singapore, in

  furtherance of the common intention of you all, did commit murder by causing the death of

  one Koh Ngiap Yong (male/42 years old), and you have thereby committed an offence

  punishable under section 302 read with section 34 of the Penal Code, Chapter 224.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">2.    The three appellants were found guilty and were

given the mandatory sentence for murder. During the hearing of their appeals, the first

appellant withdrew his appeal. After considering all the circumstances and the evidence

before us, we dismissed the appeals of the second and third appellants and now set out the

reasons for our decision.</p>
<u xmlns=""><i>
<p align="justify"><br/>

Background</p></i></u>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">3.    On 8 August 2000, a dead body was found in some

bushes along Chestnut Avenue. The deceased, Koh Ngiap Yong, a taxi driver, had a number of

stab wounds in his chest and neck. A handcuff key with a metal ring was recovered by

police officers at the scene. It was estimated that the deceased died some 12 to 24 hours

before his body was discovered.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">4.    Following police investigations, the three

appellants were arrested on 15 October 2000. The police recovered a bayonet from the first

appellant’s locker at Cathay Bowl, which is at a shopping centre at Choa Chu Kang.

They also recovered from his flat a long-barrelled Smith &amp; Weston revolver, a Colt

semi-automatic pistol, three pairs of handcuffs and a bunch of handcuff keys attached to a

small metal ring. A pair of handcuffs was also found in the second appellant’s flat.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">5.    Tests confirmed that the first appellant’s

bayonet had bloodstains and that the blood was that of the deceased. Evidence was tendered

that the handcuff key recovered from the scene of the crime was similar in composition,

make-up, design and dimension to the handcuff keys seized from the first appellant. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">6.    It was determined that on 8 August 2000, the three

appellants met at a coffee shop at West Mall to plan a robbery. The first and second

appellants testified that they had intended to rob Boon Lay Gem Pte Ltd, a jewellery shop

at Jurong East. The third appellant added that he and his accomplices had also talked

about robbing CISCO officers who were carrying cash to ATM machines. During the meeting,

the second and third appellants were each given a bag containing weapons by the first

appellant. The bag for the third appellant contained a bayonet, a pair of handcuffs, a ski

mask and a pair of gloves. The bag for the second appellant contained a long-barrelled

Smith &amp; Wesson revolver, a pair of handcuffs and a ski mask. As for the first

appellant, he was armed with a Colt 45 pistol, which was placed in a pouch around his

waist. He also had a pair of handcuffs, a ski mask, a pair of gloves and a hammer in

another bag.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">7.    The appellants required a vehicle to ferry them

away from the scene of the robbery. They decided to steal an unattended vehicle or to take

over a taxi from a taxi driver. After failing to find an unattended vehicle, they stopped

and boarded a taxi, which was plying along Bukit Batok. The second appellant sat on the

front seat beside the taxi driver while the other two appellants sat on the back seats of

the taxi, with the third appellant seated directly behind the taxi driver.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">8.    The taxi driver was asked to proceed to Chestnut

Avenue. At the destination, the taxi driver was asked to stop the taxi some 200 metres

away from the PUB Waterworks main gate. He was then ordered to get out of the taxi. The

third appellant tapped a bayonet on the taxi driver’s left side but the latter

remained in his seat, saying "I pay, I pay". At this juncture, the first

appellant pointed his pistol at the taxi driver, who alighted from the taxi and started to

run. However, the third appellant caught hold of him, handcuffed him and dragged him

towards the bushes. The taxi driver, who begged for mercy, pointed out that he had a

family. The three appellants gave conflicting versions as to what happened thereafter.

What is undisputed is that the third appellant stabbed the taxi driver in the chest and

the neck, after which he removed the handcuffs and stole the taxi driver’s wallet.

The second appellant then ferried his accomplices in the taxi to Woodlands. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">9.    At Woodlands, the appellants discussed their plans

to rob the jewellery shop. After proceeding to Jurong East, they aborted their plan to rob

the shop in question when they realised that it was fitted with a closed circuit

television camera. Concerned that they might be recognised by the drivers of two vehicles

which had passed by them when the taxi stopped at Chestnut Avenue, the second and third

appellants had a haircut. After that, the three appellants proceeded to West Mall. The

taxi was parked in a multi-storey car park and the appellants watched a movie, after which

they shared the money in the taxi driver’s wallet and coin box. All the weapons were

returned to the first appellant and the appellants went their separate ways when they

reached the Bukit Batok MRT station. </p>
<u xmlns=""><i>
<p align="justify"><br/>

The trial judge’s decision</p>
</i></u>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">10.    Although it was the third appellant who stabbed

the taxi driver to death, the prosecution sought to have all three appellants convicted of

murder on the basis of section 34 of the Penal Code, which provides as follows:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">When a criminal act is done by several persons, in furtherance of the

  common intention of all, each of such persons is liable for that act in the same manner as

  if the act were done by him alone.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">11.    The trial judge held that all three appellants

were guilty. In para 150 of his judgment, he said as follows:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">The common intention of the three accused persons to rob the taxi

  driver of his taxi was not disputed by the defence. Reviewing all the evidence, in my

  determination, the compelling inference was that there was clearly a common intention by

  all three of them not only to rob the taxi driver of his taxi but all his monies and in

  that process to put the taxi driver away for good so that he would not be around to tell

  the police what happened and eventually identify them.</p>
<u><i>
</i></u></blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><br/>

The third appellant’s appeal</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">12.    The third appellant’s appeal will first be

considered. He admitted that he plunged the bayonet into the taxi-driver’s chest and

neck a number of times. Each of the four wounds in the deceased’s chest would have

been sufficient in the ordinary cause of nature to result in his death. All the same, the

third appellant claimed that he was not guilty of murder because he would not have killed

the taxi driver if the first appellant had not pointed a pistol at him and asked him to

"finish off" the victim. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">13.    The third appellant testified that before they

boarded the taxi, the first appellant told him: ‘Li, you have to finish the taxi

driver.’ (p 1090 of the Notes of Evidence). He said that the first appellant, who

instructed him to take the taxi driver to the bushes, stood at the rear of the taxi,

holding a pistol in his hands. The third appellant added that while he was leading the

taxi driver towards the bushes, the latter tripped and fell into a ditch. The first

appellant came over and helped to pull the taxi driver out of the ditch. Whilst in the

bushes, the taxi driver, who tripped and fell again, could not get up. As the third

appellant could not raise the fallen victim by himself, he thought of asking the first

appellant to help him. He said that instead of coming to his assistance, the first

appellant pointed the pistol at him and told him to finish off the taxi driver. The third

appellant claimed that he was afraid that the first appellant would shoot him if he did

not act as instructed. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">14.    The trial judge took the view that the third

appellant’s claim that he acted under duress was a "belated fabrication

concocted to evade the consequences of his mindless and cruel deed". He rightly noted

that the question of duress was not raised in the third appellant’s statements to the

police. He also aptly pointed out that duress is not a defence in the case of murder

because section 94 of the Penal Code provides as follows:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><i>Except murder and offences against the State punishable with death,</i>

  nothing is an offence which is done by a person who is compelled to do it by threats,

  which, at the time of doing it, reasonably cause the apprehension that instant death to

  that person will otherwise be the consequence:</p>
<blockquote>
<i><p align="justify">Provided that the person doing the act did not of his own accord, or

    from a reasonable apprehension of harm to himself short of instant death, place himself in

    the situation he became subject to constraint.</p>
</i>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">15.    The stabbing of the taxi driver in the chest with

the bayonet is certainly within the ambit of section 300 of the Penal Code. The forensic

pathologist testified that each of the stab wounds inflicted on the taxi driver was, by

itself, sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause the taxi driver’s death.

As the third appellant intended to inflict the fatal injuries on the taxi driver, the

trial judge rightly concluded that he was guilty of murder. In the circumstances, his

appeal was dismissed.</p>
<p xmlns=""><u><i><br/>

The second appellant’s appeal</i></u></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">16.    As for the second appellant, the main plank of

his defence was that his role was solely to act as the driver of the getaway car to be

used during the planned robbery. He claimed that he did not know that the taxi driver

would be killed or that the third appellant had a bayonet until the latter re-entered the

taxi after killing the taxi driver. As such, he contended that he played no role in the

murder of the taxi driver.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">17.   The second appellant testified that as soon as the taxi

driver got out of the car, he swiftly got out of the car in order to occupy the

driver’s seat. As he was about to adjust the rear view mirror of the vehicle, he

happened to turn back and observed that the third appellant was holding the victim close

to the bushes. The first appellant was somewhere behind the taxi holding his pistol in his

right hand. The second appellant claimed that he saw nothing else. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">18.    As it was the third appellant who stabbed the

taxi driver, the second appellant will only be guilty of murder if section 34 of the Penal

Code, which concerns common intention, is applicable. This section has been discussed in

innumerable cases. In <i>Mimi Wong &amp; Anor v Public Prosecutor </i>[1972-1974] SLR 73,

79, Wee Chong Jin CJ, who delivered the judgment of the Court of Criminal Appeal, said as

follows:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">The Privy Council in <i>Mahbub Shah </i>(sic) v <i>Emperor </i>AIR 1945

  PC 118 said this of s 34 :</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">Section 34 lays down a principle of joint liability in the doing of a

    criminal act. The section does not say 'the common intentions of all' nor does it say 'an

    intention common to all'. Under the section, the essence of that liability is to be found

    in the existence of a common intention animating the accused leading to the doing of a

    criminal act in furtherance of such intention. To invoke the aid of s 34 successfully, it

    must be shown that the criminal act complained against was done by one of the accused

    persons in furtherance of the common intention of all. If this is shown, then liability

    for the crime may be imposed on any one of the persons in the same manner as if the act

    were done by him alone.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">In an earlier case, <i>Barendra Kumar Ghosh v Emperor </i>AIR 1925 PC 1<i>,

  </i>the Privy Council said :</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">Section 34 deals with the doing of separate acts, similar or diverse,

    by several persons; if all are done in furtherance of a common intention, each person is

    liable for the result of them all, as if he had done them himself, for 'that act' and 'the

    act' in the latter part of the section must include the whole action covered by 'a

    criminal act' in the first part because they refer to it….</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">It is clear from the Privy Council's interpretation of the words

  ‘criminal act’ that it is the result of a criminal act which is a criminal

  offence. It then remains, in any particular case, to find out the actual offence

  constituted by the ‘criminal act’. If the nature of the offence depends on a

  particular intention the intention of the actual doer of the criminal act has to be

  considered. What this intention is will decide the offence committed by him and then s 34

  applies to make the others vicariously or collectively liable for the same offence. The

  intention that is an ingredient of the offence constituted by the criminal act is the

  intention of the actual doer and must be distinguished from the common intention of the

  doer and his confederates. It may be identical with the common intention or it may not.

  Where it is not identical with the common intention, it must nevertheless be consistent

  with the carrying out of the common intention, otherwise the criminal act done by the

  actual doer would not be in furtherance of the common intention.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">19.    From the evidence given by the three appellants,

their common intention was to seize a taxi in order to use it as a getaway vehicle after

robbing a jewellery shop at Jurong East. It was also their common intention to rob the

driver of the taxi of his money. In his statement to the police, the third appellant

stated as follows:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">"At this juncture all of us agreed that we rob a taxi driver and

  at least we can get a couple of hundred dollars. We then flagged a taxi, a cream coloured

  taxi, at Bt Batok."</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">20.    The third appellant’s act of stabbing the

victim several times was consistent with the three appellants’ common intention of

robbing the victim of his taxi and his monies. It was in furtherance of their common

intention as it enabled them to make off with the taxi and the monies and proceed to

Jurong East to carry out their planned robbery at the designated jewellery shop without

fear of being identified by the victim later on. There was ample evidence that the

appellants were afraid of being recognised and identified by anyone. The bags given by the

first appellant to the other appellants contained, inter alia, ski masks and gloves. On

the fateful day, the appellants were armed to their teeth and were prepared to use their

weapons to achieve their goal. They had intended to rob in broad daylight and had even

contemplated robbing armed CISCO guards carrying cash to ATM machines. In these

circumstances, it is unbelievable that they intended the taxi driver no serious harm.

Their claim that they had only intended to tie him up behind the bushes cannot be

believed. In any case, if they had merely intended to tie up the taxi driver, they brought

no rope with them.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">21.    The fact that the second appellant claimed that

he was in the taxi when the taxi driver was stabbed some distance away has not been

overlooked. Section 34 is applicable even if the second appellant did not witness the

commission of the crime. In <i>Public Prosecutor v Gerardine Andrew </i><a class="remove" href1="/scripts/lp/dll/prospect.dll?GetHTML_lpqs&amp;type=1&amp;CaseID=47105&amp;freetext=" target="LWBMainFrame">[1998] 3 SLR 736</a>,

752, this Court stated the position as follows:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">The question whether an accused person must be physically present at

  the actual commission of the offence is … answered in the affirmative. The next

  question which arises for this appeal is whether [the person charged] was physically

  present for the purposes of s 34 when the stabbing took place. The requirement here is

  physical presence at the actual commission of the offence, not physical presence at the

  immediate site when the commission of the offence occurred. In <i>Barendra Kumar Ghosh v

  Emperor </i>AIR 1925 PC 1, a post-master was shot and killed inside a post office. The

  accused said that he was outside the post-office at the time of the shooting. Lord Sumner

  in delivering the judgment of the court observed at p 6, ‘Even if the appellant did

  nothing as he stood outside the door, it is to be remembered that in crimes as in other

  things "they also serve who only stand and wait’. It was noted by Bose J in <i>Shreekantiah</i>

  that an accused need not be present in the actual room. <i>He can, for instance, stand

  guard by a gate outside ready to warn his companions about any approach of danger or wait

  in a car on a nearby road ready to facilitate their escape</i>. What is crucial is that he

  must be physically present at the scene of the occurrence and must actually participate in

  the commission of the offence in some way or other at the time the crime is actually

  committed.</p>
<p align="justify">(emphasis added)</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">22.    As for the second appellant’s claim that he

did not know that the taxi driver would be killed or that there was a bayonet in their

midst before the third appellant re-entered the taxi after killing the taxi driver, the

trial judge found this claim unbelievable. He pointed out that although the second

appellant said that he did not know the contents of the third appellant’s bag, he

admitted that he knew that it contained some weapons. In any case, the trial judge pointed

out that the second appellant must have noticed the bayonet when it was used to tap the

left side<i> </i>of the taxi driver before the latter got out of the taxi. Whether it had

been the left waist or the left shoulder of the victim that had been tapped, the bayonet

was a rather large object and the second appellant’s assertion that he did not notice

it because he was looking at the victim’s face could not be accepted. Within the

close confines of the taxi, the second appellant must have noticed the bayonet. Finally,

the second appellant admitted that he saw the third appellant and the taxi driver when

they were close to the bushes. At that time, the third appellant was holding the bayonet

and the second appellant must have noticed this. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">23.    It was not established that the trial judge erred

when he found the second appellant guilty of the charge faced by him. As such, the second

appellant’s appeal was also dismissed. </p>
