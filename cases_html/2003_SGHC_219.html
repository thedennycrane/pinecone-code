<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 6pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">2<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">         </span> On 19 April 2002 the wife filed Divorce Petition No. 601422 (the Petition) in the Family Court praying for a divorce on the ground of the husband's unreasonable behaviour, which she particularised.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> On 13 May 2002 the husband filed an Answer and Cross-Petition to the Petition.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He denied the wife's allegations set out in the Petition in particular that he had assaulted her or had mentally and physically abused her.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He alleged that it was the wife whose behaviour/conduct was unreasonable, who did not discharge her wifely duties and showed no affection for him, who had refused to have conjugal relationship with him since 1993, and who failed to appreciate what he had done for her and the sons, especially his generosity with money.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The husband cross-petitioned for a divorce and prayed inter alia for joint custody, care and control of the children.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 6pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">3<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">         </span> I should add that after she had filed the Petition, the wife applied to court and obtained, an Expedited Order as well as a Personal Protection Order against the husband.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> She further applied and obtained a maintenance order against him, on 14 June 2002.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 6pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">4<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">         </span> On 14 November 2002, the Family Court granted the wife and husband decrees nisi on their Petition and Cross-Petition respectively.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The district judge ordered that the ancillary matters be dealt with in chambers at a later stage.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 6pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">5<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">         </span> The wife was unhappy with the court's granting a decree nisi on the husband's Cross-Petition on the ground of her unreasonable behaviour and appealed to the High Court.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 6pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">6<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">         </span> The wife's appeal came up for hearing before me on 12 May 2003; I dismissed the appeal and the wife being dissatisfied, has now filed a notice of appeal (in Civil Appeal no. 58 of 2003) against my decision.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span></span></p>

<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 6pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">8<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">         </span> The husband's main grievance against the wife was her refusal to have conjugal relationship with or show any affection or intimate closeness towards, him since 1995 to-date.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> For five (5) years prior thereto, the wife seldom had sex with the husband.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He testified he found it extremely humiliating for her to deny him a normal married life, thereby causing him a great deal of emotional and mental trauma.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Cross-examined, the husband testified he had tried (hundreds of times) since 1994, to have sex with the wife but she used all sorts of excuses to turn him down.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> As the marriage was the second for the husband, he did not want to go through another (unpleasant) divorce.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He therefore decided he would sacrifice himself for the sake of the two (2) sons (over whom the couple had frequent quarrels/disagreements) until they were older and had left home.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Although he did not press the issue of the lack of sexual relationship because of the children, the husband felt over time that the parties could no longer reconcile.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 6pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">9<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">         </span> The wife did not deny the husband's allegation.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Indeed, in her Answer to his Cross-Petition she admitted she had refused to have sex with him even though she knew he felt deprived.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> In her Answer and in her affidavit of evidence-in-chief, she gave various reasons for such refusal:-</span></p>
<p class="Judg-List-1" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 6pt 37.4pt; TEXT-INDENT: -37.4pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">(i)<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">        </span> she alleged that the husband had assaulted her on or about 12 February 1994 (at Shaw Centre carpark) causing her to leave the matrimonial home with the sons and to stay away for 3 days.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> After that assault, she lost all respect and affection for the husband and could not bring herself to have sex with him.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Although she returned to the matrimonial home, it was for the sake of the sons so as not to disrupt their lifestyle and studies, not because of the husband;<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span></span></p>
<p class="Judg-List-1" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 6pt 37.4pt; TEXT-INDENT: -37.4pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">(ii)<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">        </span> after the husband cut her personal allowance to $1,500/- (one of her complaints was that he was tight-fisted), she stopped conjugal relationships with him, as she realised he would not change. She could not bear to have him touch her; she had to have feelings for a person before she engaged in sex and had none for someone she felt had treated her badly.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 6pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">She had however acknowledged (at N/E 2) that the husband maintained the family throughout the years.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Other than refusing to have sex with the husband, the wife claimed she still cooked and washed for the husband (this was disputed by the husband).</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 6pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">10<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">       </span> The court below found the wife gave contradictory testimony in her re-examination when she said (at N/E 27):-</span></p>

<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 6pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">11<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">       </span> The district judge found (in para 13 of her grounds of decision):-</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1" style="MARGIN: 0in 0.5in 6pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">It would appear from the evidence that the wife wanted to keep the marriage but did not want to have sexual relationship with the husband. She perceived that she is not at fault and that she is justified in not having sexual relationship with him. The husband however was unhappy with not having sexual relationship and sought now to terminate the marriage. I am of the opinion that the behaviour of the wife was such that the husband cannot reasonably be expected to live with her.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 6pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">12<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">       </span> The husband's other grounds in his Cross-Petition were, that the wife was violent, hot-tempered, extravagant, very cold and unfriendly towards him; she went to the extent of removing all or most of his photographs from the house.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The marriage had become an empty shell.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Often, he came home tired due to jet lag but the wife paid little attention to him.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The husband also claimed that the wife disliked many of his friends, giving them the cold shoulder when they came to the house so much so that they did not bother to come again.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The wife also disliked his father and his daughter from his first marriage; her behaviour towards them upset him.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> She was extravagant and obsessed with buying things which included having 200 pairs of shoes.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He denied her allegations of violence on his part.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 6pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">13<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">       </span> The wife denied she was hot tempered or violent and, that she had removed most of his photographs.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> If she was uncaring or showed him no affection, she was only doing to him what he did to her.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> She said she disliked only a couple of his friends in Portugal but had never turned away any of his friends in Singapore.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> She had nothing against her husband's daughter but she disliked his father as much as the father disliked her.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> She admitted having 100 pair of shoes in Singapore and 4 pairs in Portugal.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 6pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">14<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">       </span> The court below looked at and applied the principles in, <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Wong Siew Boey v Lee Boon Fatt</i> [1994] 2 SLR 115 (and the English cases cited therein) and concluded that the husband had proved, on a balance of probabilities, that the marriage had broken down irretrievably in that the wife had behaved in a such way that he cannot reasonably be expected to live with her.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Consequently, the district judge granted the husband a decree nisi to be made absolute in three (3) months.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Headg-1" style="MARGIN: 12pt 0in 6pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><strong>The Appeal</strong></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 6pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">15<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">       </span> In her submissions, counsel for the wife pointed out that although the husband alleged that he could not reasonably be expected to live with the wife,<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> he continued to live with the wife up to the date of the hearing of the Appeal.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Hence, nothing had changed over the years.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Counsel contended that the husband filed his Cross-Petition only because her client had filed the Petition.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Counsel argued that the husband had failed to satisfy the requirements of s 95(3)(b) of the Women's Charter Cap 353 (the Act) and his decree nisi ought to be rescinded.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The case of <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Pheasant v Pheasant</i> [1972] 1 All ER 587 was cited for the proposition (per Ormrod J) that the irretrievable breakdown of the marriage must essentially be as at the date of the hearing of the petition, not when the petition was filed.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 6pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">16<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">       </span> Counsel for the respondent pointed out that the court below found as a fact, that the wife knew the husband felt deprived by her refusal to have sexual relations with him since in or about 1993; yet she behaved in a manner she knew would adversely affect the husband.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 6pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">17<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">       </span> Another finding of fact by the district judge was that the wife gave contradictory evidence which cast doubt on her veracity as a witness.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Since the court below had the advantage of seeing the wife and the husband in the witness box, an appellate court should respect the findings made on their testimony.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 6pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">18<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">       </span> Counsel pointed out that the wife obtained an Expedited Order on an ex-parte basis, without the husband giving his version of the facts.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> As for her Personal Protection Order (PPO), he had disputed her application.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> At the hearing, it was agreed between the parties that the PPO would be granted without prejudice to the husband's right to contest the allegations of violence which he had denied.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Consequently, the PPO cannot be construed as proof the husband had been violent against the wife.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> In fact the wife filed several applications at about the same time, as a tactical move to put pressure on the husband to make compromises on the Petition.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 6pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">19<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">       </span> As for the argument that the husband had been tolerating the wife's conduct since 1993 to-date and therefore it cannot be said he finds it intolerable to live with her, his counsel pointed out that the husband is scheduled to retire from Singapore Airlines' services in December this year.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He was/is unable to afford reasonable alternative accommodation for the limited number of days he spends in Singapore in-between his flight schedules, given his heavy financial contributions towards the sons' education, the wife's maintenance ($7,000/- per month), household and other expenses.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He was also anxious to save money in view of his pending retirement.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 6pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">20<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">       </span> The fact that the arguments between them arose mainly over the husband's complaint of the wife's spoiling of the sons (and neglecting him in the process) did not detract from the fact her behaviour was unreasonable.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Counsel cited instances where the wife had been found by the court below to have acted unreasonably, despite the husband's providing well for the family (which the wife admitted), including a maid, a gardener and all amenities in a large landed property.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The wife's allegation that she had to furnish receipts for all her expenditure (since 1994) was not proven.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Indeed, she had been found to be extravagant which was one of the husband's complaints, having 100 pairs of shoes (by her own admission).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> This was also substantiated by her need for monthly maintenance of $7,000/-, excluding living expenses for the sons and household expenses.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Her expenditure was in sharp contrast to the husband's of $1,500 to $2,000 per month; he wanted her to be less extravagant in view of his pending retirement.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Headg-1" style="MARGIN: 12pt 0in 6pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><strong>The decision</strong></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 6pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">21<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">       </span> I start by referring to the case cited and relied on by the court below, that of <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Wong Siew Boey v Lee Boon Fatt</i> (para 13 <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">supra</i>).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> There, the court spelt out the following tests:-</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1" style="MARGIN: 0in 0.5in 6pt 74.8pt; TEXT-INDENT: -38.8pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">(i)<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">         </span> the question whether the petitioner finds it intolerable to live with the respondent must be answered subjectively; whether his/her attitude is reasonable is irrelevant;<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1" style="MARGIN: 0in 0.5in 6pt 74.8pt; TEXT-INDENT: -37.4pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">(ii)<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">        </span> in dealing with behaviour, the relevant question is whether the petitioner can reasonably be expected to live with the respondent.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> It is for the court to answer this, using an objective test, having regard to the personalities of the individuals before it, however far these may be removed from some theoretical norm, in the light of the whole history of the marriage and their relationship;</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1" style="MARGIN: 0in 0.5in 6pt 74.8pt; TEXT-INDENT: -37.4pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">(iii)<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">       </span> the court must look at behaviour by taking into account the cumulative effect of behaviour.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Any conduct, active or passive, constitutes behaviour.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The behaviour is not confined to behaviour towards the respondent: the behaviour may have relevance to the marriage although it is towards other members of the family or towards outsiders.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Any and all behaviour may be taken into account, including omissions, where it has reference to the marriage.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 6pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">I was of the view that the district judge correctly applied the above guidelines when she granted the husband a decree nisi on the Cross-Petition; consequently I dismissed the wife's appeal.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 6pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">22<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">       </span> The governing principle in appeals must be borne in mind — the court below had the advantage of seeing the couple's demeanour when they testified; it was in the best position to assess the veracity of the wife and husband.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Having made that assessment, the court below preferred the testimony of the husband.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> A court sitting in an appellate capacity should be slow to go against the findings of fact made by a trial judge save in exceptional circumstances, which were not present in this case.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I was therefore not prepared to depart from the findings made by the court below.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 6pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">23<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">       </span> The impression I gained from evaluating the notes of evidence of the hearing below was, that the wife's behaviour was indeed unreasonable; the husband had thus satisfied the subjective test set out in <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Wong Siew Boey's</i> case, under s 95(3)(b) of the Act which states:-</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1" style="MARGIN: 0in 0.5in 6pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">The court hearing a petition for divorce shall not hold the marriage to have broken down irretrievably unless the petitioner satisfies the court of one or more of the following facts:-</span></p>
