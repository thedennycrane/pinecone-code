Hence, the general rule on costs under O 22A r 9(3) would apply if two conditions are satisfied:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) the OTS was not withdrawn and had not expired before the disposal of the claim (the “Validity Requirement”); and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) the judgment is not more favourable than the terms of the OTS (the “Favourability Requirement”). </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The Validity Requirement</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">16 It is not in dispute that the respondents did not withdraw the OTS at any time. However, NTUC Foodfare claims that the OTS expired upon the conclusion of the trial. We disagree. Here, the OTS did not specify a time for acceptance. Order 22A r 3(5), which provides for this scenario, states:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(5) Where an offer to settle <span class="font-italic">does not specify a time for acceptance</span>, it may be accepted <span class="font-italic">at any time before the Court disposes of the matter</span> in respect of which it is made. [emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">17 Under O 22A r 3(5), the OTS remained open for acceptance “at any time before the Court <span class="font-italic">dispose[d] of the matter</span> in respect of which it [was] made” [emphasis added]. It is settled law that for the purposes of O 22A r 9(3)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>), “the disposal of the claim” refers to the final disposal of the claim on appeal if an appeal is filed: see <span class="font-italic">Man B&amp;W Diesel S E Asia Pte Ltd </span><span class="font-italic">and another v PT Bumi International Tankers and another appeal</span> [2004] 3 SLR(R) 267 at [20] and <span class="font-italic">Ram Das V N P v SIA Engineering Co Ltd</span> [2015] 3 SLR 267 at [73]. In our judgment, the phrase “dispos[al] of the matter” in O 22A r 3(5) must be interpreted consistently with O 22A r 9(3)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) to refer to the final disposal of the claim on appeal where there is an appeal. We therefore conclude that under O 22A r 3(5), the OTS remained open for acceptance until 19 July 2018, when we issued the Judgment which finally disposed of the claim. Hence, the Validity Requirement is satisfied. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The Favourability Requirement </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">18 As noted above, we held in the Judgment that the respondents are liable for the sum of S$176,176.85 and interest at 5.33% per annum on the said sum from the date of the writ to the date of the Judgment. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">19 Order 22A r 9(4) of the Rules of Court provides that in deciding whether the judgment is more favourable than the terms of an OTS, the court should only consider interest awarded in respect of <span class="font-italic">the period before service of the </span><span class="font-italic">OTS</span>. Interest at 5.33% per annum on the sum of S$176,176.85 from 7 December 2015 until 11 May 2017 (before the OTS was served on 12 May 2017) amounts to S$13,429.31. Adding this sum to S$176,176.85 yields the sum of S$189,606.16.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">20 The respondents submit that the Favourability Requirement is satisfied because S$189,606.16 is less than the Settlement Sum of S$225,000. On the other hand, NTUC Foodfare contends that the Favourability Requirement has not been satisfied because once costs and disbursements are taken into account, the terms of the OTS are less favourable than the judgment. Thus, the narrow point which we have to decide is whether we should take into account the costs and disbursements that NTUC Foodfare incurred up to the date of the service of the OTS in assessing the relative favourability of the OTS and the judgment. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(1) The test of favourability</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">21 In <span class="font-italic">CCM Industrial Pte Ltd v </span><span class="font-italic">Uniquetech Pte Ltd</span> [2009] 2 SLR(R) 20, Chan Sek Keong CJ made the following pertinent remarks at [40] on the test of favourability under O 22A r 9(3)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… The word “favourable” <span class="font-italic">has to be interpreted in the context in which it is used</span>. <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">What is favourable has to be determined on the terms of the offer to settle</span>, and it may contain many terms. <span class="font-italic">In an ordinary case of a debt or damages claim, </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">it would </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">apply to the sum offered, although not only to the sum offered</span>. In <span class="font-italic">Singapore Airlines Ltd</span>, the Court of Appeal was concerned only with the sum offered in the offer to settle, comparing it with the judgment sum. In that situation, it is easy to see which is more favourable in terms of the amount. The Court of Appeal insisted on absolute certainty in numbers. That is a reasonable approach where the only term is the amount offered. But r 9(3) goes beyond that. The statement in <span class="font-italic">Singapore Airlines Ltd</span> should be read in that light. In an offer to settle which contains many terms, <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">the sum offered in settlement is only one factor to be taken into account in determining whether the plaintiff’s judgment is more favourable than the offer to settle</span>. [emphasis added in italics and bold italics]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">22 In this passage, Chan CJ emphasised that all of the terms of the OTS are critical in determining whether the Favourability Requirement is satisfied and that even in a claim for damages, the settlement sum stated in the OTS would not be the only relevant factor. We agree with and endorse these propositions.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">23 In our judgment, where a defendant makes an OTS proposing to pay the plaintiff a sum of money in settlement of the dispute, one factor that is relevant to the Favourability Requirement is whether the OTS makes separate provision for the plaintiff to be paid its costs (up to the date of the OTS). If the OTS does not do so, the court should account for the costs incurred by the plaintiff up to the date of the OTS in determining if the Favourability Requirement is satisfied.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 Such an approach was taken by the High Court in <span class="font-italic">LK Ang Construction Pte Ltd v Chubb Singapore Pte Ltd (judgment on costs)</span> [2004] 1 SLR(R) 134 (“<span class="font-italic">LK Ang</span>”). In that case, the defendant had filed an OTS proposing to pay the plaintiff S$30,000 inclusive of costs to settle their dispute. The plaintiff did not accept the OTS. It then obtained judgment in the sum of S$15,424.84 (inclusive of interest). Kan Ting Chiu J held at [14] that it was necessary to account for the plaintiff’s costs up to the date of service of the OTS when examining the Favourability Requirement. It was unclear whether the Favourability Requirement was made out on the evidence before the court. Kan J therefore ordered at [22] that the plaintiff tax its costs on the standard basis up to the date of the OTS, and that the general rule under O 22A r 9(3) would apply if the sum of the plaintiff’s costs and the judgment sum was less than S$30,000. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 In our judgment, the broad approach taken in <span class="font-italic">LK Ang</span> is consistent with the scheme and operation of O 22A r 9(3) for the following reasons.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Order 22A r 9(3) sets out a general rule that the defendant should be awarded costs on an indemnity basis from the date on which the OTS was served if the conditions of O 22A rr 9(3)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) and 9(3)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) are satisfied. The rule is based on the notion that where those conditions are fulfilled, the plaintiff should have chosen one option (accepting the OTS) over another option (proceeding to judgment), <span class="font-italic">on the date</span><span class="font-italic"> that the OTS was served</span>. That is why O 22A r 9(3) provides for the defendant to be awarded costs on an indemnity basis from that date. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Order 22A r 9(3)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) requires the court to compare the judgment and the terms of the OTS. This comparison is to be made <span class="font-italic">as of the date of the OTS</span>. Hence, O 22A r 9(4) provides that the court should only consider interest awarded in respect of the period <span class="font-italic">before</span> the OTS was served in deciding whether the Favourability Requirement is satisfied (see [19] above). </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) In our judgment, since O 22A r 9(3) is based on the notion that the plaintiff should have chosen one option (accepting the OTS) over another option (proceeding to judgment), the comparison under O 22A r 9(3)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) must be between like and like. Hence, the starting point is to examine the terms of the OTS. The analysis will depend on the terms:</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(i) Where the OTS states a monetary sum, but is either silent on interest and costs, or states that the settlement sum is inclusive of interest and costs, or states that each party shall bear its own costs, it should be interpreted as an “all-in” offer inclusive of interest and costs. For the comparison to be between like and like, since the settlement sum is inclusive of interest and costs, the court should compare the judgment sum <span class="font-italic">together with interest and costs up to the date of the OTS</span> with the settlement sum. In <span class="font-italic">LK Ang</span>, Kan J indicated at [22] that the appropriate measure of the plaintiff’s costs was the plaintiff’s (party-and-party) costs, assessed on a standard basis, up to the date of the OTS. We agree that this is the appropriate measure, albeit we add the following. Where the judgment sum does not exceed the District Court limit or the Magistrate’s Court limit, the costs should generally be assessed on the applicable State Courts scale, unless there was sufficient reason for bringing the action in the High Court or (one of) the defendant(s) objected to the transfer of the action to a State Court: see ss 39(1) and 39(4) of the State Courts Act (Cap 321, 2007 Rev Ed) and O 59 r 27(5) of the Rules of Court.</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(ii) On the other hand, where the OTS provides for the plaintiff to receive a fixed sum <span class="font-italic">plus</span> interest and costs, it would typically suffice for the court to compare the judgment sum (without accounting for interest and costs) with the fixed sum in the OTS to determine whether the Favourability Requirement is satisfied.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 We acknowledge that we did not expressly articulate the approach laid down above in other OTS cases which have come before this court. However, in those cases, the costs incurred by the plaintiff up to the date of the OTS were immaterial to the issue of whether the Favourability Requirement was satisfied:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) In <span class="font-italic">Singapore Airlines Ltd v Tan </span><span class="font-italic">Shwu Leng</span> [2001] 3 SLR(R) 439, the plaintiff obtained judgment in the sum of S$352,279.33 (including interest). The defendants had offered to settle the dispute for S$350,000. Even without accounting for the plaintiff’s costs up to the date of the OTS, the judgment sum of<span class="font-italic"> </span>S$352,279.33 already exceeded the settlement sum of S$350,000. The Favourability Requirement was clearly not satisfied and hence the necessity to examine the costs incurred up to the date of the service of the OTS simply did not arise.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The converse situation arose in <span class="font-italic">Clarke Beryl Claire (personal representative of the estate of Eugene Francis Clarke, deceased) and others v </span><span class="font-italic">SilkAir (Singapore) Pte Ltd</span> [2002] 1 SLR(R) 1136. There, the defendant was held to have been entitled to limit its liability to each plaintiff to US$75,000. The defendant had offered to settle the claims for S$332,000 each. The Court of Appeal held at [64] that the plaintiffs had failed to obtain a judgment that was more favourable than the OTS, without considering the costs incurred by the plaintiffs. In our view, however, given the gulf between the sums of US$75,000 and S$332,000, the Favourability Requirement was clearly satisfied even if the plaintiffs’ costs (to the date of the OTS) had been accounted for. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 By contrast, in this case, the costs incurred by NTUC Foodfare are material to the question of whether the Favourability Requirement is satisfied. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(2) Application of the law</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 The OTS states a Settlement Sum of S$225,000 with no further provision for interest or costs. The judgment sum, accounting for interest up to the date of the OTS, amounts to S$189,606.16 (see [19] above).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 The difference between the OTS and S$189,606.16 is S$35,393.84. For the following reasons, we are satisfied that NTUC Foodfare’s costs up to 12 May 2017, assessed on a standard basis, would have exceeded this sum:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) In terms of disbursements, NTUC Foodfare’s disbursements up to 12 May 2017 amounted to S$27,640.41 or S$33,140.41 (depending on whether a later refund of hearing fees is accounted for).

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div></div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) In terms of costs, even if we accept that the correct sum for disbursements is the lower sum of S$27,640.41, we are satisfied that costs would have far exceeded S$7,753.43 (the difference between S$35,393.84 and S$27,640.41), given that the OTS was served after all of the AEICs had been filed and much of the preparatory work for the trial was completed (see [6] above). This would have been the case regardless of whether the costs were assessed on the High Court scale or on the District Court scale (the Judgment Sum here was less than S$250,000, which is the District Court limit).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 Therefore, once NTUC Foodfare’s costs up to the date of the OTS are accounted for, the OTS was less favourable than the judgment. We therefore conclude that the Favourability Requirement is not satisfied. It follows that the rule on costs under O 22A r 9(3) of the Rules of Court is not engaged.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The appropriate orders on costs</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 In the premises, we are satisfied that costs should follow the event, although a discount should be applied because NTUC Foodfare did not succeed in full. Before turning to the appropriate costs orders, however, we address NTUC Foodfare’s argument that it should be awarded costs on an indemnity basis from the date of the <span class="font-italic">Calderbank</span> Offer, on the basis that the terms of the <span class="font-italic">Calderbank</span> Offer were more favourable to the respondents than the Judgment Sum. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 This submission would have been compelling if the costs incurred by NTUC Foodfare after the date of the <span class="font-italic">Calderbank</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>Offer were wholly attributable to the respondents’ failure to accept that offer. However, we do not accept this premise. As we have noted, the OTS, which was more favourable to NTUC Foodfare than the <span class="font-italic">Calderbank</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>Offer, did not expire upon the conclusion of the trial. It remained open for acceptance by NTUC Foodfare until the disposal of the appeal. Hence, having decided after the trial that it was prepared to accept the sum of S$176,176.85 in settlement of the dispute, NTUC Foodfare could have simply accepted the OTS. This would have concluded the matter. Yet NTUC Foodfare did not so. It appears that this was because NTUC Foodfare did not realise that the OTS was still open for acceptance. This is consistent with NTUC Foodfare’s costs submissions before us. In this light, the costs incurred by NTUC Foodfare after it served the <span class="font-italic">Calderbank</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>Offer did not arise solely because the respondents failed to accept that offer. They are also attributable to NTUC Foodfare’s failure to accept the OTS which remained valid for acceptance. It is therefore inappropriate to award NTUC Foodfare indemnity costs from the date of the <span class="font-italic">Calderbank</span> Offer. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 We now state and explain our orders on costs:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) <span class="font-italic">The costs of the appeal</span>: According to its Costs Schedule, NTUC Foodfare incurred costs of S$50,000 for the appeal, with disbursements of S$7,000 (for a total of S$57,000).

</div> On one hand, NTUC Foodfare failed in its claims for certain losses (“the Rebuilding Losses”). On the other hand, most of the time at the appeal hearing was spent on the issue of whether a duty of care arose, on which NTUC Foodfare succeeded.

</div> and we agree, that much of the time at the trial was spent on factual issues pertaining to the Rebuilding Losses. We therefore consider that it would be appropriate to apply a higher discount of 40%. Hence, NTUC Foodfare should receive 60% of its costs below to be taxed on the District Court scale if not agreed. In arriving at this conclusion, we had regard to our decision in <span class="font-italic">Koh</span><span class="font-italic"> Sin Chong Freddie v Chan Cheng Wah Bernard and others and another appeal</span> [2013] 4 SLR 629. In that case, we awarded S$50,000 in damages to each plaintiff. We then held at [89], “in accordance with the spirit that a party should not have to incur costs other than what is warranted by the substance or magnitude of the claim”, that each plaintiff would only be entitled to costs on the applicable Subordinate Courts scale. In our judgment, the same reasoning applied here. Since the Judgment Sum was less than the District Court limit of S$250,000 (but more than the Magistrate’s Court limit of S$60,000), the applicable scale would be the District Court scale.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 We thus award NTUC Foodfare costs of the appeal fixed at S$30,000 inclusive of disbursements, and 60% of its costs below, assessed on a standard basis, to be taxed on the District Court scale if not agreed. </div><div class="Judg-Sign text-left">Sundaresh Menon       Steven Chong      Quentin Loh<br/>Chief Justice         Judge of Appeal      Judge </div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">N Sreenivasan SC, Palaniappan Sundararaj, N K Rajarh and Cheong Wei Yang, Daryl (Straits Law Practice LLC) for the appellant;<br/>Kwek Yiu Wing Kevin, Tan Yiting Gina and Charmaine Elizabeth Ong Wan Qi (Legal Solutions LLC)) for the respondents. </div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>

<p><em><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">NTUC Foodfare Co-operative Ltd v SIA Engineering Co Ltd and another<br/>
Civil Appeal No 207 of 2017</span></em></p>
<p><font face="Calibri">--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</font></p>
<p><strong><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">Decision of the Court of Appeal (delivered by Judge of Appeal Steven Chong):</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">Outcome:<em> CoA awards costs of appeal and proceedings below to appellant after considering offer to settle filed by respondents and Calderbank offer filed by appellant</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">1          On 19 July 2018, the Court of Appeal allowed Civil Appeal No 207 of 2017 in part and directed the parties to file written submissions on the costs for the proceedings below and the appeal, unless the parties came to an agree309683ment on costs.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">2          The present judgment dealt with the costs of the appeal and the proceedings below.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">Facts</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">3          On 12 May 2017, before the trial below began, the respondents served an offer to settle (“OTS”) on the appellant (“NTUC Foodfare”) proposing to pay the latter $225,000 in settlement of the dispute. The OTS stated that there would be no order as to costs.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">4          NTUC Foodfare did not accept the OTS. However, on 16 April 2018, after the trial, but before the hearing of the appeal, NTUC Foodfare wrote a letter to the respondents stating that it was prepared to accept a total sum of $176,176.85 (all in) in settlement of the dispute (“the <em>Calderbank </em>Offer”). The respondents did not accept the <em>Calderbank</em> Offer.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">5          On 19 July 2018, the Court of Appeal allowed the appeal in part, holding that the respondents were liable to NTUC Foodfare in the sum of $176,176.85 and interest at 5.33% per annum on the said sum from the date of the writ to the date of the judgment.         </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">Decision</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">6          Order 22A r 9(3) of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2014 Rev Ed) set out a general rule on costs that would apply here if two conditions were satisfied (at <strong>[15]</strong>). The first condition was that the OTS was not withdrawn and had not expired before the disposal of the claim (the “Validity Requirement”). The second condition was that the judgment was not more favourable than the terms of the OTS (the “Favourability Requirement”). </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">7          In relation to the Validity Requirement, the Court of Appeal held that this requirement was fulfilled. The OTS remained open for acceptance until 19 July 2018, when the Court of Appeal finally disposed of the claim (at <strong>[17]</strong>).  </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">8          In relation to the Favourability Requirement, the Court of Appeal held that where a defendant made an OTS proposing to pay the plaintiff a sum of money in settlement of the dispute, and the OTS did not make separate provision for the plaintiff to be paid its costs (up to the date of the OTS), the court should account for such costs in determining whether the Favourability Requirement was satisfied (at <strong>[23]</strong>). Here, once NTUC Foodfare’s costs up to the date of the OTS were accounted for, the OTS was less favourable than the judgment. Therefore, the Favourability Requirement was not satisfied. It followed that the rule on costs under O 22A r 9(3) of the Rules of Court was not engaged (at <strong>[30]</strong>).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">9          The court rejected NTUC Foodfare’s argument that it should be awarded costs on an indemnity basis from the date of the <em>Calderbank </em>Offer. The costs incurred by NTUC Foodfare after it served the <em>Calderbank</em> Offer did not arise solely because the respondents failed to accept that offer, but were also attributable to NTUC Foodfare’s failure to accept the OTS (at <strong>[32]</strong>). </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">10        In the result, the court awarded NTUC Foodfare costs of the appeal fixed at $30,000 inclusive of disbursements and 60% of its costs below, assessed on a standard basis, to be taxed on the District Court scale if not agreed (at <strong>[34]</strong>). </span></p>
