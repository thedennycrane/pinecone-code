<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       This is an appeal against the decision of
                    Assistant Registrar Leong Kwang Ian (“assistant registrar”)
                    ordering that a sum of money from the Central Provident Fund
                    (“CPF”) which was paid to the Official Assignee as the trustee in
                    bankruptcy of the appellant, Mdm Lim Lye Hiang (“LLH”), be
                    divisible among and payable to her creditors.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Background Facts</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       On 9 January 1998, a bankruptcy order was
                    made against LLH. On 18 September 2008, the CPF Board sent a letter to LLH
                    to inform her that she had been nominated to receive the CPF monies and the
                    Singtel discounted shares of her late sister, Mdm Lim Lye Keow
                    (“LLH’s nominated CPF monies”). Mdm Lim Lye Keow had
                    passed away on 14 March 2008. This letter was copied to the Official
                    Assignee, who has no record of having received this letter at that time. It is
                    unclear from the record when Mdm Lim Lye Keow made the nomination. Almost a
                    year later, on 26 June 2009, the CPF Board sent an email to the Official
                    Assignee’s officers, requesting for the Official Assignee’s
                    instruction on the transfer of LLH’s nominated CPF monies. The Official
                    Assignee similarly has no record of having received this email.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       On 13 November 2009, LLH was discharged by
                    an order of court made pursuant to s 124 of the Bankruptcy Act
                    (Cap 20, 2009 Rev Ed) (“Bankruptcy Act”). At the time of
                    the application for discharge, because the Official Assignee remained unaware
                    that LLH had become entitled to LLH’s nominated CPF monies, it failed to
                    alert the court to the same. However, due to the objection of a creditor, for
                    reasons which are not relevant to the present appeal, the Official Assignee
                    delayed the distribution of her assets to her creditors and the sending of a
                    notification to LLH of the fact that she had been discharged by the
                    court.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       Thereafter, on 14 January 2010, the CPF
                    Board again emailed the Official Assignee referring to its previous letter dated
                    18 September 2008 and email dated 26 June 2009, and requested for
                    instructions to transfer LLH’s nominated CPF monies to the Official
                    Assignee. The monies amounting to $102,614.84, which included money standing to
                    Mdm Lim Lye Keow’s credit during her lifetime, and the proceeds from
                    the sale of her Singtel discounted shares, were eventually transferred to the
                    Official Assignee on 2 March 2010.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       On 12 May 2010, the Official Assignee filed
                    a summons seeking an order, <em>inter alia</em>, in the
                    following terms:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">1) That [LLH’s nominated CPF monies] be divisible among her
                        creditors and payable to them as dividends, on the basis that they are
                        property which had devolved on [LLH] on 14 March 2008 (which was the
                        date of her sister’s death and before [LLH]’s discharge from
                        bankruptcy) notwithstanding that the CPF monies were received by the
                        Official Assignee after her discharge.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">.....</p>
<p class="Judg-1">At the hearing before the assistant registrar on 25 June 2010,
                    the Official Assignee contended and the assistant registrar accepted that,
                    pursuant to s 15(5) of the Central Provident Fund Act (Cap 36,
                    2001 Rev Ed) (“CPF Act”), LLH had become <em>entitled to withdraw</em> LLH’s nominated CPF monies upon
                    Mdm Lim Lye Keow’s death on 14 March 2008, which was before
                    LLH’s discharge. Having regard to:</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(i)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">Section 78(1) of the Bankruptcy Act, which
                            provides that all property that devolves on the bankrupt before his
                            discharge is divisible; and</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(ii)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">the definition of property in s 2 of the
                            Bankruptcy Act, which includes “money, goods, things in action,
                            land and every description of property wherever situated and also
                            obligations and every description of interest, whether present or future
                            or vested or contingent, arising out of or incidental to,

<p class="Judg-1">the assistant registrar held that the right to withdraw LLH’s
                    nominated CPF monies constituted “property” which devolved on LLH
                    before her discharge and therefore vested in the Official Assignee and became
                    divisible among her creditors.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The legal significance of a bankrupt’s discharge on the vesting
                of assets in the Official Assignee</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       By way of background, it is useful to first set
                    out the relevant provisions of the Bankruptcy Act. Section 75(a) of the
                    Bankruptcy Act provides that the bankruptcy of a person who has been adjudged
                    bankrupt by a bankruptcy order commences on the day on which the bankruptcy
                    order is made. Section 75(b) provides that bankruptcy terminates upon a
                    bankrupt’s discharge. Sub-sections 76(1)(a) and (b) of the Bankruptcy Act
                    are of particular relevance to the present appeal, and they provide that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>Effect of bankruptcy order</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>76</b>. —(1) On the making of a bankruptcy
                        order —</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(a) the property of the bankrupt shall —</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(i) vest in the Official Assignee without any further conveyance,
                            assignment or transfer; and</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(ii) become divisible among his creditors;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(b) the Official Assignee shall be constituted receiver of the
                        bankrupt’s property;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">...</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       In s 2 of the Bankruptcy Act,
                    “property” is defined non-exhaustively to include things in
                    action, and also every description of interest, whether present or future or
                    vested or contingent, arising out of or incidental to property. Reading the
                    definition of “property” in s 2 with s 76(1)(a) of the
                    Bankruptcy Act, anything which falls within the definition of
                    “property” in s 2 belonging to a bankrupt on the date of the
                    making of a bankruptcy order will vest in the Official Assignee and become
                    available for distribution among his creditors.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       Sub-sections 76(1)(a) and (b) should also be
                    read together with s 78(1) of the Bankruptcy Act, which describes the
                    property which is divisible among a bankrupt’s creditors, subject to
                    certain exceptions listed in s 78(2) of the Bankruptcy Act (which are
                    irrelevant to the present appeal). Section 78 of the Bankruptcy Act provides as
                    follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>Description of bankrupt’s property divisible
                            amongst creditors</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>78</b>. —(1) The property of the bankrupt
                        divisible among his creditors (referred to in this Act as the
                        bankrupt’s estate) shall comprise —</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(a) all such property as belongs to or is vested in the bankrupt at the
                        commencement of his bankruptcy <em>or is acquired by or

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(b) the <em>capacity to exercise and to take proceedings
                            for exercising all such powers in or over or in respect of
                            property</em> as might have been exercised by the bankrupt for his
                        own benefit at the commencement of his bankruptcy or <em>before his discharge</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(2) Subsection (1) shall not apply to —</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(a) property held by the bankrupt on trust for any other person;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(b) the tools, if any, of his trade;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(c) such clothing, bedding, furniture, household equipment and provisions
                        as are necessary for satisfying the basic domestic needs of the bankrupt and
                        his family; and</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(d) property of the bankrupt which is excluded under any other written
                        law.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The effect of ss 76(1)(a) and 78(1)(a) is that property which (a)
                    belongs to the bankrupt at the commencement of bankruptcy (which, according to
                    s 75(a) of the Bankruptcy Act, is the date of the bankruptcy order) and
                    which vests in the Official Assignee upon the court making a bankruptcy order as
                    a result of the operation of s 76(1)(a)(i); or (b) is acquired by or
                    devolves upon the bankrupt before his or her discharge will be divisible among
                    the bankrupt’s creditors. Section 78(1)(b) clarifies that things in action
                    form part of the property of the bankrupt which are divisible in bankruptcy
                    among creditors.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       Subject to certain exceptions (which are not
                    applicable here), a discharge from bankruptcy has the effect of releasing the
                    bankrupt from all debts provable in bankruptcy, but does not have the effect of
                    rendering the Official Assignee’s functions spent. Section 127(1) of the
                    Bankruptcy Act provides that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>Effect of discharge</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>127</b>. —(1) Subject to this section and
                        any condition imposed by the court under section 124 or 126, where a
                        bankrupt is discharged, the discharge shall release him from all his debts
                        provable in the bankruptcy but shall have no effect —</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(a) on the functions (so far as they remain to be carried out) of the
                        Official Assignee; or</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(b) on the operation, for the purposes of the carrying out of those
                        functions, of the provisions of this Act.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Thus, even after the bankrupt’s discharge, the Official Assignee
                    remains duty-bound to continue to collect all the assets of the bankrupt which
                    are divisible among creditors (as set out in ss 76(1)(a) and 78(1)(a) and
                    (b)) and to distribute the proceeds from the realisation of such property to
                    creditors who have proved their debts. The law imposes a legal obligation on the
                    bankrupt to assist in the fulfilment of the Official Assignee’s functions
                    even after his discharge on pain of a fine or revocation of his discharge. The
                    discharged bankrupt’s obligation is provided for in s 128 of the
                    Bankruptcy Act, which provides that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>Discharged bankrupt to give
                        assistance</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>128</b>. —(1) A discharged bankrupt shall,
                            <em>notwithstanding his discharge</em>, give
                        assistance as the Official Assignee requires in the <em>realisation and distribution of such of his property as is vested in
                            the Official Assignee</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(2) If the discharged bankrupt fails to give assistance to the Official
                        Assignee under subsection (1) —</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(a) he shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on conviction to
                        a fine not exceeding $10,000; and</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(b) the court may, if it thinks fit, revoke his discharge, but without
                        prejudice to the validity of any sale, disposition or payment duly made, or
                        thing duly done subsequent to the discharge, but before its
                        revocation.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The parties’ arguments</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     LLH’s main argument in this appeal is
                    that LLH’s nominated CPF monies did not devolve upon LLH immediately upon
                    the death of Mdm Lim Lye Keow. Counsel for LLH submits that in the absence
                    of authorisation from the CPF Board for the withdrawal of the monies prior to
                    LLH’s discharge, LLH’s nominated CPF monies were not payable to LLH,
                    and therefore did not amount to property within the meaning of s 78(1) of
                    the Bankruptcy Act. Counsel for LLH contends that since LLH’s nominated
                    CPF monies only devolved upon LLH after the date of her discharge, they did not
                    vest in the Official Assignee and were not divisible among LLH’s
                    creditors. Alternatively, even if LLH had become entitled to LLH’s
                    nominated CPF monies prior to her discharge from bankruptcy, counsel for LLH
                    submits that s 24(4) of the CPF Act, which provides that a bankrupt’s
                    CPF contributions shall not be subject to his debts in bankruptcy, applies to
                    LLH’s nominated CPF monies. Therefore, LLH’s nominated CPF monies
                    did not pass to the Official Assignee. Finally, counsel for LLH submits that
                    since the Official Assignee had given LLH an unconditional discharge, the
                    Official Assignee had lost its right to claim that LLH’s nominated CPF
                    monies was divisible among creditors, being property which was acquired by or
                    devolved upon LLH during her bankruptcy.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     In contrast, the Official Assignee essentially
                    argues that the assistant registrar’s decision was correct. The Official
                    Assignee urges this court to take the view that LLH’s entitlement to
                    withdraw LLH’s nominated CPF monies was a type of property which had
                    accrued on 14 March 2008, the date on which Mdm Lim Lye Keow passed
                    away, and that the date on which the relevant monies were paid out by the CPF
                    Board to the Official Assignee was irrelevant to the question of whether the
                    monies had vested in the Official Assignee before LLH’s
                discharge.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The issues raised</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     To my mind, the parties’ submissions are
                    at cross purposes because their submissions are not in relation to the same kind
                    of property. It appears to me that the arguments made by counsel for LLH assume
                    that the Official Assignee was <em>only</em> claiming the
                    right to distribute to creditors the <em>actual monies</em>
                    paid out to the Official Assignee on 2 March 2010, which was subsequent to
                    her discharge on 13 November 2009. However, that assumption seems mistaken given
                    that the thrust of the Official Assignee’s submission is that it is
                    asserting that as LLH’s trustee in bankruptcy, it had the right to
                    exercise LLH’s <em>entitlement to withdraw LLH’s
                        nominated CPF monies</em>, which LLH had acquired during her
                    bankruptcy on 14 March 2008, twenty months prior to the date of her
                    discharge.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     As mentioned earlier, the definition of
                    property in s 2 of the Bankruptcy Act is framed widely, to include
                    “money, goods, <em>things in action</em>, land and
                    every description of property wherever situated and also obligations and
                        <em>every description of interest, whether present or future
                        or vested or contingent</em>, arising out of or incidental to,
                    property”. By virtue of s 78(1)(a) of the Bankruptcy Act, anything
                    falling within the definition of “property” in s 2 is
                    divisible among creditors if it belongs to the bankrupt at the commencement of
                    bankruptcy or is acquired by or devolves upon the bankrupt before her discharge
                    (see above, at <a href="#p1_8">[8]</a>). Thus, the first issue
                    arising in this appeal should be framed as: whether LLH’s entitlement to
                    withdraw LLH’s nominated CPF monies, which arose during the period of her
                    bankruptcy, was property divisible among creditors within the meaning of
                    s 78(1), read with the definition of “property” in s 2
                    of the Bankruptcy Act. The fact that LLH’s entitlement to withdraw was
                    exercised by the Official Assignee on LLH’s behalf after her discharge had
                    no impact on the question of whether such entitlement to withdraw amounted to
                    property divisible among the creditors. Nothing in the Bankruptcy Act provides
                    that where the <em>proceeds</em> from divisible property
                    (within the meaning of s 78(1) of the Bankruptcy Act) are realised
                        <em>after</em> a bankrupt’s discharge, such
                    proceeds are no longer divisible among the creditors even though the property in
                    question may have been acquired by or devolved upon the bankrupt <em>during</em> the bankruptcy.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     If the first issue is answered in the
                    affirmative, <em>ie</em>, that LLH’s entitlement to
                    withdraw LLH’s nominated CPF monies constituted property divisible amongst
                    creditors of the bankrupt for the purposes of s 78(1) of the Bankruptcy
                    Act, a second issue arises, <em>viz</em>, whether
                    s 24(4) of the CPF Act prevents LLH’s entitlement to withdraw
                    LLH’s nominated CPF monies from vesting in the Official Assignee during
                    LLH’s bankruptcy. Finally, this appeal raises the issue of whether the
                    Official Assignee’s decision to grant LLH an unconditional discharge
                    barred it from thereafter seeking to claim the property in the form of
                    LLH’s entitlement to withdraw LLH’s nominated CPF monies, which was
                    acquired by or had devolved upon LLH during her bankruptcy and prior to her
                    discharge.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Whether LLH’s entitlement to withdraw LLH’s nominated CPF
                monies constitutes property within the meaning of s 78(1) of the Bankruptcy
                Act</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     It is necessary to examine the relevant
                    sections in the CPF Act to determine whether LLH’s entitlement to withdraw
                    LLH’s nominated CPF monies had the character of property for the purposes
                    of s 78(1) of the Bankruptcy Act. Section 25(1) of the CPF Act provides
                    that:</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     The entitlement of the nominee to make a
                    withdrawal upon the death of a nominating member arises out of the testamentary
                    effect of a nomination, <em>ie</em>, a nomination is
                    capable of passing property to the nominee upon the death of the nominating
                    member. In <em>How Yew Hock (Executor of the estate of Yee Sow

                    2 MLJ 474, the Malaysian Federal Court considered the issue of whether
                    a nomination made under the Malaysian equivalent of the CPF Act was a
                    testamentary document which had to satisfy the requirements of the Wills Act
                    1959 (Malaysia).While the issue which arose in that case is different from the
                    present, the Federal Court cited with approval the following passage from
                    Mellows, <em>The Law of Succession</em> (Butterworths,
                        4<sup>th</sup> ed, 1983) which helpfully elucidates the
                    legal nature of nominations:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">A nomination is a direction to a person who holds funds on behalf of
                        another to pay those funds in the event of death to a nominated person. In
                        many cases, nominations operate by statute... However, there can also be
                        non-statutory nominations, particularly in connection with pension schemes.
                        The rules of many pension schemes provide, in essence, that if the employee
                        dies during the course of his employment the amount of contributions will be
                        paid to a person nominated by the employee in writing, and in the absence of
                        any nomination, to the employee’s personal representatives. Where a
                        nomination is made, it does not operate as a will. <em>While
                            the document does affect the devolution of property on death, the
                            property passes directly from the fund to the nominee, and at no time
                            forms part of the estate</em>. The nomination operates by virtue
                        of the rules of the scheme and not as a will, and it does not, therefore,
                        have to satisfy the requirements of the Wills Act.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     In <em>Re Barnes, Ashenden v
                        Heathe</em> [1940] Ch 267 at p 273, Farwell J
                    stated that a document executed to effect the nomination of a recipient of
                    monies deposited in a society registered under the Industrial and Provident
                    Societies Act, 1893 (c 39) (UK) has the characteristics of a testamentary
                    document:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I say, ‘in its nature testamentary’, because it has all the
                        characteristics of a testamentary document, that is to say, it is a
                        nomination which has no effect at all until the death of the nominator who
                        is left completely free during his lifetime to deal with his share
                        irrespective of it. The nominee would have no right to complain of, nor
                        could he take any steps to prevent, the nominator dealing with his interest
                        during his lifetime. The nomination has no operation and is not intended to
                        have any operation until the death of the nominator. Whether or not it then
                        operates depends upon whether or not the nominator has during his lifetime
                        either revoked it or used the money which he purported to nominate for his
                        own purposes, by withdrawing it from the society or in some other way. The
                        result, as I said, is that the nature of the nomination in a case of this
                        sort is clearly testamentary.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     Clearly, a nomination made pursuant to
                    s 25(1) the CPF Act operates differently from a will. Unlike other property
                    belonging to a testator during his lifetime, nominated CPF monies do not form
                    part of the deceased’s estate. Rather, the nominee immediately acquires
                    the right to withdraw the nominated CPF monies: see s 25(1) of the CPF Act.
                    If the monies had already been paid out to another party before a nominee has
                    withdrawn the monies, s 24(3A) comes to the protection of the nominee by
                    impressing upon the nominated CPF monies a statutory trust in the
                    nominee’s favour. Section 24(3A) provides that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(3A) Subject to subsection (3B), sections 16A, 27N
                        and 57C and any regulations made under section 27Q or 57F, all moneys
                        paid out of the Fund on the death of any member of the Fund shall be
                        deemed to be impressed with a trust in favour of —</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(a)  the person or persons nominated under section 25 (1) by
                            the deceased member, if any; or</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(b)  the person or persons determined by the Public Trustee
                            in accordance with section 25 (2) to be entitled thereto,</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">but shall, without prejudice to the operation of the Estate Duty Act
                        (Cap. 96), be deemed not to form part of the deceased member’s
                        estate or to be subject to his debts.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Given the testamentary nature of a CPF nomination and the effect of
                    ss 15(5), 25(1) and 24(3A) of the CPF Act, nominated CPF monies become
                    immediately payable to the nominee upon the death of the nominating
                    member.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     I turn now to consider s 20(1) of the CPF
                    Act, which counsel for LLH relies heavily upon in support of the argument that
                    the nominated CPF monies do not devolve upon a nominee until the CPF
                    Board’s authorisation has been given for the withdrawal of those
                    monies:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">

                            Fund</em> by a person entitled thereto under section 15, the
                        Board may <em>authorise the payment</em> to the
                        applicant of such sum as the member is entitled to withdraw from the
                        Fund and any interest calculated in accordance with section 6 (4) and
                        (4B) up to the date of the authorisation or, if the applicant is a
                        nominee appointed in accordance with section 25 (1), such portion of
                        the sum as he is nominated to receive.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added.]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">In reliance on s 20(1), counsel for LLH submits that the Official
                    Assignee’s failure to make an application to the CPF Board for the
                    withdrawal of the nominated CPF monies before LLH’s discharge meant that
                    the monies were <em>not payable</em> to LLH, and therefore
                    was not property which devolved upon or was acquired by LLH during her
                    bankruptcy. This argument is unsustainable in the light of the preceding
                    discussion. As stated above (at [15]-[19]) a nomination, having testamentary
                    characteristics, operates upon the death of the nominating member. Section 25(1)
                    of the CPF Act provides that upon the death of a nominating member, nominated
                    CPF monies and designated shares subject to the nomination become payable or
                    transferable out of the CPF to the nominee in his own right.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     LLH’s entitlement to withdraw
                    LLH’s nominated CPF monies in my view constitutes property divisible among
                    LLH’s creditors within the meaning of s 78(1)(a) read with s 2
                    of the Bankruptcy Act. An entitlement to withdraw nominated CPF monies also
                    falls within the definition of “property” in s 2 of the
                    Bankruptcy Act, which includes things in action, every description of property
                    and also obligations and every description of interest, whether present or
                    future or vested or contingent, arising out of or incidental to, property. In my
                    view, LLH’s entitlement to withdraw LLH’s nominated CPF monies also
                    readily falls within s 78(1)(b) of the Bankruptcy Act, because an
                    entitlement to withdraw the nominated CPF monies is a type of “<em>capacity to exercise and to take proceedings for exercising all
                        such powers in or over or in respect of property</em>”
                    [emphasis added] (see above, at <a href="#p1_8">[8]</a>).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     Thus, the fact that the actual payment out of
                    nominated CPF monies is contingent upon the CPF Board’s authorisation of a
                    nominee’s application for withdrawal did not detract from its character as
                    property divisible among creditors in bankruptcy for the purposes of
                    ss 78(1) of the Bankruptcy Act. In the present appeal, since LLH’s
                    nominated CPF monies became payable to LLH upon Mdm Lim Lye Keow’s
                    death on 14 March 2008, LLH’s entitlement to withdraw the nominated
                    CPF monies in this case devolved upon LLH on the same date. It therefore fell
                    within the ambit of ss 78(1)(a) and (b) of the Bankruptcy
                Act.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     Also, I am of the view that s 20(1)
                    merely lays down a procedural requirement of a prior authorisation from the CPF
                    Board before nominated CPF monies may be withdrawn by persons who have become
                    legally entitled to withdraw from the CPF within the meaning of s 15 of the
                    CPF Act. Section 20(1) does not stipulate any substantive criteria which must be
                    satisfied, failing which an application for the withdrawal of monies which an
                    applicant had become entitled to withdraw within the meaning of s 15 of the
                    CPF Act would be rejected. A procedural requirement that prior authorisation be
                    obtained cannot alter the nature of a nominee’s entitlement to withdraw
                    nominated CPF monies as property divisible among creditors, by operation of
                    ss 78(1)(a) and (b) of the Bankruptcy Act.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     If there were additional substantive criteria
                    imposed by s 20(1) on the nominee’s rights to withdraw nominated CPF
                    monies from the CPF, one would imagine that those criteria would apply with
                    equal force to the transfer of the Singtel discounted shares purchased with CPF
                    monies to nominated recipients. In the case of the Singtel discounted shares,
                    s 26(2) of the CPF Act envisages an outright transfer by the CPF Board to
                    the nominated recipient of the Singtel discounted shares purchased using the
                    deceased’s CPF monies, and if that is not feasible, ss 26(3) and (4)
                    envisage that the shares are to be sold and the proceeds therefrom transferred
                    to the nominee, without additional substantive conditions:</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     Also, in the light of what was discussed
                    recently in <em>Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official
                        Report</em> (16 August 2010) vol 87 at col 0, there are
                    ample reasons for taking the view that Parliament had intended s 20(1) of
                    the CPF Act to perform no more than a procedural function. Minister for
                    Manpower, Mr Gan Kim Yong stated at the second reading of the Central
                    Provident Fund (Amendment) Bill that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Madam, we are also refining the disbursement of CPF assets of deceased
                        members. Currently, CPF savings have to be disbursed directly to the
                        nominees upon the death of a member. Some members have requested for their
                        CPF savings to be transferred directly to their nominees’ CPF accounts
                        instead so as to help provide for their healthcare and retirement needs. I
                        think this is a sensible request. Therefore, sections 15, 20 and 25 will be
                        amended to offer members this option. This option will become available from
                            1<sup>st</sup> January 2011 onwards.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Mr Gan stated that the CPF Board was generally reluctant to hold
                    nominated CPF monies, and aims to expeditiously pay out nominated CPF monies to
                    nominees upon the death of the nominating member (<em>ibid</em>):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Madam, the next area of change concerns unclaimed CPF monies. This
                        includes monies of deceased members which have not been claimed by the
                        beneficiaries, which the CPF Board is currently required to hold
                        indefinitely. This is not desirable as the assets should be disbursed to
                        beneficiaries as far as possible.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">We are, therefore, amending sections 15 and 20 to allow the CPF Board to
                        automatically disburse a member’s CPF monies to his nominees, once it
                        is notified of his demise. CPF Board will no longer need to wait for
                        nominees to apply for the bequeathed monies before they can be disbursed.
                        Nevertheless, some CPF monies may continue to remain unclaimed for various
                        reasons, for example, nominees with incomplete or inaccurate details on
                        record may not be contactable. We will streamline how such CPF monies are
                        managed.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In the last five years, the CPF Board has been able to locate and make
                        payment to nominees in 98% of all such cases. 2% of the cases remain
                        outstanding, despite the Board’s efforts to locate the nominees and
                        disburse the monies. These include cases when nominees either did not
                        respond to CPF Board letters or could not be located because insufficient or
                        inaccurate information provided by the member on the nomination form, or
                        some nominees might have relocated overseas.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Admittedly, these proposed changes have not yet been brought into
                    effect. However the above statements by Mr Gan suggest that CPF Board
                    authorisations are usually given as a matter of course to nominees entitled to
                    withdraw within the meaning of s 15(5), and that s 20(1) of the CPF
                    Act does not impose further substantive criteria before a nominee may withdraw
                    nominated CPF monies.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     Whatever the underlying rationale for
                    statutorily requiring an application for CPF Board authorisation to be made, it
                    seems abundantly clear that s 20(1) only provides for the process by which
                    withdrawals are requested by persons qualified to do so pursuant to s 15 of
                    the CPF Act. The Official Assignee’s omission to make an application
                    pursuant to s 20(1) of the CPF Act prior to LLH’s discharge did not
                    change the nature of LLH’s entitlement to withdraw LLH’s nominated
                    CPF monies, or prevent it from becoming property divisible among a
                    bankrupt’s creditors, since it had been acquired by or devolved upon LLH
                    before LLH’s discharge.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Whether the protection afforded by s 24(4) of the CPF Act to a
                bankrupt’s contributions extends to nominated CPF monies</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     I turn now to address another argument relied
                    upon by counsel for LLH in the alternative, in support of the argument that
                    LLH’s nominated CPF monies shall not be subject to LLH’s debts on
                    her bankruptcy, because under s 24(4) of the CPF Act, “no
                    contribution to the Fund or interest thereon” shall pass to the Official
                    Assignee on bankruptcy. Section 24(4) of CPF Act provides that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(4) Subject to sections 27N and 57C and any regulations made under section
                        27Q or 57F, <em>no contribution to the Fund or interest
                            thereon</em> shall be subject to <em>the debts of
                            the member of the Fund</em>, nor shall the contribution or
                        interest pass to the Official Assignee on the bankruptcy of the
                        member.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Counsel for LLH argues that the phrase “standing to the credit
                    of the member” was used in other provisions such as ss 27(1), 21(1),
                    22(1) and 32(5) of the CPF Act to distinguish monies standing to the credit of a
                    particular member from monies in the fund generally. Since s 24(4) does not
                    include the words “standing to the credit of a member”, counsel
                    for LLH submits that it ought to be interpreted to include the nominated CPF
                    monies passing to a nominee upon the death of nominating member.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     However, in my view, this argument should also
                    be rejected. Section 24(4) is intended for the protection of CPF monies standing
                    to the credit of <em>the bankrupt</em>, against his
                        <em>own creditors</em>. Money standing to the credit of
                    a member is accumulated over time, through contributions to his or her credit.
                    Contributions by employers are mandated by s 7 of the CPF Act, as well as
                    contributions from the employee’s wage if the employee’s
                    remuneration exceeds $500 per month. Alternatively, they may be made voluntarily
                    under s 13B of the CPF Act. Section 12(2)(a) of the CPF Act states that
                    every contribution paid to the CPF for a member shall be credited to the member
                    by the CPF Board:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>Contributions to be paid into Fund</b>

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">

                        collected on account of contributions to the Fund under this Act shall be
                        paid into or carried to the Fund in such manner as may be prescribed.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(2) The Board shall cause to be credited to each member of the Fund
                        —</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(a) the amount of every contribution paid to the Fund for him;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(b) the interest payable to him under section 6(4); and</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(c) any additional interest payable to him under
                        section 6(4B).</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Section 2(1) defines a “member” or “member of the
                    fund” to mean:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... <em>any person to whose credit any amount is standing
                            in the Fund</em>, or for whom any account in the Fund is
                        maintained for any of the purposes of this Act, and includes a person who
                        contributes to the Fund voluntarily in accordance with section
                        13B…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">I am of the view that nominated CPF monies which have passed after the
                    death of a nominating member to a nominee do not fall within the meaning of the
                    word “contribution” which is the subject-matter of the protection
                    conferred by s 24(4). The purpose of the “immunity” conferred
                    by s 24(4) of the CPF Act is to protect <em>the savings of a
                        membe</em>r for his retirement from his creditors: see <em>Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report</em>
                    (18 March 1986) vol 47 at col 571, Mr Lee Yock Suan (Acting
                    Minister for Labour). The nominated CPF monies in this case are the CPF
                    contributions by the deceased (and not by LLH), which stood to the credit of the
                    deceased, for the deceased’s retirement. Since the deceased had passed
                    away before those monies were withdrawn by the deceased, the rationale
                    underlying s 24(4) is inapplicable to those monies. There is to my mind no
                    reason why Parliament would have intended the ambit of the protection provided
                    by s 24(4) of the CPF Act to be extended to nominated CPF monies, which are
                    in substance no different from other testamentary gifts which would become
                    divisible among creditors of the nominee in the event of the nominee’s
                    bankruptcy. Thus, I am of the view that LLH’s entitlement to withdraw
                    LLH’s nominated CPF monies was property divisible among LLH’s
                    creditors, since it was property which was acquired by or devolved upon LLH
                    during her bankruptcy.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Whether LLH’s nominated CPF monies devolved upon LLH before she
                was discharged from bankruptcy</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     Finally, counsel for LLH argues that the case
                    of <em>Chong Chee Keong v Official Assignee</em> [2005]
                    3 SLR(R) 546 (“<em>Chong Chee
                    Keong</em>”), in which Choo Han Teck J held that a dividend in
                    bankruptcy which was paid to the bankrupt after his discharge from bankruptcy
                    was not divisible among the bankrupt’s creditors, should be followed
                    because it is on all fours with the present case. In particular, counsel for LLH
                    relies strongly on the following passage in Choo J’s judgment (at
                    [4]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... the certificate of discharge is a statutory instrument that wipes the
                        slate clean for the bankrupt so that he might carry on with his life afresh,
                        free of past debts and liabilities. <em>The certificate of
                            discharge is a document that certifies and declares to the world at
                            large that no more debt is owed by the discharged bankrupt. Any residual
                            rights must revert to the discharged bankrupt</em>. That being the
                        case, any money that comes subsequently into the Official Assignee's hands
                        must be turned over to the discharged bankrupt unless the Official Assignee
                        had expressly reserved that money as a condition to the discharge. [emphasis
                        added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     The above paragraph ought to be read in the
                    light of the facts of <em>Chong Chee Keong</em>. In that
                    case, the plaintiff was the shareholder and managing director of a company,
                    which was wound up on 13 August 1999 and the Official Receiver was
                    appointed as liquidator. A few months later, on 10 December 1999, the
                    plaintiff was adjudicated bankrupt. On 21 April 2001, the Official Assignee
                    filed a proof of debt of $682,304.00 against the company in liquidation on the
                    plaintiff’s behalf. Subsequently, on 30 June 2003, the plaintiff was
                    discharged by a certificate of discharge issued by the Official Assignee.
                    Thereafter, on 5 July 2004, the Official Receiver declared a dividend of
                    16.33% in the liquidation of the company. Thus, the plaintiff was entitled to
                    16.33% of $682,304.00, which amounted to $111,420.24. The Official Assignee
                    argued before Choo J that the debt owing from the company to the plaintiff
                    had been the plaintiff’s property prior to the commencement of her
                    bankruptcy, and the monies therefore vested in the Official Assignee upon the
                    making of a bankruptcy order. The plaintiff argued that since an unconditional
                    discharge had been given to the plaintiff with the consent of creditors, the
                    Official Assignee could not lay claim to the money after the discharge.
                    Ultimately, Choo J held in favour of the plaintiff on the ground that the
                    money had not been due and payable to the Official Assignee until after the
                    discharge. Choo J appeared to have been particular influenced by the
                    following in coming to his conclusion (at [4]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<em>Without that reservation [of right], the Official
                            Assignee can retain the money only if the certificate of discharge is
                            set aside by the court</em>. But that is a separate matter and
                        requires an application to be made by the Official Assignee, and I expect
                        that in the course of such an application, the circumstances in which the
                        plaintiff's creditors had given their consent [to the issuance of the
                        certificate of discharge] among other issues (not presently relevant) might
                        be relevant. <em>Since the plaintiff is a discharged
                            bankrupt, the burden is not on him to explain the whys and wherefores of
                            his discharge - unless he had been expressly told or knew clearly that
                            the money now due to him has to be disbursed to past
                            creditors</em>. That is not the case here. <em>A
                            person in the plaintiff's circumstances could have committed himself
                            financially after learning that money was due to him. That person would
                            be put in an impossible situation if the Official Assignee were
                            entitled, as a principle of law, to the money in such
                            circumstances</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     I am of the view that <em>Chong
                        Chee Keong</em> was decided on the facts of that particular case, and
                    that each case turns on its own facts. In this regard, I refer to the following
                    passage in Ian Fletcher, <em>The Law of Insolvency</em>
                    (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 4<sup>th</sup> ed, 2009) at
                    para 8-001:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<em>In accordance with the general proposition that the
                            bankruptcy law enables the debtor to be freed from the claims of his
                            creditors in return for giving up substantially the whole of his
                            assets</em>, the proprietary effects of adjudication, broadly
                        speaking, are that the bankrupt will be divested of his property which will
                        automatically become vested in his trustee in bankruptcy upon the
                        latter’s appointment... <em>Moreover in the interest of
                            ensuring that full justice is done, the trustee’s right to claim
                            the property of the bankrupt is not limited only to such assets as may
                            happen to belong to him or her at the very moment of adjudication, but
                            is capable of extension both backwards and forwards from that moment in
                            time</em>. Conversely, certain items of the bankrupt’s
                        property are excluded from the effects of adjudication and remain his in
                        law, whilst, under certain conditions, it is possible for the
                        trustee’s title to other assets to undergo curtailment. <em>Thus, the actual extent to which property will become available
                            for realisation and eventual distribution to the creditors in the form
                            of dividends is a matter which will depend on the particular
                            circumstances of each case</em>...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">It is incumbent on this court to take into account the underlying
                    rationale for the rule that only a bankrupt’s property which had been
                    acquired before and during her bankruptcy fall to be divided among her
                    creditors. Unlike <em>Chong Chee Keong</em>, the present
                    case concerns monies which had become due and payable to the bankrupt before she
                    was discharged. Furthermore, the reasoning in <em>Chong Chee
                        Keong</em>, <em>viz</em>, that it was unfair to
                    allow the Official Assignee to assert its entitlement to the monies after it had
                    granted an unconditional discharge despite having full knowledge that a chose in
                    action worth $682,304.00 had vested in it during the plaintiff’s
                    bankruptcy, is not applicable to the present case. In the present case, the
                    Official Assignee’s failure to make the recovery of LLH’s nominated
                    CPF monies and division among creditors a condition for discharge stemmed from
                    its ignorance (prior to the discharge) that LLH’s nominated CPF monies due
                    to the bankrupt existed and had been vested in it. Apparently, the Official
                    Assignee failed to receive the letter dated 18 September 2008 and the email
                    dated 26 June 2009 from the CPF Board informing it of LLH’s nominated
                    CPF monies. How that could have happened is not clear to me.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     I also note that counsel for LLH has
                    overstated her case by citing <em>Chong Chee Keong</em> for
                    the proposition that upon the grant of an unconditional discharge, all the
                    assets which have vested in the Official Assignee during the bankruptcy would
                    re-vest in the discharged bankrupt, for the following reasons. There is nothing
                    in the Bankruptcy Act to the effect that property which has vested in the
                    Official Assignee during the bankruptcy would re-vest in the bankrupt upon a
                    discharge. In fact, ss 127 and 128 of the Bankruptcy Act contemplate a
                    continuation of the role of the Official Assignee in collecting assets which
                    have vested in it upon the making of a bankruptcy order and assets which have
                    been acquired by or devolved upon the bankrupt during her bankruptcy for
                    distribution to creditors who have proved their debts in the bankrupt’s
                    bankruptcy (see above at <a href="#p1_9">[9]</a>).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     In the light of the foregoing, LLH’s
                    appeal is dismissed. However, given that this case would not have arisen but for
                    the delay on the part of the Official Assignee, I make no order as to
                    costs.</p>
