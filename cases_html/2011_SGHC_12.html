<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       The defendant was at all material times the main contractor of the iconic
                    award winning public housing project known as The Pinnacle@Duxton. One of the
                    distinctive features of this housing project is the unique design in linking the
                    seven apartment blocks with twelve steel link bridges (“the link
                    bridges”). The plaintiff was engaged as the sub-contractor by the
                    defendant for the supply, fabrication, delivery and installation of the link
                    bridges (“the Sub-Contract”). The dispute in the present suit
                    arose in connection with the balance sums due from the Sub-Contract.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The defendant applied to strike out 33 paragraphs of the Statement of Claim
                    (“the allegedly offending paragraphs”) under O 18 r 19(1)(a) and
                    (c) of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2006 Rev Ed)
                        (“<em>the Rules</em>”) on the grounds
                    that the paragraphs did not disclose a reasonable cause of action or
                    alternatively may prejudice, embarrass or delay the fair trial of the action.
                    The principal premise relied on by the defendant in support of the application
                    was that the allegedly offending paragraphs were in the nature of
                        “<em>forest pleadings</em>” in that they
                    failed to draw a causal nexus between the breach and the losses. The Assistant
                    Registrar (“AR”) dismissed the application with costs and observed
                    that the defendant should instead have applied for Further and Better
                    Particulars (“F&amp;BP”). The defendant being dissatisfied with
                    the AR’s decision filed an appeal which was heard before me on
                    6 December 2010. Like the AR, I arrived at a similar conclusion that the
                    defendant should <em>at best</em> apply for F&amp;BP if it
                    was minded to do so. Accordingly, I dismissed the appeal. As the defendant has
                    filed a Notice of Appeal against my decision for which the leave application is
                    pending, I now state my full grounds for dismissing the appeal. For reasons
                    which will be apparent below, it is clear to me that the defendant’s
                        “<em>forest pleading</em>” point is
                    misconceived. In advancing this argument, the defendant has plainly
                        “<em>missed the woods for the
                    tr</em>ees”.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Background</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       The plaintiff’s claim is for the sum of $9,384,577.31 being the balance
                    due for work done on the Sub-Contract and for the additional works and/or
                    variations as a result of changes in the design of the link bridges. The
                    plaintiff alleged that the project consultants issued more than 900 new/revised
                    drawings for the link bridges. Essentially the plaintiff claimed that the
                    new/revised drawings fundamentally altered the original design from a simple
                    flat truss frame corbel to an “A” framed triangular truss with
                    telescopic support system.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       The original award for the Sub-Contract was for a lump sum of $10,290,000.00.
                    To-date, the defendant has already approved and paid the plaintiff the sum of
                    $17,243,948.10 under the Sub-Contract. It is immediately obvious that the sum
                    paid by the defendant is about 70% <em>above</em> the
                    original lump sum award. Therefore, there can be no legitimate dispute that
                    additional works and/or variations were in fact performed by the plaintiff under
                    the Sub-Contract. The dispute involves the scope, extent and consequently the
                    value of the additional works and/or variations.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       The present suit was commenced on 2 August 2010. On 13 September 2010, the
                    defendant applied for and obtained an extension of time to file their defence
                    and it was duly filed on 20 October 2010 following the grant of the extension.
                    The plaintiff filed their reply on 10 November 2010. The defendant’s
                    application was filed on 16 November 2010 not only after the defence was filed,
                    but also after pleadings had already closed.</p>

<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The defendant’s submissions</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       The defendant’s submissions were unnecessarily prolix with copious
                    references to various authorities covering the same points. In brief, their key
                    points are as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_7-p2_a"></a>(a)     The allegedly offending paragraphs in the Statement of Claim are
                        embarrassing because the plaintiff had failed to draw a causal nexus between
                        the breach and the alleged damage/loss. Specifically, the defendant alleged
                        that the plaintiff had failed to identify how the revised drawings led to
                        the variations and/or additional works and consequently the claim.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_7-p2_b"></a>(b)     The defendant also alleged that it was not clear whether the
                        plaintiff’s claim is based on clause 11.1 of the Sub-Contract.
                        Assuming that the claim is premised on clause 11.1, it was then incumbent on
                        the plaintiff to comply with the procedure set out under clause 12 of the
                        Sub-Contract to claim for the additional works and/or variations. In that
                        regard, the defendant alleged that it was not clear from the Statement of
                        Claim how the requirements under clause 12 had been satisfied by the
                        plaintiff.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The plaintiff’s response</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       The plaintiff submitted that it was too late in the day for the defendant to
                    strike out the allegedly offending paragraphs since the application was only
                    filed after close of pleadings.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       The plaintiff also submitted that the defendant has failed to understand that
                    its claim is not for damages for delay and/or disruption but is instead a claim
                    simply for additional works arising from the numerous changes in the design
                    drawings. Accordingly, there is no need to establish any causal nexus between
                    the breach and the loss since no breach has been alleged against the defendant
                    to begin with.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     Finally, it was submitted that the question whether clause 12 of the
                    Sub-Contract constitutes a condition precedent to justify a claim for additional
                    works is a question of fact to be decided at the trial. In any event, the
                    defendant has clearly waived strict compliance of clause 12 or is estopped
                    from asserting otherwise given that it has paid an additional sum of about $7
                    million over and above the contractual lump sum amount of $10,290,000.00.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The court’s decision</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     While it is good practice that striking out applications should always be made
                    promptly, and as a rule preferably before the close of pleadings, there is
                    strictly no bar for such an application to be made after close of pleadings. O
                    18 r 19(1) of <em>the Rules</em> provides that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The Court may <em>at any stage of the
                            proceedings</em> order to be struck out or amended any
                        pleading...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     Whether a striking out application should be entertained after close of
                    pleadings is a matter of discretion to be decided on a variety of factors such
                    as proximity of the trial dates, alteration of position by the parties and the
                    merits of the application. Obviously this list is not intended to be exhaustive
                    but serves only as a guide in the exercise of the discretion. In this case, as
                    there was no indication that the trial dates were around the corner and since
                    the application was filed some five days after close of pleadings, I proceeded
                    to hear the merits of the application.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     Before dealing with the merits, I pause to note that although the main ground
                    of the defendant’s application was made under O 18 r 19(1)(a) of <em>the Rules</em>, the defendant’s submissions were
                    instead entirely in support only of the alternative ground under O 18 r19(1)(c)
                    of <em>the Rules</em>. The application under O 18 r
                    19(1)(a) of <em>the Rules</em> is clearly misconceived. The
                    remedy to strike out for no reasonable cause of action is only available in
                    plain and obvious cases without embarking on any serious or lengthy inquiry into
                    the relative strengths of the parties’ positions. That may well explain
                    the defendant’s decision to focus on the alternative ground. There is a
                    further and more fundamental impediment to the defendant’s application. It
                    seeks only to strike out 33 paragraphs of the Statement of Claim either totally
                    or in part out of a total of 223 paragraphs. Implicit in the defendant’s
                    application is its recognition that the other 190 paragraphs in the
                    Statement of Claim do give rise to a reasonable cause of action. However in the
                    present case, there is only one cause of action for additional works and/or
                    variations. We are hence not concerned with a case where there are multiple
                    pleaded causes of action and the application seeks only to strike out part
                    thereof. The allegedly offending paragraphs are part of the factual background
                    that gave rise to the plaintiff’s claim. In such a situation, it is wholly
                    inappropriate to strike out some paragraphs of the Statement of Claim ostensibly on
                    the ground that they do not disclose a reasonable cause of action in the context
                    where there is only one pleaded cause of action.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Forest Pleadings</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     This expression was employed by Judge Humphrey Lloyd QC in <em>Bernhard’s Rugby Landscapes Ltd v Stockley Park Consortium
                        Ltd</em> (1997) 82 BLR 39; (1998) 14 Const LJ 329
                        (“<em>Bernhard’s Rugby”)</em>,
                    wherein he observed at 51A that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The pleading was therefore of the type customarily known as a
                        “forest” pleading since the statement of claim was virtually
                        no more than a vehicle for the relaunch of the plaintiff’s original
                        contractual claim submissions.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     To the best of my knowledge, the term “<em>forest
                        pleading</em>” has not been used in any other case apart from
                        <em>Bernhard’s Rugby</em>. Leaving aside the
                    issue of proper labelling, the objectionable nature of “<em>forest pleading</em>” is that it is merely a relaunch
                    or rehash of the original contractual claim documents submitted by a claimant
                    typically after the completion of a project. In <em>Bernhard’s Rugby</em>, the claimant had presented the
                    construction manager with detailed and lengthy claims for the delay. Before the
                    construction manager could arrive at his decision on the dispute between the
                    claimant and the employer, the claimant issued court proceedings and essentially
                    reproduced the same claim submissions. In the present case, although the
                    defendant purported to claim that the allegedly offending paragraphs were in the
                    nature of “<em>forest pleadings</em>”, it has
                    not suggested that they were merely a rehash of the claim documentation
                    submitted by the plaintiff following the completion of the Sub-Contract.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     When I dismissed the appeal on 6 December 2010, I intimated to the
                    defendant’s counsel that there were sufficient particulars in the
                    Statement of Claim to permit the defendant to understand the nature of the
                    plaintiff’s claim and more importantly to enable the defendant to plead a
                    defence to the claim. Indeed, the Defence was filed on 20 October 2010 prior to
                    the filing of the striking out application. In my view, the Statement of Claim
                    is sufficiently clear that the claim against the defendant is premised on the
                    following:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_16-p2_a"></a>(a)     The original design for the link bridges was a simple flat truss frame
                        corbel system.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_16-p2_b"></a>(b)     The project consultants issued more than 900 new/revised drawings which
                        changed the design of the link bridges to “A” framed
                        triangular truss with telescopic support system.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_16-p2_c"></a>(c)     As a result of the changes in design, the plaintiff had to incur
                        additional costs and expenses. Such additional costs and expenses
                            include:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_16-p2_c-p3_i"></a>(i)       additional cutting and joints;</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_16-p2_c-p3_ii"></a>(ii)       additional site welding;</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_16-p2_c-p3_iii"></a>(iii)       additional wrap-around plates;</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_16-p2_c-p3_iv"></a>(iv)       additional built-up sections; and</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_16-p2_c-p3_v"></a>(v)       additional end bearing supports for the telescopic support system and
                            the use of “Macalloy bars”.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_16-p2_d"></a>(d)     The losses arising from the changes in design drawings were
                            particularised.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     It was plainly wrong for the defendant to describe the allegedly offending
                    paragraphs as “<em>forest
                    pleadings</em>”.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Causal Nexus</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     The crux of the defendant’s objection to the allegedly offending
                    paragraphs is its perceived requirement to establish a causal nexus between the
                        <em>breach</em> and the claim. This understanding is
                    also borne out by paragraph 13 of the Defence:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">13.    Paragraphs 11 to 31 deal with the Plaintiffs’ allegations of
                            design changes (“new/revised designs”). A review of the
                            relevant paragraphs show that:</p>

<p class="Judg-Quote-2">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     This perceived understanding led the defendant’s counsel to cite various
                    authorities in support of the necessity to establish the causal nexus between
                    the <em>breach</em> and the alleged loss, such as <em>Bernhard’s Rugby at [104] and [113]</em>:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The defendant attacked the pleading on the grounds that such an allegation
                        was embarrassing since it <em>did not establish a causal link
                            between the breach and the damage alleged</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Nevertheless, the point of logical weakness inherent in such claims,
                            <em>the causal nexus between the wrongful acts or
                            omissions of the defendant and the loss of the plaintiff, must be
                            addressed</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     The defendant’s counsel also cited <em>Wharf Properties
                        and another v Eric Cumine Associates, Architects, Engineers and
                        Surveyors</em> [1991] 52 BLR 1 (“<em>Wharf Properties</em>”) and reproduced a quote purportedly
                    made by Lord Oliver of Aylmerton that:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_5" id="Ftn_5_1"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Wharf should establish a nexus between the contract, it’s breach,
                        the events immediately consequent upon this breach and that this led to the
                        financial losses claimed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">No page reference was provided for the above quote. In attempting to locate
                    the page reference, I discovered that this statement was nowhere to be found in
                        <em>Wharf Properties</em>. Instead the actual holding
                    by his Lordship with respect to the need for Wharf to establish a nexus at pp
                    20?21 is reproduced below:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">This has, however, no bearing upon the obligation of a plaintiff to plead
                        his case with such particularity as is sufficient to alert the opposite
                        party to the case which is going to be made against him at the trial. ECA
                        are concerned at this stage not so much with quantification of the financial
                        consequences ? the point with which the two cases
                        referred to were concerned ? but with the specification
                        of the factual consequences of the breaches pleaded in terms of periods of
                        delay. <em>The failure even to attempt to specify any
                            discernible nexus between the wrong alleged and the consequent delay
                            provides, to use Mr. Thomas' phrase, "no agenda" for the
                            trial</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     The defendant also cited <em>Petromec Inc v Petroleo Brasileiro
                        SA</em> [2007] EWHC 1589 (“<em>Petromec</em>”) in support of its argument that a causal nexus
                    must be established by the plaintiff even in respect of claims for additional
                    works.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     My own research has revealed that the defendant’s submission with
                    respect to <em>Wharf Properties</em> (at paragraph 40 of
                    the defendant’s Written Submissions) was taken verbatim from an online
                    article written by one Jeff Whitfield<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_6" id="Ftn_6_1"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span> without any acknowledgment of its source. The defendant’s
                    “analysis” on <em>Petromec</em> at paragraph
                    27 of the defendant’s Written Submissions was likewise lifted from another
                    online article.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_7" id="Ftn_7_1"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span> It is not good practice for counsel to copy verbatim summaries of
                    case law with quotes purportedly from the judgment without conducting
                    appropriate checks on the accuracy of the source. Where it is proper and apt to
                    quote extracts from any article, counsel should acknowledge the source. There is
                    no “shortcut” to proper research. I should add that such
                    “cut and paste” jobs are not helpful and in fact render the
                    submissions disjointed without sufficient co-relation to the facts of the
                    case.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     In my judgment, both <em>Petromec</em> and <em>Wharf Properties</em> do not assist the defendant’s
                    case:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_23-p2_a"></a>(a)     First, both cases were concerned with the advancement of what was
                        described as “global” or “rolled up” claims
                        where the claims were hopelessly unparticularised. In <em>Petromec</em>, the claimant’s approach was to claim the
                        difference in the total costs in building the rig based on the revised
                        specifications compared with the costs that would have been incurred under
                        the original specifications. The court held that such an approach was flawed
                        because there may be other reasons for the increase in costs which were
                        unrelated to the variations. In contrast, as explained at <a href="#p1_16">[16]</a> above, the plaintiff has set out the
                        nature of its claim for the balance due for the additional works and/or
                        variations carried out as a result of the changes in the design of the link
                        bridges and has particularised its losses which arose as a result of the
                        additional works and/or variations.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_23-p2_b"></a>(b)     Second<em>, Wharf Properties</em> was concerned with
                        a breach of contract for the completion of a residential and commercial
                        development, with the alleged breach being the failure to properly supervise
                        contractors and sub-contractors, thereby causing the delay. <em>Wharf Properties</em> is not helpful as it was not
                        concerned with a claim for additional works.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     Finally, even if there is a need for the plaintiff to identify a nexus between
                    its claim for additional works and its loss, in my view, the plaintiff has done
                    so in setting out the nature of its claim and particularising its losses that
                    arose as a result of the additional works.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Alleged non-compliance with clause 12 of the Sub-Contract</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     In deciding the merits of the defendant’s application, the court is
                    entitled to take into account the Reply filed by the plaintiff: <em>Singapore Civil Procedure 2007</em>
                    (G P Selvam gen ed) (Singapore: Sweet &amp; Maxwell Asia, 2007) at p
                    256. At paragraph 8 of the Reply, the plaintiff has clearly pleaded that by
                    certifying and paying the sum of $17,243,948.10 (far more than the lump sum of
                    $10,290,000.00 payable under the Sub-Contract), the defendant has either waived
                    strict compliance with clause 12 of the Sub-Contract or, in any event, is
                    estopped from asserting otherwise.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     Accordingly, it is disingenuous of the defendant to claim that the allegedly
                    offending paragraphs of the Statement of Claim may prejudice, embarrass or delay
                    the fair trial of the action when it was its own conduct which approved and paid
                    for the additional works without reference to clause 12 of the Sub-Contract. It
                    is noteworthy to highlight that it is not the defendant’s pleaded case
                    that the additional sum was paid for variation orders and/or additional works
                    that were carried out in strict compliance with clause 12 of the Sub-Contract.
                    Instead the defendant’s pleaded explanation for the additional payment at
                    paragraph 35 of the Defence is that it “is evidence of the
                    Defendant’s reasonable interim position based on the best possible
                    evaluation of the Plaintiff’s claims <em>despite the
                        Plaintiff’s failure to adhere to the Sub-Contract in particular
                        Clause 12</em>”. From the pleaded defence, the defendant
                    has clearly admitted by its own “<em>best possible
                        evaluation</em>” that additional works were carried out and
                    that payment over and above the original contractual lump sum is due and owing
                    to the plaintiff.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     Ultimately, whether the plaintiff will succeed in its claim for the additional
                    works is not a matter for this court to decide at this stage of the proceedings.
                    Suffice it to say that I am satisfied that the facts of the present case do not
                    meet the high standard required to strike out the allegedly offending paragraphs
                        <em>in limine</em>. Having said that, it is beyond
                    doubt from the pleadings that additional works and variations were performed by
                    the plaintiff in respect of the link bridges under the Sub-Contract. There can
                    be no other explanation for the “<em>overpayment</em>” of some $7 million by the defendant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     Accordingly, I dismissed the appeal with costs fixed at $2,500.00 to be paid
                    by the defendant to the plaintiff.</p>
