<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       This is an appeal against the decision of the
                    High Court Judge (“the Judge”) in <em>Lim Mey Lee
                        Susan v Singapore Medical Council</em> [2011] 4 SLR 156
                    (“the HC Judgment”) dismissing the application by the appellant,
                    Dr Susan Lim Mey Lee (“the Appellant”), in Originating
                    Summons No 1252 of 2010 (“OS 1252/2010”) for leave to
                    apply for (<em>inter alia</em>):</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_1-p2_a"></a>(a)     a quashing order to quash the
                        decision of the respondent, the Singapore Medical Council (“the
                        SMC”), appointing a second Disciplinary Committee (“the Second
                        DC”) to hear 94 disciplinary charges against her arising out of a
                        complaint made against her (“the Quashing Order”);
                    and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_1-p2_b"></a>(b)     a prohibiting
                        order to prohibit the SMC from taking any steps to bring further
                        disciplinary proceedings with respect to the aforesaid disciplinary charges
                        (“the Prohibiting Order”).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Background to the present appeal</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The material facts, as found by the Judge, are
                    as follows. On 18 July 2007, officials from the Ministry of Health, Brunei
                    (“MOHB”) met with Prof Kandiah Satkunanantham
                    (“Prof Satku”), the Director of Medical Services (“the
                    DMS”) at that time. During the meeting, Prof Satku was informed of
                    the fees charged by the Appellant for the medical treatment of a member of the
                    royal family of Brunei (“the Patient”), which fees MOHB found
                    unacceptable. Prof Satku invited MOHB to write in officially to the
                    Ministry of Health, Singapore (“MOHS”) for the matter to be looked
                    into. Thereafter, the Permanent Secretary of MOHB (“PS-MOHB”) sent
                    a letter dated 27 August 2007 to the Permanent Secretary of MOHS
                    complaining of the “unacceptable and extremely high”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> fees charged by the
                    Appellant for treating the Patient and “seek[ing] the intervention of
                    [MOHS] in [the] matter”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       Upon receipt of PS-MOHB’s complaint
                    (“the Complaint”), MOHS conducted a preliminary investigation into
                    the Complaint. Prof Satku was also involved in that preliminary
                    investigation. On the basis of its preliminary investigation, MOHS referred the
                    Complaint to the chairman of the SMC’s Complaints Panel (“the
                    CP”) on 3 December 2007 with respect to three issues:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_3-p2_a"></a>(a)     whether the invoices issued by the
                        Appellant demonstrated a pattern of overcharging and/or improper
                        billing;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_3-p2_b"></a>(b)     whether
                        some charges imposed by the Appellant were for services which she did not
                        provide; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_3-p2_c"></a>(c)     whether there was any conflict of interest as the invoices in question were
                        issued by various clinics managed by the Appellant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       The chairman of the CP in turn laid the
                    Complaint before a Complaints Committee (“the CC”). The CC sent a
                    letter dated 18 December 2007 to the Appellant inviting her to furnish a
                    written explanation of the allegations against her. The Appellant, through her
                    then solicitors, provided a letter of explanation dated 4 February 2008.
                    After considering the Complaint and the Appellant’s explanation, the CC
                    made an order on 17 November 2008 that a formal inquiry be held by a
                    Disciplinary Committee (“the CC’s Order). Accordingly, the SMC
                    appointed a Disciplinary Committee (“the First DC”) comprising the
                    following persons: Assoc Prof Chin Jing Jih, Prof Ong Biauw Chi,
                    Dr Wong Yue Sie and Ms Serene Wee. Mr Giam Chin Toon SC was
                    appointed as the legal assessor.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       Before the First DC, the SMC preferred 94
                    disciplinary charges against the Appellant for overcharging the Patient as well
                    as for making false representations in invoices rendered to the Patient. The
                    first tranche of the hearing took place from 28 January 2010 to
                    9 February 2010. At the close of the SMC’s case, counsel for the
                    Appellant informed the First DC that he would be making a submission of no case
                    to answer. Directions were then given for such submission to be filed by
                    4 June 2010, with a reply from the SMC due on 16 July 2010. Counsel
                    for the respective parties were given leave to make oral submissions at the
                    reconvened hearing.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       On 28 May 2010, a member of the first DC,
                        <em>viz</em>, Dr Wong Yue Sie, died. As a result,
                    a vacancy arose, which was filled by the appointment of Assoc Prof Anette
                    Jacobsen (“A/Prof Jacobsen”) on 9 July 2010. At the
                    reconvened hearing on 29 July 2010, the chairman of the First DC announced
                    to the parties at the start of the hearing as follows:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">We have read the written submissions and I understand from my colleagues
                        in the panel that we have no further questions to raise. Does either party
                        have anything else to add or submit before we deliver our decision at this
                        stage?</p>
<p class="Judg-1">This statement led the Appellant’s counsel to venture the view
                    that the First DC might have prejudged the Appellant’s submission of no
                    case to answer. The First DC nonetheless continued with the hearing. Eventually,
                    the Appellant’s counsel made an application for the First DC to recuse
                    itself on the ground that its chairman’s remarks showed that it had
                    prejudged the Appellant’s submission of no case to answer. Counsel for the
                    SMC, finding himself in a somewhat difficult position, informed the First DC
                    that he would not object to the Appellant’s application, whereupon the
                    First DC recused itself.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       After the First DC recused itself, the SMC
                    sought legal advice on how to proceed further with the matter. This led the SMC
                    to revoke the appointment of the First DC and appoint the Second DC comprising
                    the following members: Prof Tan Ser Kiat, Prof C Rajasoorya,
                    Dr Abraham Kochitty and Assoc Prof Koh Ming Choo Pearlie.
                    Mr Vinodh Coomaraswamy SC was appointed as the legal
                assessor.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       The revocation of the First DC’s
                    appointment and the appointment of the Second DC were effectuated via two
                    e-mails sent to all the members of the SMC (referred to hereafter as either the
                    “SMC members” or a “SMC member”, as may be
                    appropriate to the context), except for Dr Wilmot R Rasanayagam
                    (“Dr Rasanayagam”), who received hard copies of those
                    e-mails. The first e-mail was sent on 3 September 2010 by Serene Wong (the
                    senior manager of the Professional Conduct and Professional Standards Division
                    of the SMC) to seek the approval of the SMC members to revoke the appointment of
                    the First DC. That e-mail (“the 3 September 2010 e-mail”)
                    read as follows:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span></p>

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">1.    We refer to the

                            application for the Disciplinary Committee (DC) [<em>ie</em>, the First DC] to recuse itself. Details of this case

                            appoint a new DC pursuant to Section 42(5) of the Medical
                            Registration Act [(Cap 174, 2004 Rev Ed)], i.e.</p>

                    Medical Registration Act (Cap 174, 2004 Rev Ed) (“the
                    MRA”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     On 17 December 2010, the Appellant filed
                    OS 1252/2010 for leave to apply for:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_11-p2_a"></a>(a)     the Quashing Order on the basis that
                        the SMC’s decision to appoint the Second DC was (i) illegal under
                        the MRA and (ii) tainted by actual or apparent bias on the part of the
                        SMC; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_11-p2_b"></a>(b)     the
                        Prohibiting Order on the basis that it was unreasonable according to the
                        well-established principles enunciated in <em>Associated
                            Provincial Picture Houses, Limited v Wednesbury Corporation</em>
                        [1948] 1 KB 223 (“<em>Wednesbury</em>”) –
                        <em>ie</em>, it was irrational, unfair, prejudicial and
                        oppressive – for the SMC to appoint the Second DC to continue the
                        disciplinary proceedings against the Appellant in respect of the 94
                        disciplinary charges laid before the First DC.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The
                    Appellant also sought leave to apply for a declaration that the Medical
                    Registration (Amendment) Regulations 2010 (S 528/2010) (“the
                    S 528/2010 Amendment Regulations”) were null and void on the grounds
                    that they were, in their entirety, contrary to natural justice.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The Judge’s decision</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     The Appellant advanced a large number of
                    arguments in support of her application in OS 1252/2010. It is not
                    necessary for us to set out those arguments in detail as they were addressed
                    comprehensively by the Judge in the HC Judgment. The Judge’s rulings on
                    the Appellant’s arguments may be summarised as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_12-p2_a"></a>(a)     The SMC had the power under
                        s 41(3) of the MRA to appoint the Second DC after revoking the
                        appointment of the First DC under s 42(5) of the MRA (see [36] and [98]
                        of the HC Judgment).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_12-p2_b"></a>(b)     The appointment of the Second DC complied with the requirement of
                        immediacy under s 41(3) of the MRA as the relevant time frames for this
                        purpose were 7 September 2010 (the date of the SMC’s decision to
                        revoke the appointment of the First DC) and 14 September 2010 (the date
                        of the SMC’s decision to appoint the Second DC) (see [37] and [40] of
                        the HC Judgment).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_12-p2_c"></a>(c)     Even if time had begun to run from 17 November 2008 (the date of
                        the CC’s Order), in view of the objects of the MRA, the unusual
                        recusal of the First DC and the revocation of its appointment by the SMC as
                        well as the absence of any evidence of substantial prejudice to the
                        Appellant, the time requirement was directory (see [44] of the HC
                        Judgment).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_12-p2_d"></a>(d)     The
                        Appellant’s argument that the SMC should have referred the Complaint
                        to a fresh Complaints Committee first before appointing a new Disciplinary
                        Committee (<em>viz</em>, the Second DC) after the
                        recusal of the First DC did not comport with the structure and objectives
                        contemplated by the disciplinary process set out in the MRA. As there was
                        already the CC’s Order on the record, no practical purpose would be
                        served by sending the same complaint (<em>viz</em>, the
                        Complaint) to another Complaints Committee (see [45] of the HC
                        Judgment).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_12-p2_e"></a>(e)     As
                        s 12(5) of the MRA expressly empowered the SMC to make rules for the
                        conduct of its business, the SMC could conduct its business either with or
                        without physical meetings. Accordingly, the Appellant’s argument that
                        the SMC must hold a physical meeting in order to revoke the First DC’s
                        appointment and appoint the Second DC was devoid of merit (see [46] and [98]
                        of the HC Judgment).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_12-p2_f"></a>(f)     None of the circumstances raised by the Appellant (as set out below)
                        in support of her argument that there was a reasonable apprehension of bias
                        on the SMC’s part met the legal test of whether there were
                        circumstances which would give rise to a reasonable suspicion or
                        apprehension on the part of a fair-minded reasonable person, with knowledge
                        of the relevant facts, that the decision-making body in question was biased
                        (see [52] of the HC Judgment):</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_12-p2_f-p3_i"></a>(i)       There could be no legal
                            objection, and no inherent conflict of interest, arising only from the
                            fact that the DMS, who was a member of the SMC by virtue of
                                s 4(1)(<em>a</em>) of the MRA, had
                            multiple statutory roles, provided he was not a member of any Complaints
                            Committee or Disciplinary Committee hearing and investigating a
                            complaint against a registered medical practitioner (see [57], [59] and
                            [99] of the HC Judgment).</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_12-p2_f-p3_ii"></a>(ii)       In view of the non-fact-finding nature of the
                            SMC’s role in appointing a Disciplinary Committee to inquire into
                            a complaint and (in the present case) the SMC members’ unanimous
                            decision to appoint the Second DC by reason of the absence of any
                            response by any SMC member to the 13 September 2010 e-mail by the
                            return date (so the Judge thought (see, <em>eg</em>, [61] of the HC Judgment), although Dr Rasanayagam
                            actually objected to the appointment of the Second DC as well as the
                            revocation of the First DC’s appointment (see sub-para (e) of
                                <a href="#p1_26">[26]</a> below)), the fact that the
                            DMS, the First DC’s members and an expert witness in the First DC
                            received that e-mail in their capacity as SMC members did not <em>per se</em> give rise to a reasonable apprehension of
                            bias on the part of the whole of the SMC. There was countervailing
                            factual evidence to the contrary on the record, in that the SMC had
                            approved the appointment to the Second DC of two newly-elected SMC
                            members who had not previously been SMC members when the First DC was
                            appointed, with one being a private sector medical practitioner (see
                            [57] and [62] of the HC Judgment).</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_12-p2_f-p3_iii"></a>(iii)       The Appellant’s complaint
                            that those members of the First DC who were registered medical
                            practitioners did not inform her that they were employed by Ministry of
                            Health Holdings Pte Ltd (“MOHH”), which was affiliated to
                            MOHS (thereby giving rise to a potential conflict of interest), had no
                            merit because that complaint had not been raised before the First DC. In
                            any case, s 40(11) of the MRA provided that no SMC member who was
                            employed by MOHS would be disqualified from being a member of a
                            Complaints Committee or a Disciplinary Committee by reason only that he
                            was so employed. This applied <em>a fortiori</em>
                            in relation to SMC members who were employed by restructured corporate
                            hospitals owned by MOHH<em>.</em> Further, the
                            Appellant failed to establish any nexus between the composition of the
                            First DC and all the other SMC members (who were not members of the
                            First DC) so as to infect their “unanimous” decision to
                            appoint the Second DC (see [57] and [63] of the HC
                        Judgment).</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_12-p2_f-p3_iv"></a>(iv)       The independent decision of the First DC to recuse itself in the
                            light of the Appellant’s allegation of prejudgment carried no
                            necessary connection to the decision by the other SMC members (who were
                            not members of the First DC) to appoint the Second DC (see [57] and [64]
                            of the HC Judgment).</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_12-p2_f-p3_v"></a>(v)       The Appellant’s postulation that the SMC
                            ought to have first conducted an inquiry into the First DC’s
                            recusal before appointing the Second DC and that the SMC’s failure
                            to do so created a reasonable apprehension of bias on the SMC’s
                            part had no foundation because there was no statutory obligation on the
                            SMC to conduct such an inquiry. The holding of such an inquiry was also
                            not a statutory precondition to the appointment of the Second DC (see
                            [57] and [65] of the HC Judgment).</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_12-p2_f-p3_vi"></a>(vi)       The presence of the SMC’s
                            in-house counsel in the private room where the First DC (together with
                            the legal assessor) had retired to for a hearing break had been
                            ill-judged, even if the SMC’s in-house counsel had been there for
                            logistical and/or administrative purposes. If the First DC had
                            thereafter proceeded to issue its findings and decision, those
                            circumstances might have justified a quashing of its findings. However,
                            the Appellant was unable to show how the conduct of the SMC’s
                            in-house counsel was linked to all the SMC members so as to infect their
                            “unanimous” decision to appoint the Second DC (see [57]
                            and [66]–[99] of the HC Judgment).</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_12-p2_f-p3_vii"></a>(vii)       The Appellant, in relying on
                            Dr Rasanayagam’s letter dated 16 September 2010 which
                            recorded the SMC’s in-house counsel as having made the remark that
                            the members of the First DC were “on our
                                side”,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_6" id="Ftn_6_1"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span> interpreted that remark
                            out of context. In any case, the Appellant was unable to show how that
                            remark of the SMC’s in-house counsel was linked to all the SMC
                            members so as to infect their “unanimous” decision to
                            appoint the Second DC (see [57] and [66]–[99] of the HC
                            Judgment).</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_12-p2_f-p3_viii"></a>(viii)       The Appellant’s complaint that the
                            3 September 2010 e-mail misrepresented the nature and significance
                            of the recusal of the First DC was unfounded. At the minimum, the
                            3 September 2010 e-mail had to state the decision that the SMC
                            proposed to take and the reason why it was necessary for that decision
                            to be taken. The SMC members could have asked for more details, but none
                            of them did so (see [69]–[70] of the HC
                        Judgment).</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_12-p2_f-p3_ix"></a>(ix)       The brevity of the 3 September 2010 e-mail was explained in
                            the e-mail itself as being necessary to preserve confidentiality. Such
                            brevity protected the integrity of the disciplinary process and
                            preserved the confidentiality of the deliberations of the First DC. That
                            was critical because the Second DC was to be appointed by the SMC to
                            hear the very same complaint which had been before the First DC
                                (<em>viz</em>, the Complaint). Releasing the
                            entire transcript of the First DC’s hearing would have prejudiced
                            the Appellant because under s 42(1)(<em>a</em>) of the MRA, at least two members of the Second DC would
                            be SMC members (see [71] of the HC Judgment).</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_12-p2_f-p3_x"></a>(x)       There could be no real
                            objection to the First DC’s recusal being characterised as a
                            procedural matter as the Appellant’s counsel had indeed made a
                            procedural application to the First DC for it to recuse itself (see [69]
                            and [71] of the HC Judgment).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_12-p2_g"></a>(g)     A decision would only be considered irrational
                        in the <em>Wednesbury</em> sense if the decision-making
                        body in question took into consideration matters that it should not have
                        taken into account and/or failed to take into consideration matters that it
                        was bound to consider, or, alternatively, if the decision was so absurd that
                        no reasonable decision-making body could have made such a decision (see [73]
                        of the HC Judgment).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_12-p2_h"></a>(h)     The SMC’s decision to appoint the Second DC was not a decision
                        that touched on the substance or merits of the Complaint. The SMC also did
                        not consider matters that it should not have considered, nor did it fail to
                        consider any matter that it was bound to consider (see [76], [77] and [100]
                        of the HC Judgment).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_12-p2_i"></a>(i)     The Appellant’s argument on considerations of unfairness,
                        prejudice and oppression was taken out of context and did not independently
                        support the grant of the Prohibiting Order. In any event, any unfairness,
                        prejudice or oppression did not arise from any inaction or delay on the part
                        of the SMC or the First DC. They were, instead, unavoidable consequences of
                        the recusal of the First DC (see [78] and [100] of the HC
                    Judgment).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_12-p2_j"></a>(j)     The
                        Appellant’s argument at the high level of abstraction that the SMC had
                        a legal obligation to ensure a fair disciplinary process did not cohere with
                        the structure and provisions of the MRA. The structure of the disciplinary
                        process was not set by the SMC. Instead, the structure was set by Parliament
                        in enacting the MRA. In the operation of the statutory disciplinary process,
                        fairness was ensured by the court’s supervision to ensure that fair
                        processes were followed in every case. The fact that the MRA provided that
                        the DMS was statutorily the Registrar of the SMC and a member of the SMC did
                        not in any way detract from the statutory disciplinary process being a fair
                        one (see [79], [81] and [99] of the HC Judgment).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_12-p2_k"></a>(k)     The Appellant’s application to
                        declare the S 528/2010 Amendment Regulations illegal on the grounds
                        that they were contrary to natural justice was misconceived. As those
                        regulations were not applicable to the Second DC, the issue was hypothetical
                        (see [84], [90] and [101] of the HC Judgment).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The issues and arguments on appeal</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     The arguments of the Appellant’s counsel
                    before this court were largely an elaboration of arguments which had been
                    rejected by the Judge. Before we examine those arguments, it is desirable that
                    we first describe the statutory framework regulating disciplinary proceedings
                    against registered medical practitioners that is applicable to the present case.
                    An understanding of the statutory framework will lead to a better appreciation
                    of some of the issues of procedural justice and fairness that were raised by the
                    Appellant. According to the Appellant, procedural justice and fairness were
                    lacking generally under the applicable statutory framework, and in particular
                        <em>vis-à-vis</em> her case.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The statutory framework applicable to the present case</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     The statutory framework that applies to the
                    present case is set out in ss 38–43 in Pt VII of the MRA. That
                    statutory framework has since been amended by the Medical Registration
                    (Amendment) Act 2010 (Act 1 of 2010) (“the 2010 Amendment
                    Act”), which is not relevant in the present case as it came into
                    operation only on 1 December 2010 (in this regard, we should clarify that
                    the term “the MRA” as used in this judgment refers to the Medical
                    Registration Act (Cap 174, 2004 Rev Ed) as it stood prior to the
                    coming into force of the 2010 Amendment Act). The statutory provisions
                    applicable to the present case establish four regulatory bodies to deal with
                    complaints against registered medical practitioners, each with different
                    functions and duties. These four bodies consist of the SMC, the CP, the
                    Complaints Committee and the Disciplinary Committee.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     The SMC is constituted under s 4 of the

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     A Disciplinary Committee is appointed from
                    time to time by the SMC pursuant to s 42(1) of the MRA to inquire into any
                    complaint which a Complaints Committee has decided requires a formal inquiry by
                    a Disciplinary Committee. Each Disciplinary Committee is appointed from among
                    the members of the CP, and consists of:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_18-p2_a"></a>(a)     not less than three registered
                        medical practitioners of at least ten years’ standing, at least two of

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     The sequence of references from the making of
                    a complaint to a hearing of that complaint by a Disciplinary Committee is as
                    follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_19-p2_a"></a>(a)     Under s 39(1)(<em>a</em>) of the MRA, any complaint concerning “the
                        conduct of a registered medical practitioner in his professional capacity or
                        … his improper act or conduct which brings disrepute to his
                        profession” shall be made to the SMC, which “<em>shall</em>” [emphasis added] refer the complaint
                        to the chairman of the CP.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_19-p2_b"></a>(b)     Under s 39(7) of the MRA, where any complaint is
                        referred to the chairman of the CP, the chairman of the CP “<em>shall</em>” [emphasis added] lay the complaint
                        before a Complaints Committee.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_19-p2_c"></a>(c)     Under s 40(1)(<em>a</em>) of
                        the MRA, a Complaints Committee “<em>shall</em>” [emphasis added] inquire into any complaint laid
                        before it and complete its inquiry not later than three months from the date
                        on which the complaint was laid before it.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_19-p2_d"></a>(d)     Under s 41(1)(<em>b</em>)(ii) of the MRA, upon due inquiry into a complaint, the
                        Complaints Committee, if it is of the view that a formal inquiry is
                        necessary, “<em>shall</em>” [emphasis
                        added] order that an inquiry be held by a Disciplinary
                    Committee.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_19-p2_e"></a>(e)     Under
                        s 41(3) of the MRA, where a Complaints Committee has ordered that a
                        formal inquiry be held by a Disciplinary Committee, “the [SMC]
                            <em>shall immediately</em> appoint a Disciplinary
                        Committee which <em>shall</em> hear and investigate the
                        complaint” [emphasis added].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     It can be seen from these provisions that once
                    a complaint against a registered medical practitioner for professional
                    misconduct is received by the SMC, the statutory procedures take effect as a
                    matter of course as mandated by these provisions. The only precondition for the
                    appointment of a Disciplinary Committee is a finding by a Complaints Committee,
                    after due inquiry into a complaint, that a formal inquiry by a Disciplinary
                    Committee is necessary. With this statutory framework in mind, we shall now
                    address the Appellant’s arguments on the Quashing Order, followed by her
                    arguments on the Prohibiting Order.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The Quashing Order</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Whether the appointment of the Second DC complied with the statutory
                framework</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     The Appellant raised no objection to the
                    legality or validity of the appointment of the First DC or the composition of
                    its members, whether in terms of compliance with the provisions of the MRA or in
                    terms of apparent bias. In contrast, she raised issues of legality and apparent
                    bias against <em>the SMC</em> in relation to the
                    appointment of the Second DC, although she did not make any allegation of
                    apparent bias against any member of <em>the Second DC</em>.
                    When asked by this court to clarify the Appellant’s stance on the issue of
                    apparent bias <em>vis-à-vis</em> the Second DC, counsel for
                    the Appellant replied that the issue was not relevant in this appeal and that he
                    wished to reserve the Appellant’s position on the issue.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     The argument by the Appellant’s counsel
                        <em>vis-à-vis</em> the appointment of the Second DC was
                    that the appointment: (a) was not in accordance with the provisions of the
                    MRA; and (b) was vitiated by apparent bias on the SMC’s part. In the
                    course of his submissions before us, counsel for the Appellant also asserted
                    that the SMC had no jurisdiction to even refer the Complaint to the chairman of
                    the CP as the Appellant’s alleged overcharging of the Patient was not a
                    disciplinary matter, but a commercial dispute between the Appellant and the
                    Patient.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The aftermath of the First DC’s recusal</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     As we mentioned earlier, after the First DC
                    recused itself, the disciplinary proceedings against the Appellant came to a
                    stop. At that point in time, the SMC had called all its evidence and had closed
                    its case. The Appellant had yet to call any evidence as her counsel had decided
                    to make a submission of no case to answer. The First DC’s conduct in
                    recusing itself without ruling on the Appellant’s submission of no case to
                    answer resulted in the disciplinary proceedings being left in limbo, but not
                    terminated. The disciplinary proceedings were not at an end yet as the First DC
                    had not made any ruling on the merits of the SMC’s case against the
                    Appellant and also had not dismissed the Complaint. Instead, the First DC walked
                    away from the disciplinary proceedings because it received no support from
                    counsel for the SMC to carry on with the proceedings after the Appellant’s
                    counsel submitted that the First DC had prejudged his submission of no case to
                    answer.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     The result of the First DC’s recusal, it
                    could be argued, was either that the First DC extinguished itself as a
                    disciplinary body, or that its entire membership became vacant. Whatever the
                    legal consequence of the First DC’s recusal might be, it did not
                    automatically discharge the CC’s Order (which was made under
                        s 41(1)(<em>b</em>)(ii) of the MRA) for a formal
                    inquiry to be held by a Disciplinary Committee. The CC’s Order was not
                    spent, as found by the Judge (and with which we agree). Hence, in our view,
                    despite the vigorous submissions by counsel for the Appellant that the Complaint
                    should have been laid before a fresh Complaints Committee after the First DC
                    recused itself, such an approach was not necessary and would not accord with the
                    statutory framework. The CC’s Order remained in force under the MRA and
                    had to be acted upon by the SMC. Consequently, the SMC had a statutory duty to
                    take steps to complete the disciplinary proceedings against the Appellant as
                    required by the CC’s Order. It only remained for the SMC had to decide how
                    to proceed further with those proceedings. In our view, the SMC really had only
                    two choices. It could appoint new members to fill the vacancies in the First DC
                    resulting from its original members’ recusal (as it did when it appointed
                    A/Prof Jacobsen to fill the vacancy arising from the death of Dr Wong
                    Yue Sie), or it could appoint a new Disciplinary Committee. The SMC sought legal
                    advice on the matter (see <a href="#p1_7">[7]</a> above). This
                    led to the revocation of the First DC’s appointment and the appointment of
                    the Second DC.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     No argument was made before us as to whether
                    it was even necessary for the SMC to revoke the appointment of the First DC. As
                    we stated earlier, it could be contended that the First DC’s recusal from
                    the disciplinary proceedings resulted in the extinguishment of the First DC as a
                    disciplinary body. If that was indeed the consequence, then it would not even
                    have been necessary for the SMC to revoke the First DC’s appointment as
                    there would have been no extant body to revoke. In other words, the purported
                    revocation would have no effect in law. Be that as it may, whichever way the SMC
                    went about the matter, the CC’s Order was still in effect, and the
                    Complaint had to be referred to a Disciplinary Committee for inquiry. Hence, the
                    appointment of the Second DC was in compliance with the MRA.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The Appellant’s arguments</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(1)   Whether the SMC members met to approve the revocation of the
                First DC’s appointment and the appointment of the Second DC</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     The Appellant’s first argument as to why
                    the revocation of the First DC’s appointment and the appointment of the
                    Second DC via the 3 September 2010 e-mail and the 13 September 2010
                    e-mail (collectively, “the Two E-mails”) were not in accordance
                    with the MRA consisted of the following strands:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_26-p2_a"></a>(a)     There was no true consultative
                        meeting of minds among the SMC members, and, therefore, no lawful meeting
                        was held to revoke the First DC’s appointment and appoint the Second
                        DC.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_26-p2_b"></a>(b)     Crucial
                        facts were misrepresented to or withheld from the SMC members. The Two
                        E-mails erroneously asserted that the SMC was <em>obliged</em> to revoke the appointment of the First DC and that
                        the appointment of the Second DC was an administrative
                    matter.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_26-p2_c"></a>(c)     The manner
                        in which the SMC made the two decisions revoking the First DC’s
                        appointment and appointing the Second DC – namely, with silence on the
                        part of the SMC members taken to mean assent – conveniently dispensed
                        with a consultative decision-making process.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_26-p2_d"></a>(d)     There was no evidence that all the SMC members
                        received, read and/or considered the Two E-mails so as to appreciate their
                        importance, or to understand that they would be deemed by their silence to
                        have assented to the SMC’s proposal to revoke the First DC’s
                        appointment and appoint the Second DC.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_26-p2_e"></a>(e)     Dr Rasanayagam, the only SMC member who replied to
                        the Two E-mails, voted against the proposed decisions, but the other SMC
                        members were not informed of this. Another SMC member said that he had
                        received the Two E-mails but had not participated in the SMC’s
                        proposed decisions.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_26-p2_f"></a>(f)     No SMC member actually approved the SMC’s proposed decisions,
                        whether in the light of full or adequate information on the circumstances
                        then faced by the SMC or otherwise.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     Except for the argument in sub-para (d)
                    of the preceding paragraph, all the other aforesaid arguments were canvassed
                    before the Judge, who ruled that they, even if made out, would not have the
                    effect of nullifying the appointment of the Second DC. Before us, counsel for
                    the Appellant did not explain where the Judge erred in rejecting those
                    arguments. The Judge rejected those arguments on the basis that the SMC had a
                    statutory duty (and therefore <em>no discretion</em> in the
                    matter) to appoint a new Disciplinary Committee to complete the disciplinary
                    proceedings against the Appellant which the First DC had failed to complete. In
                    contrast, the arguments of the Appellant’s counsel were made on the
                    assumption that the SMC <em>had the discretion not</em> to
                    continue those proceedings, and that the SMC members could vote to terminate
                    those proceedings. In our view, the position taken by the Appellant’s
                    counsel was neither consistent with nor supported by the statutory framework.
                    The SMC had no power to disregard the CC’s Order, which was still
                    operative. So long as the CC’s Order remained alive, the SMC’s
                    statutory duty also remained alive. The SMC thus had no choice but to appoint
                    another Disciplinary Committee to continue the disciplinary proceedings against
                    the Appellant after the First DC recused itself. If the SMC had failed to
                    appoint another Disciplinary Committee, it would have been open to the Minister,
                    under s 41(8) of the MRA, to order the SMC to immediately appoint a new
                    Disciplinary Committee to hear and investigate the Complaint.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     Given these circumstances, the
                    Appellant’s complaint about the absence of a consultative decision-making
                    process in respect of the revocation of the First DC’s appointment and the
                    appointment of the Second DC was beside the point. There was no need for any
                    consultation as to whether or not the appointment of a new Disciplinary
                    Committee was necessary or wise as the SMC had no discretion in the matter. The
                    approval of the SMC members was a procedural requirement of a formal nature,
                    and, in this regard, their approval by a majority was sufficient. We should add
                    that Dr Rasanayagam’s objection to the revocation of the First
                    DC’s appointment and the appointment of the Second DC did not affect the
                    validity of any decision made by the SMC on these two matters so long as the
                    decision was approved by a majority of the SMC members.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     Although the SMC had a statutory duty to
                    appoint a new Disciplinary Committee after the First DC recused itself, it had
                    to discharge that duty in accordance with the substantive and procedural
                    requirements of the law. Procedurally, this meant that the SMC had to secure the
                    approval of at least a majority of the SMC members to its proposal to revoke the
                    First DC’s appointment and appoint the Second DC. How such approval was to
                    be obtained was entirely a matter for the SMC to determine. For this purpose, an
                    approval given by circular would be just as valid as a formal approval given at
                    a formal meeting. With current technology, a meeting of minds via e-mails would
                    be sufficient for this purpose. Hence, in our view, the sending of the Two
                    E-mails, both of which stated that the SMC members would be deemed to have
                    agreed to the proposals set out therein if they did not respond by the
                    stipulated deadline, was a proper way for the SMC to seek the assent of the SMC
                    members to the revocation of the First DC’s appointment and the
                    appointment of the Second DC.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(2)   Whether all the SMC members received, read and/or considered
                the Two E-mails </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     Before us, counsel for the Appellant argued
                    that the SMC had not produced any evidence that the Two E-mails had been
                    received, read and/or considered by all the SMC members, and, accordingly, the
                    SMC had not established that there had been a meeting of the SMC members to
                    revoke the First DC’s appointment and appoint the Second DC, or that the
                    SMC members had agreed to the proposals set out in the Two E-mails. The
                    SMC’s response to this argument was that the Appellant had not alleged in
                    the court below that the Two E-mails might not have been received, read and/or
                    considered by all the SMC members. If that argument had been raised before the
                    Judge, counsel for the SMC submitted, the SMC would have applied to adduce
                    evidence (in the form of affidavits from the SMC members) to rebut the argument.
                    Counsel for the SMC stated that to his understanding, the Appellant’s
                    argument in the court below centred on whether the omission of the SMC members
                    to respond to the Two E-mails was sufficient to constitute assent to the
                    proposals set out in those e-mails. In the SMC’s view, it was sufficient
                    since the Two E-mails made it clear that the SMC members would be assumed to
                    have agreed to the proposals set out therein if they did not reply by,
                    respectively, Tuesday 7 September 2010 (<em>vis-à-vis</em> the 3 September 2010 e-mail) and 5pm on Tuesday,
                    14 September 2010 (<em>vis-à-vis</em> the
                    13 September 2010 e-mail). Counsel for the Appellant disagreed with this
                    submission by the SMC’s counsel, and contended that he had indeed argued
                    before the Judge that the SMC had not shown that all the SMC members had
                    received, read and/or considered the Two E-mails, but counsel for the SMC had
                    not responded to that argument.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     In the light of this factual dispute, we
                    examined the Appellant’s skeletal arguments for the hearing in the court
                    below and found that they did not contain any submission that there might have
                    been SMC members who had not <em>received</em> the Two
                    E-mails. Instead, the argument set out in those skeletal arguments was that
                    there was no evidence that all the SMC members had <em>read
                        and/or </em><em>considered</em> the contents of
                    those e-mails. After reserving judgment, we also examined the certified
                    transcript of the oral submissions before the Judge by counsel for the
                    respective parties. The certified transcript shows that counsel for the
                    Appellant said, in the course of his argument that there must be a meeting of
                    the SMC members in order to revoke the First DC’s appointment and appoint
                    the Second DC, that: (a) there was no evidence as to whom the Two E-mails
                    had been addressed to, who had received them and who had read and/or considered
                    them; and (b) if not all the SMC members had received, read and/or
                    considered the Two E-mails, there could not have been a decision by the SMC
                    members on the proposals set out in those e-mails.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_7" id="Ftn_7_1"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span> The
                    Judge’s response to this argument, as recorded in the certified
                    transcript, was that the Appellant’s allegation that there might have been
                    SMC members who had not received, read and/or considered the Two E-mails was
                        “hypothetical”,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_8" id="Ftn_8_1"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span> and that the
                    only material issue before the court was whether the decision-making process
                    effectuated by means of the Two E-mails was valid in law. We interpret this
                    observation by the Judge to mean that the Appellant’s argument in the
                    court below focused on the validity of that decision-making process, and not on
                    the point that there might have been SMC members who had not received, read
                    and/or considered the Two E-mails. In this regard, it is pertinent to note that
                    in the HC Judgment, the Judge did not deal with the Appellant’s argument
                    relating to the absence of any evidence that all the SMC members had received,
                    read and/or considered the Two E-mails.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     To resolve this disputed issue of fact of
                    whether all the SMC members had received, read and /or considered the Two
                    E-mails, we directed the SMC to file affidavits of the SMC members to address
                    the point. The affidavits have since been filed. However, counsel for the
                    Appellant now contends that the affidavits confirm that: (a) the
                    decision-making process effectuated via the Two E-mails did not yield a valid
                    decision in law; and (b) the SMC members were “unable to state on
                    oath that they had read and understood the emails [<em>viz</em>, the Two E-mails], and [had] decided to approve the proposed
                    decisions by not raising any objections … within the timelines stated in
                    the emails”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_9" id="Ftn_9_1"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span> Accordingly, counsel for the Appellant seeks
                    leave to cross-examine the SMC members on their affidavits if this court is
                    minded, on the evidence, to reach a conclusion contrary to that asserted by the
                    Appellant (as stated earlier in this paragraph).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     In our view, the only material point in
                    connection with the Appellant’s submissions on the Two E-mails is whether
                    the SMC members <em>received</em> them. If the SMC members
                    did receive them, their omission to respond by the stipulated deadlines is
                    sufficient in law to constitute their assent to – and, thus, a valid
                    decision on – the revocation of the First DC’s appointment and the
                    appointment of the Second DC. As we decided earlier, the approval of the SMC
                    members to these two measures was merely a formality as the law required the SMC
                    to appoint a new Disciplinary Committee to complete the disciplinary proceedings
                    which were left in limbo after the First DC recused itself.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     Finally, we would add that the Appellant has,
                    in our view, attempted to make too much out of this issue. The basic principle
                    of evidence in our adversarial process of adjudication is that he who asserts
                    must prove. Hence, the Appellant, in asserting that the SMC did not make a valid
                    decision in law with respect to the revocation of the First DC’s
                    appointment and the appointment of the Second DC, must prove that assertion, and
                    that includes proving that not all the SMC members received the Two E-mails. In
                    our view, the Appellant’s argument on this point fails.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     We should add that even if the
                    Appellant’s argument that there was no proper decision to revoke the First
                    DC’s appointment and appoint the Second DC were correct, it would not
                    bring an end to the disciplinary proceedings against the Appellant in respect of
                    the 94 disciplinary charges laid before the First DC. It would simply mean that
                    the SMC would have to start the process all over again by appointing another
                    Disciplinary Committee to continue the disciplinary proceedings against her as
                    ordered by the CC.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     We accordingly affirm the Judge’s
                    decision that the SMC had held a valid meeting to revoke the appointment of the
                    First DC and appoint the Second DC.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(3)   Whether the immediacy requirement in section 41(3) of
                the MRA was satisfied</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     The Appellant next argued that the immediacy
                    requirement in s 41(3) of the MRA (the provision under which the Second DC
                    was appointed) was not satisfied <em>vis-à-vis</em> the
                    appointment of the Second DC. This was because s 41(3) required the SMC to
                    appoint a Disciplinary Committee “<em>immediately</em>” [emphasis added] upon a Complaints Committee
                    ordering that a formal inquiry into a complaint be held, whereas in the present
                    case, some 22 months elapsed from the date of the CC’s Order (<em>ie</em>, 17 November 2008) before the Second DC was
                    appointed. This argument was also made before the Judge, who rejected it on the
                    grounds that the relevant starting time for the purposes of s 41(3) of the
                    MRA was the date of the SMC’s decision to revoke the appointment of the
                    First DC, and not the date of the CC’s Order. The Judge further held that
                    even if time had begun to run from the date of the CC’s Order, the
                    requirement of immediacy was directory as (<em>inter
                        alia</em>) there was no evidence of substantial prejudice to the
                    Appellant (see [44] of the HC Judgment; see also sub-para (c) of <a href="#p1_12">[12]</a> above).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     The SMC’s reply to the above argument by
                    the Appellant was that the CC’s Order remained alive, and that since the
                    SMC had complied with s 41(3) of the MRA when it appointed the First DC,
                    the requirement of immediacy had been satisfied. The Second DC, the SMC argued,
                    had been appointed for the sole purpose of completing the disciplinary
                    proceedings that the First DC had left uncompleted. We agree with these
                    submissions. They are entirely consistent with the objective that disciplinary
                    proceedings under the MRA should be commenced and completed with due expedition.
                    This is not a case where a Disciplinary Committee was appointed only 22 months
                    after the CC’s Order. It is, instead, a case where a Disciplinary
                    Committee (<em>viz</em>, the First DC) was appointed
                    timeously, but its recusal led to the disciplinary proceedings against the
                    Appellant being left in limbo, hence giving rise to the need to appoint a fresh
                    DC (<em>viz</em>, the Second DC).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     In relation to the legal basis of the
                    Judge’s holding that the immediacy requirement in s 41(3) of the MRA
                    is directory (apparently following <em>Chai Chwan v Singapore
                        Medical Council</em> [2009] SGHC 115), we would observe (as
                    the Judge also noted) that the dichotomy between the mandatory effect and the
                    directory effect of words (used in statutory provisions) which are <em>ex facie</em> mandatory (<em>eg</em>,
                    the word “shall”) has been abandoned by the English courts in
                    favour of the practical approach of determining Parliament’s intention in
                    each case so as to ascertain whether or not a failure to comply with a
                    “shall” requirement would result in a nullity (see <em>Regina v Soneji and another</em> [2006] 1 AC 340).
                    Our courts should follow suit.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     In the case of s 41(3) of the MRA, we are
                    of the view that Parliament could not have intended that an untimely appointment
                    of a Disciplinary Committee to hear a complaint would render the appointment
                    null and void, with the consequence that the SMC’s power to appoint a
                    Disciplinary Committee for the purposes of that particular complaint would be
                    exhausted. The word “immediately” in s 41(3) is intended to
                    be no more than a direction to the SMC to carry out its duties expeditiously. If
                    an untimely appointment of a Disciplinary Committee has the potential to cause
                    injustice to the registered medical practitioner whose conduct is being inquired
                    into, it would be a material factor which that Disciplinary Committee has to
                    take into account in determining whether the disciplinary charges against that
                    registered medical practitioner have been proved.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Whether there was apparent bias on the SMC’s part in appointing
                the Second DC</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     The next set of arguments advanced by the
                    Appellant apropos the Quashing Order concerned the allegation of apparent bias
                    on the SMC’s part in appointing the Second DC. It was alleged that such
                    bias was evident from the SMC’s actions and inaction <em>vis-à-vis</em> the Appellant and, thus, the court should prohibit
                    further prosecution of the Complaint. The elements of this argument (as taken
                    from the Appellant’s skeletal arguments for the present appeal) were as
                    follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_41-p2_a"></a>(a)     Prof Satku, the DMS at the
                        material time and also the Registrar of the SMC, effectively acted as
                        complainant, investigator and prosecutor in the disciplinary proceedings
                        against the Appellant. When carrying out his overlapping functions, he
                            “<em>formed a personal
                            view</em>”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_10" id="Ftn_10_1"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span> [emphasis in original] on the fees
                        charged by the Appellant. He instigated PS-MOHB to file the Complaint and
                        thereby escalated what was merely a commercial dispute between the Appellant
                        and the Patient to a disciplinary matter. For these reasons, he should not
                        have played a part in appointing the Second DC.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_41-p2_b"></a>(b)     The involvement of the First DC’s members
                        and the SMC’s witnesses in the appointment of the Second DC was a
                        fatal defect because of the inherent conflict of interest in such a
                        situation.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_41-p2_c"></a>(c)     The
                        SMC’s downplaying of the SMC’s in-house counsel’s conduct
                        in retiring to a private room with the First DC and the legal assessor
                        during a hearing break showed the SMC’s dismissive attitude towards
                        important procedural safeguards that were necessary for a fair and proper
                        disciplinary inquiry. It was clear law that the presence of a non-member of
                        a disciplinary tribunal during the tribunal’s deliberations on the
                        complaint before it was, without more, sufficient to invalidate the
                        tribunal’s proceedings, particularly when that person was the
                        prosecutor of the complaint.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_41-p2_d"></a>(d)     Dr Rasanayagam’s letter of 16 September
                        2010 stating that the SMC’s in-house counsel had commented that the
                        First DC was on the SMC’s side only served to compound the appearance
                        of bias manifested by the aforesaid conduct of the SMC’s in-house
                        counsel. The failure of the SMC to inquire into this issue demonstrated that
                        it was not interested in establishing a disciplinary process that was both
                        fair and seen to be fair.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_41-p2_e"></a>(e)     The SMC further failed to address the reasonable
                        apprehension of bias created by its misrepresentation about the procedural
                        defects in the proceedings before the First DC. Those defects were as
                        follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_41-p2_e-p3_i"></a>(i)       The First DC indicated at
                            the start of the reconvened hearing on 29 July 2010 that it was
                            ready, on the basis of the respective parties’ written
                            submissions, to deliver its decision on the Appellant’s submission
                            of no case to answer. However, at that point in time, the First DC had
                            yet to hear the respective parties’ oral arguments on this issue
                            and also had not asked the legal assessor any questions at
                        all.</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_41-p2_e-p3_ii"></a>(ii)       As
                            at 29 July 2010, A/Prof Jacobsen, who had been appointed to
                            the First DC following Dr Wong Yue Sie’s death, had had less
                            than 14 days’ access to the full set of papers relating to the
                            disciplinary proceedings against the Appellant. Yet,
                            A/Prof Jacobsen was apparently able, despite these circumstances,
                            to come to a decision on the complex arguments made apropos the
                            Appellant’s submission of no case to answer.</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_41-p2_e-p3_iii"></a>(iii)       The First DC subsequently
                            recused itself on the basis of the Appellant’s contention that it
                            had prejudged her submission of no case to answer.</p>
<p class="Judg-2">The foregoing were all gravely serious failings which prejudiced the
                        Appellant and undermined the disciplinary process administered by the SMC.
                        The assertion that the SMC was not statutorily required to inquire into
                        these matters or inform the SMC members of what had transpired in the
                        proceedings before the First DC was absurd when the SMC itself acknowledged
                        that the MRA did not provide for the appointment of a new Disciplinary
                        Committee following the First DC’s recusal.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     The Appellant’s purpose in detailing the
                    above elements, many of which were not material to the issues in this appeal
                        (<em>eg</em>, elements (c), (d) and (e)), was to
                    make the point that the SMC had failed in its statutory obligation to provide a
                    disciplinary process that was fair and seen to be fair, and that operated in
                    accordance with the law <em>with respect to her case</em>.
                    In other words, the Appellant presented herself as taking a personal stand in
                    the matter, which, she contended, was <em>for the benefit of the
                        medical profession</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     In reply to the Appellant’s allegations
                    against Prof Satku, counsel for the SMC contended that the evidence showed
                    that Prof Satku did not instigate PS-MOHB to lodge the Complaint against
                    the Appellant. The fact was that officials from MOHB went to see Prof Satku
                    (in the latter’s capacity as the DMS at that time) after receiving the
                    Patient’s complaint about the Appellant’s high charges, and
                    Prof Satku invited MOHB to file a formal complaint so that the matter could
                    be looked into. Contrary to what the Appellant alleged, Prof Satku did not
                    divert MOHB’s complaint about the Appellant’s charges away from
                    civil resolution of the dispute to resolution by the disciplinary process. This
                    could be seen from the fact that PS-MOHB filed the Complaint only <em>after</em> (<em>inter alia</em>)
                    officials from MOHB had met the chief executive officer of Parkway Hospital
                    Group, which owned the hospital where the Appellant treated the Patient, about
                    the Appellant’s charges.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     As for the other elements of apparent bias
                    alleged by the Appellant to present the picture that the SMC had failed to
                    provide a fair disciplinary process in her case, our view is that they were
                    concerned more with <em>the Appellant’s
                        perception</em> of certain irregularities which occurred in the course
                    of the proceedings before the First DC. For example, the Appellant raised the
                    point that the SMC’s in-house counsel had retired to a private room with
                    the First DC and the legal assessor during a hearing break. However, as the
                    Judge found, there was no allegation by the Appellant that the SMC’s
                    in-house counsel had taken any part in the First DC’s deliberations on any
                    of the matters raised in the proceedings before it. The Appellant also brought
                    up the remark by the SMC’s in-house counsel that the First DC was on the
                    SMC’s side. In our view, that remark was taken out of its proper context
                    and misconstrued as indicating that the First DC was biased against the
                    Appellant. That remark was actually made by the SMC’s in-house counsel in
                    response to Dr Rasanayagam’s concern, upon receiving the
                    3 September 2010 e-mail, that the SMC’s proposal to revoke the First
                    DC’s appointment might lead to the First DC’s members suing the SMC
                    (presumably for defamation) as they might regard such revocation as “[a]
                    blemish on their professional or personal reputation”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_11" id="Ftn_11_1"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span>
                    What the Appellant appeared to be arguing was that because the First DC recused
                    itself for the reason which it did (<em>viz</em>, on the
                    basis of the Appellant’s contention that it had prejudged her submission
                    of no case to answer), the SMC must address the reasonable apprehension of bias
                    created by or evident from such recusal. We are unable to see how any reasonable
                    apprehension of bias could have arisen from that incident. The Appellant failed
                    to show us how the procedural failures of the First DC supported her allegation
                    that the SMC created an unfair disciplinary process in her case when the SMC has
                    nothing to do with the statutory framework for disciplinary proceedings against
                    registered medical practitioners (see <a href="#p1_46">[46]</a>
                    below).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     The Appellant also argued that there was a
                    reasonable apprehension of bias on the SMC’s part as the SMC, in sending
                    out the 3 September 2010 e-mail, merely described the Appellant’s
                    application to disqualify the whole of the First DC as a <em>procedural</em> application, instead of pointing out to the SMC
                    members that it was a unique application of considerable seriousness to both the
                    Appellant and the SMC’s reputation. Counsel for the Appellant further
                    argued that in so describing the Appellant’s application, the SMC
                    misrepresented crucial facts to or withheld such facts from the SMC members. We
                    see no merit in these arguments. In our view, the Appellant’s recusal
                    application <em>was</em> purely procedural in nature, and
                    there was thus no misrepresentation by the SMC in so describing that
                    application. Further, counsel for the Appellant did not explain to us how the
                    contents of the 3 September 2010 e-mail could have given rise to a
                    reasonable suspicion of bias on the part of the SMC. All that the SMC did in
                    sending out that e-mail was to give the SMC members the background as to why
                    there was a need to appoint a new Disciplinary Committee. In the court below,
                    the Judge rejected the Appellant’s arguments concerning the
                    3 September 2010 e-mail on the grounds that the SMC’s decision not to
                    disclose the reasons why the First DC had recused itself was a precautionary
                    measure to guard against influencing the SMC members in their decision on
                    whether or not to assent to the appointment of the Second DC. We agree with this
                    reasoning. In our view, whatever the First DC did and why it did what it did
                    were of no concern to the SMC members apropos the appointment of the Second DC.
                    They were merely being asked to agree formally to the revocation of the First
                    DC, as well as to the appointment of the Second DC and the composition of its
                    members.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     In our view, the Appellant was attempting to
                    cast a cloud of suspicion over the conduct of Prof Satku by alleging that
                    he either administered or endorsed an unfair disciplinary process for the formal
                    inquiry into the Complaint. In our view, the Appellant attacked the wrong
                    target. While s 5 of the MRA vests the SMC with authority to regulate the
                    ethical standards of registered medical practitioners, the SMC is not
                    responsible for establishing the disciplinary framework applicable to registered
                    medical practitioners. The framework has instead been established by Parliament
                    via ss 38–43 of the MRA. The SMC’s duties under these
                    provisions are all “ministerial” or administrative in nature. The
                    SMC has no discretion in the matter once it receives a complaint (whether from
                    the DMS, MOHS or other sources) against a registered medical practitioner (see
                    s 39(1) of the MRA). The SMC merely acts as a conduit in such
                    circumstances, and, therefore, no issue of bias can arise with respect to the
                    SMC discharging its statutory duties. This is also the case when the SMC
                    appoints a Disciplinary Committee upon receiving a Complaints Committee’s
                    order that a formal inquiry into a complaint should be held by a Disciplinary
                    Committee (see s 41(3) of the MRA).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     Early cases on administrative law referred to
                    duties of the kind outlined above as “ministerial” duties because
                    they did not involve the exercise of any discretion or judgment. Reference may
                    be made to Lord Woolf, Jeffrey Jowell &amp; Andrew Le Sueur, <em>De Smith’s Judicial Review</em> (Sweet &amp; Maxwell,
                    6th Ed, 2007) at para B-008 for an explanation of the use of the term
                    “ministerial” to describe statutory duties or functions which do
                    not involve the exercise of any discretion or judgment.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     In the present case, the only discretion which
                    the SMC has in the chain of ministerial duties or functions set out in
                    ss 38–43 of the MRA is in respect of the selection of the members of
                    a Disciplinary Committee. In the context of this statutory framework, the
                    allegation that Prof Satku (the DMS at the material time) was biased
                    against the Appellant, had formed an adverse opinion on the Appellant’s
                    charges and had multiple roles to play in the disciplinary process could not
                    give rise to any unfairness or perception of unfairness in the disciplinary
                    process. In the present case, the critical issue is not the role of the DMS as a
                    member of the SMC, but whether there was a reasonable apprehension that
                    Prof Satku caused the SMC to appoint, as members of the Second DC, persons
                    in respect of whom there was a reasonable suspicion that they would or might,
                    for whatever reason, be biased against the Appellant. Neither the DMS nor the
                    SMC has any role to play in the disciplinary proceedings before the Second DC or
                    the outcome of those proceedings, both of which are entirely matters for the
                    Second DC. Hence, any allegation of bias (or other grounds of disqualification)
                    should have been directed against the members of the Second DC. However, no
                    allegation of this nature has been made by the Appellant thus far. When asked by
                    this court whether the Appellant would be making any allegation of bias against
                    the members of Second DC, counsel for the Appellant did not wish to commit his
                    client to any position (see <a href="#p1_21">[21]</a> above).
                    Until the Appellant takes a position on this issue, there is no legal basis on
                    which a court can consider granting the Quashing Order sought by the
                    Appellant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     In short, the Appellant’s case before
                    the Judge and on appeal <em>vis-à-vis</em> the Quashing
                    Order was, in our view, entirely misconceived.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The Prohibiting Order</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     We turn now to the Prohibiting Order. As
                    originally pleaded, the Appellant’s case on the Prohibiting Order was that
                    the SMC’s decision to appoint the Second DC was unreasonable or irrational
                    in the <em>Wednesbury</em> sense. As we explained earlier,
                    the position is in fact the contrary –
                    <em>ie</em>, it would be irrational (and also a dereliction
                    of duty) for the SMC not to have appointed another Disciplinary Committee to
                    continue the disciplinary proceedings against the Appellant after the First DC
                    recused itself.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     Before us, the Appellant advanced a new
                    argument based on the recent judgment of the Court of 3 Judges in <em>Law Society of Singapore v Andre Ravindran </em><em>Saravanapavan </em><em>Arul</em>
                    [2011] SGHC 224 (“<em>Arul</em>”).
                    Relying on certain observations of the Court of 3 Judges in <em>Arul</em> on the legal nature of overcharging by an advocate and
                    solicitor for professional services, counsel for the Appellant argued that the
                    SMC had no jurisdiction to prefer charges of overcharging against the Appellant
                    on the sole basis of “numbers” and/or was irrational in doing so.
                    What the Appellant’s counsel meant was that in the absence of any
                    allegation that the Appellant rendered her bills to the Patient dishonestly,
                    improperly or in abuse of the doctor-patient relationship, the fact that she
                    charged an apparently exorbitant sum for her services (whatever the amount might
                    be) would not found a charge of professional misconduct.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     The Appellant’s counsel pointed out that
                    in the present case, there was <em>prima facie</em>
                    evidence of a fee agreement between the Appellant and the Patient as the
                    Appellant had previously informed the Patient that she would be charged around
                    $100,000 to $200,000 a day for her medical care and treatment, and the Patient
                    had expressed no disagreement. It was also argued that the evidence on the
                    record showed that in the five years prior to 2007, the Patient was content to
                    pay and did pay fees of equivalent magnitude to those which were the subject
                    matter of the Complaint. All of those previous bills were checked, verified and
                    paid in full by the office of the Sultan of Brunei and MOHB. Given those
                    circumstances, the Appellant’s counsel submitted, there was no reason to
                    escalate the dispute between the Appellant and the Patient into a disciplinary
                    matter.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     The SMC’s reply to this argument was
                    that the Patient had not agreed to the Appellant’s estimated fees as the
                    occasion when the Appellant had mentioned her estimated fees to the Patient had
                    not been an appropriate or conducive occasion for the latter to agree to any
                    particular fee or level of fees for her medical care and treatment. The SMC
                    disputed the Appellant’s version of the alleged discussion with the
                    Patient on fees.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     In our view, whether there was indeed a fee
                    agreement between the Appellant and the Patient is an issue of fact for the
                    Second DC to decide. Similarly, the issue of whether or not there was any
                    overcharging by the Appellant and, if so, whether it would amount to
                    professional misconduct are matters to be resolved by the Second DC. In the
                    present proceedings, the role of the court is limited to deciding whether, as a
                    matter of law, the SMC had the power to appoint the Second DC to continue the
                    disciplinary proceedings against the Appellant and, if so, whether the power was
                    exercised in accordance with the law. On both of these issues, we have ruled in
                    favour of the SMC. The Appellant’s arguments based on <em>Arul</em> are premature, and should be raised before the Second DC
                    for its consideration.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     Be that as it may, it is necessary that we
                    correct any suggestion that in <em>Arul</em>, the Court of
                    3 Judges decided that an allegation of overcharging for professional services
                    should, in law, be viewed as a commercial dispute and not as a matter of
                    professional ethics. In the general context of professional services, if the
                    service provider and the client agree on the fee payable for the services to be
                    rendered, and if the services are rendered in accordance with the terms of the
                    agreement, no issue of overcharging would normally arise, however high the fee
                    may seem to another client or another service provider in the same profession.
                    But, as held by the Court of 3 Judges in <em>Arul</em>,
                    overcharging can still arise even where there is a fee agreement if the service
                    provider pads his bill or does unnecessary work of a kind not specified in his
                    fee agreement with his client. Overcharging for professional services simply
                    means either charging, in respect of services rendered, an amount beyond what is
                    reasonably chargeable for those kinds of services, or charging for unnecessary
                    services or services not rendered at all. In the last-mentioned instance,
                    overcharging might even amount to dishonesty and/or cheating. Whether or not
                    overcharging in a particular profession crosses the threshold of acceptable
                    professional conduct into the realm of punishable professional misconduct is a
                    matter for the relevant professional body to decide in the first instance, and,
                    if there is an appeal, ultimately by a court of law, on the facts of each case.
                    The decision of the Court of 3 Judges in <em>Arul</em> is
                    not an authority for the proposition that professionals are entitled to
                    overcharge their clients. It actually affirms the law to the
                contrary.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     Finally, we should add that even if the
                    Appellant’s arguments on overcharging have any substance, they would not
                    touch on those disciplinary charges against her which relate to making false
                    representations in invoices rendered to the Patient.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     For the above reasons, this appeal is
                    dismissed with costs and the usual consequential orders.</p>
