</div> He appealed against his sentence, contending that it was excessive. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 When the appeal first came before me for hearing, it appeared to me that there was a legal question relating to the interpretation of the Moneylenders Act (Cap 188, 2010 Rev Ed) (“the current MLA”) which could potentially work in the Appellant’s favour – namely, whether an offender who was presently convicted of a harassment offence under s 28 of the current MLA was liable to enhanced punishment under that section if his previous conviction was for <span class="font-italic">abetting</span> acts of harassment, rather than actually committing such acts (“the Legal Question”). This question turned on the proper interpretation of s 28. As the Appellant was not represented, I adjourned the hearing for him to obtain legal assistance. He was, however, unsuccessful in his application for criminal legal aid. I thus appointed a young <span class="font-italic">amicus curiae</span>, Mr Lin Yuankai (“Mr Lin”), to assist the court. After considering the written and oral submissions of both Mr Lin and the Prosecution, I answered the Legal Question in the <span class="font-italic">affirmative</span>. Furthermore, having considered the parties’ submissions, I did not find the Appellant’s overall sentence manifestly excessive. I therefore dismissed the appeal.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">3 The grounds set out herein pertain largely to the Legal Question, which I shall address after laying out the relevant background of the case. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Background facts</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">4 The Appellant, who is aged 36 this year, was, at the material time, a part-time security officer.

When the Appellant defaulted on the repayments, Hasim told the Appellant to repay him by borrowing money from another loan shark known as “Ben”.

</div> The Appellant’s actions were premeditated and calculated to evade police detection. The Appellant was persistent in his approach, and even harassed one household despite the presence of a CCTV camera outside that residence. He was also indiscriminate, as could be seen from his harassment of a housing unit that did not even belong to the alleged debtor in the case of the sixth proceeded charge. Motivated by the lure of easy money, the Appellant caused property damage. His mitigation was unexceptional – he claimed to have acted out of desperation, but he had (so he said) borrowed money from Hasim to pay, in part, his car instalments.

Furthermore, despite having been trained as a security officer, whose job was to protect persons and property, the Appellant had engaged in “acts that were the direct antithesis” (see the GD at [50]). In addition, the “aggravating effect” of the 22 charges taken into consideration for sentencing purposes could not be ignored – the number of charges was large and “reflected a campaign of harassment/terror” (see the GD at [51]).

</div> He noted that although all the charges against the Appellant were framed under s 28 of the current MLA, they related to “incidents at different dates, times, addresses and in connection with different loans [to] different debtors” (see the GD at [56]). The Appellant’s offences could thus be considered “distinct offences”, and “not part of [a] single transaction” (see likewise [56] of the GD). In the DJ’s view, ordering only two of the Appellant’s imprisonment sentences to run consecutively “would not adequately reflect the total culpability of the [Appellant] for all his acts” (see the GD at [58]); it would also result in an aggregate imprisonment sentence which was shorter than that imposed on some first-time harassers who had committed multiple offences.

This question arose due to the wording of, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, s 28(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>), which provides that a person who acts on an unlicensed moneylender’s behalf to commit or attempt to commit “<span class="font-italic">any of the acts specified in </span><span class="font-italic">[s 28(1)] shall be guilty of an offence</span>” [emphasis added], and “in the case of <span class="font-italic">a second or subsequent offence</span>” [emphasis added], shall, on conviction, be subject to enhanced punishment. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">18 In essence, the Legal Question was whether, in view of the Appellant’s antecedent offence of <span class="font-italic">abetting</span> the commission of acts of harassment,<span class="font-italic"> </span>his present offence of actually committing such acts would constitute “a second or subsequent offence” for the purposes of ss 28(2) and 28(3) of the current MLA. To state the question in another way, does the word “offence” in the context of the phrase “a second or subsequent offence” include an offence of <span class="font-italic">abetting</span> the commission of acts of harassment? Although s 109 of the Penal Code provides that an abettor of an offence shall, if no express punishment for such abetment is stipulated in the Penal Code, be punished with the same punishment as that prescribed for that offence, the offence of abetment and the principal offence abetted remain distinct offences in law. Section 109 does not appear to have equated the abetment of an offence with the commission of that offence. In this regard, I note that s 28(1) of the current MLA, to which both ss 28(2) and 28(3) refer, does not include the offence of abetting the commission of acts of harassment; instead, such abetment is separately addressed in s 28A.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">19 The hearing on 17 March 2016 was adjourned for the Prosecution to submit on the Legal Question. The parties appeared before me again on 25 May 2016.

The Prosecution, quite rightly, did not object. As mentioned earlier at [2] above, the Appellant’s application for criminal legal aid was rejected. I therefore appointed Mr Lin as the <span class="font-italic">amicus curiae</span> to assist the court in relation to the following issue (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the Legal Question): </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Whether an offender is liable [to] enhanced punishment under s 28(2) and/or [s] 28(3) of the Moneylenders Act (Cap 188, Rev Ed 2010) if his antecedent concerns the abetment of an offence stipulated in s 28, instead of the commission of an offence stipulated in s 28. Counsel may have recourse to legislative intention and cases such as <span class="font-italic">Prosecutor v Choi </span><span class="font-italic">Guo Hong Edward</span> [2007] 1 SLR(R) 712, <span class="font-italic">[</span><span class="font-italic">Ho] Sheng Yu Garreth v Public Prosecutor</span> [2012] 2 SLR 375 and <span class="font-italic">Choy Tuck Sum v P</span><span class="font-italic">ublic Prosecutor</span> [2000] 3 SLR(R) 456.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">20 After hearing the parties and Mr Lin on 22 November 2016, I was satisfied that given Parliament’s intention, the word “offence” in the phrase “a second or subsequent offence” in ss 28(2) and 28(3) of the current MLA should be construed to include an offence of <span class="font-italic">abetting</span> the commission of any of the acts of harassment specified in s 28(1). As such, I held that the Appellant was liable to the enhanced punishment prescribed by ss 28(2) and 28(3). Furthermore, I found that the overall sentence meted out by the DJ was not manifestly excessive when the relevant sentencing principles, including the totality principle, were applied (see, <span class="font-italic">eg</span>, <span class="font-italic">Mohamed </span><span class="font-italic">Shouffee bin Adam v Public Prosecutor</span> [2014] 2 SLR 998). I therefore dismissed the appeal. In explaining (at [21]–[43] below) the reasons for my decision on the Legal Question, I shall refer to the current MLA as well as its predecessor statutes, the now-repealed Moneylenders Act (Cap 188, 1985 Rev Ed) (“the 1985 MLA”) and the Moneylenders Act 2008 (Act 31 of 2008) (“the 2008 MLA”). I shall also use the generic term “the MLA” where it is necessary to refer to the Moneylenders Act (Cap 188) generally, be it the current MLA, the 2008 MLA or the 1985 MLA. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Analysis of the Legal Question</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">21 As stated earlier at [2] above, the resolution of the Legal Question and, in turn, this appeal largely hinged on the construction of s 28 of the current MLA. Where a present harassment offender – <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, an accused person who is presently charged with a harassment offence under s 28 – has previously committed any of the acts of harassment set out in s 28(1), there is no doubt that he is liable to the enhanced penalties specified in s 28(2) and s 28(3). However, it is unclear from the literal wording of s 28 whether a present harassment offender whose antecedent is for <span class="font-italic">abetting</span> the commission of acts of harassment is likewise subject to these enhanced penalties. Read literally, s 28 seems to suggest that the offence of abetting the commission of acts of harassment is excluded from the ambit of the phrase “a second or subsequent offence” in ss 28(2) and 28(3). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">22 In this regard, Mr Lin, who took the same position as the Prosecution, submitted that the word “offence” in the aforesaid phrase should be interpreted to include the offence of abetting the commission of acts of harassment. I accepted this contention after examining the statutory purpose of ss 28 and 28A, the pre-existing case law and the relevant extrinsic materials.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The legislative intent</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">23 The provision which is now s 28 of the current MLA was first introduced in the form of s 28 of the 2008 MLA to replace (the now-repealed) s 33 of the 1985 MLA. During the second reading of the Moneylenders Bill (Bill 33 of 2008) (later enacted as the 2008 MLA) in November 2008, the then Senior Minister of State for Law, Assoc Prof Ho Peng Kee (“Assoc Prof Ho”), explained that cl 28 of the Bill was intended to re-enact s 33 of the 1985 MLA, and would extend the punishment of caning “to those who instigate or direct the harasser to commit the acts of harassment”.

Notably, these situations include giving instructions to another person to carry out acts of harassment (see s 28A(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)), and can thus catch persons higher up the hierarchy than the actual harasser. As can be seen from [23]–[24] above, there is every indication that Parliament intended such persons to be treated as being just as (if not more) culpable as the actual harasser. Section 28A of the current MLA also provides for other situations where a person shall be deemed to have abetted the commission of an offence under s 28. These include situations where a person acts as a lookout for or provides transportation to the actual harasser (see ss 28A(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>)–28A(1)(<span class="font-italic">d</span>)). On the basis of the scheme set out in s 28A, abettors who fall under ss 28A(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>)–28A(1)(<span class="font-italic">d</span>) are not treated any differently from abettors who give instructions as spelt out in s 28A(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>). Since no express punishment is statutorily-prescribed for the abetment of, specifically, a harassment offence under s 28, therefore, pursuant to s 109 of the Penal Code, an abettor of a harassment offence is liable to the same punishment as that applicable to the actual harasser. In other words, the various types of abettors under s 28A, regardless of their roles, are to be regarded as bearing equal culpability as (and in some cases, possibly greater culpability than) the actual harassers who commit the harassment offences spelt out in s 28(1). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 This interpretation is fortified by the parliamentary debates when the Bill introducing the amendments made in 2010 was read (see <span class="font-italic">Singapore Parliamentary Debates</span>, <span class="font-italic">Official Report</span> (12 January 2010) vol 86).

In particular, he said (at col 2056): “To cripple the many layers of a loanshark syndicate, anyone who contributes to or facilitates a loansharking operation will attract the wrath of the law”.

Every perpetrator, in supporting the organisation, perpetuates its illegal activities. In essence, when a person assists or facilitates a loansharking operation, he becomes part of the many layers shielding the masterminds, allowing them to go undetected. More importantly, when he replaces a person who has been arrested, his doing so enables a loanshark syndicate to reorganise its resources and continue to thrive.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">In order to target the many layers forming the organisation, anyone who contributes to or facilitates a loansharking operation, no matter what his role is, will not escape the wrath of the law. This will help us disrupt the syndicates. The Bill therefore amends section 14 (which is on unlicensed moneylending) and section 28 (on harassing borrowers [by] besetting [their] residence) to treat certain acts as assistance of unlicensed moneylending and abetment of the harassment offence, respectively. These acts include, for example, selling prepaid SIM cards to loansharks, transporting runners to harassment targets, acting as a lookout for harassment runs and assisting the loansharks in verifying harassment jobs before paying the runners. Indeed, a 27-year-old ex-runner said that he was paid $10 for every address that he verified that harassment had been conducted.

</div> In other words, given the nature and methodology<span class="font-italic"> </span>of a loan shark syndicate’s operations, Parliament intended to adopt an aggressive approach to tackle the scourge of loan shark activities. Based on the statutory purpose as gleaned from the text of ss 28 and 28A of the current MLA as well as the relevant extrinsic materials, it was clear to me that Parliament intended an abettor of acts of harassment to be treated punishment-wise in exactly the same way as the actual harasser. Accordingly, I agreed with the Prosecution that a previous abetment offence under s 28A could be treated as an antecedent for the purposes of determining the applicability of the enhanced punishment set out in ss 28(2) and 28(3) for actual harassers.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The relevant case law</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 Mr Lin also pointed out that our courts had previously answered questions similar to the Legal Question in the present case by adopting a purposive approach to the interpretation of the relevant provisions of the MLA (as defined in the generic sense at [20] above).

He had abetted a loan shark to carry out the latter’s unlicensed moneylending business by checking debtors’ flats for evidence of harassment by other loan sharks and reporting on the situation to the loan shark so that the loan shark could decide whether to issue loans to the debtors or harass them for repayment of any loan previously extended. As the offender had also previously been convicted of a similar offence of abetting unlicensed moneylending, the question was whether he would be liable to enhanced punishment for having twice been convicted of abetment offences in relation to unlicensed moneylending.

He also ruled that since repeat offenders of illegal moneylending and of harassment would be subject to enhanced punishments, the <span class="font-italic">abetment</span> of such offences would “<span class="font-italic">fall within the same circle of social ills that the amendments hoped to curb</span> …” [emphasis added] (see likewise <span class="font-italic">Edward Choi </span>at [16]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 In arriving at his decision, Tay J noted that the 1985 MLA did not contain a provision which explicitly provided that an abettor of an offence under that Act would be guilty of the substantive offence. (As mentioned above at [18], although s 109 of the Penal Code states that an abettor of an offence “shall … be punished with the punishment provided for the offence” if no express punishment for such abetment is statutorily-prescribed, it does not have the effect of eliding the difference between the offence of abetment and the principal offence abetted, which remain distinct offences in law.) Nevertheless, Tay J did not think that this should preclude him from holding that the offender in <span class="font-italic">Edward Choi</span> was subject to the same enhanced punishment as a repeat offender of the principal offence of unlicensed moneylending under s 8(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the 1985 MLA.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 In this regard, I note the case of <span class="font-italic">Choy Tuck Sum v Public Prosecutor </span>[2000] 3 SLR(R) 456 (“<span class="font-italic">Choy Tuck Sum</span>”), which was cited in <span class="font-italic">Edward Choi </span>at [11].

[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 The offender in <span class="font-italic">Choy Tuck Sum </span>was convicted of abetting another person in committing the offence under s 5(1) of the EFWA of employing a foreign worker without a valid work permit. The offender had an antecedent of having himself committed an offence under s 5(1) of the EFWA. In other words, his first conviction was for committing the principal offence under s 5(1) of the EFWA, while his subsequent conviction was for abetting the commission of that principal offence. Yong Pung How CJ held that the enhanced punishment set out in the EFWA would apply to the offender as s 23(1) of the EWFA applied to all the liability-creating sections in that Act. Significantly, Yong CJ noted (at [16]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… [I]t is necessary for me to emphasise that the above interpretation is particular to the provisions of the EFWA, which were specifically worded by Parliament in order to deal with the mischief behind the Act. To illustrate this point, the wording in s 23(1) of the EFWA can be contrasted with the general provisions on abetment in the Penal Code (Cap 224). Section 109 of the Penal Code provides that “whoever abets any offence shall, if the act abetted is committed in consequence of the abetment, and no express provision is made by this Code for the punishment of such abetment, be punished with the punishment provided for the offence”. It should be noted immediately that this provision, as well as the other abetment provisions in the Penal Code, is unlike … s 23(1) [of the] EFWA, in that it does not explicitly provide that the abettor will be treated as being guilty of the substantive offence. At a conceptual level and on the question of conviction, an abetment offence is certainly still distinct from the substantive principal offence. <span class="font-italic">Therefore, the holding in this case</span><span class="font-italic"> should not be interpreted to mean that in all cases, an abetment offence would automatically be treated as being the same as the substantive principal offence. It also does not mean that a conviction for an abetment offence will always attract enhanced punishment once the accused person is shown to have a prior conviction for the principal offence abetted. As I mentioned earlier, whether or not enhanced punishment should be imposed would depend very much on the exact wording of the provisions dealing with the abetment offence and the substantive principal offence</span>. [emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 In my view, Yong CJ was correct to emphasise that the holding in <span class="font-italic">Choy Tuck Sum </span>should not <span class="font-italic">ipso facto</span> be extended to all cases. Indeed, every statute should be construed in the light of its own text and context, and what was stated by Parliament to be its object. In this regard, I note that the MLA does not have a provision similar to s 23(1) of the EWFA equating an abetment offence with the principal offence abetted. Nevertheless, I do not think the absence of such an explicit provision is necessarily determinative. The clear and consistent legislative intent driving the various amendments to the MLA (as discussed above) is to punish persons who abet the commission of harassment offences in the same manner as those who commit the principal offence of harassment. Moreover, it must be noted that s 109 of the Penal Code expressly provides that an abettor of a principal offence shall be punished with <span class="font-italic">the same punishment</span> as that which applies to the principal offence in cases where no express punishment for that particular abetment offence is statutorily-prescribed. In other words, if a person abets the commission of an offence and no express punishment for such abetment is statutorily-prescribed, then pursuant to s 109 of the Penal Code, that person would be liable to be punished in the same manner as a person who has committed the principal offence abetted. Again applying s 109, if a person were to commit an abetment offence a second time, I do not see any reason why he should not be punished in the same manner as a person who commits the principal offence a second time, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, be liable to enhanced punishment. This could be another basis to justify the holding in <span class="font-italic">Edward Choi</span> (see [32] above, and also <span class="font-italic">Edward Choi </span>at [17]). There is no reasonable justification for any sentencing incongruities based on the aforesaid difference in the pattern of offending, bearing in mind the policy behind the introduction of the enhanced punishments set out in the current MLA. As I mentioned earlier, a person who issues orders for acts of harassment to be carried out is also considered an abettor under s 28A (specifically, under s 28A(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)) of the current MLA (see [25] above). Such a person will likely be more culpable than the actual harasser, who will often be a desperate debtor pressured to reduce his mounting debt or a misguided youth looking to earn a quick buck. Should the instigator, who would be higher up in the hierarchy than the actual harasser, commit the same offence of abetment twice, it is difficult to see why he should not be subject to enhanced punishment merely because he has repeatedly outsourced the dirty work of actual harassment to someone else who might otherwise never have committed any acts of harassment at all.

What would be the position if a person’s first offence is an abetment offence and his second offence is the principal offence which he previously abetted, or <span class="font-italic">vice versa</span>? Would that person, in respect of the second offence, still be subject to enhanced punishment? In the present case, the Appellant’s first offence was that of abetting the commission of acts of harassment and his second offence was the principal offence of committing acts of harassment itself. As a matter of logic, I could not see why the Appellant should not be subject to the enhanced punishment set out in ss 28(2) and 28(3) of the current MLA, bearing in mind Parliament’s clear intention to impose enhanced punishment on all offenders who are involved in acts of harassment a second time, whether as a primary offender (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, as an actual harasser) or as an abettor. To hold that such offenders would not be liable to enhanced punishment would be wholly illogical and would bring the law into disrepute for the disparity in treatment would be inexplicable.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 At this juncture, I refer to the case of <span class="font-italic">Garreth</span><span class="font-italic"> Ho</span>, where a broad and purposive reading of s 14(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>)(ii) of the current MLA was similarly adopted to give effect to its statutory purpose.

In <span class="font-italic">Garreth</span><span class="font-italic"> Ho</span>, the offender had prior convictions in 2008 under s 8(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the 1985 MLA (reproduced at [29] above) read with s 109 of the Penal Code. Those antecedents pertained to abetting (by intentionally aiding) the carrying on of an unlicensed moneylending business (the offender had handed over sums of monies to runners working for a loan shark syndicate).

</div> The 1985 MLA was later repealed and re-enacted as the 2008 MLA, which was in turn amended to become the current MLA (see <span class="font-italic">Garreth</span><span class="font-italic"> Ho</span> at [2]). As a result of the legislative amendments, the offence of unlicensed moneylending as well as its punishment ceased to reside in s 8(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the 1985 MLA. Instead, the prohibition of unlicensed moneylending is now set out in s 5(1) of the current MLA and its punishment, in s 14(1) of this Act. Specifically, s 14(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>)(ii) provides that “any person who contravenes, or assists in the contravention of, section 5(1)” shall, in the case of “a second or subsequent offence”, receive enhanced punishment. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 The offender in <span class="font-italic">Garreth</span><span class="font-italic"> Ho</span> was arrested and charged in 2010 for being involved in a conspiracy to carry on an unlicensed moneylending business. His conduct contravened s 5(1) of the current MLA, and was punishable under ss 14(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) and 14(1A) of the current MLA read with s 109 of the Penal Code (at [23]). The offender had canvassed for borrowers, issued loans at an interest rate of 20% and collected repayments from debtors. He had also been introduced to the two men who had started that unlicensed moneylending syndicate as a “new partner” in their business (at [8]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 Reviewing the relevant parliamentary debates (set out at [26] above), V K Rajah JA observed that “assisting” conduct in relation to unlicensed moneylending “should be viewed through exactly the same lenses, at least in the context of s 14(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>)(ii) of the [current MLA], rather than be semantically micro-analysed as being conceptually different” (at [72]). Rajah JA held that the offences under s 8(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the 1985 MLA of carrying on an unlicensed moneylending business and abetting (by intentionally aiding) the carrying on of such business were the same as the offences under s 14(1) of the current MLA of carrying on an unlicensed moneylending business and assisting in the carrying on of such business (at [102]). Taking into account the “conspicuous increases” in the penalties for unlicensed moneylending over the years, the relevant parliamentary debates and the more severe penalties for repeat offenders as compared to first-time offenders, Rajah JA held (at [114]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… Parliament has signalled that offenders who are repeatedly involved (either as principal or assistant) in unlicensed moneylending operations must be severely dealt with. <span class="font-italic">On </span><span class="font-italic">a purposive interpretation of s 14(1)(</span>b<span class="font-italic">)(ii)</span><span class="font-italic"> of the [current MLA], previous offences of carrying on the business of unlicensed moneylending under s 8(1)(</span>b<span class="font-italic">) of the </span><span class="font-italic">[1985 MLA] and abetting (by intentionally aiding) the same should count as prior offences for the purposes of s 14(1)(</span>b<span class="font-italic">)(ii) of the </span><span class="font-italic">[current MLA]. This would be the case regardless of whether the second or subsequent offence under s 14(1) of the [current MLA] is one of carrying on the business of unlicensed moneylending or assisting in the same</span> (respectively, contravening and assisting in the contravention of s 5(1) of the [current MLA]). … [emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 In other words, Rajah JA found that for the purposes of s 14(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>)(ii) of the current MLA, an equivalence could be drawn between the prior abetment offences of the offender in <span class="font-italic">Garreth</span><span class="font-italic"> Ho</span> and his subsequent offences. On the facts, Rajah JA found that the offender’s subsequent offences in fact revealed that he had not merely been assisting in the carrying on of an unlicensed moneylending business, but had also conducted such business on his own account (at [117]). He held that even if the offender had been acting alone and had thus not been charged with abetment with regard to his subsequent involvement in unlicensed moneylending, it would not have made any difference to his decision that the offender was liable to enhanced punishment (at [120]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 I am aware that there are some differences in wording between s 14 and s 28 of the current MLA besides the offences proscribed. For example, s 14 explicitly states that any person who “<span class="font-italic">assists</span>” [emphasis added] in the contravention of s 5(1) “shall be guilty of an offence” as well, whereas the offence in s 28(2) only targets a person “who, acting on behalf of an unlicensed moneylender, <span class="font-italic">commits or attempts to commit</span> any of the acts [of harassment] specified in subsection (1)” [emphasis added]. Nevertheless, as the Prosecution observed, Rajah JA came to his conclusion in <span class="font-italic">Garreth</span><span class="font-italic"> Ho</span> by expressly relying on Assoc Prof Ho’s speech in Parliament (as set out at [26] above),

Although s 28 of the current MLA is a penal provision, s 9A of the Interpretation Act (Cap 1, 2002 Rev Ed) requires the rule of purposive interpretation to trump all other common law principles of interpretation, including the strict construction rule (see <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v </span><span class="font-italic">Low Kok Heng </span>[2007] 4 SLR(R) 183 (“<span class="font-italic">Low Kok Heng</span>”) at [41] and [56]–[57], cited in <span class="font-italic">Garreth</span><span class="font-italic"> Ho </span>at [55]). I accepted Mr Lin’s submission that the word “offence” in the phrase “a second or subsequent offence” in ss 28(2) and 28(3) of the current MLA could also include the offence of abetting the commission of a harassment offence under s 28.

The importance of clear statutory wording cannot be over-emphasised.

As mentioned earlier, the DJ imposed the mandatory minimum sentence for each of the first five proceeded charges. Although he fixed the imprisonment term for the sixth proceeded charge at six months above the mandatory minimum term, this was defensible on account of the fact that the victim in that particular charge was an innocent neighbour of the alleged debtor. It is an aggravating factor when innocent persons are deliberately targeted and harassed (see <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor</span><span class="font-italic"> v Quek Li Hao</span> [2013] 4 SLR 471 at [39]).

</div> While it could be argued that the DJ should have increased the imprisonment term for the sixth proceeded charge by only two or three months instead of by six months, this in itself did not render the imprisonment term for that charge manifestly excessive. Given the extent of the Appellant’s criminal conduct, it was also appropriate for the DJ to order three of the Appellant’s imprisonment sentences to run consecutively in order to adequately reflect his overall criminality. It must not be forgotten that the Appellant faced a total of 28 charges, with six proceeded with and 22 taken into consideration for sentencing purposes.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 For the foregoing reasons, I dismissed this appeal.
