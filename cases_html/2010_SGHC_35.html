<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       Summons Nos 2957/2009 and 2966/2009 were
                    brought by the defendants in this action, Bryan Lim Jit Ming
                    (“D1”) and Josephine Teo Soo Geok (“D2”), to strike
                    out certain paragraphs in the plaintiff’s Statement of Claim and in his
                    supporting affidavit filed on 26 May 2009 in respect of a Mareva injunction
                    application (“the plaintiff’s first affidavit”). The
                    defendants also applied to strike out certain paragraphs in the first affidavit
                    of one Ng Soo Kok (also known as Roy Ng) filed also in support of the
                    plaintiff’s Mareva injunction application. The grounds for the striking
                    out applications were that the paragraphs in question disclosed “without
                    prejudice” communications between the parties for the purpose of
                    settlement of a dispute. On 14 July 2009, I struck out the offending
                    paragraphs in the Statement of Claim and in the two affidavits. I now publish
                    the reasons for my decision.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Background facts</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The facts pertinent to the striking out
                    applications can be stated quite shortly. In the main action, the plaintiff, Ng
                    Chee Weng, who is also known as Patrick Ng, claims to be the beneficial owner of
                    50% of the shareholding in SinCo Technologies Pte Ltd, a company incorporated in
                    Singapore. Patrick Ng’s pleaded case is that the shares were being held on
                    trust for him by D1, and that D1 had failed to pay to him the dividends paid out
                    on the shares from 2003 to 2007. In his prayer for relief, Patrick Ng claimed,
                    amongst other things, dividends totalling $8.8m against D1 and his wife, D2. The
                    Writ of Summons was issued and served on 26 May 2009.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       Paragraphs 29 and 30(2)-30(5) of the
                    Statement of Claim referred to and gave particulars of various meetings and
                    telephone conversations between the plaintiff and D1. Specifically, the
                    plaintiff pleaded that D1:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_3-p2_i"></a>(i)     Did not deny that he held shares on
                        trust for the plaintiff;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_3-p2_ii"></a>(ii)     Did not deny that the plaintiff was entitled to the
                        dividends paid on the shares he held on trust for the plaintiff;
                    and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_3-p2_iii"></a>(iii)     Made offers
                        to settle the plaintiff’s claim for those
                dividends.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       The same events together with other exchanges
                    were repeated in paras 62, 69-74, 77-90 and 100 of the plaintiff’s first
                    affidavit dated 26 May 2009 (“the plaintiff’s first
                    affidavit”). Roy Ng, who claimed to be a mutual friend of the plaintiff
                    and D1, also made reference to some of the same events at which he was present,
                    in paras 6 and 18-42 of his first affidavit dated 26 May 2009 (“Roy
                    Ng’s first affidavit”). For convenience, the offending paragraphs
                    in the Statement of Claim, in the plaintiff’s first affidavit and Roy
                    Ng’s first affidavit are hereinafter referred to collectively as
                    “the Relevant Paragraphs”. Counsel for the defendants,
                    Mr Cavinder Bull SC, had in his written submissions summarised the
                    respective deponents’ version of the discussions with D1 as
                    follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_4-p2_i"></a>(i)     On 23 March 2009, at a meeting
                        between Patrick Ng, D1 and Roy Ng (as mediator), D1 offered to pay Patrick
                        Ng the sum of $3.5m in settlement of Patrick Ng’s claim that he was
                        entitled to dividend payments from 2003 to 2007. Patrick Ng indicated that
                        he was willing to accept a settlement payment of $3.5m.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_4-p2_ii"></a>(ii)     On 31 March 2009, at a meeting
                        between Patrick Ng, D1 and Roy Ng, Patrick Ng turned down the earlier offer
                        of $3.5m. D1 made a second offer of $4.5m to settle the
                    dispute.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_4-p2_iii"></a>(iii)     On
                        15 April 2009, Roy Ng forwarded to D1 a message from Patrick Ng
                        informing him that Patrick Ng was rejecting the offer of $4.5m. On the same
                        day, Roy Ng called D1 to inform him that Patrick Ng proposed a global sum of
                        $6.5m to settle the dispute. D1 rejected this offer to settle the
                        dispute.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_4-p2_iv"></a>(iv)     On
                        16 April 2009, Patrick Ng copied D1 on an email sent to one Terence Ng
                        that he (Patrick Ng) had turned down D1’s offer to settle the dispute
                        at $4.5m, and that he had proposed to settle the dispute at $6.5m but D1 had
                        rejected his proposal.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       Mr Bull took issue with the Relevant
                    Paragraphs, emphasing that they referred to discussions between D1, the
                    plaintiff as well as Roy Ng, which were made for the purpose of trying to settle
                    and resolve the dispute between the plaintiff and D1, and are therefore
                    privileged and inadmissible in evidence. Mr Bull also pointed out that
                    there were no documents creating the alleged trust. The trust was alleged to
                    have been constituted orally between 2002 and 2003. D1 for his part had asserted
                    that he bought the shares from the plaintiff for valuable consideration. D1
                    further asserted that the issue of dividend payments was raised at the first
                    meeting between the plaintiff, Terence Ng and D1. According to D1, the first
                    meeting was on 16 March 2009, and not on the 23 March 2009. Be that as
                    it may, on the plaintiff’s version, his claim for the refund of dividend
                    payouts to D1 was put on the table at the first meeting. The plaintiff had
                    deposed that before he left that meeting, he told D1 to “work out”
                    and “compensate” him for the dividends due to him.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> It was D1’s case that between March and
                    April 2009, Patrick Ng and D1 entered into a series of settlement negotiations.
                    It was at the 23 March 2009 meeting that Roy Ng attended for the first time
                    as mediator. The plaintiff’s first affidavit and Roy Ng’s first
                    affidavit stated that the discussions at the various meetings were on the
                    “settlement” of Patrick Ng’s claim for dividends; that a
                    mutual friend, Roy Ng, was called in to “mediate” the dispute; and
                    that various settlement “offers” and “proposals”
                    were made and rejected.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       Counsel for the plaintiff, Mr Peter Low,
                    took the contrary position. His argument was that there was no dispute since D1
                    had admitted that dividends were due to the plaintiff. The discussions, he
                    argued, pertained only to payment terms since D1 had already admitted to the
                    claim for dividends. As such the discussions were not protected by privilege
                    under the “without prejudice” rule.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       I was reminded by Mr Bull that D1 had
                    asserted that the plaintiff and Roy Ng had recounted the various communications
                    inaccurately. That said, Mr Bull focussed his arguments on what the
                    plaintiff and Roy Ng asserted in the Relevant Paragraphs. Since I agreed with
                    Mr Bull that the Relevant Paragraphs disclosed inadmissible “without
                    prejudice” communications, there was no need for me to address D1’s
                    assertion that the plaintiff and Roy Ng had recounted the various communications
                    inaccurately.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Without prejudice communications: the law</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       As a general rule, communications between
                    parties which are made on a “without prejudice” basis in the
                    course of negotiations for a settlement are not admissible in evidence (see
                        <em>eg Quek Kheng Leong Nicky v Teo Beng Ngoh</em>
                    [2009] 4 SLR(R) 181 at [22]). The “without prejudice”
                    rule applies to exclude evidence of all negotiations genuinely aimed at
                    settlement whether oral or in writing. Furthermore, the application of the rule
                    is not dependent upon the use of the phrase “without prejudice” if
                    it is clear from the surrounding circumstances that the parties were seeking to
                    compromise an existing dispute which may or may not have given rise to legal
                    proceedings (<em>per</em> Lord Griffiths in <em>Rush &amp; Tompkins Ltd v Greater London Council</em> [1989]
                    1 AC 1280 at 1299; followed in <em>Greenline-Onyx
                        Envirotech Phils Inc v Otto Systems Singapore Pte Ltd</em> [2007]
                    3 SLR(R) 40). In <em>Muller v Linsley &amp;
                        Mortimer</em> [1996] PNLR 74 at 77, Hoffmann LJ (as he then
                    was) helpfully explained the two justifications for the “without
                    prejudice” rule in these terms:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">First, the public policy of encouraging parties to negotiate and settle
                        their disputes out of court and, secondly, an implied agreement arising out
                        of what is commonly understood to be the consequences of offering or
                        agreeing to negotiate without prejudice. In some cases both these
                        justifications are present; in others, only one or the other.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       Hoffmann LJ’s explanation was cited
                    with approval by the Court of Appeal in <em>Mariwu Industrial Co
                        (S) Pte Ltd v Dextra Asia Co Ltd &amp; Anor</em> [2006]
                    4 SLR(R) 807 at [24] (“<em>Mariwu</em>”). In that case, Chan Sek Keong CJ observed at
                    [24] that s 23 of the Evidence Act (Cap 97, 1997 Rev Ed) is the
                    statutory enactment of the common law principle relating to the admissibility of
                    “without prejudice” communications based on the policy of
                    encouraging the settlement of disputes out of court. Relevant to this case is
                    the second of the two situations contemplated in s 23, <em>viz</em>., where an admission is made “under circumstances
                    from which the court can infer that the parties agreed together that evidence of
                    it should not be given”. The type of cases that could fall within the
                    second situation was identified by Chan CJ. He said (at [24]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">This [second] situation will cover cases where even though a statement is
                        not expressly made “without prejudice” the law holds that it
                        is made without prejudice because it was made in the course of negotiations
                        to settle a dispute: see the judgment of Lord Hoffmann in <em>Bradford &amp; Bingley plc v Rashid</em> [2006]
                        1 WLR 2006 at [13].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     Equally relevant to this case are
                    Chan CJ’s further comments at [25]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Section 23, properly construed, only refers to situations where it is
                        the parties to the negotiations themselves who are attempting to renege on
                        an express or implied agreement not to use admissions made in the course of
                        negotiations against each other. The admissions in such cases are not
                        relevant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Chan CJ’s interpretation of s 23 clearly echoes the
                    other basis or justification for the “without prejudice” rule,
                        <em>viz</em>., the express or implied agreement of the
                    parties themselves that communications in the course of their negotiations
                    should not be admissible in evidence if, despite the negotiations, litigation
                    ensued.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Application to the facts</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     With these principles in mind, I turn to the
                    facts of this case and the arguments canvassed by the parties as outlined in
                    earlier paragraphs above. It was obvious, and I agreed with Mr Bull, that
                    the Relevant Paragraphs were describing negotiations made in the course of an
                    attempt to settle the dispute between the plaintiff and D1 to avoid litigation,
                    and were therefore <em>prima facie</em> protected by the
                    “without prejudice” rule. Mr Bull made the point, which I
                    accepted, that the very presence of Roy Ng acting as mediator during the
                    negotiations and the various offers to settle including the plaintiff’s
                    counteroffer of $6.5m showed that the purpose of the negotiations was to settle
                    the dispute between the plaintiff and D1. The plaintiff’s attempt in his
                    subsequent affidavit to dispute this was wholly without merit.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     Mr Low’s arguments boiled down to
                    the simple proposition that the prerequisite for the “without
                    prejudice” privilege to apply, <em>ie</em> the
                    existence of a dispute, was not satisfied here. Mr Low’s general
                    proposition was not challenged by Mr Bull, and rightly so, since the
                    “without prejudice” rule, being aimed at encouraging the
                    settlement of disputes, applies only when a dispute between the parties (see
                        <em>Mariwu</em> at [30]). The issue between the parties
                    is purely factual, <em>ie</em> whether, on the facts, D1
                    had any point waved the “white flag of surrender” by admitting his
                    liability, such that a dispute no longer existed between the parties (see
                        <em>Sin Lian Heng Construction Pte Ltd v Singapore
                        Telecommunications Ltd</em> [2007] 2 SLR(R) 433 at [45]
                        (“<em>Sin Lian Heng</em>”); <em>Cytec Industries Pte Ltd v APP Chemicals International (Mau)
                        Ltd</em> [2009] 4 SLR(R) 769).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     In developing his argument, Mr Low
                    explained that on the facts in evidence there was no dispute because D1 had in
                    the negotiations admitted his liability to pay dividends due to the plaintiff as
                    beneficial owner of the shares held on trust by D1. At the hearing before me,
                    Mr Low argued that D1’s admission of liability could be deduced from
                    the following facts:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_13-p2_i"></a>(i)     D1’s silence when confronted
                        with the claim;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_13-p2_ii"></a>(ii)     D1’s offers of $3.5m and then $4.5m; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_13-p2_iii"></a>(iii)     Email dated 16 April 2009
                        from Patrick Ng to Terence Ng and copied to D1 on the dividends paid out to
                        D1 and email dated 21 April 2009 from Terence Ng to
                    D1.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">I noted that earlier on in the plaintiff’s second
                    affidavit, the position he took was that if D1 was not the trustee of the shares
                    there was no reason for D1 to negotiate any settlement and/or there would be no
                    basis for settlement negotiations or discussions. The plaintiff concluded that
                    D1 in having discussions and negotiating settlement with him had effectively
                    admitted the trust arrangement.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     I found Mr Low’s submissions
                    unconvincing. D1’s alleged silence by itself was equivocal at best; there
                    must be something more from the circumstances to show that the silence was not
                    susceptible to any innocent explanation and must consequently be taken as an
                    admission of liability. I could discern nothing of that nature; in fact, D1 had
                    made several positive denials of liability. In para 72 of the
                    plaintiff’s first affidavit, he recounted that D1 had claimed that he (D1)
                    was entitled to keep the dividends. The plaintiff’s first affidavit also
                    exhibited an email dated 13 May 2009 where D1 expressly rejected the
                    allegations of trusteeship made in the plaintiff’s emails of 16 April
                        2009.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span> Terence Ng’s email of
                    21 April 2009 to D1 was refuted by D1 in his email dated 6 May
                        2009.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span> I agreed with
                    Mr Bull that the two emails sent in April 2009 did not advance the
                    plaintiff’s case because they have been denied in correspondence between
                    the parties.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     Mr Low next argued that D1’s
                    various offers to settle amounted to an admission of liability. Factually, an
                    offer to settle a dispute, without more, could not amount to an admission of
                    legal liability in respect of that dispute. A person may wish to settle a
                    dispute for any number of reasons which do not relate to his views on his
                    liability in law (see <em>Lim Tjoen Kong v A-B Chew Investments
                        Pte Ltd</em> [1991] 2 SLR(R) 168 at [32]), and on the facts
                    there was nothing to show that D1’s offers were motivated by or
                    constituted an admission of his legal liability.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     I think that, at the highest, Mr Low can
                    only argue that the Relevant Paragraphs amounted to admissions against interest
                    not amounting to admissions of liability. The plaintiff’s case will fail
                    even so. As Menon JC explained in <em>Sin Lian
                        Heng</em> (<a href="#p1_12">[12]</a> above at [42]
                    – [43]), the protection of admissions against interest is the most
                    important practical effect of the “without prejudice” rule. To
                    recognise such admissions as admissible would be contrary to the underlying
                    objective of giving protection to the parties to speak freely in settlement
                    negotiations.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     For the reasons stated, I granted the
                    defendants an order in terms of prayers 1 and 2 of both SUM 2957/2009 and
                    SUM 2966/2009 on the simple ground that the Relevant Paragraphs disclosed
                    communications which fell within the ambit of the “without
                    prejudice” rule. I further ordered the plaintiff to refile the Statement
                    of Claim, his first affidavit, and the first affidavit of Roy Ng within 7 days
                    of the date of my order (<em>ie</em> by 21 July 2009)
                    with the Relevant Paragraphs expunged. The costs of both applications were fixed
                    at a global sum of $5,000 plus disbursements.</p>
