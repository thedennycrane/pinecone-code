It is well established that pleadings need only contain material facts. In<span class="font-italic"> MK (Project Management) Ltd v Baker Marine Energy Pte Ltd</span> [1994] 3 SLR(R) 823 at [26], the Court of Appeal held (citing <span class="font-italic">In</span><span class="font-italic"> re Vandervell’s Trusts (No 2); White v Vandervell Trustees Ltd</span> [1974] Ch 269): “It is sufficient for the pleader to state the material facts. [The pleader] need not state the legal result.” In <span class="font-italic">Sharikat</span><span class="font-italic"> Logistics Pte Ltd v Ong Boon Chuan and others</span> [2011] SGHC 196 at [8], the court held that “[a] Statement of Claim must set out material facts, not opinion, and not evidence.”</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 Whether the Policy covers the liability in respect of which the plaintiff seeks recovery is not a material fact. It involves the legal interpretation of the various clauses of the Policy. There is therefore no need for this to be pleaded. The plaintiff itself has pleaded cll 2.1, 3.2 and 8.2 of the Policy at para 3 of its statement of claim (“SOC”). The defendant’s position at para 6 of the defence is that para 3 of the SOC is not admitted. The plaintiff has also stated at para 21 of the SOC that it was entitled to be indemnified under the Policy against the Consent Judgment. In response, the defendant did not admit to this paragraph and put the plaintiff to strict proof thereof.

</div> The defendant is therefore not precluded from making the argument that, on the proper interpretation of cll 2.1, 3.2 and 8.2, the plaintiff has not shown that it is entitled to coverage under the Policy.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 In the defendant’s submission, the analysis starts with cl 2.1, which states: “[defendant] will pay [plaintiff] … for … any legal liability to pay Compensation … <span class="font-italic">arising from any civil liability</span> resulting from a Claim for breach of professional duty in the conduct of [plaintiff’s] Business” [emphasis added].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 Cl 8.2 defines “Compensation” as including monies agreed to be paid by judgment. Thus, the reference to “Compensation” in cl 2.1 would also include the plaintiff’s liability under the Consent Judgment. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 However, “Compensation” in cl 2.1, is distinct from the “civil liability” which it must arise from. Thus, the “Compensation” (liability under the Consent Judgment) in cl 2.1 must arise from “civil liability” in order to satisfy cl 2.1. The defendant relies on <span class="font-italic">Enterprise Oil </span><span class="font-italic">Ltd v Strand Insurance Co Ltd</span> [2006] EWHC 58 (Comm) (“<span class="font-italic">Enterprise Oil”</span>) to support its submission that the reference to “civil liability” in cl 2.1 means that the plaintiff must establish in these proceedings that it would have been liable to the Builder and Developer in Suit 417 for at least the amount of the Settlement Agreement. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 In <span class="font-italic">Enterprise Oil</span><span class="font-italic">, </span>the insured brought a claim against its insurer in respect of a tortious claim against it by a third party. The insured had settled the third party’s claim.

On a construction of the relevant clause of the policy, the court found that the insured could not simply rely on the fact of the settlement agreement to demonstrate either liability or that the amount of settlement was reasonable. Thus, the insured had to establish that it would have been under an actual liability to the third party in respect of the alleged tort, for an amount at least that of the settlement agreement: <span class="font-italic">Enterprise Oil</span> at [195]. The relevant clause in <span class="font-italic">Enterprise Oil </span>(see [17]) provided that the insurer covered: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… all sums which the Insured may be obligated to pay by reason of liability imposed on the Insured by law or assumed under Contract or Agreement (written or oral) or otherwise<span class="font-italic">, on account of personal injury and/or bodily injury and/or loss of life and/or loss of and/or damage to tangible property, (including loss of use </span><span class="font-italic">following physical loss of or damage to property or persons)</span> arising out of an occurrence occurring during the period of this Policy, all in connection with the Offshore/Marine and/or waterborne and/or airborne operations of the Insured wheresoever occurring.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">The defendant argues that “on account of personal injury” in the emphasised portion above was equivalent to “arising from any civil liability resulting from a Claim for breach of your professional duty in the conduct of Your Business” in cl 2.1.

The defendant submits that the Consent Judgment is based on the Settlement Agreement, which is an agreement by which the plaintiff assumed liability by consenting to 100% liability in Suit 417. The defendant contends that the plain words of the carve-out in cl 3.2 are, on a proper construction, wide enough to encompass the Settlement Agreement and Consent Judgment.

This would include the plaintiff’s liability to pay monies to the Developer and Builder under the Consent Judgment.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 However, cl 2.1 of the Policy does not simply state that the defendant will indemnify the plaintiff against any “Compensation”. Clause 2.1 states that the defendant will cover “any legal liability to pay Compensation …. <span class="font-italic">arising from any civil liability resulting from a Claim for breach of professional duty in the conduct of [the plaintiff’s business]</span> …” [emphasis added] (see [15] above). I agree with the defendant that on a proper construction of cl 2.1, the “legal liability” to pay “Compensation” is distinct from the “civil liability” which it must arise from. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 Thus, to be covered under cl 2.1, the liability to pay monies under the Consent Judgment must arise from “civil liability”. It is insufficient for the plaintiff to point to the Consent Judgment as being covered by cl 8.2 to seek coverage under the Policy. The sum that the plaintiff was required to pay the Builder and Developer under the Consent Judgment is simply the “Compensation” that the plaintiff must pay. To fulfil clause 2.1, the plaintiff must also establish that civil liability gave rise to its obligation to pay “Compensation”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 Clause 3 sets out the types of civil liability that the Policy covers. The plaintiff’s claim is made in respect of “Contractual Liability (Tort Liability)”, defined in cl 3.2 as liability arising from a “duty of care to provide professional services in the conduct of [the plaintiff’s] Business”. Pertinently, cl 3.2 further states that coverage does not extend to any liability assumed by the plaintiff “under any express warranty, guarantee, representation, hold harmless agreement, indemnity contract or similar agreement <span class="font-italic">unless such liability would attach in the absence of any such agreement</span>” [emphasis added] (see [15] above).

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> I am unable to agree with the plaintiff. The agreements listed in cl 3.2, such as “express warranty”, “guarantee”, “representation” or “indemnity contract”, are essentially agreements for one party to indemnify another. They are wide enough to cover agreements where a party has voluntarily taken on or takes on a liability that may not otherwise exist as a matter of law. This is what the Settlement Agreement is. On its plain words, cl 3.2 could thus include all means by which the plaintiff voluntarily assumes liability, such as by way of a settlement agreement. I find that the Settlement Agreement falls under cl 3.2 as a “similar agreement”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 This reading is reinforced by cl 7.13 of the Policy, which states that the plaintiff will not admit, negotiate, or repudiate any claim, fact and/or circumstance, and that defendant will not be liable for any claim, fact or circumstances and/or costs and expenses without the defendant’s prior written consent. This makes clear that the defendant will not cover any liability which is assumed by the plaintiff, including by way of settlement agreement, unless it consents to such assumption. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 I hence find that the plaintiff’s liability to pay monies under the Consent Judgment was assumed pursuant to a “similar agreement” under cl 3.2. Therefore, as per cl 3.2, the plaintiff must show that this liability to pay monies under the Consent Judgment would have attached in the absence of the Settlement Agreement. Otherwise, the plaintiff will not have satisfied the requirement in cl 2.1 that compensation must arise from civil liability to be covered. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 The question which follows is, what does it mean to prove that the liability to pay monies under the Consent Judgment would have attached in the absence of the Settlement Agreement? The defendant’s primary position is that the plaintiff must show that the settlement is reasonable, in that it would otherwise have still been liable (even in the absence of a settlement) for at least as much as the settlement amount. The defendant’s alternative position is that the plaintiff must show that the settlement was reasonable in that it reasonably reflected the plaintiff’s arguable liability to the Developer and Builder, even if short of showing that it would have been 100% liable.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 In my view, neither of the defendant’s positions have satisfactorily addressed the question. I make two points about what I find must be proven by the plaintiff.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 In my analysis, the plaintiff must show actual, as opposed to arguable, tortious liability. The primary reason for this is the wording of cl 3.2. The clause excludes civil liability arising from agreements unless “such liability <span class="font-italic">w</span><span class="font-italic">ould</span> attach in the absence of any such agreement”. Notably, it does not refer to “liability [that] <span class="font-italic">c</span><span class="font-italic">ould </span>attach <span class="font-italic">…</span>”. This makes it clear that to satisfy cl 3.2, the plaintiff must establish that it was under an actual liability independent of the Settlement Agreement. Simply proving that there was an arguable liability would not suffice for the purposes of cl 3.2. This interpretation of cl 3.2 is also in line with the general principle of insurance law, whereby “liability insurance provides an indemnity against actual established liability, as opposed to mere allegations”: John Birds, Ben Lynch &amp; Simon Paul, <span class="font-italic">Mac</span><span class="font-italic">Gillivray on Insurance Law: Relating to all Risks other than Marine</span> (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 15th Ed, 2022) at para 28-006. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 However, the fact that the plaintiff must show actual liability does not necessarily mean that the plaintiff must show, on a balance of probabilities, that every element of the tortious claim has been established and that damages would be at least as much as the settlement amount. Instead, the court’s holding in <span class="font-italic">Britestone</span> at [41] provides guidance on how the plaintiff could go about establishing such actual liability. Admittedly, <span class="font-italic">Britestone</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>concerned a different context. There, the issue was whether the settlement amount in an agreement between the plaintiff and a third party could be recovered from the defendant as losses for breach of contract. The court laid down the principle that if a settlement is reasonably reached and reasonable in nature, the amount agreed therein will be regarded as accurately reflecting the actual loss suffered by the downstream plaintiff. The court described this approach as pragmatic. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 In my view, a similarly pragmatic approach should be adopted when interpreting cl 3.2 of the Policy. Where an insured has settled a claim for alleged professional negligence, in order to satisfy cl 3.2 and show that the liability would have attached in the absence of the settlement agreement, the insured can simply establish that the settlement agreement was reasonable. While the insured could also prove reasonableness by proving on a balance of probabilities that his own professional negligence would have led to liability in the amount of the settlement sum, that would not be the only manner of proving reasonableness. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 Thus, in my judgment, in determining whether the settlement agreement is reasonable for the purposes of cl 3.2, the non-exhaustive list of relevant considerations set out by the court in <span class="font-italic">Britestone</span> at [54] would be relevant. This includes (amongst others):</div><div class="mb-3"><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(a) the duration or period of negotiations as well as their general content; </div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(b) whether the negotiations were conducted <span class="font-italic">bona fide</span>; </div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(c) the assessment which could properly be made at the time of settlement of the prospects of success or failure of the claim based on materials then available; </div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(d) the availability of and/or reliance on legal advice or expert advice taking into account considerations of cost and time; </div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(e) whether the settlement amount has been paid, and, if so, how and when; </div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(f) the bargaining strengths of the parties involved in the settlement, taking into account (among other things) alternative means by which the dispute could have been concluded; and</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(g) whether, in the round, the settlement figure was objectively assessed and properly calibrated against the context of the entire factual matrix.</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 In my view, the above considerations set out by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Britestone</span> provide for a more nuanced and comprehensive analysis of whether the settlement reflects actual liability, as compared to a more narrow and mechanical requirement that the insured show on a balance of probabilities that he would have been liable for at least as much as the settlement amount. This also avoids the potentially difficult and awkward situation whereby an insured has to establish on a balance of probabilities each element of <span class="font-italic">his own </span><span class="font-italic">liability</span>. As such, I have interpreted cl 3.2 in this way.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 To summarise, to show that cl 3.2 and 2.1 have been satisfied and that it is entitled to coverage, the plaintiff must show that the Settlement Agreement was reasonable, whether by establishing its tortious liability on a balance of probabilities or in accordance with the considerations from <span class="font-italic">Britestone</span>.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span class="font-italic">Applicability of Hartford Insurance</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 For completeness of analysis, I will examine the applicability of the Court of Appeal’s decision in <span class="font-italic">Hartford Insurance Co (Singapore) Ltd (formerly known as The People’s Insurance Co Ltd) v Chiu Teng Construction Pte Ltd</span> [2002] 1 SLR(R) 152 (“<span class="font-italic">Hartford Insurance</span>”). The respondent there, Chiu Teng Construction Co Pte Ltd (“Chiu Teng”), was the main contractor of a housing development. Some of the houses were damaged due to works carried out by Brentford Construction (S) Pte Ltd (“Brentford”). Brentford went into liquidation. Chiu Teng brought a claim against Brentford and obtained interlocutory judgment against it with the consent of the Official Receiver. An assessment of damages was then conducted, with witnesses called on behalf of Chui Teng to give evidence. The Official Receiver chose not to participate in the assessment. Judgment was granted in favour of Chiu Teng against Brentford for a certain judgment sum. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 Brentford was insured by the appellant, Hartford Insurance Co (Singapore) Ltd (“Hartford”), and was indemnified against “such sums which Brentford shall become liable to pay as damages” consequent upon accidental loss or damage to property belonging to third parties occurring in direct connection with the construction or erection works carried out by Brentford. After obtaining judgment against Brentford, Chiu Teng then commenced proceedings against Hartford for that judgment sum, stepping into the shoes of Brentford pursuant to s 1(1) of the English Third Parties (Rights against Insurers) Act 1930. In those proceedings, Hartford argued that the judgment sum against Brentford was not binding on them, and that Chiu Teng should prove all over again the quantum of their loss. Both the High Court and the Court of Appeal rejected this argument. The Court of Appeal stated in <span class="font-italic">Hartford Insurance </span>at<span class="font-italic"> </span>[27]–[29] that:</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">We do not think it should make a difference whether the judgment obtained against the insured is after a trial or on admission, so long as notice was given to the insurer to defend the claim of the injured third party if it wished. … It is absurd to require an insured to contest a claim, or the quantum thereof, if he does not have any basis to contest it. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">… we agree with the approach taken by the Outer House, which broadly followed the opinion expressed by Mellish LJ in <span class="font-italic">Parker v Lewis</span> (see [10] above). It said [2001 SLT 347 at [9] and [10]]: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Where the insurer, on the other hand, forms the view that he is not liable to indemnify his insured, then he still has at least two options. The first is to refuse or withdraw cover in respect of any defence to the pursuer’s action. In that event, if the pursuer proceeds with his action and secures decree against the person thought to be insured, the amount of the decree will be determinative of the liability of the insured to the pursuer unless and until that decree is reduced on the grounds of, for example, fraud or collusion. The insurer cannot normally re-open the question of the amount of the liability in circumstances where he has declined to enter the process and fund the defence to the action or has withdrawn his instructions and funding in the course of the action. The question of liability between the pursuer and the insured has to be litigated in an action between those two parties and a decree in that action has to be seen as a final determination of that liability so long as the decree stands unreduced. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The second option is for the insurer to offer to instruct the defence to the action but make it clear ab ante, or at least as soon as possible, both to the pursuer and the insured, that his position is to remain that he is not liable under the policy. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">The choice is entirely for the insurer. If it chooses not to intervene, then, if a judgment is obtained against the insured, it would have to indemnify the insured if the policy defences pleaded by it should fail. …</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 On the face of these remarks, a question arises whether the fact that the plaintiff had obtained the Consent Judgment was itself sufficient to entitle it to coverage under the Policy. The plaintiff did not cite <span class="font-italic">Hartford Insurance</span> in its opening statement or in any of its written submissions. After closing and reply submissions were filed, parties were invited to provide their views on the impact, if any, of <span class="font-italic">Hartford Insurance</span> at [27]–[29] on their case.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 Having considered parties’ further submissions, I agree with the defendant that <span class="font-italic">Hartford Insurance </span>does not assist the plaintiff in this case.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 First, the language of the indemnifying provisions in <span class="font-italic">Hartford Insurance </span>and the Policy here is wholly different. The Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Hartford Insurance</span> recognised that the issue of whether the insured succeeded was ultimately a question of the specific contractual obligations, holding at [24] that:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… As we see it, <span class="font-italic">the real point is one of contract</span>. The question to ask is, following from the first judgment, is there a sum which Brentford is legally liable to pay to Chiu Teng as damages. The answer is a definite yes. The wording of the policy is clear: the insurer (Hartford) shall indemnify the insured (Brentford) against such sums which Brentford shall become legally liable to pay as damages. …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 In <span class="font-italic">Hartford Insurance,</span> the indemnifying provision could be seen to be broader than that in the present case. Hartford was to indemnify Brentford against “such sums which Brentford shall become legally liable to pay as damages”: <span class="font-italic">Hartford Insurance</span> at [23]. In contrast, cl 2.1 of the Policy provides that the defendant will pay the plaintiff for “any legal liability to pay Compensation … arising from any civil liability resulting from a Claim for breach of professional duty in the conduct of Your Business”, and cl 3.2 provides that coverage of civil liability “does not extend to cover any liability assumed by You under any express warranty, guarantee, representation, hold harmless agreement, indemnity contract or similar agreement <span class="font-italic">unless such liability would attach in the absence of any such agreement</span>” [emphasis added]. Thus, there is a significant differentiation between the relevant indemnifying provisions in <span class="font-italic">Hartford</span><span class="font-italic"> Insurance</span> and the Policy. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 Second, in contrast to the case in <span class="font-italic">Hartford Insurance</span> where the insured did not contest its liability, the plaintiff and Mr Ng did and continued to believe that independent of the Settlement Agreement, they were not responsible for the Damage. The evidence on this is set out at [67]–[71] below. The evidence before the court, evidence which was brought solely for the purposes of this suit, is that there was no objective basis for the plaintiff and Mr Ng to consent to the 100% liability for Suit 417 that they assumed under the Settlement Agreement and Consent Judgment. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 The observation in <span class="font-italic">Hartford Insurance </span>at [27] that “[w]e do not think it should make a difference whether the judgment obtained against the insured is after a trial or on admission, so long as notice was given to the insurer to defend the claim of the injured third party if it wished” also does not assist the plaintiff. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) In <span class="font-italic">Hartford, </span>there was no dispute over liability and the quantum of damages was arrived at after an assessment of damages involving witnesses. In this case, Suit 417 was never judicially determined because the Developer, the Builder, the plaintiff and Mr Ng reached a private settlement amongst themselves on both liability and quantum (which Ng effectively admitted was a settlement of convenience). It is not clear that such a situation fell within the contemplation of the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Hartford Insurance</span>. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Moreover, the observations at the start of [27] should be read with the further statements in [27], where the court also observed that “It is absurd to require an insured to contest a claim, or the quantum thereof, if he does not have any basis to contest it.” In other words, the observation that a judgment obtained after a trial is the same as a judgment obtained on admission, was made in reference to an admission where there is no basis to contest a claim. </div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(i) In its response to queries from the court on <span class="font-italic">Hartford Insurance</span>, the plaintiff submitted that it was absurd for it to contest the claim in Suit 417 when it did not have any basis to contest it, as the Developer and the Builder had strong evidence against it and the defendant’s expert reports disclosed that the plaintiff was negligent. It was thus submitted that the plaintiff had no ground, basis or evidence to refute such reports and evidence. However, such a submission is completely unsupported by the evidence in this case, and is in fact, contradicted by the evidence of plaintiff’s only witness, Mr Ng, which I will return to below. </div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(ii) In this case, by Mr Ng’s evidence, the plaintiff had a basis to contest the claim in Suit 417. However, the plaintiff and Mr Ng decided not to contest the claim, despite his view that they were not liable, because, on Mr Ng’s evidence, he lacked the time and money to fight the claim (see below at [71]).  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 While <span class="font-italic">Hartford Insurance</span> at [27]–[29] did not contemplate a case as the present, where both liability and quantum were settled, this was the fact scenario that was before the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Britestone</span>. While <span class="font-italic">Britestone</span> did not arise specifically in the context of a claim by an insured against the insurer, it did set out an approach to strike the appropriate balance between the competing interests of safeguarding a party against unreasonably settled third party claims, and ensuring that cases which have been settled need not be re-litigated. I have found the approach in <span class="font-italic">Britestone</span> helpful, and have thus applied it above.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 In summary, for the above reasons, I do not find that <span class="font-italic">Hartford Insurance </span>applies to the present case.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Would the plaintiff have been liable to the Developer and Builder in Suit 417 in the absence of the Settlement Agreement?</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 I turn next to the question, whether on the evidence, the plaintiff would have been liable to the Developer and the Builder in Suit 417, in the absence of the Settlement Agreement. As per [54] above, the question can alternatively be framed as whether the Settlement Agreement was reasonable.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Parties’ submissions</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(1) Defendant’s submissions</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 The defendant relies on the following evidence in support of its submission that the plaintiff’s liability would not have attached in the absence of the Settlement Agreement.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 In Suit 417, the plaintiff denied all liability to the Builder and the Developer.

</div>
</div> However, the plaintiff did not call Mr Ng Soon Hua to give evidence. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">My decision</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">76 The plaintiff’s reliance on the report by Mr Ng Soon Hua was misplaced. The plaintiff called Mr Ng as its one and only witness. Importantly, his evidence as set out at [67]–[71] above contradicts the plaintiff’s submission that liability under the Consent Judgment would have attached in the absence of the Settlement Agreement. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">77 Mr Ng’s evidence in both Suit 417 and Suit 376 is that the plaintiff was not at fault for the Damage, and that at the least, the Builder and other parties contributed to the Damage. This evidence is consistent with the evidence of Mr Patterson-Kane as noted at [68] above. Critically, Mr Ng also testified that he and the plaintiff actually denied all liability to the Developer and the Builder, that they truly believed that they were not liable to the Builder and Developer, and that he entered the Settlement Agreement, not because he assessed that he or the plaintiff was likely be found liable in Suit 417, but to help the developers recover the money and because he did not have resources to “fight” the claim without the backing of the defendant (see [71] above). Returning to the factors set out in <span class="font-italic">Britestone</span> at [54], there has been no evidence provided that showed that the Settlement Agreement was reasonable. There is no evidence on the content of the negotiations, whether they were conducted <span class="font-italic">bona fide</span>, or the assessment made then of the prospects of the success of the claim. On the evidence before me, it could not be said that the settlement figure was objectively assessed and properly calibrated against the context of the entire factual matrix. Far from it, the evidence shows the contrary. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">78 Consequently, I find that the plaintiff has not proven that liability under the Consent Judgment would have attached in the absence of the Settlement Agreement. As I have determined above, this is a requirement for coverage under cl 3.2 read with cl 2.1 of the Policy. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">79 I would add that I do not find merit in the plaintiff’s submission that the defendant ought to have objected to the Settlement Agreement, either at the point of mediation or when Consent Judgment was entered.

</div>
</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">80 The unchallenged evidence of Ms Shirlene Carol Fernz Ak Vincent (“Ms Vincent”), Claims Litigation Manager of the defendant, is that all the defendant knew at the end of the mediation was that it was unsuccessful, that is, there was no <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> settlement. The defendant was neither privy to how the settlement terms came about, nor could it assume what the settlement terms were in the absence of a fully signed settlement agreement.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">81 I also agree with the defendant that as it had already denied coverage by the time of the Consent Judgment, it was not for the defendant to object to the Consent Judgment or advise the plaintiff, which was duly represented legally, on how to deal with the claims from the Developer and Builder. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">82 As this is a threshold issue for the plaintiff’s claim, the claim fails on this basis alone.

The court in <span class="font-italic">Griffin Travel </span>noted that the plain and ordinary meaning of dishonesty was “deceitfulness shown in someone’s character or behaviour”. As for wilfulness, the defendant submits that “… the person responsible for wilful misconduct knows and appreciates that it is wrong conduct on his part in the circumstances to do or omit to do a particular thing, or acts with reckless carelessness, not caring what the results of his carelessness may be”: <span class="font-italic">Marina Centre Holdings Pte Ltd v Pars Carpet Gallery Pte Ltd</span> [1997] 2 SLR(R) 897 <span class="font-italic">(“</span><span class="font-italic">Marine Centre Holdings</span>”) at [22].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">85 Annex C Forms were forms that the Builder, QP(S) (Mr Ng in this case) and QP(Geo)(S) were to complete and submit to BCA, before moving to the next construction stage under the ERSS plans.

In none of the Annex E Forms that were electronically completed and signed by Mr Ng, or their covering letters which were also digitally signed by Mr Ng, did he raise that the Builder had deviated from the approved ERSS plans by failing to install raking struts. This was despite the fact that the Annex E Forms required him to confirm that the works were built in accordance with BCA approved plans.

This is because the raking struts rested on a boundary wall, which was a non-structural wall. They would thus not have any effect on stabilising the neighbouring Two Properties. In fact, the plaintiff subsequently made further submissions to BCA for the omission of the installation of raking struts, which were approved on 7 March 2019. Two accredited checks also confirmed that the raking struts were not necessary.

</div> The plaintiff states that it took up the Policy to protect itself from breach of professional duty in the course of practice. It is against the business purpose of the Policy for cl 6.5 to be read such that coverage can be denied as long as there is a dishonest omission which contributed to the claim. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">My decision</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">96 To start, I find the plaintiff’s submission on the interpretation of cl 6.5 to be without merit. It is trite law that the starting point in contractual interpretation is to look to the text of the contractual document: <span class="font-italic">Lucky Realty Co Pte Ltd v HSBC Trustee (Singapore) Ltd</span> [2016] 1 SLR 1069 at [2]. What the text of cl 6.5 states, is plain and clear. It excludes coverage where there is “any Claim directly or indirectly <span class="font-italic">arising out of</span>, in consequence of, <span class="font-italic">or contributed to by</span> an actual act or omission by You or Your Employees, contractors or consultants which was fraudulent, dishonest …” [emphasis added].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">97 Moreover, the court may have regard to the relevant context as long as the relevant contextual points are clear, obvious and known to both parties: <span class="font-italic">Zurich Insurance (Singapore) Pte Ltd v B-Gold Interior Design &amp; Construction </span><span class="font-italic">Pte Ltd </span>[2008] 3 SLR(R) 1029 at [125], [128] and [129]. What the plaintiff is seeking to impute here is not a context that is relevant to the interpretation of cl 6.5, but simply the plaintiff’s apparent subjective intent in taking up the Policy. At the same time, it is a key part of the commercial context that an insurer sets out, at a particular price, what it is willing to insure and the conditions for coverage. Such conditions are contained in the Policy, which the plaintiff agreed to. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">98 I turn next to whether cl 6.5 was breached on the facts. The undisputed facts are that Mr Ng was aware that the Builder did not install raking struts before proceeding with excavation, and that he could have indicated in the Annex C Forms or the Annex E Forms and their covering letters that there was deviation from the ERSS plans but did not do so.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">99 The question is whether, in light of the above facts, Mr Ng was not just negligent or incompetent, but dishonest or committed a wilful breach of duty. Based on the authorities cited by both the plaintiff and defendant, it is clear that dishonesty requires some level of subjective appreciation that what one is doing is wrong. An examination of what Mr Ng himself believed at the time is therefore necessary. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">100 Mr Ng’s evidence is that he genuinely believed that the absence of raking struts prior to excavation was a minor deviation from the ERSS plans that did not need to be reported. His evidence is that the deviation was minor and would not cause the Damage, as the raking struts would have rested on the boundary wall, which was a non-structural wall. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">101 Mr Patterson-Kane disagrees with Mr Ng’s assessment and testified that the boundary wall was also a retaining wall, even if it was only a brick wall.

</div> However, there is nothing in any of Mr Patterson-Kane’s reports or testimony that points to the conclusion that Mr Ng’s view is one that cannot possibly have been genuinely held. No further evidence was led by either party, beyond the bare contrasting opinions of Mr Patterson-Kane and Mr Ng, on whether the boundary wall was indeed a retaining wall or a non-structural wall, and on the effect of either being true. While the defendant submits that Mr Ng’s evidence is not reliable because he did not carry out an independent and objective test to verify this,

</div>
</div> On his assessment, it appears that the absence of the raking struts was not a major cause of the Damage. Thus, Mr Patterson-Kane’s assessment somewhat supports Mr Ng’s evidence that the absence of the raking struts was a minor deviation. Consequently, Mr Ng’s evidence that he genuinely believed that there was no need to report the minor deviation in the Annex C Forms, remains objectively plausible, even in light of Mr Patterson-Kane’s expert evidence.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">104 Further, Mr Patterson-Kane’s critique of Mr Ng set out at [91]–[92] above, is focused on Mr Ng’s <span class="font-italic">actions</span> in choosing not to report any deviations from the ERSS plans, thereby contravening regulations under the Building Control Act. It is clear that Mr Patterson-Kane was not making a comment on whether Mr Ng honestly held the belief that there was only a minor deviation from the ERSS plans. In any event, a comment by Mr Patterson-Kane in that regard would carry little weight given that it would have been made without any actual evidence of Mr Ng’s intentions and knowledge at the time.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">105 Taking into consideration the testimony of Mr Ng and Mr Patterson-Kane, I find that Mr Ng genuinely believed that the absence of raking struts was a minor deviation and that hence he did not need to indicate such deviation in the Annex C Forms, or the Annex E Forms and their covering letters. As per <span class="font-italic">Marina Centre Holdings </span>at [22]<span class="font-italic">, </span>wilful misconduct is where a person “<span class="font-italic">knows and appreciates that it is wrong conduct on his part</span> in the circumstances to do or omit to do a particular thing”. It follows from my finding on Mr Ng’s genuine belief, that he clearly did not appreciate that he was doing something wrong. Nor could he have been acting deceitfully such that he can be said to have been dishonest: <span class="font-italic">Griffin Travel </span>at [410] and [412]. I thus find that the defendant has not proved that Mr Ng was dishonest or in wilful breach of duty in failing to indicate the deviation from the approved ERSS plans. Accordingly, cl 6.5 was not breached.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Issue 3: Was there a breach of cl 7.7?</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">106 The defendant finally submits that the plaintiff breached cl 7.7 of the Policy, which requires the plaintiff to provide the defendant with “all information and assistance” that the defendant “may reasonably require” to investigate or defend a claim. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Parties’ submissions</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Defendant’s submissions</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">107 The defendant’s case is that the main non-cooperation was the plaintiff’s failure to respond to the defendant in respect of queries and requests for information and documents relating to the deviation from the ERSS plans, which would have been material to the assessment of the plaintiff’s claim on the Policy.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">108 Ms Vincent testified that there were a number of instances where the plaintiff and Mr Ng were not cooperative in providing information and assistance that was reasonably required to investigate and defend the claim.

</div></div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) During a meeting between Mr Ng, the defendant and DRD on 25 June 2018, DRD requested a detailed chronology of all of the works that were carried out onsite for the Project, accompanied by photographs as well as commentary for each photograph. Mr Ng sent DRD a document via e-mail dated 1 July 2018 (the document was subsequently revised on 9 July 2018). However, it was not clear from Mr Ng’s e-mail and document whether he was of the view that there were any deviations from the approved ERSS plans.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) On 26 June 2018, DRD sent a query to Mr Ng on the sequence of works with reference to a site photograph. There was no response to this e-mail, so DRD sent further reminders on 29 June 2018 and again on 5 July 2018. Mr Ng only responded on 9 July 2018 and merely stated that “The photo shown is localized excavation in accordance with approved drawings”. He did not answer the question that was asked of him, which was whether the work done complied with the sequence specified in the ERSS plans (which required the raking struts to be completed before the excavation works for the basement could commence). </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) DRD on 18 May 2018 requested Mr Ng to provide the date when a certain figure in the plaintiff’s 6 October 2015 Annex E covering letter was taken. This was never provided despite reminders. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) When asked about the removal of the two raking struts which had been erected across the drain to the rear boundary wall of No. 1 Greenleaf Lane, Mr Ng informed the defendant and DRD that he had not been consulted on this removal. A document contradicting Mr Ng’s account was pointed out to Mr Ng by DRD on 2 July 2018, but he never responded to this e-mail.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">109 Ms Vincent explained that the information, documents and assistance that the defendant requested through DRD were needed to fully investigate the plaintiff’s claim and evaluate the plaintiff’s and/or Mr Ng’s potential liability. This had a bearing on matters such as the appropriate strategy to deal with the potential claim as well as the reserves which needed to be set aside. In this regard, the defendant needed to assess how and to what extent coverage under the Policy was engaged. The plaintiff and Mr Ng’s failure to provide the defendant with all information and assistance (reasonably) required impeded the defendant from doing so.

QBE’s case is that contrary to what you set out at para 47 sub-paragraph (2), you actually failed to provide all relevant information and assistance that QBE and/or Dentons reasonably required to investigate and/or defend their claim which was threatened by the builder and the developer at the material time, you can either agree or disagree? </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">A:  I agree, yah</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Q:  You agree with that? </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">A:  Yah. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Q:  In all fairness, do you agree with that?  </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">A  Yah.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">122 In light of the above evidence, I find that the plaintiff had not provided the defendant with all the information and assistance that it may have reasonably required to investigate and/or defend the claim. The plaintiff hence breached cl 7.7.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">123 The next question is whether cl 7.7 is a condition precedent to coverage of the claim under the Policy. While the defendant relies on the observations in <span class="font-italic">Shinedean</span> at [19], they were made in the context of a policy that contained a term stating that “[n]o claim under this policy shall be payable unless the terms of this condition have been complied with” (see <span class="font-italic">Shinedean</span> at [26]). There is no language to this effect in cl 7.7 or in cl 7. In section [2.2] of Poh Chu Chai<span class="font-italic">, General Insurance Law</span> (LexisNexis, 2009) (“<span class="font-italic">General Insurance Law</span>”), the learned author states that if an insurer wishes to disclaim liability when an insured is in breach of a policy term, the term has to be stipulated to be a condition precedent to the insurer’s liability. Apart from labelling a term as a condition precedent, a term may be construed as a condition precedent if it is stated that a breach takes away all policy benefits. Thus, a term stipulating that all policy benefits are forfeited if there is a failure to comply with the term suffices to make it a condition precedent. Another variation is to stipulate that the insurer’s liability does not arise until after the term is complied with by the insured. There is no language in cl 7.7 or cl 7 that utilises any of such variations or language of similar effect to indicate that cl 7.7 is a condition precedent.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">124 In its further submission, the defendant submits that Ian Enright, Robert M Merkin, <span class="font-italic">Professional Indemnity Insurance Law </span>(Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 2nd Edition, 2007) (“<span class="font-italic">Professional Indemnity Insurance Law</span>”) (at paras 15-031 to 15-032) supports the interpretation of cl 7.7 as a condition precedent. As para 15-030 is also relevant, I include it below:  </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Co-operation.</span> There is authority that certain terms will imply an obligation of cooperation: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">It is common for professional indemnity policies to contain express conditions concerning co-operation by the insured in the defence of the third party claim against the insured which forms the basis of the insured’s claim for indemnity under the policy. <span class="font-italic">These provisions will usually be drawn as conditions precedent to the insurer’s liability to provide an indemnity.</span> A number of examples are provided below: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(2) The insured will give to the insurer in relation to the insurer’s defence or settlement of any claim against the insured, all such information and assistance as the insurer may reasonably require.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(4) The insured shall give all such information, co-operation and assistance as underwriters may require.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…The legitimacy of any request by the insurer for information or assistance must always be considered against the particular wording of the policy provision, when the purpose of such provisions will have a bearing on the proper construction. Thus, a condition that the insured shall co-operate with insurers and their appointed representatives “in the investigation and assessment of any loss and/or circumstances giving rise to a loss”. The clause must be intended to bear some relationship to the ordinary course of claims handling and investigation, and the purpose of putting insurers in a position where they can make a sensible judgment regarding any proposal made to settle or compromise or admit liability. The requirements of the clause must extend at least to the determination of the nature, scope and amount of any loss and whether it falls under the policy cover. It would also extend to investigation of a potential breach of warranty directly related to the loss, and possibly to investigation of a misrepresentation related to the circumstances later give rise to the loss.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">125 The defendant submits that the second and fourth example in the passage above are materially similar to cl 7.7 and that therefore this excerpt from <span class="font-italic">Professional Indemnity Insurance Law</span> supports the interpretation of cl 7.7. as a condition precedent.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">126 I am unable to agree with this. In my view, it is clear on a reading of the text cited by the defendant that the learned authors of <span class="font-italic">Professional Indemnity Insurance Law</span> were listing examples of conditions of co-operation, rather than examples of conditions of co-operation that were stipulated to be conditions precedent. When the authors stated that “these provisions will usually be drawn as conditions precedent to the insurer’s liability to provide an indemnity”, they were simply stating that the following examples of conditions, as a matter of practice, would typically <span class="font-italic">also</span> be stipulated to be conditions precedent when they were found in insurance contracts. The learned authors were not stating that the examples contained language which would render them as conditions precedent.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">127 The only part of the Policy that defendant relies on as a stipulation that cl 7.7 is a condition is precedent is what it states to be the preamble to the Policy. This part of the Policy states, “WE WOULD REMIND YOU THAT YOU MUST DISCLOSE TO US, FULLY AND FAITHFULLY, THE FACTS YOU KNOW OR OUGHT TO KNOW, OTHERWISE YOU MAY NOT RECEIVE ANY BENEFITS FROM YOUR POLICY” (the “Reminder”). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">128 I note that the Reminder is not actually in “The Preamble” of the Policy. “The Preamble” is actually cl 1 of the Policy.

</div> The Reminder is instead set out on the page before cl 1, on what appears to be a welcome page, after the following words:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">QBE INSURANCE (SINGAPORE) PTE LTD welcomes you as a policyholder and we take this opportunity to recommend that you thoroughly examine this Document which sets out the limitations and benefits of the insurance.

Even if it was, the Reminder does not set out what is required of the insured, in the clear terms that cl 7.7 does. Nor does it firmly indicate that a breach would result in the forfeiture of the benefits of the policy, as it only mentions that the insured “may not receive any benefits” from the Policy. Consequently, I find that the Reminder is insufficient to support the reading of cl 7.7 as a condition precedent.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">130 The defendant also submits that what is truly determinative of whether a clause is a condition precedent is the substantive underlying rationale for the clause, rather than the label that is placed on it. In support of this proposition, the defendant relies on <span class="font-italic">Diab v Regent Insurance Co Ltd</span> [2007] 1 Bus LR 915 (“<span class="font-italic">Diab</span>”) and <span class="font-italic">Denso Manufacturing UK Ltd v Great Lakes Reinsurance (UK) plc</span> [2018] 4 WLR 93 (“<span class="font-italic">Denso</span>”) in which the courts discussed the substantive rationale for co-operation clauses when determining if they were conditions precedent.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">131 I do not find <span class="font-italic">Diab </span>and <span class="font-italic">Denso</span> to support the plaintiff’s case that cl 7.7 is to be regarded as a condition precedent. In both cases, there was clear language in the relevant clauses that stipulated them to be conditions precedent. As discussed earlier, such language is missing in cl 7.7. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) In <span class="font-italic">Diab</span>, Condition 11 provided that “No claim under this Policy shall be payable unless the terms of this condition have been complied with.” The Privy Council at [14] stated: “The condition is expressed as one that has to be complied with before any claim becomes payable and their Lordships find the categorisation of condition 11 as a condition precedent easy to accept." </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) In <span class="font-italic">Denso</span>, condition 7 provided that “No claim under this Policy shall be payable unless the terms of this condition have been complied with.” The court in <span class="font-italic">Denso</span> stated at [40]: “On this issue it seems to me that [the insurer] is correct and that in the light of the wording and context of this ATE Policy the terms relied on are capable of being conditions precedent.”</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">132  In other words, the exposition of rationale behind the co-operation clauses in <span class="font-italic">Diab </span>and <span class="font-italic">Denso</span> took place from the starting position that the language of the relevant conditions supported its construction as a condition precedent. That the courts also undertook an examination of the rationale does not mean that the substantive rationale for the clause becomes the determinative question. Rather, the fact that the courts undertook such an examination follows from the widely accepted principle which the learned author of <span class="font-italic">General Insurance Law </span>set out at para 2.2 in the following manner:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[i]f an insurer wishes to disclaim liability when an insured is in breach of a policy term, the term has to be stipulated as a condition precedent to the insurer’s liability … [a]t the same time, it has to be recognised that the mere labelling of a term as a condition precedent does not automatically make the term a condition precedent even though it is a strong indication of the insurer’s intention.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">133 In other words, while the mere labelling of a term as a condition precedent does not automatically make the term a condition precedent, there should be, in the first place, sufficient in the language of the condition to provide a strong indication of the insurer’s intention that the clause is to be regarded as a condition precedent. Without such language, the subsequent discussions on the commercial rationale behind the clause that the defendant highlighted would not even be engaged. This can be seen also in <span class="font-italic">The Directors of the London Guarantee Co v Benjamin Lister </span><span class="font-italic">Fearnley</span> (1880) 5 App Cas 911, which the defendant cites, pointing to Lord Blackburn’s discussion of the rationale of a proviso (at 916-917) when determining whether it was a condition precedent. In the section cited by the defendant, Lord Blackburn concluded that “[he was] obliged to come to the conclusion that the intention must have been what [he had] last stated, and that <span class="font-italic">it is sufficiently expressed</span> to have the effect of making this a condition precedent” [emphasis added]. Earlier, he had stated that “[a]ll agree that the question is, what is the intention to be collected from the words.” Thus, it cannot be any clearer that the starting point in an inquiry as to whether a clause is a condition precedent is the objective intention as expressed in the words of the policy. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">134 Thus, I find that cl 7.7 was not a condition precedent. There is nothing in cl 7.7 or in the Policy as a whole that can be said to stipulate cl 7.7 to be a condition precedent.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">135 For the reasons set out above, I find that while the plaintiff was in breach of cl 7.7, it was not a condition precedent. The defendant is hence only entitled to damages arising from the breach of cl 7.7. It is however, not part of the defendant’s pleaded case that it is entitled to damages against the plaintiff for the breach of cl 7.7. I will hence not make any orders for damages arising from the breach of cl 7.7.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Issue 4: Does public policy or public interest militate against the defendant’s right to repudiate liability under the Policy?</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">136 The plaintiff submits that even if the court finds in favour of the defendant on any of the three issues previously discussed, the court should nevertheless recognise that there are considerations of public policy or public interest that weigh in favour of the plaintiff, and militate against the defendant’s exercise of its right to repudiate liability under the Policy.

</div>
</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">137 Before addressing the substantive merits of this submission, I make two observations. First, the plaintiff is not suggesting that the Policy should be voided or rendered unenforceable for reasons of public policy. Instead, the plaintiff is seeking to enforce the Policy on public policy grounds. Second, the plaintiff is not suggesting that public policy considerations should be taken into account when interpreting the various clauses of the Policy. Rather, the plaintiff’s submission is that the court should determine the suit based on public policy considerations <span class="font-italic">despite</span> the proper interpretation of the contract leading to the opposite outcome.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">138 There is no legal basis whatsoever for the plaintiff’s submission. The plaintiff refers to three authorities: <span class="font-italic">Ting Siew May</span><span class="font-italic"> v Boon Lay Choo and another </span>[2014] 3 SLR 609 (“<span class="font-italic">Ting Siew May</span>”),<span class="font-italic"> </span><span class="font-italic">ACB v Thomson Medical Pte Ltd and others</span> [2017] 1 SLR 918<span class="font-italic"> </span>(“<span class="font-italic">ACB</span>”)<span class="font-italic"> </span>and <span class="font-italic">UKM v Attorney-General</span> [2019] 3 SLR 874<span class="font-italic"> </span>(“<span class="font-italic">UKM</span>”). None of these authorities support the plaintiff’s submission in any way.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">139 <span class="font-italic">Ting Siew May</span> only stands for the proposition that “[a] court [may] hold that a particular contract is void and unenforceable as being contrary to public policy because of the <span class="font-italic">wider public interest</span>” [emphasis in original]: at [24]. It does not stand for the opposite proposition that a party may enforce a contract in a manner contrary to the proper interpretation of the contractual clauses because it would be in the public interest to do so.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">140 <span class="font-italic">ACB </span>only stands for the proposition that public policy has a role to play in regulating the types of damages recoverable in a civil claim. In fact, the court noted at [53] that the role that policy plays in the law of contract outside the defence of illegality was limited.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">141 The passages cited by the plaintiff from <span class="font-italic">UKM</span> were remarks made by the court about how public policy should be taken into account <span class="font-italic">where there was a statutory basis </span><span class="font-italic">for the court to take public policy into account</span>: at [103]. Amongst other considerations, the court in <span class="font-italic">UKM </span>noted at [97] that s 3(1) of the Adoption of Children Act (Cap 4, 2012 Rev Ed) (the “Adoption Act”), which conferred on the court a general discretion, must have had the purpose of enabling the court to consider any public policy which may be relevant to any aspect of the institution of adoption. This was because adoption is the very institution which the Adoption Act has established and seeks to regulate. In stark contrast, the plaintiff has not identified any legal basis, whether arising from common law, contractual principles or statute, to take public policy into account in the context of contractual rights generally. Nor has the plaintiff established any basis for its specific submission that the Policy should be enforced despite its proper contractual interpretation. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">142 Given the above, there is no need for me to address the substance of the plaintiff’s public policy argument. Nevertheless, I touch on it in brief to show that substantively, it is also completely without merit.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">143 First, the plaintiff argues that “because insured and third parties are reliant on [coverage under a professional liability policy] to manage their risk in commercial dealings and business relations with insureds, there is clear potential for harm to the wider commercial ecosystem and stakeholders if it is subjected to repugnant outcomes or standards especially once given weight of law through precedents set by the Court.”

</div>
</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">144 The plaintiff did not provide any evidence to support any of their speculative policy assertions. Neither has the plaintiff provided any explanation or authority for what it considers “reasonable limits” to an insurer’s ability to include contractual exclusions. The plaintiff asserts that allowing the defendant to rely on its contractual rights can be detrimental to the common good that comes from professional liability insurance, but it does not address the other side of the policy equation, namely the impact on the provision of insurance if insurers are not entitled to rely on what has been determined to be their contractual rights. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">145 The second “policy” relied on by the plaintiff is the special status afforded to mediated settlement agreements. This argument also fails to point to any contravention of public policy. The plaintiff refers to remarks in parliament by the then Senior Minister of State for Law, Ms Indranee Rajah, in support of the Mediation Bill (Bill No 37/2016), where she explained the policy behind strengthening the enforceability of mediated settlement agreements.
