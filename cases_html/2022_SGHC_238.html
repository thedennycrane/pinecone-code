</div> SPH was interested in acquiring SSTG as it was then looking to expand its digital media business. SPH viewed the acquisition of SSTG as a strategic expansion in its digital media business and an opportunity to improve its existing online property listings business, ST Property. At the time, SSTG was Singapore’s only major real estate analytics company. It managed and operated the Singapore Real Estate Exchange (“SRX”), a digital platform which provided the property market with computer generated pricing and other related services. It obtained real-time information on sales and rental transactions from its partnership with a consortium of property agencies in Singapore (“SRX Consortium”). SPH was hoping to gain access to this information through an acquisition of SSTG. This would allow ST Property to provide high-quality listings to differentiate itself from its competitors.

</div> Acquiring SSTG would also block ST Property’s competitors from acquiring it, and at the same time hedge against SSTG becoming a competitor in the future.

One such disagreement related to the Service Agreement. Mr Baker complained to Mr Fong that he had not seen the Service Agreement before it was executed and that he was not aware of what Mr Tan had locked StreetSine into. Mr Fong responded that the Service Agreement was in all material aspects the same as an earlier draft which Mr Baker himself had provided. Mr Fong’s evidence was that he thought that this meant that Mr Baker had accepted its terms and thus it was surprising to him that Mr Baker indicated that he “had not bought into” the Service Agreement.

A settlement was reached, whereby SISV and StreetSine would jointly issue a press release which addressed SISV’s earlier statements (discussed at [15] above) that formed the basis of the SISV Litigation (“SISV Settlement”).

</div> In the press release, SISV stated that it recognised that computer-generated valuations could facilitate pricing transparency for the public and enhance the efficiency and productivity of property professionals, and strongly recommended embracing such technology. The press release also contained an acknowledgement from StreetSine that for transactions where a formal valuation is required, the opinion of a licensed appraiser remained important.

</div> SSTG remains under judicial management.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Procedural history </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 In the course of proceedings I had to deal with a number of interlocutory applications. I will mention two points.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 The first concerns party representation. There are two aspects to this. One is that on 17 June 2021, Mr Baker filed notice that he intended to act in person. Mr Lee, however, would remain represented by Providence Law Asia LLP, as they had both been hitherto. This raised the question of whether multiple plaintiffs can proceed in this way, as ordinarily they should be represented by one set of counsel. If plaintiffs engage different counsel, or one is in person while the other is represented by counsel, there is then on one hand the risk of inconsistent positions being taken and on the other hand the possibility of inefficient use of court time where both plaintiffs seek to address the court separately on the same points. It was immediately apparent to me that Mr Baker was a sophisticated and articulate individual who felt that he could best speak for the justice of his case. Sensibly, the defendants did not make much of an objection, and I allowed the plaintiffs to proceed in this way, subject to my control of time and on the basis of their stated intention to take consistent positions. Thereafter, Mr Baker and Mr Lee’s counsel worked together to divide the time appropriately and with minimal duplication. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 The other aspect of party representation concerned the fact that, of the defendants, SPH and SPHI had one set of counsel from Allen &amp; Gledhill LLP while Mr Barakat-Brown had another set from the same law firm. The defendants made applications for further security for costs from Mr Baker who is resident outside the jurisdiction. I dismissed these applications on the principal ground that Mr Baker (and Mr Lee) now had assets within the jurisdiction (namely their indirect share of the sales proceeds for SSSPL held by the judicial managers of SSTG) that were likely to exceed the quantum of any adverse order for costs. While doing so, I observed that:

I do not decide anything at this stage, but the question whether two parties represented by the same law firm may have separate costs ordered in their favour will have to be considered in due course.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 The second point is that, preparatory to applying for subpoenas to compel attendance at trial, Mr Baker applied for dispensation of affidavits of evidence-in-chief in respect of twelve witnesses, including the chairman, chief executive officer and numerous employees of SPH, the judicial manager of SSTG and even a partner of Allen &amp; Gledhill LLP.

</div>
</div> First, as the application was only filed by Mr Baker, I required Mr Lee’s counsel to confirm that he associated himself with the application and reminded the plaintiffs they could have only one case for both of them, and would be jointly and severally responsible for costs, if ordered. Secondly, as Mr Baker is a litigant in person, albeit one working closely with Mr Lee’s counsel, I explained the consequences of a party calling a witness as its own, namely that leading questions may not be asked except in accordance with s 144 of the Evidence Act 1893 (the “EA”), and that the party is generally bound to accept the truthfulness of that witness, unless the witness is impeached in accordance with s 157 of the EA. These are important restrictions that operate to discourage parties from calling witnesses speculatively, merely in hope that they may give favourable evidence. Without them, trials would be unnecessarily prolonged, a result that would not be in the interests of the expeditious administration of justice. I allowed the application only in respect of two witnesses, namely Ms Young Yim Nee Babsy (“Ms Young”), who was a nominee of SPHI on SSTG’s board, and Mr Ng Yat Chung (“Mr Ng”), the CEO of SPH.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Parties’ cases</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Plaintiffs’ case</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 The plaintiffs contend that the defendants, instead of advancing StreetSine’s interests, developed a plan to remove them so that SPH could gain full control of StreetSine. Around 10 May 2018, the defendants plotted a “bloodless coup”, whereby Mr Barakat-Brown would replace Mr Baker, with the ultimate objective of devaluing the plaintiffs’ shares in SSTG such that SPHI could acquire them for a cheap price. When this plan failed, the defendants resorted to spilling “blood on the floor”, and removed the plaintiffs from their executive roles on 17 December 2018. From that point onwards, the defendants restricted the plaintiffs’ access to StreetSine’s systems and information and acted in an oppressive manner to force the plaintiffs into selling their shareholding at a low price. When they were unable to force the plaintiffs to do so, they deliberately devalued StreetSine and placed it under judicial management.

This legal right arises from the express terms of the SHA and the P&amp;COA. The plaintiffs argue that Clauses 1.1, 3, 5.1 and 5.3 confer on them management rights which are not limited in time. The intention was therefore for their management rights to continue without any cut-off date. Their legitimate expectation of management would only cease when each of them held less than 5% of shares in SSTG, because Clause 3.3.3 provides that their right to appoint directors ceases if their shareholding falls below that threshold.

The defendants combined to exclude the plaintiffs from management by terminating their executive roles. Around 8 May 2018, a plan was hatched between Mr Barakat-Brown and Mr Ng, the CEO of SPH by then, to exclude the plaintiffs from management of StreetSine.

Commercial unfairness is the touchstone by which the court determines whether to grant relief under s 216 CA (<span class="font-italic">Over &amp; Over </span>at [81]). In assessing commercial unfairness, the court should bear in mind that the essence of a claim for relief under s 216 CA lies in upholding the commercial agreement between the shareholders of a company: <span class="font-italic">Ascend Field Pte Ltd and others v Tee Wee </span><span class="font-italic">Sien and another appeal </span>[2020] 1 SLR 771 at [29]. The adjective “commercial” highlights that the inquiry is not limited to parties’ formal legal rights. The commercial agreement between shareholders can be contained in a formal agreement such as the company’s constitutional documents, a shareholders’ agreement, or other collateral agreements. The commercial agreement can also come from an informal understanding among shareholders: <span class="font-italic">Ho Yew Kong v Sakae Holdings Ltd and other appeals and other matters </span>[2018] 2 SLR 333 at [172].

</div> Therefore, where there is no stated time limit for a particular power of the “Management”, it continued to be exercisable by Mr Baker and Mr Lee after 30 June 2018. For example, Clause 5.1.1 of the SHA (see [12] above) describes how the “Management” should “prepare and submit a draft updated Strategic Plan (incorporating an annual Operating Budget…) to the Board for its review and approval at least two months before the start of the next financial year of the Company”. There is no stated time limit in this sub-clause, as compared to Clause 5.1.4 where the “Management’s” conditional authority to make variations to the Strategic Plan would end on 30 June 2018. Thus, while Mr Baker and Mr Lee could not vary the Strategic Plan after 30 June 2018, they were still entitled to prepare and submit the Strategic Plan incorporating an Operating Budget for the following year.

One was Clause 3.12.4 under which the board would have to consult with the “Management” concerning bonuses and increments of employees. The other was Clause 7.1.3 where the “Management’s” primary focus was required to be on growth and development of business and operations and the achievement of targets and milestones in the prevailing Strategic Plan.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 I am not persuaded by this contention. First, there is no logical business reason for Mr Baker and Mr Lee to retain these disparate management powers after ceasing to be employed as CEO and CTO respectively. For example, one would expect any replacement CEO to be responsible for all aspects of the Strategic Plan and Operating Budget without the suggested carve-out in favour of the plaintiffs under Clause 5.1.1. Indeed, this is made clear in Clause 1.1, which defines “Management” as Mr Baker and Mr Lee <span class="font-italic">in their capacities as CEO and CTO. </span>Once they ceased to be CEO and CTO respectively, any clauses referring to “Management” would no longer refer to them. I do not accept the opposite argument that because “Management” was defined as Mr Baker and Mr Lee in their capacities as CEO and CTO, the SHA conferred on them a right to remain as CEO and CTO, or otherwise to retain some or all of the functions and powers usually associated with those roles. That is a strained reading of the SHA, which in fact contradicts the terms of the MAs which provided for termination after 30 June 2018 (see [11] above).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 A further weakness in the plaintiffs’ contention is their suggestion that their management rights under the SHA continued until either of them held less than 5% of the shares in SSTG. They argue that this limit on their management rights arises from Clause 3.3. Clause 3.3 provides that there shall be no change to the shareholders’ rights to appoint directors so long as they retain at least 5% shareholding. Clause 3.3 makes no reference to management or management rights. It governs the shareholders’ rights to appoint directors. In none of the clauses referring to rights of management is there a reference to a minimum of 5% shareholding.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 I consider that the SHA read as a whole does not support any concept of continuing or residual powers vested in Mr Baker and Mr Lee. Much less does the SHA suggest that these residual powers would be vested in them so long as they retained 5% shareholding each. The natural way to provide for such powers in a logical and coherent fashion would be to state expressly that even after the plaintiffs ceased to be CEO and CTO respectively, they would retain certain identified powers until they ceased to hold 5% shareholding. Alternatively, Clause 1.1 could have simply defined “Management” as Mr Baker and Mr Lee in their capacities as at least 5% shareholders. I should note that lawyers were involved in the drafting of the SHA, and that the table of contents and the structure of the SHA generally demonstrate an otherwise logical approach to the parties’ respective powers, rights and obligations. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 I turn next to the alternative contention that there was an implied term of the SHA that the plaintiffs would retain their rights, authority and obligation to control and manage SSTG’s business until such time that each ceased to be at least a 5% shareholder.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 This contention fails at the first step identified in <span class="font-italic">Sembcorp Marine v PPL Holdings Pte Ltd and another and another appeal</span> [2013] 4 SLR 193, at [101], namely that there be a gap in the contract uncontemplated by parties at the time of contracting. It is plain that at the time of entry into the SHA, parties had contemplated what Mr Baker’s and Mr Lee’s management rights would be and how long they would last. On my construction of the SHA, they simply ceased to have management rights pursuant to the SHA after 30 June 2018. This did not preclude them continuing to be employed as CEO and CTO under the MAs or having management roles under other agreements thereafter. Such roles would depend on what was subsequently agreed between them and SSTG, and any powers they might have after 30 June 2018 would be derived from those agreements (if any) and not from the SHA.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 As the concept of legitimate expectations extends beyond matters of contractual right, I must consider whether there was any relevant legitimate expectation beyond what the SHA provides. Defeating a legitimate expectation, unlike breaching a contract, founds no potential contractual remedies but only the possibility that such conduct amounts to commercial unfairness or oppression so as to found relief under CA s 216. However, where contractual rights are the product of informed negotiation between experienced businesspersons, as is the case here, it will have to be shown clearly how and why the minority shareholder should legitimately expect a state of affairs that he had not secured in his contract, here the SHA. The principal point made by the plaintiffs is that when they sold 60% of the company they received no control premium, and hence they expected to continue to have control until such time as they were paid for giving up that control. This point simply cannot bear the weight of the plaintiffs’ contention. The SHA represents the bargain that they struck concerning the state of affairs following their sale of 60% of the company. The price that the plaintiffs received for that sale must be taken to match what was bargained for in the SHA, which included provisions that limited the control that SPHI would otherwise have had by virtue of being majority shareholder. These limitations included the plaintiffs’ management rights that, on my construction of the SHA, were limited in time to the period until 30 June 2018, their rights to continue as directors and the provision for reserved matters that was not bounded in time. That SPHI did not pay for control is reflected in the provisions in fact expressly agreed between parties and does not support additional unexpressed limitations on SPHI’s rights as a majority shareholder. I am unable to find any legitimate expectation that the plaintiffs would have management rights after 30 June 2018, or indeed any role in management other than that of remaining directors on the board as they were entitled to do under the SHA.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 The plaintiffs argued that the fact that restrictive covenants against competing with StreetSine endured so long as they remained shareholders rather than ending on 30 June 2018 or upon ceasing to be employed as CEO and CTO showed that they expected to remain in management even after 30 June 2018 and after ceasing to be employees. I am not persuaded by this argument. The restrictive covenants at Clause 6 of the P&amp;COA appear to reflect similar provisions at Clause 9 of the SPA, which also operate so long as Mr Baker or Mr Lee remained as shareholders. The P&amp;COA extends the benefit of the covenants to SPH. Their purpose seems to be to protect SPH and SPHI as purchaser from future competition from the vendor. This is not unusual and the fact that Mr Baker and Mr Lee agreed to them relates to their position as vendors. I do not consider that the restrictive covenants in the P&amp;COA support the argument that Mr Baker and Mr Lee expected a continuing role in management even after 30 June 2018 and after ceasing to be executive employees.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 I would go further. Not only was there no legitimate expectation that the plaintiffs would have management rights after 30 June 2018, I also do not accept that the plaintiffs even had a subjective expectation of such continuing rights at the time of entry into the SHA. I find that it is an afterthought.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Was their termination from executive roles commercially unfair?</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 The plaintiffs also argued that regardless of whether they had continuing rights to remain in executive roles and notwithstanding that their termination as employees was not in breach of their employment contracts, termination was nonetheless oppressive because of its manner and the failure to consult them about how StreetSine would operate thereafter. They pointed to the lack of a transition period and argued that a “technology company without a CTO was like a human without a brain”.

</div> The plaintiffs are certainly right that when a majority in control of a company terminates the management team in accordance with their constitutional rights to do so this does not of itself preclude a finding of unfairness. A lawful decision to terminate the management team could be made not in the best interests of the company but to advantage the majority or prejudice the minority.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 This reflects the legal position that a board must make decisions in good faith in what it considers is in the interests of the company and not for any collateral purpose: see, for example <span class="font-italic">Cheong Kim Hock v Lin Securities</span><span class="font-italic"> (Pte) (in liquidation</span> [1992] 1 SLR(R) 497, at [26], citing <span class="font-italic">r</span><span class="font-italic">e Smith and Fawcett, Limited</span> [1942] 1 Ch 304, at 306.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 However, in this case I am satisfied that the board decided to terminate the plaintiffs in the good faith belief that this was in StreetSine’s best interests, and did not do so for any improper or collateral purpose. In coming to this view, I have noted the broader context that Mr Baker had himself initiated his own stepping back from executive responsibilities in March 2018 because he wished to return to the USA.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">72 The plaintiffs’ complaints are principally twofold. One is that Mr Baker was compelled to commence proceedings in the High Court to obtain access to certain documents relying on his rights as a director under CA s 199 and that not only was this application allowed but SSTG was also ordered to pay costs. The other is that they were denied access to information and documents relevant to the SISV Litigation.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">73 An application under CA s 199 is readily allowed by the court and so it proved in Mr Baker’s case. It is another matter altogether however to treat the company’s resistance to such an application as an act of oppression. It has not been established that the application was resisted in bad faith, as opposed to, for example, legitimate concern about the scope of the documents sought. Moreover, I accept the defendants’ contention that any prejudice to the plaintiffs was eliminated upon SSTG’s compliance with the order obtained by Mr Baker. I note further that the application under CA s 199 was both commenced and concluded while these minority oppression proceedings were afoot. I am not able to find that resistance to this application establishes or fortifies the plaintiffs’ case.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">74 As for information relevant to conduct of the SISV Litigation for the time period after the plaintiffs were terminated from their executive management roles, I hold that the degree of information to which they were entitled was that appropriate for members of the board of directors. I do not find that they were deprived of any specific information which they were entitled to have as directors. The fact that Mr Barakat-Brown took over management conduct of the SISV Litigation is no more than the natural and legitimate consequence of the change in management.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Did SPHI settle the SISV Litigation unfairly or oppressively to the plaintiffs?</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">What was the commercial agreement concerning settlement of the SISV Litigation?</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">75 The plaintiffs complain that the SISV Litigation was settled without their agreement as shareholders.

However, regardless of subjective beliefs at that time, it remains necessary to construe the SHA to determine what was meant by “disposal of a material asset”, and whether settling the SISV Litigation would come within that.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">76 Neither party adduced evidence from any accounting expert concerning how a litigation claim may be classified in the financial statements of a Singapore company. The defendants rested on the fact that the SISV Litigation was never classified as an asset in StreetSine’s financial statements, a fact that Mr Baker accepted during cross examination.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">77 The plaintiffs did not elaborate on their contention that the SISV Litigation was an asset. I would infer that its basis must be that the claims sued on, namely the torts of conspiracy, causing loss by unlawful means and malicious falsehood, were choses in action belonging to StreetSine. Any property of StreetSine’s including choses in action would be its asset, notwithstanding that the claims were for unliquidated damages.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">78 In my view, in the context of the SHA, the word “asset” in the relevant paragraph bears the meaning of an asset in an accounting sense. In other words, it would apply only to property of StreetSine that was either classified as an asset in its financial statements, or ought to have been so classified under applicable accounting standards. The plaintiffs bore the burden of proof to establish this. They did not adduce any evidence that the SISV Litigation, not being so classified, ought to have been classified as an asset under applicable accounting standards. Accordingly, I do not accept that settlement of the SISV Litigation was a reserved matter.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">79 I accept the defendants’ position that settlement of the SISV Litigation was a matter for the SSSPL board. Thus, the commercial agreement was that the settlement of the SISV Litigation did not require the plaintiffs’ approval.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Was the decision to settle the SISV Litigation commercially unfair?</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">80 I turn then to whether the SSSPL board’s decision to settle the SISV Litigation was unfair or oppressive even though shareholder approval was not required. The board took appropriate steps to assess the best course of action including by obtaining the DSC Note. The DSC Note placed chances of success in relation to at least some defendants as about even. It cautioned that “[e]ven if StreetSine is successful in any of its claims, the damages … are not going to be anywhere close to what StreetSine earlier had in mind e.g. in its 2 May 2018 report on the assessment of damages”.

While the same theme recurs in relation to the conspiracy claim, it is important to consider it in relation to the minority oppression claim. This is because such a scheme, if it existed, would bear on whether SPHI exercised its rights as majority shareholder in good faith as discussed in the preceding sections. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">99 My first observation is that the plaintiffs’ narrative is not supported by direct evidence of any such motive on SPH’s part. Moreover, the narrative is not one of simple pressure put upon a minority shareholder to sell but a tale of a convoluted scheme to somehow manipulate the sales process undertaken by the judicial managers. It is cloak-and-dagger stuff of Machiavellian proportions. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">100 This leads me to the point that such a daring and ambitious scheme if it existed must have involved SPH’s CEO, Mr Ng. Yet, the plaintiffs called Mr Ng under subpoena as their own witness and at no time sought to impeach his evidence as hostile. They are bound to accept his evidence of fact as truthful (although a failure of recollection or mistake of memory on the part of one’s own witness may be overcome by reference to other evidence). Mr Ng confirmed that he did not know of any plans to sell SSSPL at the time of the judicial management applications and had no intention to buy SSSPL.

Injury to the claimant must have been intended as a means to an end or as an end in itself. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">106 It is worth noting that the Court of Appeal at [90] left unanswered the “preliminary question ... whether unlawful means conspiracy continues to have any relevance in our law as a basis of civil liability”. The Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal because in any event the elements of combination and intention were not made out. Since <span class="font-italic">EFT Holdings</span>, the plea of an unlawful means conspiracy has become ever more frequent, and has, on occasion, succeeded.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">107 As can be seen from my summary of the plaintiff’s submissions at [35] above, the unlawful acts relied upon overlap with the alleged acts of oppression. This raises the question whether what counts as an unlawful act extends beyond civil wrongs, such as breaches of tortious, contractual or fiduciary duties, or criminal offences, to acts of oppression that are not in themselves a breach of any duty or bear any criminal character but are simply relied on or potentially relevant for the purpose of a remedy under CA s 216. The plaintiffs offered little argument, if any, for why the category of unlawful acts should be extended in this way. In my view, there is no principled basis for doing so. It is necessary for the plaintiffs to establish a civil or criminal wrong. Conduct that is merely unfair is not by itself an unlawful act. Thus, the plaintiffs must establish that the acts complained of were unlawful, for example by being in breach of the SHA, or of the articles of association or of directors’ duties, and not just unfair to them. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Issues to be determined in relation to unlawful means conspiracy</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">108 For the plaintiffs’ conspiracy claim, I will focus on the issue of whether there were any unlawful acts on the part of the defendants that they combined to carry out. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Were there any unlawful acts on the part of the defendants that they combined to carry out?</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Excluding the plaintiffs from executive management </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">109 The claim of a combination to exclude the plaintiffs from executive management rests on three discussions that Mr Barakat-Brown had.

</div> The plaintiffs’ real complaint with the 9 May 2018 Note was that it contained a “possible path forward” which entailed “enter[ing] into new service agreements with [Mr Baker] and [Mr Lee] for the roles they [were] needed to perform”. I do not see any merit in this complaint given that Mr Baker specifically recommended that the board approve Mr Barakat-Brown’s hiring as CEO in his e-mail of 3 May 2018. This meant that Mr Baker’s role necessarily had to change. Moreover, the question of the future roles of Mr Baker and Mr Lee was a legitimate one for the prospective CEO to discuss with the majority shareholder. After all, as CEO he would have to manage them (as part of his management of the business) in the performance of whatever executive roles they retained, notwithstanding that as CEO he would also be accountable to the board (as a whole) of which they would remain members.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">115 In view of this reading, I accept Mr Ng’s testimony that he did not see “any conflict” or “any daylight” between what Mr Baker was telling him and what Mr Barakat-Brown was telling him.

The true position is that Mr Baker and Mr Lee would be accountable to Mr Barakat-Brown as CEO in relation to the performance of any continuing executive roles they had notwithstanding that he would concurrently be accountable for his performance as CEO to the board of which they would remain members.

</div> The core of their allegations is that as chairman and director he subordinated the interests of StreetSine to those of SPH. Thus, his support for their removal from their management roles, the litigation against them and the discussions he had with others without including the plaintiffs are characterised as being for an improper purpose or in bad faith. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">122 I do not accept these allegations. It was agreed that the board would be structured to include three nominees of SPHI. This is captured in Clause 3.2 of the SHA. That the nominees were also either employees or former employees of SPH was known to the plaintiffs. Nominated directors owe fiduciary duties to the company just as any other director does and are not subordinate to or subject to the control of the person who nominated them. The SPHI-nominee directors were obliged to act in good faith in the best interests of StreetSine, and were not subject to SPHI’s direction. I am satisfied that Mr Fong like the other SPHI-nominees kept that duty in mind and did not take directions from SPH. The fact that SPH also considered that its interests were better served by, for example, terminating the plaintiffs from their management roles and filing applications for interim judicial management does not mean that such decisions by its nominees were made under direction or were tainted by any improper purpose. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Conclusion on conspiracy</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">123 For completeness, I will make brief observations on intention and loss. As is clear in the passage from <span class="font-italic">EFT Holdings</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>that I have cited at [105] above, the injury to the plaintiffs must have been an end or the means to an end. Such an intention is wholly missing in this case. The plaintiffs may not have agreed with the defendants’ approach to StreetSine’s strategic direction or management, and undoubtedly believed they knew best or better than the defendants. It may well be that the defendants were wrong and the plaintiffs were right. However, it is clear on the evidence that the defendants’ desire and intention was to preserve or maximise StreetSine’s value. Such an intention, if successfully carried out, would benefit the minority as much as the majority. Judicial management was a last resort process that the defendants hoped would both sidestep the disputes among shareholders and address the cashflow difficulties faced by StreetSine. The judicial managers carried out their duties independently. I have already rejected the plaintiffs’ narrative of SPH and SPHI engaging in a scheme to buy their shares or the underlying business cheaply.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">124 As for loss, the plaintiffs’ claim of $1,678,246,487 in damages

</div> was staggeringly overblown. First, it proceeded on the basis of putting them in the position they think they would have been if StreetSine had performed in accordance with their EPM vision. This is the wrong measure of damages, framed as it is in terms of performance, as if this were a breach of contract claim. Instead, it should be framed by comparison to the position that they would have been in if the unlawful acts had not occurred. The plaintiffs have far from proven that, had none of the allegedly unlawful acts occurred, they would have achieved their EPM vision. Further, no expert evidence was tendered of StreetSine’s value at any time. The following data points were in the evidence: first, the price at which SPH made its acquisition in 2014, valuing the company as a whole at $50 million; and secondly, the Indicative Proposal in 2018 valuing the company as a whole at $85 million. These valuations do not begin to support an overall value of the company exceeding $4 billion. In oral closing, the plaintiffs raised the possibility of a separate assessment of damages.
