Consequently, the law firm files an application for the company to be put under judicial management and for interim judicial managers to be appointed. The court then places the company under interim judicial management and appoints interim judicial managers. The interim judicial managers thereafter retain the legal services of the same law firm. The directors of the company object and cause an action to be commenced in the name of the company, seeking to injunct the law firm from acting for the interim judicial managers and the company. Do the directors have the legal standing to authorise such an action in the company’s name? What is the legal effect of an order placing the company under interim judicial management? Do the directors retain thereafter a common law power to commence such an action? These, in essence, are the legal issues that the present appeals raise for our determination.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 We heard these appeals together with CA/CA 20/2021 and CA/CA 21/2021. Our decision on those two appeals may be found in <span class="font-italic">Lim </span><span class="font-italic">Oon Kuin and others v Rajah &amp; Tann Singapore LLP and another appeal </span>[2022] SGCA 29 (the “CA Joinder Judgment”). That judgment being released simultaneously with this, we adopt all terms of reference and abbreviations employed therein for this judgment as well.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">3 The present appeals arise from the decision in <span class="font-italic">Ocean Tankers (Pte) Ltd (under judicial management) v Rajah &amp; Tann Singapore LLP and another matter </span>[2021] SGHC 47 (the “Striking Out Judgment”). In the Striking Out Judgment, the High Court judge (the “Judge”) allowed the applications by Rajah &amp; Tann Singapore LLP (“R&amp;T”) for the Injunction Applications to be struck out, on the basis that Mr Lim Chee Meng (“Mr CM Lim”) and Ms Lim Huey Ching (“Ms HC Lim”) (together, “the Lims”) did not have the requisite authority to cause Hin Leong Trading (Pte) Ltd (“HLT”) and Ocean Tankers (Pte) Ltd (“OTPL”) (collectively, “the Companies”) to commence the actions as they had been divested of their managerial powers as directors of the Companies upon the appointment of the Interim Judicial Managers (“IJMs”).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Background</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">4 As the factual background is set out in depth in the CA Joinder Judgment, we shall summarise only the facts salient to the present appeals.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">5 On 27 April 2020, the Judge placed HLT under interim judicial management and appointed the IJMs over HLT. On 12 May 2020, the Judge placed OTPL under interim judicial management and appointed the IJMs over OTPL. After their appointment, the IJMs of both the Companies retained the legal services of R&amp;T.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">6 At the material time, the Lims were directors of both the Companies. On 9 and 21 July 2020, the Lims caused the Injunction Applications to be commenced in the names of the Companies. The Injunction Applications were to (a) restrain R&amp;T from advising and acting for the Companies in High Court  Originating Summons No 452 of 2020 (“OS 452”) and High Court Originating Summons No 417 of 2020 (“OS 417”), which were the pending applications for judicial management orders against the Companies; and to (b) restrain R&amp;T from advising and acting for the IJMs of the Companies, as well as for the Companies’ Judicial Managers (“JMs”) should they be appointed subsequently. On 7 August 2020, the Judge granted OS 452 and OS 417. The Companies were placed under judicial management and their respective IJMs became their JMs. The JMs of the Companies continued to retain the services of R&amp;T.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">7 It bears pointing out that despite the appointment of the IJMs over the Companies, neither of the Lims had sought their approval in relation to the filing of the Injunction Applications, either before or after the filing of the applications. Likewise, neither of the Lims sought the consent of the JMs to proceed with the Injunction Applications following the court order placing the Companies under judicial management. Rather, the Lims purported to act <span class="font-italic">unilaterally on behalf of </span><span class="font-italic">the Companies </span>in filing and proceeding with the Injunction Applications. The significance of this fact shall become apparent.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">8 On 5 October 2020, R&amp;T filed the Striking Out Applications seeking to strike out the Injunction Applications in their entirety. The Lims and their father, Mr OK Lim, responded by commencing the Joinder Applications on 12 October 2020, seeking to join themselves as parties to the Injunction Applications in their personal capacities.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">9 On 4 November 2020, the Judge heard the Applications. He dismissed the Joinder Applications but allowed the Striking Out Applications. In respect of the latter, he considered that neither Mr CM Lim nor Ms HC Lim possessed managerial powers <span class="font-italic">qua </span>directors to commence the Injunction Applications in the names of the Companies. They consequently had no standing and the Injunction Applications were taken out without due authority. In making this finding, the Judge rejected the Lims’ argument that notwithstanding the Companies having been placed under interim judicial management, the Lims continued to possess residual powers of management as directors under common law that empowered them to commence the Injunction Applications in the Companies’ names (see the Striking Out Judgment at [45]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">10 On 27 and 30 November 2020, the present appeals against the Judge’s decision allowing the Striking Out Applications were filed on behalf of the Companies.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">11 Subsequently, on 5 February 2021, the JMs of HLT filed an application for HLT to be wound up. On 8 March 2021, the Judge allowed the application and placed HLT in compulsory liquidation. The JMs were also appointed as HLT’s liquidators. On 16 August 2021, OTPL was placed in compulsory liquidation, with its JMs being appointed as its liquidators. No appeal has been filed against either winding up order.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Issues in the present appeals</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">12 To determine whether the Judge erred in striking out the Injunction Applications on the basis of lack of authority, the legal issues that need to be determined as are follows:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Does an interim judicial management order operate so as to divest the directors of a company of all their powers of management, including the power to commence an action in the company’s name?</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Even if the answer to the above is in the affirmative, what is the scope of any power that the directors retain at common law?</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Our decision</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-justify font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The law on striking out</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">13 R&amp;T brought the Striking Out Applications under O 18 r 19(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>), (<span class="font-italic">b</span>)  or (<span class="font-italic">d</span>), or alternatively, under O 92 r 4 of the Rules of Court (2014 Rev Ed) (“the Rules”), contending that the Injunction Applications should be struck out because:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The Lims, as directors of the Companies, did not have the requisite standing, power or authority to cause the Companies to commence and proceed with the Injunction Applications; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) the Injunction Applications disclosed no reasonable cause of action and/or were scandalous, frivolous or vexatious and/or were an abuse of the process of the court.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify"></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">14 It is common ground that the Rules grant the court the power to strike out the whole or part of an originating summons. The threshold for striking out is a high one, to the extent that the claim must be “obviously unsustainable, the pleadings unarguably bad and it must be impossible, not just improbable, for the claim to succeed” (<span class="font-italic">Singapore Civil Procedure 2021</span> vol 1 (Cavinder Bull gen ed) (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 2021) (“<span class="font-italic">Singapore Civil Procedure</span>” at para 18/19/6). The principles relating to the specific grounds under O 18 r 19(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>), (<span class="font-italic">b</span>) and (<span class="font-italic">d</span>) are well-established:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The ground under O 18 r 19(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the Rules refers to a cause of action (or defence, as the case may be) with no chance of success, having regard only to the averments made in the pleadings (see <span class="font-italic">Singapore Civil Procedure </span>at para 18/19/10).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The ground under O 18 r 19(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the Rules captures cases that are obviously frivolous or vexatious or obviously unsustainable (<span class="font-italic">Singapore Civil Procedure </span>at para 18/19/12).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) The ground under O 18 r 19(1)(<span class="font-italic">d</span>) of the Rules refers to instances where the court’s machinery is used improperly or not <span class="font-italic">bona fides </span>(<span class="font-italic">Gabriel Peter </span><span class="font-italic">&amp; Partners (suing as a firm) v Wee Chong Jin and others </span>[1997] 3 SLR(R) 649 at [22]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">There may be a significant degree of overlap between these grounds. They also largely mirror and share a consistent juridical basis with the court’s inherent jurisdiction to strike out proceedings, as contained within O 92 r 4 of the Rules (<span class="font-italic">Chee </span><span class="font-italic">Siok Chin and others v Minister for Home Affairs and another </span>[2006] 1 SLR(R) 582<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [29] and [35]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">15 In this vein, it is clear that striking out is warranted when there is an absence of legal standing owing to a lack of authority because such proceedings ought not, and indeed could not validly, have been brought at all (see <span class="font-italic">United Investment and Finance Ltd v Tee Chin Yong</span><span class="font-italic"> and others </span>[1965-1967] SLR(R) 349 at [51]–[58]). Hence, the sole point of contention is simply whether the Lims were legally entitled to commence the Injunction Applications in the Companies’ names. In turn, the enquiry as to whether they had authority to commence the Injunction Applications entails ascertaining the exact <span class="font-italic">scope </span>of a director’s powers, residual or otherwise, upon the appointment of insolvency officeholders, such as provisional liquidators, interim judicial managers, liquidators, and judicial managers.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-justify font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The effect of an interim judicial management order</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">16 We begin with a few observations regarding the general powers of directors. It is important in this context to bear in mind the essential features of a corporation. First, there is the separation of <span class="font-italic">legal personality </span>between the corporate body and its shareholders. This means that each company is a separate legal entity, as are its shareholders; correspondingly, the acts of the former will not be imported to the latter, as a general rule. Second, and more important for our purposes, is the separation between <span class="font-italic">ownership and management</span>. This is because the shareholders (and owners) of the company can but need not necessarily be involved in the management of the company. This – the day-to-day management of the company – is ordinarily the responsibility of the board. Section 157A of the Companies Act (Cap 50, 2006 Rev Ed) (“the Act”) provides that the “business of a company shall be managed by, or under the direction or supervision of, the directors” and to this end, directors may exercise all the powers of a company except any power that the Act or the company’s constitution requires the company to exercise in general meeting. It is these very powers conferred on directors that form the nub of the present appeals.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">17 We move on to the treatment of a director’s powers by the judicial management regime. The judicial management scheme was conceived in the wake of the 1987 Pan-Electric crisis, in which Pan Electric Industries Limited, a publicly listed company, collapsed owing to mismanagement by its directors. The inauguration of the judicial management scheme was heralded as a “major innovation in the general structure of the insolvency procedure and will provide an interregnum during which the affairs of the company can be sorted out … [and] provides an opportunity for the company and its creditors to reach some sort of compromise or accommodation” (see <span class="font-italic">Singapore Parliamentary Debates: Official Report </span>(5 May 1986), vol 48 at cols 55–56). In order to allow companies in financial distress to obtain the breathing space needed to work out a rescue, arrangement or controlled asset realisation, it was considered necessary to, among other things, divest the errant directors of their powers of management and transfer the same to an independent management acting as officers of the court (see <span class="font-italic">Law and Practice of Corporate Insolvency </span>(Andrew Chan Chee Yin gen ed) (LexisNexis, 2014) at pp 136–137). This is important in understanding the limited scope of powers which directors retain upon the making of a judicial management order.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The statutory provisions</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">18 Pending the making of an order for judicial management, the court has the power to appoint interim judicial managers over the company. The reason for such power is easily understood. Judicial managers may only be appointed by a court order made after a hearing, which is to take place not less than seven clear days after the notice of the filing of the application is published. This means that there is an interim period during which the company is in management limbo. As has been pointed out, in an application for interim relief in the context of judicial management, the <span class="font-italic">raison d’</span><span class="font-italic">être </span>is the “protection of the assets and business of a company” such that the “court’s determination of whether or not an order for [interim judicial management] should be ordered will depend at least in part on the nature and imminence of the risks facing the company’s business and assets” (<span class="font-italic">Re KS Energy Ltd and another matter </span>[2020] 5 SLR 1435 at [16]). For example, in <span class="font-italic">Re a Company (No 00175 of 1987) </span>[1987] 3 BCC 124, Vinelott J observed, in relation to the making of an interim order for administration (on which the judicial management regime was based), an order for interim relief would be appropriate where there is a <span class="font-italic">prima facie </span>case for the making of an order for administration and where the assets or businesses of the company are in jeopardy (at 128):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… I can see no reason why, <span class="font-italic">if satisfied that the assets or business of a company are in jeopardy, and that there exists a prima facie case for the making of an administration order, the court should not abridge the time for service of the petition</span>, and if at the hearing a person with power to appoint a receiver seeks further time in which to consider whether to exercise that power, should not adjourn the hearing and <span class="font-italic">appoint the proposed administrator or some other suitable person to take control of the property of the company and manage its affairs pending the hearing</span>. Such an appointment would be analogous to the appointment of a receiver of a disputed property which is in jeopardy. If the court cannot make such an order the court might be placed in an unenviable position in a case where an adjournment for a period sufficient to enable the person with power to appoint a receiver to make up his mind whether to make the appointment, <span class="font-italic">might result in the destruction of a company although the survival of the company was the purpose for which the administration order was sought</span><span class="font-italic">.</span> …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">19 Such power is provided for under s 227B(10)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the Act, which was repealed and re-enacted as s 92 of the Insolvency, Restructuring and Dissolution Act 2018 (Act 40 of 2018) (“IRDA”) with effect from 30 July 2020.

The effect of s 227G(2) read with the Eleventh Schedule of the Act, is that pursuant to the IJM Orders, the directors of the Companies were effectively divested of their management and control of the Companies. These powers instead lay with the IJMs, such powers being exercisable at their sole discretion. This position remained after the Companies were placed under judicial management, as the judicial management orders were worded almost identically to the IJM Orders:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">It is ordered that:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">1. The Applicant, [<span class="font-italic">ie</span><span class="font-italic">, </span>OTPL/HLT], is placed under judicial management to achieve one or more of the following purposes stated in Section 227B of the Companies Act (Cap. 50) (the “Act”):-</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(1) the survival of the Company, or the whole or part of its undertaking, as a going concern; …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">3. The affairs, business and property of the Company [</span><span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">ie</span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">, OTPL</span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">/HLT] shall be managed by the Judicial Managers during the period in which the Order for judicial management is in force;</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">4. The </span><span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">Judicial Managers are empowered and authorised to exercise all powers and entitlements of a judicial manager and all powers and entitlements of directors of the Company conferred by the Act</span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)"> and/or by the memorandum and articles of association of the Company, or by any other applicable law in </span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">force;</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 Thus, as the Judge held, the contention by the Lims that they had power as directors of the Companies to commence and maintain the Injunction Applications, notwithstanding the lack of any sanction by the IJMs or the JMs, is simply a “non-starter as long as the companies were under judicial management” (Striking Out Judgment at [29]). We respectfully agree with the Judge. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 For completeness, we observe that the position is similar in the context of an order placing a company in liquidation and the consequent appointment of liquidators, as <span class="font-italic">Walter </span><span class="font-italic">Woon on Company Law </span>elaborates at para 17.122:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">On the appointment of a liquidator in a voluntary winding up (whether members’ or creditors’), <span class="font-italic">the powers of the directors cease except so far as is allowed by the liquidator</span><span class="font-weight-bold"> </span>or by the members (or the committee of inspection or the creditors, in the case of a creditors’ voluntary winding up) with the consent of the liquidator.

Further, as the authors of Tan Lay Hong, <span class="font-italic">The Annotated Singapore Companies Act </span>(Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 2017) point out at para 227B.09, an “analogy can be drawn from the appointment of a provisional liquidator pending [a] final winding up order” to the making of an interim judicial management order. We agree with this observation. That the directors lose their power to manage the company is also clearly the position in England (see <span class="font-italic">Ayerst</span><span class="font-italic"> (Inspector of Taxes) v C. &amp; K. (Constructions) Ltd </span>[1976] AC 167 at 177).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 For all intents and purposes, the appointment of judicial managers over a company effectively entails a usurpation, substitution and supplantation of the powers ordinarily vested in the board of directors. This is why neither the judicial management regime nor the liquidation regime under the Act bears the hallmarks of debtor-in-possession proceedings. So that puts paid to any argument that the IJM Orders did not operate to divest the Lims of their powers as directors.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-justify font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The residual powers of directors at common law</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 The above notwithstanding, the Lims claim that their conduct in procuring the commencement of the Injunction Applications was unimpeachable, due to residual powers that continued to be vested in them as directors of the Companies.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 While the Lims say that there are no local cases that expressly deal with the scope of the residual powers of a director of a company that is placed under judicial management or is wound up, this is somewhat of an overstatement. The High Court in <span class="font-italic">Pacific Andes </span>did in fact consider the proposition of law that “the appointment of a provisional liquidator effectively displaces management save for some residuary responsibilities” as a well-established one (at [74], citing <span class="font-italic">Re Union Accident Insurance Co Ltd </span>[1972] 1 WLR 640 (“<span class="font-italic">Re Union</span>”) and <span class="font-italic">Walter </span><span class="font-italic">Woon on Company Law </span>at para 17.98). The relevant extract from <span class="font-italic">Walter </span><span class="font-italic">Woon on Company Law </span>states that:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… The provisional liquidator may exercise all the powers of a liquidator, subject, however, to such limitations and restrictions as may be set in the order appointing him.

In <span class="font-italic">Re Union</span>, the directors of the company instructed the solicitors to file an application to discharge the provisional liquidator of the company. Plowman J, sitting in the English High Court, dismissed the application, considering that the appointment had been properly made. He then proceeded to consider the issue of costs, and specifically, whether costs ought to be ordered against the directors’ solicitors personally for bringing the application. This necessitated consideration of whether the directors did in fact have powers to procure the filing of the application on behalf of the company. He answered this in the affirmative and held that costs ought not to be ordered against the directors’ solicitors personally.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 According to Plowman J, such powers were residual powers: powers which the directors retained even upon the appointment of the provisional liquidator. He explained as follows (at 642):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…<span class="font-weight-bold"> </span><span class="font-italic">It is of course well settled that on a winding up the board of directors of a company becomes functus officio and its powers are assumed by the liquidator</span> … No doubt that is so, but it is common ground that notwithstanding the appointment of the provisional liquidator, <span class="font-italic">the board </span>has some residuary powers, for example it can unquestionably instruct solicitors and counsel to oppose the current petition and, if a winding-up order is made, to appeal against that order.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The issue is to the extent of those residuary powers, and in particular whether they extend to the launching of the present motion. I think that it may sometimes be helpful to test the matter by considering the other side of the coin, namely to <span class="font-italic">i</span><span class="font-italic">nquire whether the power which the board is said to have lost is one which can be said to have been assumed by the liquidator</span>. If the answer is that it cannot, that may be a good reason for saying that the board still retains it. Clearly, for example, as I have already indicated, <span class="font-italic">the power to instruct solicitors and </span><span class="font-italic">counsel on the hearing of the winding-up petition is not a power which anyone could suggest has passed to the provisional liquidator and therefore the board retains it</span>.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">If that is true in regard to the petition itself, it is, in my judgment, equally true of interlocutory proceedings which are such that it would not be appropriate for the provisional liquidator to give instructions on behalf of the company. …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 At least two key propositions of law may be distilled from the above passage.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 The first concerns the effect<span class="font-italic"> </span>of a liquidator’s appointment on a director’s powers. Subsequent cases have taken <span class="font-italic">Re Union </span>to stand for the “well settled” principle that the appointment of an official liquidator by the court has the effect of rendering the board of directors <span class="font-italic">functus officio</span>, with the latter’s powers to be assumed by the liquidator (see <span class="font-italic">Re </span><span class="font-italic">Swedex Windows &amp; Doors Ltd (in liquidation) and another </span>[2010] IEHC 237 at [21]; <span class="font-italic">Andronics</span><span class="font-italic"> Communications Ltd v AIB Group (UK) t/a First Trust Bank </span>[2020] NIQB 64 (“<span class="font-italic">Andronics</span>”) at [9]). In the decision of the Northern Ireland High Court in <span class="font-italic">Andronics</span>, Horner J observed that “[t]his makes good sense” as the liquidator’s task of realising the assets of the company for the benefits of the creditors and shareholders would be “made impossible if directors of the company were able of their own initiative to launch legal proceedings on behalf of a company which was being wound up” (at [9]). He held that a former director who had purported to act on behalf of the company, including by applying to set aside a cause of action which had been disclaimed by the liquidator, was not legally entitled to do so. This is uncontroversial, and <span class="font-italic">Lightman &amp; Moss on the Law of Administrators and Receivers of Companies </span>(Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 6th Ed, 2017) (“<span class="font-italic">Lightman and Moss</span>”) observes that it has been accepted at least since <span class="font-italic">Re Oriental Inland Steam Co Ex p </span><span class="font-italic">Scinde Railway Co </span>(1874) 9 Ch App 557 that a winding up order has the effect of bringing directors’ powers to an end (at para 2-063, footnote 199).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 The second concerns the scope of residual powers<span class="font-italic"> </span>that directors of a company in liquidation may continue to possess. <span class="font-italic">Re Union </span>has been accepted for its holding that despite the appointment of a liquidator or provisional liquidator (as the case may be), the company’s board retains a residual power to instruct solicitors and counsel to oppose the winding-up petition, as well as to appeal against any such order. <span class="font-italic">Re Union </span>was also applied in <span class="font-italic">Stephen, Petitioner </span>[2012] BCC 537, in the context of administration, to permit the board of directors to challenge “the appointment of a provisional liquidator, receiver or administrator as the case may be” (at [5]). Likewise, it was applied in <span class="font-italic">Closegate</span><span class="font-italic"> Hotel Development (Durham) Ltd and another v Mclean and others </span>[2014] Bus LR 405 (“<span class="font-italic">Closegate</span>”), which was a decision of the English High Court that concerned an application by the companies’ directors to declare as invalid the appointment of administrators over two companies by a creditor bank. Citing <span class="font-italic">Re Union</span>, Snowden QC observed that there is “long-standing <span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">authority to the effect that even after the appointment of a provisional liquidators [</span><span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">sic</span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">], the board of directors of a company retains a residuary power to instruct lawyers to challenge the appointment of the provisional liquidator, to oppose the petition and, if a winding up order is made, to appeal against the making of that order” </span>(at [7]). In this respect, the statement of a director’s residual powers in <span class="font-italic">Re Union </span>has found approval in other common law jurisdictions, including Australia (see the Supreme Court of Victoria decision in <span class="font-italic">Brinds</span><span class="font-italic"> Ltd and others v Offshore Oil NL and others (No 2)</span> [1985] 10 ACLR 242) as well as South Africa (see <span class="font-italic">O’</span><span class="font-italic">Connell Manthe &amp; Partners v Vryheid Minerale (Edms) Bpk</span> 1979 (1) SA 553 (T)).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 Various academic commentaries have described the holding in <span class="font-italic">Re Union</span> in these terms as well. For example, in his treatise <span class="font-italic">The Law of Insolvency </span>(Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 5th Ed, 2017) at para 22-102, Prof Ian F Fletcher describes <span class="font-italic">Re</span><span class="font-italic"> Union </span>as standing for the proposition that “[t]he directors retain the residual power to instruct solicitors and to appeal against the order and also to act in interlocutory proceedings, including a motion to discharge the provisional liquidator”.

Instead, we respectfully agree with the Judge’s analysis. In <span class="font-italic">Shanks</span>, Lord Weir observed that the <span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">“[Companies (Floating Charges and Receivers) (Scotland) Act 1972 (c</span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)"> 67) (UK)] does not provide that the powers of a company to raise proceedings cease upon the appointment of a receiver” (at 413I).

The case concerned a situation where a company in administration had a substantial surplus after paying all debts proved in the administration. The administrators wished to distribute the surplus to the sole member of the company. The UKIA, however, did not provide a mechanism for this to take place. The administrators thus sought to appoint a director of the company to effect the distribution pursuant to “management powers” to be sanctioned by the administrators pursuant to paragraph 64 of Schedule B1, which specifically provided that the administrators could consent to a company’s “management powers” being exercised by the directors. The issue was whether the court ought to approve the distribution. Hildyard J held at [45] that:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… It is clear from paragraph 64 of Schedule B1 [of the UK Insolvency Act 1986] that directors and shareholders can do things which are not inconsistent with the administration, and may exercise “management powers” (defined by paragraph 64(2)(a) as “a power which could be exercised so as to interfere with the exercise of the administrator’s powers”), though only with the administrators’ consent, and any residual powers which are not “management powers”. …</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">The Lims contend that the above extract means directors and shareholders can do things which are not inconsistent with the administration of the company and may exercise any residual powers which are not management powers. In our judgment, their reliance on <span class="font-italic">Lehman Brothers </span>is misplaced. We say so for three reasons.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 First, and as the Judge observed (Striking Out Judgment at [44]), the powers of the directors and shareholders to do things which were not inconsistent with the administration arose from para 64 of Schedule B1 of the UKIA, which reads as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">64 (1) A </span>company in administration or an officer of a company in administration may not exercise a management power without the consent of the administrator. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(2) For the purpose of sub-paragraph (1)— </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(a) “management power” means a power which could be exercised so as to interfere with the exercise of the administrator’s powers, </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(b) it is immaterial whether the power is conferred by an enactment or an instrument, and </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(c) consent may be general or specific. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">It is undisputed that there is no equivalent provision in the Act. Thus, the observations of Hildyard J, made in the context of the UKIA, are not relevant to us.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 Secondly, even assuming that the English statutory scheme is analogous to ours, the residual powers for which the Lims contend are fairly wide. They encompass the ability to “restrain the company’s solicitors from acting in circumstances where there would be a breach of confidentiality” and where “it would be just for the Court to exercise its supervisory jurisdiction”. Such an ability would interfere with the exercise of the powers of the judicial managers (to appoint a solicitor and bring/defend any action). It would therefore amount to a “management power” for the purposes of para 64 of Schedule B1 of the UKIA. Indeed, the power to commence and defend proceedings in the name and on behalf of the company is a power that is expressly vested in the IJMs and JMs, as s 227G(2) of the Act (read with the Eleventh Schedule) makes abundantly clear. Such a power, it would stand to reason – even under the English statutory scheme – is not one exercisable by directors or shareholders of the company.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 Thirdly, Hildyard J expressed the view that whilst a company is in administration, any exercise by the company or its directors of “management powers” would have to be consistent with the purposes of the administration (<span class="font-italic">Lehman Brothers </span>at [66]). This view was approved by the learned authors of <span class="font-italic">Goode on Principles of Corporate Insolvency Law </span>(Kristin van Zwieten ed) (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 5th Ed, 2018)<span class="font-italic"> </span>at para 11-94, footnote 470. It is difficult to see how the purported residual power sought to be exercised by the directors in commencing the Injunction Applications would be consistent with the purposes of the judicial management, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, to achieve the survival of the Companies (or the whole or part of its undertaking) as a going concern or a scheme of arrangement, as provided for in the judicial management orders for both the Companies (see [24] above). As clarified by Snowden QC in <span class="font-italic">Closegate</span>, the concept of a “management power” as defined in paragraph 64 of Schedule B1 of the UKIA is “primarily intended to catch powers which, if exercised by the directors, could impede the exercise of similar powers by the administrators”, but is not intended to catch a power exercisable by the directors to cause the company to challenge the “logically prior question of whether the administrators have any powers to exercise at all” (at [6]). The latter, it appears, is where the concept of residual powers becomes relevant, and also why such residual powers have been so narrowly construed by the courts.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 As R&amp;T rightly points out, <span class="font-italic">Lehman Brothers</span> involved quite a different factual context from the one here. The issue there was not whether certain powers sought to be exercised by directors without the consent of the administrators were “management powers”, but rather whether directors could exercise powers which clearly were “management powers” <span class="font-italic">with the consent of the administrators</span>. No such issue arises in the present case. It is not disputed that no such consent was obtained by the Lims from the IJMs, the JMs, or the liquidators in commencing or pursuing the Injunction Applications. Their decision to act unilaterally is sufficient to distinguish <span class="font-italic">Lehman Brothers</span>.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The position in Malaysia</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 We also to consider the position in Malaysia which, for the reasons that follow, tracks closely the English position and bolsters support for a narrowly circumscribed scope of residual powers.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(1) <span class="font-italic">Sri Hartamas </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 We begin with the Malaysian Supreme Court decision of <span class="font-italic">Sri </span><span class="font-italic">Hartamas Development Sdn Bhd v MBF Finance Bhd</span> [1991] 3 MLJ 325 (“<span class="font-italic">Sri </span><span class="font-italic">Hartamas</span>”). There, a winding-up order had been made against the appellant company. An application was made by motion for an order of stay of the winding-up order pending disposal of the appeal, such motion being supported by an affidavit filed by the solicitors of the company. The court cited <span class="font-italic">Re Union</span> with approval, stating that “notwithstanding the appointment <span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">of the provisional liquidator and the general assumption by him of the company</span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">’s powers, the board still retained certain residuary powers which included authority to instruct solicitors and counsel to oppose the petition and, if a winding-up order is made, to appeal against the order”.</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 Hashim Yeop A Sani CJ thus concluded that after a winding-up order is made, “generally speaking no one but the liquidator can act on behalf of the company. But it is quite clear that the company has a right to be heard to say that the winding-up order is wrong and to appeal against the order”. The only question was who ought to move the appeal on behalf of the company. This should have been the directors, acting on behalf of the juridical corporate body, but since the motion was supported only by an affidavit filed by the solicitors, the motion was not properly before the court and was, accordingly, dismissed.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(2) <span class="font-italic">Taman Sungai </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 The Malaysian Court of Appeal decision of <span class="font-italic">Taman Sungai </span><span class="font-italic">Dua Development Sdn Bhd (previously known as Supershine (M) Sdn Bhd) v Goh Boon Kim </span>[1997] 2 MLJ 526 (“<span class="font-italic">Taman Sungai</span>”) is to similar effect. There, provisional liquidators had been appointed over a company by an order of court. The order was appealed against. The directors of the company filed a petition, seeking that the powers and duties of the provisional liquidator be stayed until determination of the appeal. This petition was opposed by the provisional liquidators on the basis that the directors ceased to have any capacity to instruct solicitors to make the application once the provisional liquidators had been appointed.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 Mahadev Shankar JCA, delivering the judgment of the court, cited with approval the decisions in <span class="font-italic">Sri </span><span class="font-italic">Hartamas </span>and <span class="font-italic">Re Union</span>, as well as a passage from <span class="font-italic">Australian Company Law </span>(W.E.

No doubt that is so, but it is common ground that notwithstanding the appointment of a provisional liquidator, the board has some residuary powers, for example, <span class="font-italic">it can unquestionably instruct solicitors and counsel to oppose the current petition and, if a winding-up order is made, to appeal against that order</span>.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Notwithstanding appointment of a provisional liquidator, the directors retained power to have the company represented in the winding-up proceedings: <span class="font-italic">Re Laverton Nickel NL</span> (1979) 3 ACLR 945.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 The court considered it pivotal that the case before it was one in which “the company itself is appealing against the order appointing the provisional liquidators” and where the “winding-up order had not yet been made”.

Based on the test in <span class="font-italic">Re Union </span>– that the extent of residuary powers may be determined by looking at the other side of the coin, “namely to enquire whether the power which the board is said to have lost is one which can be said to have been assumed by the liquidator” – and following previous representations by the directors and the provisional liquidator that the directors would continue to comply with their obligations under the listing rules, the appeals committee had held that the directors were responsible (at [27]). Aziah Ali J held there was no basis for quashing the decision of the appeals committee in light of evidence showing that the directors’ undertaking to ensure compliance remained intact notwithstanding the appointment of the provisional liquidator, and such an undertaking could not be assigned to the latter (at [34]–[35]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 In our view, <span class="font-italic">Bursa Malaysia Securities</span> does not present any basis on which the scope of the principle in <span class="font-italic">Re Union</span> can be widened.

The Malaysian decisions in <span class="font-italic">Sri </span><span class="font-italic">Hartamas </span>and <span class="font-italic">Taman Sungai </span>stand for the same principle (Striking Out Judgment at [40]).<span class="font-italic"> </span>We agree.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 In substance, an application challenging the making of a judicial management order would challenge the <span class="font-italic">very juridical basis </span>on which such management powers of the directors have been removed<span class="font-italic">, </span><span class="font-italic">ie, </span>upon the appointment of an interim judicial manager, judicial manager, provisional liquidator and/or liquidator. As such, it would appear attractive to hold that it would remain open for directors to challenge the very basis upon which their powers have been divested and that accordingly, it would “not be correct to say that such a power is vested in these insolvency officeholders” in the very first place (Striking Out Judgment at [36]). However, it seems to us, that bearing in mind that a judicial management order can only be made at the instance of the company itself acting in accordance with the resolutions of the board or the shareholders or upon the application of a creditor, it would be incongruous to allow the directors power to challenge their own actions or those of the shareholders. Accordingly, whatever the theoretical attraction of such a holding may be, such residual powers as the directors may have to challenge a judicial management order should, in our view, only be available when the original application had been made by a creditor.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 The view expressed above is consistent with the statutory prescription as to which parties are empowered to <span class="font-italic">veto </span>or <span class="font-italic">challenge </span>a judicial management application: (a) first, pursuant to s 227B(5)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the Act, the court must dismiss an application for a judicial management order if the making of the order is opposed by a person who has appointed, will appoint or is entitled to appoint a receiver and manager of the whole or substantially the whole of a company’s property; and (b) second, pursuant to s 227B(3)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>), where a nomination of a judicial manager is made by the company, a majority in number and value of creditors may be heard in opposition to the nomination (see <span class="font-italic">Re Genesis Technologies International (S) Pte Ltd </span>[1994] 2 SLR(R) 298 at [8]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 The Lims argue that <span class="font-italic">Re Union </span>does not limit the residual powers merely to actions challenging the validity of the appointment of an insolvency officer holder such as a judicial manager or liquidator. Rather, they submit that <span class="font-italic">Re</span><span class="font-italic"> Union </span>applies to “<span class="font-italic">all </span>proceedings which are such that it would not be appropriate for the liquidator to give instructions on behalf of the company”. Obviously, they say, it would not be appropriate for the IJMs or the JMs, or indeed the liquidators of the Companies, to commence proceedings in their names to restrain R&amp;T from acting.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 We are not persuaded by this argument and reject it. The Lims’ interpretation of <span class="font-italic">Re Union </span>as standing for such a broad proposition of law is untethered to authority; it is nothing more than a thinly veiled assertion that directors possess residual powers to <span class="font-italic">effectively </span>second-guess the decisions of judicial managers in the management of the company. This appears to be an argument from necessity: in that if directors do not have that power, no one can make a different decision and the judicial managers or liquidators would not do so since they made the decision in the first place. But necessity is not the touchstone. <span class="font-italic">Re Union </span>provides no such authority. Moreover, as R&amp;T rightly points out, this would effectively outflank and upend the purpose of the legislative scheme for judicial management and liquidation, which is to vest authority over the company’s affairs in the judicial managers and liquidators <span class="font-italic">to the exclusion</span> of the directors. To describe the boundaries of a residual power in such an amorphous way would unduly <span class="font-italic">impinge</span> upon the powers, and <span class="font-italic">interfere</span> with the ability, of the appointed insolvency professionals to carry out their duties. This cannot be the correct position in law.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 Next, the Lims submit that a distinction ought to be drawn between <span class="font-italic">the power to retain solicitors</span><span class="font-weight-bold"> </span>and the <span class="font-italic">power to restrain solicitors</span>. The Injunction Applications, they contend, implicate only the latter power, such that by seeking to injunct R&amp;T from acting for the Companies, they are not impermissibly usurping the liquidators’ power to retain solicitors for the companies. With respect, this distinction is one of semantics but not based on any legal principle. Implicit in it is their acceptance that insolvency office holders have the power to retain solicitors. But the corollary of this must be that they also have the power to discharge solicitors. If they choose not to exercise that power by continuing to have a set of solicitors represent the company, that is a choice which is wholly within their prerogative. It is not open to the directors to usurp the power of retaining or discharging solicitors on behalf of the company by applying to court in the name and on behalf of the company to forcibly bring about a state of affairs that the IJMs, JMs and liquidators did not sanction and were not minded to bring about voluntarily. In any event, it is clear that Plowman J’s comments in <span class="font-italic">Re Union </span>related to “<span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">the power to instruct solicitors and counsel on the hearing of the winding-up petition”. This is plainly not the case here. While the Injunction Applications purport to be an exercise of the power to restrain R&amp;T, they are certainly not related to the making of the Companies’ judicial management orders or the liquidation orders, which were not challenged, or subsequently appealed against. </span>We can do no better than echo the Judge’s observation that the Injunction Applications were not applications aimed at challenging either the appointment of the IJMs, JMs or liquidators or the judicial management and liquidation orders made as against the Companies (Striking Out Judgment at [37]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">In the present case, however, the Lims were not seeking to challenge the IJM Orders or the JM Orders in the Injunction actions. They were exercising powers that had been divested from them and vested in the interim judicial managers and the judicial managers, namely, the power to commence proceedings in the name and on behalf of OTPL and HLT and to retain solicitors to advise them. Indeed, it is difficult to see how the Lims could have challenged the IJM Orders and the JM Orders. After all, the IJM Orders and JM Orders were ordered in terms of the prayers in applications filed by the Lims themselves on behalf of OTPL and HLT, and they brought no appeals subsequently against the orders. </span><span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">Union Accident</span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">, </span><span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">Stephen </span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">and </span><span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">Closegate</span><span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)"> </span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">therefore did not assist </span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">the Lims’ argument that they had the power to cause [the Companies] to bring the Injunction actions.

They do not explain how this is so, and this assertion does not do much to address the authorities considered above. More fundamentally, the status of solicitors as officers of the court <span class="font-italic">already </span>means that the court has oversight over their conduct.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Summary</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 We summarise. As the cases establish, upon a court order placing a company under judicial management or in liquidation, with insolvency representatives being appointed concomitantly over the company, the company’s directors retain residual powers in the limited situation where the company seeks to appeal against or otherwise challenge the very order appointing the judicial managers or liquidators, and must therefore act through its directors. This residual power is necessarily of a narrow scope, to be invoked only in very specific situations.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 The present case does not come within the strictures of this exception. In contradistinction to, say, a challenge against the appointment of insolvency office holders, the Injunction Applications do not challenge the juridical basis of the IJMs’, JMs’ and liquidators’ powers.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 Therefore, we agree with the Judge’s conclusion that the Lims did not retain any residual power as directors to procure the commencement of the Injunction Applications in the Companies’ names.

R&amp;T submits, in view of the peculiar state of affairs leading to the present appeals, that costs ought to be borne by the Lims <span class="font-italic">personally</span>, as non-parties to the present appeals. Unsurprisingly, the Lims resist this, contending that they did not act in bad faith in bringing the Injunction Applications on behalf of the Companies.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 It is clear that the court is vested with the discretionary power to make an order of costs against a non-party to proceedings. This follows from the broad wording of O 59 r 2(2) of the Rules:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Application (O. 59, r. 2)</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(2) Subject to the express provisions of any written law and of these Rules, the costs of and incidental to proceedings in the Supreme Court or the State Courts, including the administration of estates and trusts, shall be in the <span class="font-italic">discretion</span> of the Court, and the Court shall have <span class="font-italic">full power to determine by whom and to what extent the costs are to be paid</span>.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 The relevant legal principles as to when a non-party should be made liable for costs are set out in <span class="font-italic">DB Trustees (Hong Kong) Ltd v Consult Asia Pte Ltd and another appeal </span>[2010] 3 SLR 524 (“<span class="font-italic">DB</span><span class="font-italic"> Trustees</span>”). In essence, in determining whether costs ought to be ordered against a non-party to the proceedings, it must be <span class="font-italic">just </span>in all the circumstances of the case, to make the order. Two factors that may operate in favour of ordering a non-party to bear the costs of the proceedings are: (a) first, the <span class="font-italic">close connection </span>between the non-party and the proceedings; and (b) second, the fact that the non-party must have <span class="font-italic">caused the incurring of costs </span>(see <span class="font-italic">DB</span><span class="font-italic"> Trustees </span>at [29], [30] and [35]). <span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">While bad faith and impropriety on the part of the non-party are important considerations, they are not necessary requirements (</span><span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">SIC College of Business and Technology Pte Ltd v Yeo </span><span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">Poh Siah and others</span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)"> [2016] 2 SLR 118</span> <span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">at [93]). Finally, there is no indispensable rule of practice that a non-party must be given </span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">prior warning before an adverse order for costs is made; what is essential is that the non-party must be accorded due process and that his or her views are adequately considered before such an order is made (</span><span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">DB</span><span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)"> Trustees </span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">at [47]).</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 In the circumstances here, we agree that it would be just for the Lims to bear the costs of the appeals personally. We observe that the Judge considered it appropriate to order costs below to be borne personally by the Lims, rather than from the Companies’ coffers. We see no reason for the costs of the appeals to be any differently treated.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 The Injunction Applications ought not to have been brought in the names of the Companies in the first place. The Companies were, for all intents and purposes, entirely nominal plaintiffs. The true drivers of the litigation were the Lims. In commencing the Injunction Applications, they assumed the risk that they might not in fact possess such a residual power. It can thus hardly be gainsaid that the Lims have a close connection to the Injunction Applications and the present appeals. There is, likewise, a direct nexus between their commencement of the Injunction Applications in the Companies’ names and the incurring of costs by R&amp;T, which has had to resist these applications. We are satisfied that both factors in <span class="font-italic">DB</span><span class="font-italic"> Trustees </span>are satisfied so as to warrant an imposition of costs to be borne personally by the Lims. Their submission that they were not acting in bad faith is not to the point because it is clear from <span class="font-italic">DB</span><span class="font-italic"> Trustees </span>that bad faith is not in fact a pre-requisite for ordering a non-party to bear costs. Ultimately, if costs were visited instead on the Companies, the creditors of the Companies, would in effect bear the burden of the directors’ conduct; laying the burden on them would be unfair.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 Having regard to the parties’ respective costs submissions, we award R&amp;T costs of the appeals fixed at $40,000, inclusive of disbursements, to be paid by Mr CM Lim and Ms HC Lim personally.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">71 Accordingly, we dismiss the appeals and make the costs orders as set out above.

This residual power is necessarily of a narrow scope, to be invoked in very specific situations: at </span><span class="font-weight-bold" style="color: rgba(255,0,0,1)">[62].</span></div><div class="txt-body text-left"></div><div class="txt-body text-left">1 The appeals arise from the decision of the High Court judge (the “Judge”) to allow the striking out of applications to injunct (the “Injunction Applications”) the respondent law firm from advising and acting for the appellants in applications for judicial management orders made by the latter, as well as the interim judicial managers (“IJMs”) and judicial managers (“JMs”) of the appellants, if they were appointed. </div><div class="txt-body text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Background to the appeal</span></div><div class="txt-body text-left">2 On 27 April 2020, the Judge placed the first appellant under interim judicial management and appointed IJMs over it. On 12 May 2020, the Judge placed the second appellant under interim judicial management and appointed IJMs over it. After their appointment, the IJMs of both appellants retained the legal services of the respondent. </div><div class="txt-body text-left">3 At the material time, Mr Lim Chee Meng (“Mr CM Lim”) and Ms Lim Huey Ching (“Ms HC Lim”; collectively, the “Lims”) were directors of the appellants. On 9 and 21 July 2020, the Lims caused the Injunction Applications to be commenced in the names of the appellants. Despite the appointment of the IJMs over the appellants, the Lims did not seek their approval in relation to the filing of the Injunction Applications, or the consent of the JMs to proceed with them following the subsequent court orders placing the appellants under judicial management. The respondent filed applications (the “Striking Out Applications”) on 5 October 2020, seeking to strike out the Injunction Applications in their entirety. The Lims and their father, Mr Lim Oon Kuin, responded by commencing applications to join themselves (the “Joinder Applications”) as parties to the Injunction Applications in their personal capacities. The first and second appellants were subsequently placed in compulsory liquidation on 8 March 2021 and 16 August 2021 respectively, with the JMs appointed as the liquidators.</div><div class="txt-body text-left">4 The Judge heard the Joinder Applications and the Striking Out Applications together. He dismissed the former but allowed the latter. In respect of the latter, he considered that neither of the Lims possessed managerial powers <span class="font-italic">qua </span>directors to commence the Injunction Applications in the names of the appellants. They consequently had no standing and the Injunction Applications were taken out without due authority. In making this finding, the Judge rejected the Lims’ argument that notwithstanding the Companies having been placed under interim judicial management, the Lims continued to possess residual powers of management as directors under common law that empowered them to commence the Injunction Applications in the names of the appellants. </div><div class="txt-body text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Decision on appeal</span></div><div class="txt-body text-left">5 Striking out was clearly warranted where there was an absence of legal standing owing to a lack of authority, because such proceedings ought not, and indeed could not validly have been brought at all. The sole point of contention was therefore whether the Lims were legally entitled to commence the Injunction Applications in the names of the appellants. This in turn entailed ascertaining the exact scope of a director’s powers, residual or otherwise, upon the appointment of insolvency officeholders such as IJMs, JMs and liquidators: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[</span><span class="font-weight-bold">15]</span>.</div><div class="txt-body text-left">6 The court orders appointing the IJMs over the appellants were phrased in similar terms and conferred upon the IJMs the general powers and entitlements of a JM under the Companies Act (Cap 50, 2006 Rev Ed) (“the Act”). The latter in turn included the exclusive power to bring or defend any action or other legal proceedings in name and on behalf of the appellants, pursuant to ss 227G(2)–(4) read with the Eleventh Schedule of the Act. The Court of Appeal agreed with the Judge that the contention by the Lims that they had power as directors of the appellants to commence and maintain the Injunction Applications, notwithstanding the lack of any sanction by the IJMs or the JMs, was a non-starter as long as the appellants were under judicial management. The position was also similar in the context of an order placing a company in liquidation and the consequent appointment of liquidators: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[</span><span class="font-weight-bold">19]–[26]</span>.</div><div class="txt-body text-left">7 The Court of Appeal rejected the Lims’ argument that residual powers that continued to be vested in them as directors of the appellants allowed them to procure the commencement of the Injunction Applications. The English and Malaysian authorities pointed to by the appellants merely stood for the proposition that following the making of an order appointing an IJM, JM, provisional liquidator or liquidator, the directors only retained such “residual powers” which the insolvency office-bearer did not or could not assume under the applicable legislation or order of court. Furthermore, such residual powers as the directors might have to challenge a judicial management order should only be available when the original application had been made by a creditor. Bearing in mind that a judicial management order could only be made at the instance of the company itself acting in accordance with the resolutions of the board or the shareholders or upon the application of a creditor, it would be incongruous to allow the directors power to challenge their own actions or those of the shareholders: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[</span><span class="font-weight-bold">28]–[56]</span>.</div><div class="txt-body text-left">8 The Court of Appeal rejected the argument that the residual powers of a director applied to all proceedings which were such that it would not be appropriate for the liquidator to give instructions on behalf of the company. This assertion was without authority, and would effectively outflank and upend the purpose of the legislative scheme for judicial management and liquidation. The Lims’ submission that by seeking to injunct the respondent from acting, they were implicating only the power to restrain solicitors but not the liquidators’ powers to retain solicitors was not based on any legal principle. Finally, their submission that the court would retain oversight over the conduct of JMs or liquidators as well as their solicitors if directors retained such a residual power did nothing to address the authorities which had ruled on the limits of the power, and the status of solicitors as officers of the court already meant that the court had oversight over their conduct: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[</span><span class="font-weight-bold">58]–[61]</span>.</div><div class="txt-body text-left">9 The cases therefore established that upon a court order placing a company under judicial management or liquidation, with insolvency representatives being appointed concomitantly over the company, a company’s directors retained residual powers in the limited situation where a company sought to appeal against or otherwise challenge the very order appointing the JMs or liquidators, and must therefore act through its directors. This residual power was necessarily of a narrow scope, to be invoked in very specific situations. The present case did not come within this exception: the Injunction Applications did not challenge the juridical basis of the IJMs’, JMs’ and liquidators’ powers. The Injunction Applications were accordingly correctly struck out: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[</span><span class="font-weight-bold">62]–[64]</span>.</div><div class="txt-body text-left">10 The Court of Appeal held that it would be just for the Lims to bear the costs of the appeals personally. The Injunction Applications ought not to have been brought in the names of the appellants in the first place. The Lims had a close connection to the Injunction Applications and the appeals, and there was a direct nexus between their commencement of the Injunction Applications in the names of the appellants and the incurring of costs by the respondent, which had to resist the Applications: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[</span><span class="font-weight-bold">65]–[69]</span>.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center"></div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center"><span class="font-italic">This summary is provided to assist in the understanding of the Court’s grounds of decision.
