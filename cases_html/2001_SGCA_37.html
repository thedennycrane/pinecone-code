<strong>JUDGMENT:</strong>
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><strong><font color="#804040" face="Times New Roman" size="3">Grounds of Judgment</font></strong></p>
<font face="Times New Roman" xmlns="">
<p align="justify">1.    The appellant, who was an employee of the respondents since

January 1994, sustained personal injuries in the course of his work on 15 May 1998 and brought an

action to claim damages from his employers, the respondents, for a breach of duty. The learned trial

judge found that the injuries were caused by the work carried out on that day by the appellant on

the instruction of the respondents. However, the trial judge also found that the appellant had

contributed to the injuries sustained to the extent of 60% and thus reduced the quantum of damages

which the appellant was entitled to by the same proportion. As agreed at the commencement of the

trial, assessment of damages was to be undertaken later by the Registrar. Being dissatisfied with

the determination that he was contributorily negligent, the appellant appealed. At the conclusion of

the hearing of the appeal, we set aside the finding of contributory negligence and held that the

respondents were 100% liable for the injuries. We now give our reasons.</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">The facts</p>
</b>
<p align="justify">2.    The appellant, aged 33 at the time of the incident, was

employed as an Assembly Mechanic with the respondents, who were in the business of, inter alia,

manufacturing and repairing oilfield and gas field machinery equipment. The appellant started work

with the respondents in January 1994 as a General Helper. The equipment included heavy and long

pipes and connector forgings ("connectors"), which were metal rings used to connect the

ends of metal pipes. Each connector weighed about 45 kilograms.</p>
<p align="justify">3.    On 15 May 1998, the appellant, together with one other

worker, Raman, was instructed to stack and move connectors which were then lying at the respondents

yard at No 3, Tuas Avenue. He started work that day at 8.00am. He was instructed by the respondents

Operations Manager, Mr Doug Harrison, to load the connectors onto pallets, up to five levels high.

The connectors were separated at each level by a wooden plank. When each pallet was fully stacked,

it was to be moved away by the use of a fork-lift.</p>
<p align="justify">4.    On that day, there was considerable urgency in getting the

connectors removed to other designated places as the space in the yard on which the connectors were

then placed was needed to receive and store a huge quantity of long pipes which were scheduled to

arrive by trucks the next morning, at about 11.00am, from the Port of Singapore under police escort.

Thus the removal of the connectors had to be completed before the long pipes arrived. As the trial

judge found "all possible delays had to be avoided, as the trucking out times and their

arrivals were all pre-arranged; no changes could be made without a lot of trouble and

inconvenience."</p>
<p align="justify">5.    At about 10.00am that day, having noted that the pace of

stacking of the connectors by the appellant and Raman were not as rapid as Mr Harrison had wished,

he brought two other workers to help them. Still later, upon returning to the site at about 2.30pm,

he noticed that only about half the quantity of connectors had been stacked and he also noticed that

they had used the forklift to stack the connectors onto the pallets. As the process of using the

forklift to stack the connectors was slow, he asked them to lift and stack the connectors manually.

Realising then that there were only 2 hours left before knock-off time for the workers, Mr

Harrison set an example himself by getting into the act and helping in the stacking.</p>
<p align="justify">6.    The trial judge found that the workers, upon seeing Mr

Harrison "putting his shoulder to the plough", understandably exerted themselves far more

than they would have done otherwise. They tried to keep up with Mr Harrisons rate of stacking.

The work was eventually done. But what is important to note is that Mr Harrison is a much larger and

stronger person, with a height of 6 feet 4 inches. The other workers, including the appellant, did

not have this kind of physique.</p>
<p align="justify">7.    It is clear that the work of stacking the connectors was a

heavy one as it involved lifting them onto the pallets. There was evidence that all the workers,

including the appellant, were instructed on how to go about stacking the connectors  to bend

their knees, instead of their back, when lifting the connectors. Nevertheless, the trial judge found

that the respondents did not have in place a safe system of work in an emergency such as this, where

a deadline had to be met. He said:-</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">Knowing that the pipes were arriving, more workers could have been employed to

  clear, stack and palletise the connectors. They should have started earlier and the heavy work

  could have been done without unduly straining the back of the workers. When a worker was rushed,

  he was prone to short circuit the process of bending his knees and lifting the connectors. If more

  workers had been deployed, then Mr Harrison could have insisted that two workers lift each

  connector and stack them, especially stacking them at the 4<sup>th</sup> and 5<sup>th</sup> level,

  which inevitably strained the backs of the workers.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">8.    On the next day, 16 May 1998, Mr Harrison offered the

workers, including the appellant, overtime work relating to the unloading and stacking of the 60

feet long pipes. Although the appellant was, because of the previous days strenuous work,

suffering a severe backache, he nevertheless volunteered because he was needed to drive the larger

forklift.</p>
<p align="justify">9.    The trial judge accepted the medical evidence adduced that

the appellant suffered a prolapse of the disc on 15 May 1998 as a result of having to stack the

heavy connectors under extreme pressure of time.</p>
<p align="justify">10.    Having come to the conclusion that in the circumstances the

respondents had failed to provide a safe system of work, the trial judge nevertheless held the

appellant to be contributorily negligent and was 60% to be blamed. His reasons were:-</p>
<p align="justify">11.    However, the (appellant) should not have tried so hard and

so long. His overtime work, driving the forklift exacerbated his prolapse, and he should have

stopped. Nobody forced him to work, though he must have felt some pressure in view of the urgency

and the shortage of manpower.</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">The appeal</p>
</b>
<p align="justify">12.    On this appeal, the appellant raised two main points.

First, the trial judge was wrong to have found the appellant contributorily negligent, when the

respondents had not pleaded contributory negligence in their defence. Second, even if it was correct

for the court to have held that the appellant was guilty of contributory negligence, the trial judge

erred in apportioning 60% of the blame onto the appellant.</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Question of pleading</p>
</b>
<p align="justify">13.    We will commence the consideration of this question by

first examining the pleadings. In the statements of facts, after reciting the facts, the appellant

alleged that the injuries were caused by a breach of the statutory duties imposed on the respondents

under the Factories Act. In the alternative, the appellant alleged that the respondents, as

employers, had failed to take reasonable care for the safety of the appellant. Among the particulars

of negligence pleaded were:-</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">(b) Failing to provide any or any adequate precautions for the safety of the

  Plaintiff when he was engaged upon the said work;</p>
<p align="justify">(c) Failing to provide any or any adequate measures to prevent workers from

  being injured when carrying heavy objects;</p>
<p align="justify">(g) Failing to provide and maintain a safe system of work.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">13.    In their defence filed, the respondents alleged that the

appellant had been manually lifting the connectors to pallets since he was first employed. The

respondents denied any breach of the statutory duties under the Factories Act. They also denied any

common law negligence. This was all that they averred:-</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">The defendants say that it had provided training and demonstration to all its

  workers to use their legs strength rather than this back which lifting forging connectors on to

  pallets. In the course of work Mr Dong Harrison personally lifted connector forgings using the

  safe method as a reminder to all workers to use such safe method.</p>
<p align="justify">The defendants say that the Plaintiffs injury was grounded upon a

  degeneration of the Plaintiffs lumbar discs (L1, L2, L4 and L5) which is a natural process.

  Such a degeneration of the lumbar discs made it pone to prolapse by any sudden exertion to the

  back such as bending to pick up moderately heavy objects either during work or outside the

  work-place. Save that the Plaintiff was engaged in manual work up to 19 May 1998 the defendants

  deny that the manual work was the cause of the (appellants) injury.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">14.    In common law, contributory negligence had no place. A

plaintiffs case would be dismissed if it was caused, in part, by his own negligence. The rigours

of the common law were eventually mollified by the English Law Reform (Contributory Negligence) Act

1945, the precursor of s 3(1) of the Contributory Negligence and Personal Injuries Act (Cap 54),

under which the court is given the power to apportion liability between the tortfeasor and the

victim where it is shown that the victim is partly responsible for the injury or loss.</p>
<p align="justify">15.    Order 18 r 8(1) of the Rules of Court prescribes what

should be pleaded and it reads </p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">8  (1) A party must in any pleading subsequent to a statement of claim plead

  specifically any matter, for example, performance, release, any relevant statute of limitation,

  fraud or any fact showing illegality </p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">(a) which he alleges makes any claim or defence of the opposite party not

    maintainable;</p>
<p align="justify">(b) which, if not specifically pleaded, might take the opposite party by

    surprise; or</p>
<p align="justify">(c) which raises issues of fact not arising out of the preceding pleading.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">16.    <i>In Drinkwater &amp; Anor v Kimber </i>[1952] 21 QB 281,

Singleton LJ said that the section in the 1945 Act did not create a right of action; it only removed

an obstacle. In <i>Nance v British Columbia Electric Rly Co Ltd</i> [1951] AC 601 at 611 Lord Simon

referred to "contributory negligence" as a defence.</p>
<p align="justify">17.    A case which seems to be on point is <i>Fookes v Slaytor</i>

[1979] 1 All ER 137. There, the plaintiff, who suffered injuries as a result of a highway accident,

sued the driver of the other vehicle. The defendant failed to file any defence and did not attend

the trial. The County Court judge found the plaintiff one-third to blame and reduced the damages

awarded accordingly. On appeal, the Court of Appeal held that the defence of contributory negligence

was only available if it was pleaded. In the absence of such a plea, the judge had no jurisdiction

to make a finding of such negligence on the part of the plaintiff. Sir David Cairns, who delivered

the leading judgment of the court, said:-</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">The opposite view [i.e. that contributory negligence need not be pleaded] would

  mean that a plaintiff in any case where contributory negligence might possibly arise, even though

  it was not pleaded, would have to come to court armed with evidence that might be available to him

  to rebut any allegation of contributory negligence raised at trial. It is true that in the

  ordinary case it would not be likely to involve anything beyond the evidence he would be giving to

  establish negligence on the part of the defendant, but circumstances are reasonably conceivable in

  which it might be.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">18.    In the Supreme Court Practice 1999, the learned authors,

relying on the authority of <i>Fookes v Slaytor,</i> state (at 18/8/9):-</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">Contributory negligence must be specifically pleaded by way of defence to a

  plaintiffs claim for negligence, and in the absence of such a plea, the trial judge is not

  entitled to find that the plaintiffs negligence had contributed to the accident.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">19.    We have set out in 13 above, the defence of the

respondents. Essentially two points were made. First, the appellant, like the other workers, were

properly instructed as to how they should lift the connectors to stack them. Second, the injury was

brought about by a degeneration of the appellants lumber disc rather than by the manual work he

was required to do. As an allegation of contributory negligence is a defence, it should have been

pleaded and particulars in support thereof given. While we would not go so far as to say that unless

the term "contributory negligence" is expressly mentioned in the pleadings, that defence

will not be given consideration by this court, the facts pleaded must be sufficiently clear that the

defendant is alleging that the plaintiff is responsible, at least in part, for the injuries which

gave rise to the action. The very object of pleadings is to enable both parties to come to court

prepared to answer what the other side alleged. The parties are not expected to come prepared for

possible issues. No party should be allowed to take the other by surprise.</p>
<p align="justify">20.    In the present case, not only had the respondents failed to

plead contributory negligence on the part of the appellant, no facts were even alleged which could

constitute contributory negligence. The basis upon which the court below found the appellant to be

contributorily negligent was that he voluntarily accepted overtime work which aggravated the injury.

This fact was not pleaded by the respondents as a basis for contributory negligence. The respondents

were in possession of records which showed that the appellant worked overtime on 16 May 1998. They

knew he worked the next day. But unless this fact was pleaded, there was no way the appellant could

prepare himself to answer it adequately. Accordingly, in our judgment, the judge below was not

entitled to find that the appellant was contributorily negligent.</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Judgment</p>
</b>
<p align="justify">21.    In the premises, we allowed the appeal and held that the

respondents were 100% liable and should bear the full costs, here and below. The security for costs

(with any accrued interest) shall be refunded to the appellant.</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Question of apportionment of blame</p>
</b>
<p align="justify">22.    However, we would like to mention in passing that, even if

the pleading point had not been taken up by the appellant, we would have allowed the appeal on the

ground that the apportionment of liability determined by the court below was plainly erroneous. On

the finding of the court below, the appellant was held 60% to blame because he agreed to accept

overtime work. But the learned judge below recognised that, to an extent, he accepted it because of

a sense of responsibility when he himself said the appellant "must have felt some pressure in

view of the urgency and the shortage of manpower."</p>
<p align="justify">23.    The court below found the respondents negligent for failing

to provide a safe system of work. The fault of the appellant was in accepting the overtime work when

he had experienced pain the day before in rushing, together with the other workers, to stack and

remove the connectors from the yard. While we recognised that the money he would earn in doing

overtime work no doubt played a part in his final decision, the judge also recognised that his sense

of responsibility also played a part in that decision to accept overtime work. In these

circumstances, it was our view that the degree of blameworthiness which could be attributed to the

appellant was really minimal. The overtime work involved driving a larger forklift and did not

involve the lifting of heavy objects like the connectors.</p>
