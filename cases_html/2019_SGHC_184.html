This submission was misconceived as it betrayed a misunderstanding of how cl 2 of the Power of Attorney was meant to operate. That clause reads:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">2. To enter into any negotiations and to appoint brokers, valuers, auctioneers, solicitors and other agents to act on the Land Owner’s behalf in all matters arising out of or in connection with the transfer, sale, lease, mortgage, charge, management and upkeep of [the Property] or any of the powers herein granted.<span class="font-italic"> </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">11 The defendant also suggested that because cl 2 stated that the valuer was to act on the Land Owner’s behalf – in this case, the defendant – it cannot include a power which was exercised contrary to his wishes, such as by forcing him to yield access and/or vacant possession.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">12 A plain reading of cl 2 shows that the donee is empowered to appoint various agents to act on the donor’s behalf “<span class="font-italic">in all matters arising out of or in connection with</span>” the sale of the property. A valuer duly appointed by the donee will have those powers under the Power of Attorney. The phrase “all matters arising out of or in connection with” is, in my view, sufficiently broad to permit the valuer to gain access to the Property in order to perform the valuation exercise. Having granted the donee the power to appoint the valuer to act on his behalf in connection with the sale of the Property, it does not lie in the mouth of the donor to deny the valuer access to the Property to frustrate the sale.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">13 The defendant also argued that the Power of Attorney was to be read together with the Loan Agreement, and that the Power of Attorney was so wide in nature that it did not mirror the terms of the Loan Agreement. Although this argument was not easy to follow, I understood the defendant to be saying that the plaintiff was not entitled to carry out a valuation exercise because of the effect produced when cll 5.6 and 5.7 of the Loan Agreement are read together, <span class="font-italic">i</span><span class="font-italic">e</span>, that the plaintiff was <span class="font-italic">obliged </span>to purchase the Property at the “Agreed Property Price” of S$2,040,000 and therefore could not elect to sell it on the open market to a third party at some other price other than the Agreed Property Price.

The clause reads:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">7.5 Singaravelu Murugan further agrees and confirms that in an Event of Default:-</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(ii) where the Lender has elected not to exercise the OTP, the Attorney will be exercising his/her powers under the POA to sell and transfer the Property to third parties to realise the sale proceeds to repay the Loan or such part thereof that is outstanding and pay all monies due and/or payable to the Lender under this Agreement …</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">15 The effect of the above clause was clearly to provide the Lender, Xingang, with a choice: it could either elect to exercise the OTP and purchase the Property from the defendant at the Agreed Property Price of S$2,040,000, or the plaintiff could exercise his powers under the Power of Attorney to sell the Property to a third party at market price.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">16 The defendant’s final substantive argument was that the Loan Agreement and the Power of Attorney contained no specific term stipulating what would happen to the rest of the sale proceeds once the Property was sold. For this reason, the Power of Attorney was suggested to be too “vague and wide” and should therefore not be enforced. I failed to see the merit to this argument as cl 7.5(ii) plainly stated that the sale proceeds that was received by a third party buyer was only to “repay the Loan …that is outstanding” and to “pay all monies due and/or payable to the Lender”. The donee does not have the power to deal with the remaining sums of money after the loaned sums have been recovered and would therefore have to render an account of the balance to the defendant.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">17 In the premises, I granted an order in terms and ordered the defendant to pay costs to the plaintiff fixed at $15,000.</div><div class="Judg-Sign text-left">Lee Seiu Kin<br/>Judge</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Lim Tong Chuan and Pang Haoyu Samuel (Aquinas Law Alliance LLP) for the plaintiff;<br/>Cheryl Tan (Fernandez LLC) for the defendant.<br/></div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div><div class="Judg-Quote-List text-justify"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
