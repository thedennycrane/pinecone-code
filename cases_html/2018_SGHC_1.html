</div> Zainal only ordered 200 cartons of contraband cigarettes from Samba for S$8,000. Samba told him that Rahmat would deliver 20 cartons first and the remainder would be delivered at another time. After Zainal had passed Rahmat S$8,000, Rahmat had just replied “kejap” or “wait for a while” and then left, leaving the Bag at the staircase in IKEA. Zainal first left the Bag there, thinking that Rahmat would return to claim the Bag but when Rahmat did not do so after some time of waiting, Zainal then picked it up and placed it in IKEA’s warehouse. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 The presumption under s 18(1) of the MDA was rebutted because Zainal did not know that the Bag contained the Drugs. There was no evidence that Zainal knew anyone named Kanna or Bai, and these names were not saved in Zainal’s handphone, as per the handphone records. Zainal’s version was supported by the fact that his records did show that he had tried to call a man known as “Samba”, from whom he had ordered the contraband cigarettes. Rahmat himself admitted that he did not mention Bai to Zainal. Rahmat had also admitted that he had never said to Zainal what was in the Bag, nor that Bai had told him to deliver the Bag to Zainal. There was no reason why Zainal, if he had known that the Bag contained items meant for him, would not have taken it from Rahmat despite having the opportunity to do so on a number of occasions. Zainal’s putting of the Bag behind the pallets showed that he did not know it contained drugs. Had he actually known, he would have hidden it in the locker where it would be safer. One of these lockers was completely empty. Zainal was also in possession of the Bag for just a few moments such that he could not have known that the Bag concealed drugs underneath the Towel.

There was no evidence that when Zainal met Rahmat, Zainal knew that the Bag contained three packets of heroin.

Moreover, the Drugs could not be seen as there was a dark cloth in the Bag concealing the items below.

In this regard, there are a number of ways to prove the act of trafficking: see s 2 of the MDA ([29] above).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 In the present case, both the Defendants did not dispute the identity of the Drugs found in the Bundles – the drug analysis, chain of custody, and integrity of the process were all not challenged. As for Rahmat, since he admitted to driving the Car into Singapore with the Bag, possession of the Drugs by him was not in issue by virtue of s 18(1) of the MDA. As for Zainal, he disputed possession of the Drugs. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 Both Defendants primarily disputed that they had knowledge that the Bag contained diamorphine. The Prosecution invoked s 18(2) of the MDA, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, an accused is presumed to have known the nature of the drugs he possessed. As a result, the burden lay on the Defendants to show, on a balance of probabilities, that they did not in fact have knowledge of the nature of the Drugs. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 I will now turn to consider the case against each of the Defendants, separately.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Case against Rahmat</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 Physical possession of the Drugs was made out against Rahmat, and was not in issue. In any event, the presumption of possession under s 18(1) of the MDA would have applied. The Bag was in his possession, and continued to be so, with the Drugs inside the Bag, until he left it on the staircase at IKEA. There was nothing to show any break in his physical possession of the Drugs, and no such argument was put forward.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 As noted above, the primary defence in Rahmat’s case was not that he did not know that the Drugs were there. He had checked the Bag he was carrying, and simply did not know that the items he saw were controlled drugs. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 After considering the evidence and the parties’ submission, I found that Rahmat had actual knowledge that the Bag contained diamorphine. The Prosecution invoked the presumption of knowledge under s 18(2) of the MDA. I found that the evidence proved actual knowledge, including wilful blindness. In any event, the evidence also led to the conclusion that the s 18(2) presumption was not rebutted. I will consider first the presumption under s 18(2) of the MDA as my findings of actual knowledge and wilful blindness are buttressed by my findings on the presumption. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Section 18(2) presumption </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 As referenced above, s 18(2) of the MDA provides for a presumption of knowledge of the nature of the drug:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Any person who is proved or presumed to have had a controlled drug in his possession shall, until the contrary is proved, be presumed to have known the nature of that drug.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 Where the presumption under s 18(2) applies, this has to be rebutted by the accused on the balance of probabilities: see <span class="font-italic">Muhammad </span><span class="font-italic">Ridzuan </span>at [75] and <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor</span><span class="font-italic"> v Ilechukwu Uchechukwu Chukwudi </span>[2015] SGCA 33 (“<span class="font-italic">Ilechukwu</span>”) at [30].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 A rebuttal may be established if the accused shows that “he did not know or could not reasonably be expected to have known the nature of the controlled drug”: see <span class="font-italic">Dinesh Pillai a/l K Raja </span><span class="font-italic">Retnam v Public Prosecutor </span>[2012] 2 SLR 903 at [18].

The court assesses the accused’s evidence as to his subjective knowledge by comparing it with what an ordinary, reasonable person would have known or done if placed in the same situation that the accused was in.

However, the guidance from the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Obeng</span><span class="font-italic"> Comfort</span> goes further (at [40]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Where the accused has stated what he thought he was carrying (“the purported item”), <span class="font-italic">the court will assess the veracity of </span><span class="font-italic">his assertion against the objective facts and examine his actions relating to the purported item</span>. This assessment will naturally be a highly fact-specific inquiry. For example, the court will generally consider the nature, the value and the quantity of the purported item and any reward for transporting such an item. If it is an ordinary item that is easily available in the country of receipt, the court would want to know why it was necessary for him to transport it from another country. If it is a perishable or fragile item, the court would consider whether steps were taken to preserve it or to prevent damage to it. If it is a precious item, the court would consider whether steps were taken to keep it safe from loss through theft or otherwise. If it is a dangerous item, the court would consider how the item was packed and handled. Ultimately, <span class="font-italic">what the court is concerned with is the credibility and veracity of </span><span class="font-italic">the accused’s account (ie, whether his assertion that he did not know the nature of the drugs is true). </span>This depends not only on the credibility of the accused as a witness but also on how believable his account relating to the purported item is. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added] </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 Thus, the version proffered by Rahmat must be tested against the probabilities of the situation and the objective evidence. In this regard, Rahmat relied on his relationship with the person who passed him the Bag, namely Kanna, whom he had known for about two months, and from whom he was trying to get a loan to start a goat rearing business.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(1) The relationship with Kanna</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 I did not accept Rahmat’s reliance on his relationship with Kanna to show that his version should be accepted. Rahmat maintained that he was entitled to rely on what Kanna had told him because of their relationship. He had trusted Kanna, who told him that what he was given to carry into Singapore was medicine. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 The threshold drawn in local cases was recently clarified by me in <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v </span><span class="font-italic">Saravanan Chandaram</span> [2017] SGHC 262 at [47]: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… [T]he relationship of trust must be one that is credible on the facts as alleged; where the description of the alleged relationship contains incongruities, the likely result will be that the version proffered by the accused will be rejected and the presumption will remain unrebutted. But where the description of the relationship is coherent, credible and there is nothing to cast doubt on what is testified, the court will conclude that there is sufficient support for the accused’s version and that the presumption has been rebutted on the balance of probabilities. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 In the present case, there was insufficient basis for Rahmat to trust Kanna because of the brevity of the relationship between them. The limited nature of the relationship is also of note. Rahmat had only come to know Kanna at a massage parlour, where sexual services were provided.

Rahmat testified that he had considered going into the business of goat rearing, and needed a RM30,000 loan from Kanna. This delivery of the Bag was intended to be the basis for the loan. It was hard to believe that any delivery of medicine on such a small scale, as Rahmat contended (which would have been a legitimate and lawful delivery) could be part of a process that would lead one to obtain such a substantial loan. This went to the strength of the veracity of Rahmat’s version, and would have to be weighed with all the other evidence against that version.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 I do accept though that a brief relationship does not invariably mean that an accused person would have no reasonable basis to trust another<span class="font-italic">. </span>In <span class="font-italic">Harven</span>, an explanation by the accused there of the circumstances leading to the finding of drugs on him was founded on a short relationship with a colleague that lasted three weeks.

</div> Presumably, this meant that he was more composed.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 I could not accept Rahmat’s explanation for the discrepancies between his version at trial and his statements. It defied belief that Rahmat experienced such shock stemming from his concern for his family that he could not give an accurate statement. While it would be understandable for Rahmat to be tired or concerned about his family, neither reason could account for the different explanations he gave. Certainly, although errors or omissions about minute details are to be expected, one could reasonably expect him to accurately convey what he had thought was in the Bag and whether he had checked its contents. The importance of these matters would have been apparent to anyone. Furthermore, there is a vast difference between medicine and food crackers; it takes only a cursory glance to tell the two apart. In the circumstances, I could not accept that he was under such shock that he could not give an accurate statement and against that context, the version subsequently given by him to Dr Yeo could not be accepted as the truth.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 Rahmat’s counsel argued that any finding of shock would be dependent on medical evidence. But this was beside the point. The question was, what was Rahmat’s state of mind at the material time? And as the presumption operated, it was for Rahmat to adduce sufficient evidence to establish his lack of knowledge on the balance of probabilities. On this issue, for the reasons canvassed above, I found that Rahmat failed to rebut the presumption.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 In any event, even if the statements were to be disregarded, his testimony in court could not lead to the rebuttal of the presumption. On a balance of probabilities, they could not outweigh the issues raised by the complete absence of a reason to trust Kanna in the short space of time that they had known each other (see [45]–[49] above).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 At this juncture, I ought to point out that the Prosecution relied on several lies by Rahmat in his statements as corroborating his guilt.

Second, they must relate to a material issue. Third, they were made out of a realisation of guilt and fear of the truth. Fourth, the statement must be shown to be a lie by independent evidence. All the lies relied upon by the Prosecution failed one or more of these requirements. In particular, there was little by way of independent evidence, as the findings were primarily on credibility and consistency.   </div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(3) Conclusion on the rebuttal of the presumption</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 For these reasons, I found that Rahmat failed to rebut the presumption of knowledge of the nature of the Drugs under s 18(2) of the MDA. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Actual knowledge </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 The above reasons for finding that Rahmat failed to rebut the s 18(2) presumption also independently gave rise to the conclusion that actual knowledge was made out.

At trial, Rahmat claimed that he had seen the Bag and felt the contents. Even if that were the case, he ought to have checked the Bag further given the surrounding circumstances (<span class="font-italic">eg</span>, his shallow relationship with Kanna and the amount of money he was given).

</div> Reading PW4’s conditioned statement as a whole, it was clear that PW4 was not personally stationed at the taxi stand at the time and would therefore have been in no position to answer the question of what “looking suspicious” meant. Given that these were not the words of PW4, Rahmat’s counsel erred in getting PW4 to explain what he meant by those words. It was unsurprising that PW4 could not explain what it meant. Regarding the similarities in the words used in the conditioned statement, this was again unsurprising given that these arresting officers were merely stating what they had heard from SSgt Goh through the communications channel. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 Rahmat also took issue with the interpreter, PW9, and pointed out a list of mistakes in PW9’s conditioned statements.

</div> there were phone and immigration records, which showed that Rahmat and Zainal were in contact on at least three prior occasions before 27 May 2015. Coincidentally, there were also corresponding immigration records showing that Rahmat had entered Singapore on those exact same dates. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">74 The fact that there were past transactions would have pointed against Rahmat’s supposed lack of knowledge about the Drugs, and contradicted his version that he had only met Zainal on the day the transaction in question took place. However, while I found against Rahmat on this point, this could be considered as similar fact evidence that is prejudicial to Rahmat, although this was not argued as such). I thus did not consider this in weighing either the rebuttal of the presumption, or the existence of actual knowledge or wilful blindness. There was other evidence, sufficiently pointing against either a rebuttal of the presumption or that clearly pointed towards actual knowledge and wilful blindness.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Trafficking of the Drugs</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">75 Rahmat left the Bag with the Drugs on the staircase at IKEA, intending for the Bag to be taken by Zainal. That meant that there was transfer of possession, by way of giving, and thus trafficking for under s 2 of the MDA.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Conclusion as to Rahmat’s culpability</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">76 For the above reasons, I was satisfied that the offence of trafficking in controlled drugs under s 5(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the MDA was made out as against Rahmat. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Case against Zainal</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">77 I was satisfied that the case against Zainal was made out as he had physical possession of the Drugs. He was also either presumed to know the nature of the Drugs, or actually knew, or was wilfully blind that what he had was heroin. It was also proven that he had the Drugs in his possession for the purpose of trafficking because of the large quantity involved. Alternatively, the presumption of possession for the purpose of trafficking under s 17(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the MDA operated against him. That presumption was not rebutted.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Possession</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">78 I was satisfied that actual possession was established as Zainal was in control of the Bag containing the Drugs. It was immaterial that the Drugs were not on his person at the time of his arrest. In my judgment, as long as a controlled drug is within a person’s control, he is in possession of it even if it is not on his person. On the facts, Zainal had hidden the Bag near his work area at IKEA. The act of hiding indicates control over the Drugs, and such control is what matters for the element of possession to be made out. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">79 The requirement of physical control was noted by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Sim Teck Ho v </span><span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor </span>[2000] 2 SLR(R) 959, which bears quoting in some length due to the parallels to the present facts of hiding the Drugs:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">11 The key issue in this appeal was whether the trial judge was right in finding that the appellant was in possession of the diamorphine contained in the bag. Numerous cases have established that possession encompasses the element of physical control as well as an element of knowledge. For example, in <span class="font-italic">Fun </span><span class="font-italic">Seong Cheng v PP</span> [1997] 2 SLR(R) 796, it was said (at [53]–[54]) by M Karthigesu JA, in delivering the judgment of the Court of Appeal:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… Clearly in order to prove that the appellant was in possession, he must have physical control over the drugs. It is a matter of fact whether someone has physical control over an item. …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Physical control is not enough for the purpose of proving possession. There needs to be <span class="font-italic">mens</span><span class="font-italic"> rea </span>on the part of the accused. …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">12  Karthigesu JA went on [to] cite a portion of Lord Pearce’s judgment in Warner<span class="font-italic"> v Metropolitan Police Commissioner</span> [1969] 2 AC 256, a decision of the House of Lords which involved the meaning of “possession” for the purpose of s 1 of the Drugs (Prevention of Misuse) Act 1964. Lord Pearce’s <span class="font-italic">dicta</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>had been cited <span class="font-italic">in </span><span class="font-italic">extenso</span> with approval by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Tan Ah Tee v PP</span> [1979–1980] SLR(R) 311. Wee Chong Jin CJ in delivering the judgment of the court, said that the word “possession” for the purpose of the Act should be construed as Lord Pearce had construed it. His Lordship had said in Warner:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">One may, therefore, exclude from the “possession” intended by the Act the physical control of articles which have been “planted” on him without his knowledge. But how much further is one to go? If one goes to the extreme length of requiring the prosecution to prove that “possession” implies a full knowledge of the name and nature of the drug concerned, the efficacy of the Act is seriously impaired, since many drug pedlars may in truth be unaware of this. I think that the term ‘possession’ is satisfied by a knowledge only of the existence of the thing itself and not its qualities, and that ignorance or mistake as to its qualities is not an excuse.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">13  Therefore, in order to prove possession, the Prosecution must prove that there is first, physical control over the controlled drug, and second, knowledge of the existence of the thing itself, that is the existence of the controlled drug, but not the name nor nature of the drug.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Physical control</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">14  The appeal contested the trial judge’s finding that these two elements of possession were satisfied. In respect of physical control, the appellant argued that the trial judge erred in failing to give due weight to the fact that the appellant did not have exclusive possession of the flat and that there were visitors who went to play mahjong at the flat who could have entered the storeroom. We had several difficulties with this argument.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">15  First, based on the evidence of the appellant, from the time he kept the bag in the storeroom at about 11.00pm to 12.00pm on 9 November 1999 till the time of the raid at about 1.00pm on 11 November 1999, the only period in which the appellant was out of the house was on 10 November from about 4.00pm when he went to work at the hawker stall till 11.00pm of the same day when he returned home. There was however no evidence of a mahjong session during this period of time. Mdm Tan in her testimony said that she would invite her neighbours to her house once or twice a week to play mahjong. The appellant’s brother, Hai Huat, in his testimony, said that his mother’s friends would come once or twice a week, on Sunday, and at times also on weekdays. He was unable to remember if he had seen his mother’s mahjong friends, and neither did he ask nor was told if her friends had come to the flat on the crucial Wednesday afternoon of 10 November 1999 to play mahjong. There was, in short, merely speculation that there might have been visitors, but no evidence of it.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">16  Second, Mdm Tan’s mahjong friends were lady neighbours in their 60s or 70s who resided in the same block. Even if there was a mahjong session on the afternoon of 10 November 1999, no reason was suggested as to why these ladies would want to plant drugs in their neighbour’s storeroom.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">17  Third, even if someone did plant drugs in the storeroom, it would have been extremely coincidental that the drugs were planted in the Watson’s plastic bag that the appellant’s former prison inmate had passed to him for safekeeping.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">18  <span class="font-italic">The only persons who clearly had access to the storeroom were the family members of the appellant. The appellant had </span><span class="font-italic">however, chosen the storeroom precisely because in his view, none of the other family members went there. Moreover, it was not the appellant’s case that the drugs were planted by a family member. In view of all these circumstances, the trial judge was justified in finding that no one, other than the appellant, entered the storeroom between 9 November 1999 and 11 November 1999, that the bag and its contents remained intact from the time it was placed in the storeroom by the appellant until the time of its discovery by the CNB officers, and that the appellant had physical control over the bag and its contents.</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added] </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">80 The same focus on control is apparent in the English decision of <span class="font-italic">W</span><span class="font-italic">arner v Metropolitan Police Commissioner </span>[1969] 2 AC 256 (“<span class="font-italic">Warner</span>”), a decision of<span class="font-italic"> </span>the House of Lords. Although <span class="font-italic">Warner </span>was concerned with the meaning of “possession” in the context of s 1 of the Drugs (Prevention of Misuse) Act 1964 (c 64) (UK), which has a different statutory regime, it has been locally endorsed by the Court of Appeal for its observations on the general concept of possession (see the Court of Appeal decisions in <span class="font-italic">Tan </span><span class="font-italic">Kiam Peng </span>at [53] and <span class="font-italic">Pham </span><span class="font-italic">Duyen Quyen v Public Prosecutor</span> [2017] SGCA 39 at [31], noting the effect of its earlier decision in <span class="font-italic">Tan Ah Tee</span><span class="font-italic"> and another v Public Prosecutor</span> [1979–1980] SLR(R) 311).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">81 In particular, Lord Wilberforce in <span class="font-italic">Warner</span> stated at 309F:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… Ideally a possessor of a thing has <span class="font-italic">complete physical control</span> over it; he has knowledge of its existence, its <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">situation</span> and its qualities: he has received it from a person who intends to confer possession of it and he has himself the intention to possess it exclusively of others. …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added in italics and bold italics] </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">82 Lord Guest also pointed to the definition in a legal dictionary as follows (<span class="font-italic">Warner</span> at 299E): </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…[T]he visible possibility of exercising physical control over a thing, coupled with the intention of doing so, either against all the world, or against all the world except certain persons. There are therefore three requisites of possession. First, there must be actual or <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">potential </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">physical control</span>... accompanied by intention… [T]he possibility and intention must be visible or evidenced by external signs, for <span class="font-italic">if </span><span class="font-italic">the thing shows no signs of being under the control of anyone, it is not possessed</span>…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added in italics and bold italics] </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">83 From these cases, it becomes clear that where a person hides an item, he still retains control over it. He retains “potential physical control” because he knows where the item is and can look for it when he wants to. In other words, using the words of Lord Wilberforce, he knows of its “existence” as well as its “situation” (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, location). Anomalous results would follow if hiding an item removes it from one’s possession. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">84 It could be argued that hiding an item results in the loss of possession, because if possession were maintained in such a situation, there would be no need for the presumptions under the MDA, such as s 18(1). However, those are situations where the presumptions are needed to resolve any ambiguities about the extent of an accused person’s control. But here, Zainal himself testified that he had put the Bag behind a stack of pallets containing goods from IKEA. There was no ambiguity and therefore no need to resort to the presumption.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">85 On the facts, Zainal manifested an intention to control the Bag. He had not put it out in the open in a public place, but behind some pallets in an office area. There was no intention to abandon by, for example,<span class="font-italic"> </span>throwing it away in a bin. The clear inference was that Zainal intended to return to the Bag at some point. In the meantime, it was not put in anyone else’s control either. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">86 In any event, even if I were wrong in finding actual physical possession, s 18(1) of the MDA would apply against him. This provision reads as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Presumption of possession and knowledge of controlled drugs</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">18.</span>—(1) Any person who is proved to have had in his possession or custody or under his control —</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) anything containing a controlled drug;</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">shall, until the contrary is proved, be presumed to have had that drug in his possession.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">87 The Bag was in Zainal’s possession, and that possession was not relinquished.

It would not suffice for the accused to claim simply that he did not know what he was carrying save that he did not know or think it was drugs. If such a simplistic claim could rebut the presumption in s 18(2), the presumption would be all bark and no bite. Similarly, he would not be able to rebut the presumption as to knowledge by merely claiming that he did not know the proper name of the drug that he was asked to carry. The law also does not require him to know the scientific or the chemical name of the drug or the effects that the drug could bring about. The presumption under s 18(2) operates to vest the accused with knowledge of the nature of the drug which he is in possession of, and to rebut this, he must give an account of what he thought it was.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">I accept that <span class="font-italic">Obeng</span><span class="font-italic"> Comfort</span> requires a person found with drugs to proffer some explanation, indicating what he had thought he had with him.

</div> He was supposedly concerned with trying to figure out whether and when the cigarettes would eventually be delivered. His position was effectively a denial that he had anything to do with the Bag. But because he had the Bag in his possession, the presumption under s 18(2) of the MDA applied. It was thus incumbent upon him to put forward some explanation to show on the balance of probabilities that he did not know the nature of the Drugs. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">92 The difficulty for Zainal was that, on his case, this had to flow from his explanation that he was expecting cigarettes, and that he essentially did not have anything to do with the Bag at all. However, once he had taken the Bag into his physical possession, he should have examined the contents. His failure to do so, taken together with his own professed history of dealing in drugs – and hence knowledge about drugs – cast significant doubt on his version of events. His alleged transaction was not a legal one: he was supposedly trying to deal with contraband cigarettes. Some suspicion and caution would have been expected if that were the case. But he did not check and ascertain the Bag’s contents, and that lack of precaution undermined his case. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">93 Moreover, given that Zainal testified that he could tell from the moment he met Rahmat that Rahmat did not carry with him the 20 cartons of cigarettes,

</div> That would have been the natural and expected reaction of someone who was expecting cigarettes, and several cartons at that. According to Zainal, he led Rahmat away from the public areas at the IKEA store, to the staircase to ask him about the cigarettes. Zainal was however unable to explain why he had to wait until he arrived at the staircase to ask Rahmat about the cigarettes.

This is odd given the non-delivery of cigarettes. Given that Rahmat had left without the matter having been resolved (see [26] above), it would have been natural to examine the Bag. To my mind, that he did not do so was incredible. Zainal claimed that he had to rush back to work,

According to him, he would have done so had he been knowingly involved in a drug transaction. Zainal argued that he had waited for Rahmat to return, and left the Bag alone during that time. This however did not take Zainal’s case anywhere – there were other possible explanations for this such as his suspicion that there were law enforcement officers in the vicinity at that time. He had thus waited for the coast to clear as it were before he thought it was safe to take possession of the Bag. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">97 I also accepted the argument of the Prosecution that there was insufficient space to accommodate the 200 cartons of cigarettes that Zainal had supposedly ordered.

</div> there was no reason for Rahmat to have given false evidence in this regard. There was nothing to be gained by Rahmat. And the evidence given was not susceptible to any inaccuracy or incompleteness. It was simply a question of whether Zainal had asked Rahmat about cigarettes or not. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">105 Rahmat had mentioned in his statements that Zainal had asked him to lie that the delivery concerned 20 cartons of cigarettes whilst the duo were placed in the same van <span class="font-italic">en route</span> to court.

</div> Rahmat maintained this in court, and there was again no reason for him to lie. Rahmat had nothing to gain from this. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">106 The Prosecution also argued that Zainal probably ordered heroin on the transaction in question based on a comparison of the monies he passed to Rahmat with the sale price of heroin based on Zainal’s evidence; some effort was expended by the Prosecution to buttress this.

</div> But I found the comparison on prices entirely speculative and there was insufficient evidence to back up such a finding. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(3) Wilful blindness</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">107 The above factors also pointed to Zainal being wilfully blind as to the nature of the Drugs. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Possession for the purposes of trafficking</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">108 Possession for the purposes of trafficking was made out in view of the large quantity of diamorphine found in the Drugs. There was some 53.64g in Zainal’s possession, more than triple that of the quantity that attracted the capital punishment. Given the quantities involved and in the absence of any credible explanation from Zainal, the only conclusion that could be drawn was that the Drugs were to be transferred to someone else.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">109 The Prosecution raised Zainal’s own explanation that he had intended to transfer the Bag to Rahmat, as showing as well as that there was intention to transfer possession of the Drugs.

</div> I did not give any weight to this however, as it was clear to me that this explanation was proffered on the basis that Zainal did not know the contents of the Bag. Against that backdrop, it would not be proper to take his explanation out of that context. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">110 In addition, s 17(1) of the MDA would have been applicable in view of my findings on possession and knowledge above (which can be met without reliance on the presumptions in s 18 of the MDA). The presumption would not be rebutted for the reasons stated above: the quantities involved indicated that possession was not to end with Zainal; there was no evidence led that he was going to consume the Drugs wholly by himself. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">111 For the foregoing reasons, the Defendants were convicted of the respective charges as framed.
