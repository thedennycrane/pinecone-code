<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       The parties in Suit No 183 of 2010 and Suit
                    No 717 of 2009, posed a question of law under O 14, r 12 of the Rules
                    of Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2006 Rev Ed) to be determined on the agreed
                    facts set out below. The question of law, as amended by consent of the parties
                    and with leave of the court, reads as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Whether the Plaintiff’s causes of action in Suit No 183 of 2010
                        [or Suit No 717 of 2009] against the Defendant [or the First Defendant,
                        in the case of Suit No 717 of 2009] have been extinguished and/or barred
                        and/or precluded from being maintained consequent to the Scheme of
                        Compromise and Arrangement dated 3 July 2008 which has been duly
                        completed, performed and fulfilled according to its terms by 4 May
                        2009.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       Having heard counsels’ submissions, I
                    delivered my decision that the plaintiff’s causes of action in
                    Suit 183 of 2010 and, subject to the assumption in <a href="#p1_14">[14]</a> below, the plaintiff’s causes of action in
                    Suit 717 of 2009, respectively, against the defendant/first defendant have
                    not been extinguished and/or barred and/or precluded from being maintained
                    consequent to the Scheme of Compromise and Arrangement dated 3 July 2008
                    (“the Scheme”) which was by 4 May 2009 successfully completed
                    and terminated. I now set out the grounds for my decision on this question of
                    law on the following agreed facts.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Summons No 2768 of 2010 in Suit No 183 of 2010</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       The plaintiff in Suit No 183 of 2010
                    suffered injuries due to an industrial accident on 14 August 2007. On
                    21 September 2007, the plaintiff’s solicitors wrote to the defendant
                    (then known as “Derrick Services Singapore Pte Ltd”) to request
                    for the defendant’s industrial accident report on the full nature of the
                    accident, the plaintiff’s injuries and the scope and costs of the
                    treatments which the plaintiff had to undergo as a consequence of the
                    accident.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       On 21 November 2007, the Ministry of
                    Manpower (“MOM”) wrote to the Company to request for Azman’s
                    medical report. Azman later filed a claim under the “Workmen’s
                    Compensation Act” on 7 April 2008 (“Azman’s WCA
                    Claim”). It should be noted that the Company’s liability to Azman
                    whether under WCA or at common law was and continues to be covered by a valid
                    insurance policy taken out by the Company. Azman’s solicitors subsequently
                    wrote to the MOM on 15 March 2010 to inform it that Azman had decided to
                    pursue his claim for damages under common law and that the MOM was to hold the
                    matter in abeyance until further notice. The MOM later replied to Azman’s
                    solicitors to inform them that it considered Azman’s WCA Claim to be
                    withdrawn.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       Azman then filed a writ for breach of
                    employers’ duty and breach of statutory duty on 16 March 2010 against
                    the Company, his employer.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       Shortly after Azman first filed his WCA Claim,
                    the provisional liquidators of the Company procured an investor who pursuant to
                    an investment agreement conditional upon creditor approval of a scheme of
                    arrangement, would acquire control of the Company. The Company then issued a
                    notice to creditors of a meeting to be convened on 25 July 2008 to consider
                    the Scheme. This notice was sent to all Scheme Creditors (as that term is
                    defined in the Scheme – see below at <a href="#p1_17">[17]</a>). Azman averred that he did not receive any notice of the
                    Scheme. The Scheme’s meeting of creditors was advertised in <em>The Straits Times</em> on 3 July 2008. Azman avers that
                    he was unaware of the advertisement as he does not read the English newspapers.
                    The Scheme was duly approved by creditors attending the creditors’ meeting
                    and a notice was issued and advertised in <em>The Straits
                        Times</em> on 8 August 2008 of a court hearing on 25 August
                    2008 for court approval of the Scheme that had been approved by the creditors.
                    The court approved the Scheme on 25 August 2008 and the Scheme took effect
                    on 26 August 2008 when the Scheme and court approval were filed with the
                    Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       The Company admits that it had been notified and
                    was aware of Azman’s industrial accident prior to the approval of the
                    Scheme. It is not disputed that the Company is covered by a valid insurance
                    policy in respect of Azman’s claim.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       The Scheme provided that the cut-off date to
                    submit proofs of debt (“the Claims Cut-Off Date”) was
                    22 October 2008. Azman did not submit any proof of debt by this date or
                    thereafter. Azman did not participate in the Scheme nor did he receive any
                    payments under the Scheme. The Scheme was terminated on 4 May 2009 by the
                    Scheme’s manager (“the Scheme Manager”), upon the fulfilment
                    of all its terms. The Scheme Manager was then discharged on 11 May 2009.
                    The Company, having successfully restructured and compromised its debts, is now
                    operating unburdened by the Scheme.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Summons No 4266 of 2010 in Suit No 717 of 2009</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       The plaintiff in Suit No 717 of 2010, Shaik
                    Abu Bakar bin Abdul Sukol (“Shaik”), suffered injuries due to an
                    industrial accident on 4 February 2008. Shaik was also an employee of the
                    Company. The Company then filed a report of the accident with the MOM. The
                    report, which was filed on 11 February 2008, indicated that it was filed
                    under the “WCA Act [<em>sic</em>] [<em>ie</em>, the Workmen’s Compensation Act] only”.
                    This report indicated that Shaik was claiming for “Workmen Injury
                    Compensation” (“Shaik’s WCA Claim”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     Shortly thereafter, the Company went into
                    provisional liquidation on 24 March 2008 and it subsequently entered into
                    the Scheme (see <a href="#p1_6">[6]</a>, above). Unlike the
                    situation with Azman, Shaik had earlier notice of the creditors’ meeting.
                    Shaik had also received notification on 27 August 2008 that the court had
                    approved the Scheme and that he was to file a proof of debt.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     Shaik had also submitted original medical
                    bills to the Scheme Manager on 14 August 2008 after the meetings of the
                    creditors to consider the Scheme were held. The Scheme Manager submitted to the
                    Company’s insurance company the bills which had not been paid. The MOM
                    later issued a “notice of assessment of compensation” under the
                    “Work Injury Compensation Act” for the sum of $29,400 on
                    20 October 2008. The insurance company filed its objection to the notice of
                    assessment. Apparently, the Scheme Manager later issued a cheque for $1,235.25
                    to Shaik in “full and final settlement” of his claim on
                    9 January 2009.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     Like Azman, Shaik did not submit any proof of
                    debt by the Claims Cut-Off Date.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     Shortly before the Scheme was discharged, on
                    8 April 2009 Shaik gave notice to the MOM of his intention to proceed with
                    a claim under common law and, accordingly, he withdrew his WCA Claim. On
                    20 August 2009, Shaik commenced this suit against the first and second
                    defendants.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     Some preliminary points pertaining to
                    Shaik’s case should be noted, before I proceed further. It is worth
                    reiterating that Shaik neither submitted a proof of debt nor did he vote in the
                    creditors’ meeting. It is also worth noting that it was common ground that
                    merely making his WCA Claim does not abrogate his common law claims and that he
                    is entitled to withdraw his application and pursue his common law claims in
                    court (see <em>Ying Tai Plastic &amp; Metal Manufacturing (S) Pte
                        Ltd v Zahrin bin Rabu</em> [1983-1984] SLR(R) 212 at [25]). The final preliminary point is that the
                    legal significance of the Scheme Manager’s payment to Shaik of a cheque
                    for $1,235.25 in “full and final settlement” of his claims in
                    respect of the MOM’s assessment of the payable sum of $29,400 on his
                    common law causes of action in Suit No 717 of 2009 was not argued before
                    me. There was only a reference, without further elaboration, in Shaik’s
                    affidavit that he had received a cheque for that amount in “full and
                    final settlement of [his] claim against the [Company]”. For the purpose
                    of the question of law before me, I expressed to the parties that I would be
                    assuming for the purpose of this question of law, that the part payment by the
                    Scheme Manager did not amount to a compromise by agreement within or apart from
                    the Scheme, between the Scheme Manager or the Company and Shaik of his WCA Claim
                    and his common law causes of action. If the part payment made by the Scheme
                    Manager or the Company was in fact a “full and final settlement”
                    of Shaik’s compromised claims and common law causes of action, then he
                    would be barred from pursuing Suit No 717 of 2009 for reasons independent
                    of the question of law posed before me.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The factual setting of the question of law</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     The question of law posed on these agreed
                    facts is a novel but fundamental one which does not appear to have been
                    addressed head on. This is either because the principles of law relating to the
                    legal effect of schemes of arrangement are well settled or because the question
                    of law on the factual matrices of these claims has not hitherto been squarely
                    posed. I should begin by saying that the question of law is posed on the agreed
                    factual matrix of a successfully completed and terminated scheme. The question
                    is not posed within the context of an ongoing scheme. Now that the Scheme has
                    been successfully completed and terminated in accordance with its terms, are
                    Azman and Shaik (collectively referred to hereafter as “the
                    plaintiffs”) barred as a matter of law from instituting their claims
                    against the Company by reason of the Scheme? It is common ground that these
                    claims are not barred by any statute of limitation.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     The Company submits that the Scheme had the
                    legal effect even after the successful completion and termination of the Scheme,
                    of extinguishing the insured contingent tortious claims because the plaintiffs
                    had not filed a proof of debt as required by the Scheme document. Therefore, it
                    is argued that the Company is completely and absolutely discharged from all such
                    unproven claims as provided by clause 5.4 of the Scheme.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The relevant provisions of the Scheme</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     The relevant provisions of the Scheme document
                    are set out as follows:</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     Although the industrial accidents occurred
                    prior to the commencement of the Scheme, the plaintiffs’ writs were filed
                    in 2009 and 2010 respectively, after the successful completion and termination
                    of the Scheme. The question is whether the plaintiffs are, by reason of the
                    Scheme, now barred, after the completion and termination of the Scheme, from
                    pursuing their respective insured claims in those writs against the
                    Company.</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     The scope and procedural object of schemes of
                    arrangements or compromises are further outlined by Peter Gibson LJ in

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It has been the legislative policy for well over a century to encourage
                        compromise and arrangements between a company and its creditors or members.
                        That has been achieved by the enactment of a statutory mechanism to enable
                        the absence of consent of minority creditors or members to be overcome,
                        provided that a sufficient number of the relevant creditors or members agree
                        with the proposed compromise or arrangement and the court gives its
                        approval. If that occurs, then the dissentient minority will be bound by
                        that compromise or arrangement. That of course in the case of a creditor is
                        an encroachment on his right to be paid what he is owed in accordance with
                        the contractual terms. But the utility of the statutory mechanism is
                        particularly obvious in a case where a company is in financial difficulties
                        but can persuade most, but not all, of the relevant creditors that the
                        company’s debts should be restructured rather than that those
                        creditors should exercise their rights, including the right to put the
                        company into liquidation.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Finally, in <em>In re T &amp; N Ltd and
                        others</em> [2006] 1 WLR 1728 (“<em>In re T
                        &amp; N</em>”), David Richards J described the purposes of
                    a scheme of arrangement in the following terms (at [40]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... one of recognised purposes of section 425 [of the Companies Act
                        1985 (c 6) (UK)] is to encourage arrangements with creditors which avoid
                        liquidation and facilitate the financial rehabilitation of the company
                        …</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     The courts have given effect to the underlying
                    legislative policy of the antecedents of s 210 of the Companies Act by
                    holding that such creditor and court approved schemes of compromise or
                    arrangement bind all creditors. I should underscore that what binds the
                    creditors is the compromise or arrangement set out in the scheme. A compromise
                    or arrangement ordinarily means a variation by way of restructuring and/or
                    rescheduling of the company’s debts owed to creditors. The question here
                    is whether a scheme has the effect in law of unilaterally <em>extinguishing</em> an insured claim in totality, quite apart from
                    compromising it. A careful reading of s 210 of the Companies Act and the
                    underlying legislative policy set out in the cases cited above, reveals nothing
                    which supports the proposition that s 210 of the Companies Act by its terms
                    confers a statutory result that the scheme extinguishes an insured claim against
                    a company, after the completion and termination of a scheme. Debts or claims can
                    ordinarily only be <em>compromised</em> to the extent
                    provided and performed by the company as set out in the scheme <em>vis-à-vis</em> each individual creditor or
                claimant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     Once a scheme has been duly approved by the
                    creditors and the court, the scheme will be binding on all creditors, whether
                    proven or unproven, and the courts will not vary or amend the scheme save for
                    fraud, obvious mistakes in the scheme document and, in Singapore, our courts
                    will on occasion extend the time for an unproven creditor to prove his debt and
                    participate in the scheme (see <em>Oriental Insurance</em>
                    at [66] and [69]). A duly approved scheme may also, in principle, be amended by
                    another duly approved scheme. This guarded approach provides finality, clarity
                    and certainty for such approved schemes (see <em>Oriental
                        Insurance</em>at [66] and [69]), and facilitates corporate
                    rehabilitation.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     Where a scheme has been proposed between the
                    company and its creditors, the court is empowered under s 210(10) of the
                    Companies Act upon the application of the company or any member or creditor of
                    the company to restrain further proceedings in any action or proceeding against
                    the company except by leave of the court and subject to such terms as the court
                    imposes. What this means is that once the scheme has been approved by the court,
                    for the duration of the scheme, the status of any further court proceedings
                    against the company will be determined by the court before which such
                    proceedings were commenced, either by reason of s 210(10) of the Companies
                    Act or by reason of any moratorium against actions provided for in the scheme
                    document itself.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Are the plaintiffs “creditors” within the meaning of
                s 210(3) of the Companies Act?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     I turn next to consider the meaning of the
                    word “creditors” in s 210(3) of the Companies Act. The word
                    is not defined in the Companies Act. Courts elsewhere have adopted different
                    interpretations of the word. A summary of the relevant case law may be found in
                        <em>Pacrim Investments Pte Ltd v Tan Mui Keow Claire and
                        another</em> [2010] SGHC 134 at [24]–[31] and in
                        <em>Australian Corporation Law: Principles and
                        Practice</em> (Butterworths, Looseleaf Ed, 1991, November 2010 issue)
                    at para 5.1.0035.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     On one view, “creditors” may
                    refer to all persons who have claims which may be admitted to proof in the
                    winding up of the company (see <em>Re Glendale Land Development
                        (in liq)</em> (1982) ACLC 562 at 564; followed in <em>Re Huon Valley Springs Pty Ltd (Receivers and Managers
                        appointed)</em> (1986) 10 ACLR 883). Applying this view in the
                    context of the relevant legislation in Singapore, unliquidated tort claimants
                    such as the plaintiffs would not be “creditors” within the meaning
                    of s 210(3) of the Companies Act. This is because s 327(2) of the
                    Companies Act provides that, in the winding up of an insolvent company, the same
                    rules that prevail in relation to bankrupt persons are applicable with regard
                    to, <em>inter alia</em>, the debts that are provable.
                    Reference must then be made to the Bankruptcy Act (Cap 20, 2009 Rev Ed)
                    (“the Bankruptcy Act”) to determine whether unliquidated tort
                    claims may be provable in the winding up of an insolvent company. Section 87(1)
                    of the Bankruptcy Act provides, in effect, that such claims shall not be
                    provable:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Description of debts provable in bankruptcy</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">87. —(1) Demands in the nature of unliquidated damages arising
                            <b><em>otherwise than by reason of a contract, promise or
                            breach of trust</em></b> shall <b><em>not</em></b> be
                        provable in bankruptcy.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added in bold italics]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     Another view is that the definition of
                    “creditors” for the purpose of schemes of arrangement extends
                    beyond persons with claims provable in winding up (see <em>In re
                        T &amp; N</em> at [40]).
                    However, even if a broader view is adopted, it is not entirely clear whether a
                    person with an unliquidated claim in tort is a creditor for the purpose of a
                    scheme of arrangement. There is Australian case law to the effect that such
                    claimants are not creditors (see <em>Trocko v Renlita Products
                        Pty Ltd; The Commonwealth Trading Bank and Shepherd (Claimants)</em>
                    [1973] 5 SASR 207 at 209–210, <em>In re Waymouth
                        Guarantee and Discount Co</em> [1975] 10 SASR 407 at 457 (per
                    Walters J)). There is case law to the contrary as well (see <em>Re R L Child &amp; Co Pty Ltd</em> (1986) 10 ACLR
                    673).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     However, it was not necessary for me to reach
                    a conclusion as to whether unliquidated tort claimants, in general, are
                    “creditors” within the meaning of s 210(3) of the Companies
                    Act.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     It is appropriate that the courts adopt an
                    approach which gives the broadest scope to creditors for the purpose of
                    facilitating corporate rehabilitations. Thus an insured unliquidated tort
                    claimant may opt in to participate in a scheme, receive compromised payments
                    thereunder and be bound by the scheme. Other insured unliquidated tort claimants
                    may elect to opt out of the scheme and commence court actions against the
                    company between the period where the company has proposed scheme and right up to
                    the termination of the scheme. Claimants who opt out run the risk of any
                    moratorium that might arise either out of s 210(10) of the Companies Act or
                    from the terms of the scheme document.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     Nothing in s 210 of the Companies Act is
                    directed to address post-completion and post-scheme termination events.
                    Section 210 of the Companies Act quite naturally does not go further to
                    prescribe consequences that follow the completion and termination of schemes of
                    arrangement, it being concerned only to facilitate the corporate rehabilitation
                    process. The practical reality before me, is that the Company’s insurer is
                    the person who bears the liability to meet the unliquidated tort claims should
                    the plaintiffs succeed. It would not serve any statutory purpose of
                    s 210(3) of the Companies Act, which is to facilitate rehabilitation of
                    companies in financial difficulty, and neither is there any language in
                    s 210(3) of the Companies Act which provides any basis to conclude that a
                    scheme may statutorily extinguish the insured claims of persons such as the
                    plaintiffs, which have no real impact on the Company’s assets or its
                    rehabilitation, and who did not participate in the scheme in any
                way.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The terms of the Scheme</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     I next turn to the Scheme document on how it
                    defines Scheme Creditors and the scope and effects expressed within it. The
                    material definition clauses are as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>Scheme Creditor</b> means a creditor of the
                        Company (other than an Excluded Creditor) who has a Scheme Claim;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>Scheme Claim</b> in relation to any Scheme
                        Creditor means the total amount of Liabilities (including any Liabilities
                        that had been agreed between the Company and the respective Scheme Creditor
                        but had not paid prior to 24 March 2008), if any, as at 24 March
                        2008 <b><em>for which the Company is or may be liable to that
                            Scheme Creditor (whether contingently or otherwise)</em></b>
                        …</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>Liability</b> means any obligation, liability or
                        indebtedness of a person whether it is present, future, prospective or
                        contingent, whether its amount is fixed or unliquidated, whether it arises
                        in contract, tort, restitution or otherwise, whether or not it involves the
                        payment of money, which arises at common law, in equity, by statute (in
                        Singapore or in any other jurisdiction) or which arises pursuant to a valid
                        assignment or a valid authority to pay any amount on behalf of a person or
                        in any other manner whatsoever provided that such expression does not
                        include any obligation or liability which is barred by statute or one for
                        which no remedy may be granted or is otherwise unenforceable. For the
                        avoidance of doubt, where any obligation or liability under a contract or
                        policy is void or, being voidable, has been duly avoided, no obligation or
                        liability shall arise in respect of such obligation or liability;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added in bold italics]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     It is clear that each Scheme Claim is defined
                    to mean a claim “for which the Company is or may be liable to that Scheme
                    Creditor”. The definition of “liability” which is defined
                    to aggregate all liabilities in their totality and to comprise individual claims
                    for which the company is or may be liable to that Scheme Creditor, resonates the
                    same point. I note that an Australian court has following its construction of
                    the scheme document held that an unliquidated tort claimant was not a creditor
                    bound by a scheme of arrangement (see <em>Smith v Carr and
                        others</em> (1993) 10 ACSR 427). As a matter of construction of
                    the Scheme document’s definition clauses, the plaintiffs’ insured
                    claims for which the Company bears no substantive actual or contingent liability
                    would not, in my view, be claims for which the Company “is or may be
                    liable ... (whether contingently or otherwise)”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     Even if insured claims were to be construed to
                    be within the Scheme definitions, the next question is whether the Scheme
                    document has overreaching effects after the conclusion and termination of the
                    Scheme. The critical clause which is invoked by the Company to close out the
                    plaintiffs’ claims is clause 5.4 of the Scheme which reads as
                    follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">5.4    Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein,
                            any Scheme Creditor who has failed to submit to the Scheme Manager at
                            the Specified Address, a Proof of Debt in respect of its Scheme Claim on
                            or before the Claim Cut-Off Date, <em>shall not be
                                entitled to payment of his Scheme Claim, and with effect from the
                                Claims Cut-Off Date</em>, <b><em>the Company
                                shall be completely and absolutely discharged from that Scheme
                                Creditor’s Scheme Claim</em></b>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added in italics and bold italics]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     In order for a scheme to achieve its purpose
                    of binding minority creditors, the statutory conditions in s 210(3) of the
                    Companies Act must be followed and court approval of the scheme must be
                    obtained. In order to fulfil the statutory conditions in s 210(3) of the
                    Companies Act, the company has to identify its creditors and settle the amounts
                    payable to them in order that the necessary numerical and value votes may be
                    determined. Clause 5.4 is designed to determine the classes of eligible
                    Scheme Creditors and the amounts due to them for this purpose. In order to
                    determine the relevant numbers and values, clause 3.3 treats unproven debts
                    or claims to be computed as zero and then clause 5.4 treats such unproven
                    creditors as not being entitled to participate in payments under the Scheme and
                    as having had their debts discharged from the Claims Cut-off Date for the
                    purposes of the Scheme. Clauses 3 and 5 accordingly set out the mechanics
                    of determining the number and value of eligible creditors for purposes of
                    computing the statutory thresholds and for determining the persons entitled to
                    receive the compromised payments as set out in the Scheme.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     What is clear is that such unproven creditors
                    are not entitled to receive any payments made to proven creditors under the
                    Scheme and for this purpose his claim is to be treated as discharged. As noted
                    above, the unproven creditor would find himself closed out from participating in
                    the Scheme save in exceptional circumstances (see <a href="#p1_24">[24]</a>, above). What is not expressed in clause 5.4, however,
                    is that all unproven claims are to be treated as unilaterally discharged beyond
                    the life of the Scheme.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     The heart and effects of the Scheme is set out
                    in clause 2.1.1 of the Scheme as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The purposes of this Scheme which is proposed by the Company are to
                        procure, <b><em>in consideration of the matters</em></b> set
                        out in this Scheme the discharge and release of all claims by Scheme
                        Creditors relating to the Scheme Claims against the Company.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added in bold italics]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Clause 2.1.1 expressly contemplates that the Company has to
                    provide some consideration to Scheme Creditors in exchange for which the claims
                    as compromised will be discharged and released. Clause 5.4 does not have an
                    independent life of its own but is subject to clause 2.1.1. The compromise
                    is ordinarily structured by a variety and combination of means including
                    reduction/forgiveness of principal and/or interest (referred to as
                    “haircuts”), equity for debt exchanges, and the
                    rescheduling/postponement of repayment. This comports with the basic legal
                    principle that a legal obligation cannot be unilaterally disclaimed by one party
                    save by mutual agreement. Neither clause 2.1.1 nor clause 5.4 have,
                    following the completion and termination of the Scheme, the overreaching effect
                    of enabling the company to have unilaterally extinguished debts or claims which
                    were unproven and which did not participate in the scheme.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     I am mindful of the wider market implications
                    of this question of law and I accordingly frame my decision within the narrow
                    context of the agreed facts (see <a href="#p1_3">[3]</a>–<a href="#p1_13">[13]</a>, above) and
                    test it against the legislative policy of s 210 of the Companies Act. The
                    legislative policy is to facilitate companies to reach a compromise and
                    arrangement with their creditors in order to obviate the need for liquidation
                    and to facilitate financial rehabilitation of the company, where the prescribed
                    majority of creditors agree to such compromise or arrangement (see above at
                        <a href="#p1_21">[21]</a>–<a href="#p1_22">[22]</a>). This policy is achieved by ensuring finality to the
                    process of identifying and quantifying the value of outstanding debts and claims
                    in order to determine whether the prescribed majority agree to the proposed
                    compromise. This legislative policy will not be undermined by holding that
                    unproven and insured unliquidated tort claimants whose claims have no
                    substantive effect on the Company’s assets, are not barred from pursuing
                    their claims in court after the successful completion and termination of the
                    Scheme. I have addressed the risks that such insured claimants take in
                    commencing actions in court once a scheme has been proposed and up to the
                    termination of a creditor and court approved scheme above at <a href="#p1_30">[30]</a>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     In the light of the above, I would hold that
                    the plaintiffs’ unproven insured contingent tortious claims against the
                    Company are not within the definition of creditors in the Scheme document. Even
                    if they were to be regarded as within such definition, the Scheme document does
                    not have overreaching effects following the completion and termination of the
                    Scheme so as to unilaterally completely and absolutely discharge the Company
                    from the plaintiffs’ claims.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     For all these reasons, I decided that, in
                    these circumstances:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_40-p2_i"></a>(i)     Azman’s causes of action in
                        Suit No 183 of 2010 against the Company have not been extinguished
                        and/or barred and/or precluded from being maintained consequent to the
                        Scheme of Compromise and Arrangement dated 3 July 2008 which had been
                        duly completed, performed and fulfilled according to its terms by 4 May
                        2009; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_40-p2_ii"></a>(ii)     Shaik’s causes of action in Suit No 717 of 2009 against the
                        Company, assuming that his receipt of part payment from the Scheme Manager
                        was not in full and final settlement of his claim and causes of action,
                        either in or apart from the Scheme, have not been extinguished and/or barred
                        and/or precluded from being maintained consequent to the Scheme of
                        Compromise and Arrangement dated 3 July 2008 which had been duly
                        completed, performed and fulfilled according to its terms by 4 May
                        2009.</p>
