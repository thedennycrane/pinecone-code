This legislative objective balances the desire to ensure that contractors are paid their dues in a timely fashion against the need to respect the parties’ bargain as reflected in their agreed contractual terms. Hence, in the speech of the then Minister of State for National Development, Mr Zaqy Mohamad, at the Second Reading of the Building and Construction Industry Security of Payment (Amendment) Bill on 2 October 2018, the minister stated that it is common industry practice for a contract to provide for the suspension of payment until a later date if the contract is terminated upon a contractor’s default. Where there is such a provision, a contractor that has defaulted will have to abide by the terms of the contract and will only be able to submit a payment claim under the SOPA after the conditions in the contract have been met (see <span class="font-italic">Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report </span>(2 October 2018) vol 94 (“<span class="font-italic">Second Reading Speech</span>”)). The present case is one where these competing considerations are engaged. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Facts </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 The claimant is Builders Hub Pte Ltd (“BH”).

</div> The learned Adjudicator found, at paragraph 79 of the Adjudication Determination, that in considering whether a claimant was entitled to be paid under the contract, the correct approach is as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… the “default” position is that unless the material contract expressly provided that a contractor is entitled to submit further payment claims post-termination or that it is entitled to be paid progress payments post-termination, then no such entitlement can arise under the said contract. I find this to be the correct position, with the qualification that this is the case only where there is an express termination clause providing for the termination of the employment of the contractor and the consequences of such termination, as in the present case. …</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">14 Applying this “default position”, the learned Adjudicator found that there was no <span class="font-italic">express </span>provision in the Contract providing that BH would be entitled to have its payment claims that were submitted prior to termination evaluated and paid after termination.

Neither did the occurrence of the contractual termination event <span class="font-italic">per se</span> disentitle BH to an adjudication of a payment claim that was validly served prior to the termination.

If there is such a provision, BH would lose its right to apply for adjudication of the claim in PC 40 even though PC 40 was validly served prior to the termination.

If, however, the Contract was terminated by BH pursuant to its general contractual right to terminate the Contract for JP’s alleged repudiatory breaches, or if the provisions for the termination of BH’s employment in cl 30.2 and the consequences of such termination in cl 30.3 were not otherwise engaged, BH’s entitlement to apply for adjudication would remain intact in the absence of any other terms in the Contract providing to the contrary.    </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 In explaining my conclusion, I will consider: (a) the learned Adjudicator’s analysis of BH’s entitlement to progress payments which undergirded his determination that he had no jurisdiction to determine SOP/AA 164 of 2022; (b) the relevant provisions in the SOPA; and (c) the case authorities referred to by the learned Adjudicator and the parties. Thereafter, I will turn to the facts and examine how the application of the relevant provisions in the Contract will affect BH’s entitlement to apply for an adjudication on the basis of PC 40.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The “default position” adopted by the learned Adjudicator </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 As I have summarised above (see [13]–[14]), the learned Adjudicator found that where a contract bears an express termination clause providing for the termination of a contractor’s employment and the consequences of such termination (the “employment termination clause”), the “default position” is that the contractor has no right to submit further payment claims, or to be paid progress payments, even if the relevant payment claim was served prior to such termination unless the contract expressly provides otherwise.

</div> The reason for this “default position” is that there is no need for the SOPA to perform a “gap-filling” function in such cases, since the express terms of the contract ought to apply instead.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 With respect, I do not agree with this “default position”. The “default position” does not consider the critical point of whether the employment termination clause is engaged in the first place. In my view, the mere existence of an employment termination clause in the Contract should not and does not affect a contractor’s entitlement under the contract if it is not engaged on the facts. It is only if the contract was in fact terminated pursuant to that employment termination clause that the contents and effect of that clause and its constituent parts become engaged. Where the clause is not engaged, the question should be whether there are other contractual terms that preclude, negate or suspend the contractor’s right to be paid based on a payment claim that is served prior to termination, rather than whether there are contractual terms that provide for entitlement to post-termination progress payments.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Section 4(2)(c) of the SOPA does not exclude the application of the SOPA where no suspension of payment term is applicable on the facts</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 I begin my analysis with reference to the relevant provisions in the SOPA. In this regard, there is no legislative support for any requirement that the contract must expressly preserve a contractor’s entitlement to progress payments in respect of payment claims that had been validly served prior to termination, in order for that claim to be amenable to adjudication under the SOPA. The entitlement to progress payments is provided in s 5 of the SOPA, which states that “[a]ny person who has carried out any construction work, or supplied any goods or services, under a contract is entitled to a progress payment”. There is no reference here to the general defeasibility or suspension of the entitlement to progress payments upon the occurrence of any event. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 So far as contractual termination is concerned, s 4(2)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the SOPA provides only for a limited situation where the SOPA does not apply to a terminated contract. Section 4(2)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) reads as follows: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Application of Act</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">4.</span>— …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(2)  This Act does not apply to —</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) any terminated contract to the extent that —</div><div class="txt-body text-justify">(i) the terminated contract contains provisions relating to termination that permit the respondent to suspend progress payments to the claimant until a date or the occurrence of an event specified in the contract; and</div><div class="txt-body text-justify">(ii) that date has not passed or that event has not occurred; </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 In my view, s 4(2)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the SOPA only applies to exclude the application of the SOPA to a terminated contract if there are terms in that contract “relating to termination that permit the respondent to suspend progress payments” that have been engaged. This conclusion may be gleaned from the <span class="font-italic">Second Reading Speech</span>:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…we understand that it is common industry practice for contract terms to suspend payment until a later date if a contractor has defaulted, leading to the termination of the contract. When this happens, the SOP Act will pay heed to terms pre-agreed by parties. As such, clause 3 will require adjudicators to respect the contract clauses on suspension of payment for terminated contracts. <span class="font-italic">This means that claimants that have defaulted on the contract will need to abide by contract terms, and they will be able to submit a payment claim under the SOP Act only after the conditions in the contract have been met.</span><span class="font-italic"> </span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 From the extract above, it is telling that the purpose of s 4(2)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) is simply to require parties to “respect the contract clauses on suspension of payment for terminated contracts” by not allowing claimants to rely on the progress payment mechanism in the SOPA if the conditions for payment under the contract have not been met. By parity of reasoning, where there is no suspension of payment clause that is engaged, there is no indication of parliamentary intent to exclude the application of the SOPA to the terminated contract as there will be no contractual bargain that needs to be upheld. As such, in my view, the contractual terms relating to termination <span class="font-italic">must be engaged</span> <span class="font-italic">on the facts</span> before the SOPA is disapplied pursuant to s 4(2)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the SOPA. This is clear from the plain reading of s 4(2)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>), which envisages the invocation or engagement of the clause that permits the suspension of progress payments until a specified date or event. Where the suspensory provision in the contract is not invoked or engaged on the facts, s 4(2)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) does not operate to disentitle a contractor to progress payments.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 On the facts, s 5 of the SOPA undeniably applies – there is no dispute that PC 40 relates to construction work under the Contract. There is also no question that BH was entitled to serve PC 40, when it was served, and that PC 40 was validly served. The question is whether BH “lost” its entitlement to be paid based on PC 40 upon the termination of the Contract or its employment. In this regard, under the REDAS Conditions that have been incorporated into the Contract, unless a contractor’s employment is terminated under cl 30.2 due to a contractor’s default and cl 30.3 applies to suspend progress payments until a specified date or event, s 4(2)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the SOPA simply does not come into play. Any contention that cll 30.2 and 30.3 of the REDAS Conditions should be construed as satisfying the conditions in s 4(2)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the SOPA, even when those clauses are not invoked on the facts, is misconceived.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The case authorities do not support the “default position”</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 Moreover, I am of the view that case authorities that were referred to by the learned Adjudicator and cited by JP do not support the proposition that a payment claim validly served prior to termination is not amenable to adjudication, if the adjudication application is not filed before the termination event, unless the contract expressly provides otherwise. Indeed, as I will elaborate, the case authorities support the <span class="font-italic">converse</span> proposition – that an entitlement to be paid based on a payment claim that is validly served before the termination event remains unaffected provided that there are no contractual provisions to the contrary.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 The first decision to be considered is the Court of Appeal’s judgment in <span class="font-italic">Yau</span><span class="font-italic"> Lee</span>. One of the main questions, in that case, was whether payment claims could be submitted after a final certificate had been issued by the designated architect under the contract. The Court of Appeal answered the question in the negative, explaining that once the designated architect has issued a final certificate that was <span class="font-italic">prima facie </span>valid, he is rendered <span class="font-italic">functus officio </span>and his role under the contract comes to an end, such that there is “simply no <span class="font-italic">basis</span> to submit further payment claims” [emphasis in original] (at [39]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 I should note from the outset that <span class="font-italic">Yau</span><span class="font-italic"> Lee </span>concerned a contract that incorporated, with amendments, the Singapore Institute of Architects Articles and Conditions of Building Contract (Measurement Contract) (7th Ed, April 2005) (“SIA Conditions”), in contrast to the REDAS Conditions that are applicable in the present case. The certification regime under the SIA Conditions has been observed to be “categorically different” from that under the REDAS Conditions, in that, unlike an architect under the SIA Conditions, the designated payment certifier under the REDAS Conditions is an agent of the employer and is thus neither independent nor objective. His certificates are thus “no more than steps in a payment procedure, and hardly carry the same weight as a certificate issued by an architect … [under the SIA Conditions]” (see <span class="font-italic">CEQ v CER</span> [2020] SGHC 70 (“<span class="font-italic">CEQ”</span>) at [25]–[28]). In this regard, I note that the appeal from the decision in <span class="font-italic">CEQ </span>was allowed by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Orion-One</span>. The Court of Appeal, however, did not comment on the learned Judge’s observations about the differences between the REDAS Conditions and the SIA Conditions, and disposed of the appeal based on a different point. Furthermore, in <span class="font-italic">Yau</span><span class="font-italic"> Lee</span>, the payment claim that was being challenged was served <span class="font-italic">after</span> the material event in question – which was the issuance of the final certificate – whereas in the present case, there is no dispute that PC 40 was issued <span class="font-italic">prior to</span> the Date of Termination. I therefore consider <span class="font-italic">Yau</span><span class="font-italic"> Lee </span>to be distinguishable from the present case<span class="font-italic">. </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 I turn then to consider the two Court of Appeal decisions of <span class="font-italic">Shimizu </span>and <span class="font-italic">Orion-One</span> which were canvassed by the parties. I begin with <span class="font-italic">Shimizu</span>, where the material issue before the Court of Appeal was whether the terms of the contract entitled the contractor to serve payment claims on the employer following the termination of the contract pursuant to a term of that contract. The court held that on a proper construction of the contract, there was “no contractually provided right to serve a payment claim for work done prior to termination <span class="font-italic">if the [contract</span><span class="font-italic"> was] terminated for [the contractor’s] default</span>” [emphasis added] (at [47]), and that s 10 of the SOPA did not apply to perform any “gap-filling” role to change this status since the contract was not silent as to the entitlement to submit post-termination payment claims in the first place (<span class="font-italic">Shimizu</span> at [48]). On the facts of that case, the employer had exercised its rights under a termination clause in the contract on the basis of the contractor’s alleged default. The Court of Appeal held that since there were provisions in the contract that precluded the service of payment claims following contractual termination, this meant that the payment claims served by the contractor following the termination of the contractor’s employment were invalid <span class="font-italic">(</span>at [38])<span class="font-italic">.</span> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 In <span class="font-italic">Orion</span><span class="font-italic">-One</span>, the Court of Appeal considered the validity of a payment claim served more than two years following the termination of the contractor’s employment. In its decision, the court stressed that “the starting point of the analysis must always be the terms of the contract” (<span class="font-italic">Orion-One</span> at [23]), and held that on proper construction, none of the clauses relied upon by the contractor served as a valid basis to entitle it to submit payment claims after the termination of its employment. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 I accept that <span class="font-italic">Shimizu </span>and <span class="font-italic">Orion</span><span class="font-italic">-One</span> are more pertinent to the present case, in the sense that the material event being considered was a contractual termination event and how that affected the contractor’s entitlement to submit or serve payment claims. However, it must be borne in mind that unlike the present case, in both cases the relevant payment claims were served <span class="font-italic">after </span>the respective dates of termination in those cases. Therefore, while the Court of Appeal’s guidance as to the general approach that should be taken in evaluating the basis for a payment claim is salient and helpful, the specific manner in which certain provisions have been construed and applied to the facts may not be directly applicable. Critically, like <span class="font-italic">Yau</span><span class="font-italic"> Lee</span>, neither of these cases support a finding that an entitlement arising from a validly served <span class="font-italic">pre-termination</span> payment claim will be “lost”, negated or suspended upon the termination of the contract or the contractor’s employment, if the contract does not <span class="font-italic">expressly</span> provide for the contractor to be paid post-termination. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 On the contrary, the Court of Appeal clarified in <span class="font-italic">Shimizu</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>that the applicability of the SOPA to progress payments after termination “does not and was not intended to override the <span class="font-italic">terms of the contract</span> <span class="font-italic">which provide the contrary</span>” [emphasis added] (at [36]). Again, the Court of Appeal held in <span class="font-italic">Orion-One </span>at [48] that the “SOPA can <span class="font-italic">in principle</span> apply to progress payment claims served post-termination … subject always to <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">any terms of the contract which provide to the contrary</span>” [emphasis in original in italics; emphasis added in bold italics]. These observations support the view that as far as a validly served pre-termination payment claim is concerned, the question is not whether there are provisions in the contract that <span class="font-italic">permit</span> the contractor to pursue its adjudication post-termination, but whether the contract <span class="font-italic">precludes</span> the contractor from doing so, which is the <span class="font-italic">converse</span> position of the “default position”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 Indeed, there is some authority for the proposition that subsequent termination does not negate, suspend or otherwise affect a contractor’s right to apply for adjudication under the SOPA on the basis of a payment claim that has been validly served <span class="font-italic">before</span> that termination.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 In the High Court decision of <span class="font-italic">Choi Peng Kum</span><span class="font-italic"> and another v Tan Poh Eng Construction Pte Ltd</span> [2014] 1 SLR 1210 (“<span class="font-italic">Choi Peng Kum</span>”), the contractor issued a payment claim seeking a progress payment under a contract that incorporated the SIA Conditions. In response, the employer terminated the contract and did not serve any payment response. When the contractor lodged an adjudication application under the SOPA, the adjudicator found in favour of the contractor and ordered that the employer make certain progress payments. The employer applied to set aside that adjudication determination on, among others, the ground that the adjudicator had no jurisdiction to consider the payment claim as the contract had been terminated. The High Court disagreed and held that the contractor was not precluded from lodging the adjudication application and that the adjudicator was not deprived of jurisdiction to hear the payment claim simply because the contract had been subsequently terminated after issuance of the payment claim. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 The High Court arrived at this conclusion despite the fact, acknowledged at [9], [10] and [18] of the decision, that the respondent to the payment claim (the employer in that case) did not provide a payment response, and had terminated the contract before the adjudication application was lodged. In this regard, I highlight [35] of the judgment: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The question therefore was whether cl 32(8)(a) precluded the [contractor] from engaging the adjudication process under SOPA and precluded the Adjudicator from making an AD under SOPA … </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 It should be noted that the learned Judge framed the issue as whether a term of the contract <span class="font-italic">precluded </span>the SOPA adjudication process, rather than whether a term of the contract <span class="font-italic">permitted </span>the adjudication process. Therefore, so far as a payment claim that had been validly served prior to termination is concerned, the inquiry focuses on whether the relevant contract <span class="font-italic">extinguishes</span> the right to adjudicate that payment claim. In the absence of such a provision, the law does not consider the entitlement under the payment claim extinguished, “lost” (in the learned Adjudicator’s words), or otherwise affected simply by the fact of a subsequent termination. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 At this juncture, it is apposite to note that <span class="font-italic">Choi Peng Kum</span> pre-dated the 2018 amendments to the SOPA, where s 4(2)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) was inserted to clarify that the SOPA does not apply to certain terminated contracts.

</div>
</div> However, its consideration of the effect of a subsequent contractual termination on a contractor’s right to apply for adjudication based on a payment claim that had been validly served was referred to with approval by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Shimizu</span>, which post-dated the 2018 amendments. In <span class="font-italic">Shimizu, </span>the Court of Appeal placed significance on the fact that the payment claim in <span class="font-italic">Choi Peng Kum </span>had been served <span class="font-italic">prior to </span><span class="font-italic">termination</span>, and observed at [25] that <span class="font-italic">Choi Peng Kum </span>“was decided on the basis that the [contractor] had validly served the payment claim in question in accordance with the terms of the contract <span class="font-italic">before</span> the termination” [emphasis in original]. Thereafter at [34], the Court of Appeal held that <span class="font-italic">Choi Peng Kum </span>is “entirely consistent with our interpretation of the SOPA” and went on to explain: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… In <span class="font-italic">Choi Peng Kum</span>, <span class="font-italic">the payment claim in question had been validly served prior to the termination of the contract</span>. It was on this basis that the adjudication application was found to have been validly made pursuant to s 12(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the SOPA, notwithstanding the fact that no payment response was provided to the defendant by the quantity surveyor. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 While it is true that the courts have repeatedly stressed that primacy must be accorded to the terms of the contract in determining the parties’ rights even within the context of the SOPA, it does not follow that where an adjudication application relating to a validly served payment claim is filed after a contractual termination event, the payment claim is amenable to adjudication only if the contract expressly provides for it.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 Indeed, I consider it a point of principle that, ordinarily, the termination of a contract does not affect rights which have accrued before that termination (see the High Court decision of <span class="font-italic">LW Infrastructure Pte Ltd v Lim Chin San Contractors Pte Ltd</span> [2011] 4 SLR 477 at [15]). In the context of construction contracts, the High Court in <span class="font-italic">Tiong Seng Contractors (Pte) Ltd v </span><span class="font-italic">Chuan Lim Construction Pte Ltd </span>[2007] 4 SLR(R) 364 also quoted with approval the following passage by Philip Jeyaretnam SC (as he then was) who was the adjudicator in that case (at [17]): </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… Nonetheless, I am of the view that the Act does apply even after a contract is terminated. First, the intention to protect cash flow would not be achieved if the interpretation put forward by the Respondent is adopted. If cash flow is blocked on one project, that will affect a contractor or service provider’s financial resources for other projects. Secondly, <span class="font-italic">although one always speaks of termination of a contract when i</span><span class="font-italic">t is really the right and obligation to do work and be paid for it which is terminated for the future, the contract continues to govern the relationship between the parties in relation to the work already done</span>. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added] </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 In the present case, there is no dispute that PC 40 relates to construction work under the Contract. There is also no dispute that BH was entitled to serve PC 40 under cl 22 of the REDAS Conditions, when it was served, and that PC 40 was validly served. The application of the foregoing principle means that the rights of BH which accrued from the valid service of PC 40 prior to the termination event will give rise to an entitlement to a progress payment that remains amenable to adjudication, unless the contract provides otherwise. In other words, if there are no express provisions that negate or suspend the entitlement that has accrued before termination, the entitlement continues to exist. Thus, the court’s inquiry should turn to whether the contract has provided for the negation or suspension of that subsisting right in the event of termination. This, in my view, better accords with principle and coheres with the court’s desire to give effect to the contractual bargain of the parties. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Application to the facts </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 Given the foregoing analysis, it is necessary to turn to examine whether the Contract provides for the negation or suspension of BH’s entitlement to the progress payment under PC 40 upon the occurrence of a termination event under the Contract. As I will elaborate, this issue is in turn dependent on the basis upon which the Contract was terminated.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 At the outset, I set out the Court of Appeal’s guidance in <span class="font-italic">Alliance Concrete Singapore Pte Ltd v Comfort Resources Pte Ltd</span> [2009] 4 SLR(R) 602 ("<span class="font-italic">Alliance Concrete</span>") at [31]–[32]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">31     … [The] actual termination of a contract is always <span class="font-italic">legally</span> “dangerous”. This is due, in part, to the fact that if a party terminates the contract <span class="font-italic">without legal justification</span>, it will <span class="font-italic">itself</span> be in <span class="font-italic">breach</span> of contract ...</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">32     Whether or not the innocent party is legally justified in terminating the contract depends on whether one of the situations set out in [<span class="font-italic">RDC Concrete Pte Ltd v Sato Kogyo (S) Pte Ltd</span><span class="font-italic"> and another appeal</span> (“<span class="font-italic">RDC Concrete</span>”) [2007] 4 SLR(R) 413] has been satisfied.

</div> This submission reflects substantively the same position as that adopted by the learned Adjudicator in his determination (see [12] above).

If cl 30.2 was not engaged, then cl 30.3 would similarly not be engaged, in which case there appears to be no other provision in the Contract that would disentitle BH to the adjudication of, or the receipt of payment under, PC 40. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 Therefore, in order to decide whether cl 30.2 was engaged, it was necessary, as an antecedent inquiry, to decide whether BH had validly terminated the Contract pursuant to its general contractual right to terminate the Contract for JP’s alleged repudiatory breaches before JP issued the notice of termination under cl 30.2.2 later on the same day. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 If it is found that BH’s termination of the Contract was legally justified and its allegations concerning JP’s alleged repudiatory breaches of the Contract fell within one or more of the situations set out in <span class="font-italic">RDC Concrete</span>, then there was no basis for JP’s purported invocation of cl 30.2.2 of the REDAS Conditions to terminate BH’s employment under the Contract subsequently, given that the Contract had already been terminated by the time of issuance of the notice of termination. In such a case, cl 30.3 of the REDAS Conditions, which suspends a contractor’s entitlement to a progress payment upon the termination of the employment of the contractor under the Contract, would simply not be engaged and the entitlement to progress payments pursuant to PC 40 would have continued to subsist. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 For completeness, I refer to my observation earlier at [36] that the contractual terms relating to termination <span class="font-italic">must be engaged</span><span class="font-italic"> on the facts</span> before the SOPA is disapplied pursuant to s 4(2)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the SOPA. Accordingly, if cl 30.3 of the REDAS Conditions was not invoked and operative on the facts of this case, then s 4(2)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) does not come into play to affect BH’s entitlement to post-termination progress payments.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 On the other hand, if it is found on the facts that BH’s purported termination of the Contract for JP’s alleged repudiatory breaches was unjustified, then, as noted at [31] of <span class="font-italic">Alliance Concrete</span>, it is likely that BH would itself be in breach of the Contract. In such a situation, if JP had validly terminated BH’s <span class="font-italic">employment </span>under the Contract under cl 30.2.2 of the REDAS Conditions, then cl 30.3.1 of the REDAS Conditions would operate to disentitle BH from making an adjudication application, which would therefore place SOP/AA 164 of 2022 outside the purview of the SOPA. Under cl 30.3.1 of the REDAS Conditions, if the employment of the contractor was terminated under cl 30.2, the employer shall not be liable to make any further payments to the contractor until the Termination Costs have been ascertained. The effect of cl 30.3.1 was explained by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Orion-One</span> at [44]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… cl 30.3.1 goes one step further to <span class="font-italic">preclude</span> the contractor from claiming any payments (including progress payments) until the project is completed and the relevant costs ascertained and deducted. In other words, <span class="font-weight-bold">by virtue of cl 30.3.1, the progress payment regime set out in cl 22 no longer applies once the contractor’s employment is terminated for breach</span>. …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 There are two points to be made here. First, whether BH had exercised its general contractual right to terminate the Contract for JP’s alleged repudiatory breaches <span class="font-italic">before</span> JP purported to terminate BH’s employment under cl 30.2.2 of the REDAS Conditions is a necessary antecedent issue that has to be addressed before any conclusion may be made about whether the learned Adjudicator has jurisdiction to adjudicate SOP/AA 164 of 2022 on its merits. I caveat that as this is an issue that goes into the merits of the dispute that the learned Adjudicator has yet to consider, I express no view on its substantive merits. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 Second, the Court of Appeal’s analysis at [44] in <span class="font-italic">Orion-One </span>on the effect of cl 30.3.1 of the REDAS Conditions is instructive. The Court of Appeal noted that “the progress payment regime set out in cl 22 no longer applies” by virtue of the operation of another term (cl 30.3.1), which, by implication, means that an express provision is required to negate the operation of cl 22. This supports the view I expressed earlier (at [48] and [52]) that if there are no provisions that negate or suspend a subsisting right to payment in the event of termination, the entitlement continues to exist. There is no need for an express provision to preserve a subsisting entitlement in that case.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 For the foregoing reasons, before a finding is made as to whether cl 30.2.2 was in fact invoked on the facts, there is no basis for JP’s contention that, by virtue of cl 30.3 of the REDAS Conditions, JP was not liable to pay BH until the Termination Costs have been ascertained,

Under cl 22.4, the Interim Payment Certificate shall be deemed to be the payment response from the employer to the contractor under the SOPA in the event the employer fails to provide a payment response to the contractor within 21 days after the payment claim is served on the employer by the contractor. However, where the employer provides a payment response within 21 days, the employer’s payment response shall take precedence over the Interim Payment Certificate. Section 11(1) of the SOPA similarly provides that a respondent named in a payment claim served in relation to a construction contract must respond to the payment claim by providing, or causing to be provided, a payment response to the claimant by the timelines stated in that provision. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 The crux of this framework is that the Interim Payment Certificate issued by the Employer’s Representative is subordinate to the payment response if one is issued by the employer.

</div> However, the status of the Employer’s Representative when it issued this certificate is immaterial because JP served PR 40 on BH on 15 September 2022 (see [8] above). In fact, at paragraph 5 of JP’s letter dated 15 September 2022, which formed part of JP’s PR 40, JP stated that “[o]ur Payment Response 40 [would] take precedence over the Interim Valuation No. 40 as certified by Infield Projects, and our Payment Response 40 [would] be the operative payment response under the SOP Act and clause 22.4 of the REDAS Conditions”.

</div> JP did not argue that PR 40 is invalid or should be disregarded for any reason. On the basis of cl 22.4 of the REDAS Conditions, the service of the payment response itself supersedes the need for an Interim Payment Certificate to be issued.

This is because (a) BH had served PC 40 on JP on 18 August 2022 (see [5] above), (b) PC 40 was served prior to the Date of Termination (see [7] above), and (c) JP served PR 40 on BH on 15 September 2022 (see [8] above). Under s 12(2) of the SOPA, BH was entitled to make an adjudication application under s 13 of the SOPA in relation to PC 40 by the end of the dispute settlement period if BH disputed the payment response provided by JP. As BH did not accept PR 40 in writing, it was considered to have disputed PR 40 under s 12(3). BH availed itself of its entitlement by way of its adjudication application in SOP/AA 164 of 2022 under s 13(1) of the SOPA on 22 September 2022 (see [9] above). I note that it is not JP’s case that SOP/AA 164 of 2022 is defective for failure to comply with any of the requirements imposed by s 13 of the SOPA. In summary, I find on the facts that whether the Employer’s Representative was <span class="font-italic">functus officio </span>or not does not affect the adjudicator’s jurisdiction to determine SOP/AA 164 of 2022. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The rules of natural justice</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">73 In my view, the learned Adjudicator did not breach the rules of natural justice in arriving at his decision. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">74 The law on the breach of the fair hearing rule, which is one of the rules of natural justice, was considered by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Glaziers Engineering Pte Ltd v WCS Engineering Construction Pte Ltd</span> [2018] 2 SLR 1311 (“<span class="font-italic">Glaziers Engineering</span>”) at [54]–[55]. In essence, a decision-maker may be in breach of the fair hearing rule if he decides a dispute on a point on which the parties have not had a fair opportunity to address. A surprising or unforeseen outcome from the decision-maker may indicate that there has been a breach of the fair hearing rule, but this is not conclusive. The true question is whether the parties have been deprived of a fair opportunity to be heard, and fairness in this context is to be understood not in terms of equal treatment between the parties, but in terms of <span class="font-italic">reasonableness</span>. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">75 In this regard, a fair and reasonable opportunity of being heard may or may not require a decision-maker to take the overt step of inviting submissions from the parties on a given issue. The Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Glaziers Engineering</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>proceeded at [60]–[65] to elaborate on a situation where the outcome of a dispute may be surprising to one or more of the parties, but which does not breach the fair hearing rule. This is a situation “where the decision-maker has decided the dispute on a premise which, though not directly raised by the parties, is reasonably connected to an argument which the parties have raised” (<span class="font-italic">Glaziers Engineering </span>at [61], citing <span class="font-italic">TMM Division Maritima SA de CV v Pacific Richfield Marine Pte Ltd</span> [2013] 4 SLR 972 (“<span class="font-italic">TMM</span>”) at [63]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">76 As summarised in <span class="font-italic">Glaziers Engineering</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [61]–[62], in <span class="font-italic">TMM</span>, the main issue in dispute between a ship purchaser and a ship seller was whether the ship purchaser was entitled to terminate the contract on the basis of an alleged repudiatory breach on the ship seller’s part. At the heart of this question was whether the term which the ship seller had breached (“cl 11”) was a condition of the contract. The ship purchaser alleged that cl 11 was a <span class="font-italic">condition</span>, whereas the ship seller alleged that it was an <span class="font-italic">innominate term</span>. The parties referred the dispute to arbitration, where the arbitrator found that cl 11 was not a condition, but a collateral warranty. The ship purchaser applied to the High Court to have the arbitrator’s decision set aside. On the facts, Chan Seng Onn J (as he then was) found that it was in fact the seller’s case before the arbitrator that cl 11 was a <span class="font-italic">collateral</span> <span class="font-italic">warranty</span> and therefore dismissed the application to have the decision set aside. He nevertheless went further to opine in <span class="font-italic">obiter </span>that the arbitrator could not be said to have deprived the purchaser of its right to be heard by deciding that the term was a <span class="font-italic">collateral</span> <span class="font-italic">warranty</span>. This was because the finding that cl 11 was a collateral warranty was not only reasonably connected to the arguments raised by the parties, but also a reasonable follow-through from the arbitrator’s finding that cl 11 was not a condition.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">77 In the present case, BH takes issue with two particular findings of the learned Adjudicator: (a) that there was no express contractual provision entitling BH to be paid after termination; and (b) that PC 40 fell outside the purview of the SOPA at the time of the adjudication application.

In JP’s reply submissions filed in SOP/AA 164 of 2022 dated 11 October 2022, JP had argued that BH was “not entitled to seek adjudication under the SOP Act because there is no contractual entitlement to payment after termination either under the common law or under the contract”.

</div> In my view, the Adjudicator’s determination that there was no express contractual provision entitling BH to be paid after termination is a point that is “reasonably connected” to JP’s argument that BH had no contractual entitlement to payment after termination either at common law or under the   Contract. In particular, I note that a submission that there is no general contractual entitlement to post-termination payment logically implies that there is no <span class="font-italic">express</span> contractual provision giving rise to such an entitlement. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">79 Turning to finding (b), I am unable to agree with BH that the learned Adjudicator breached the fair hearing rule by making a finding that PC 40 fell outside the purview of the SOPA at the time of the adjudication application. It is helpful here to reproduce a relevant section of the learned Adjudicator’s determination:

</div>
</div>
</div> and this provision sets out situations where the SOPA does not apply to terminated contracts. In my view, a dispute concerning the applicability and legal effect of s 4(2)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the SOPA may logically and reasonably give rise to a finding that PC 40 fell outside the purview of the SOPA at the time of the adjudication application. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">81 For the foregoing reasons, the learned Adjudicator cannot be said to have reached the two impugned findings without giving the parties a fair and reasonable chance to be heard on those issues. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Other issues</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">82 For completeness, I deal with BH’s arguments on the doctrines of waiver and estoppel, and the rule in s 15(3) of the SOPA which precludes a respondent from including in its adjudication response an objection unless the objection was included in the relevant payment response provided by the respondent to the claimant. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">83 In this regard, the law on waiver and estoppel (in relation to the SOPA regime) and s 15(3) of the SOPA was examined in detail by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Audi Construction Pte Ltd v Kian </span><span class="font-italic">Hiap Construction Pte Ltd</span> [2018] 1 SLR 317 (“<span class="font-italic">Audi Construction</span>”), where it held that “if a respondent wants to raise a jurisdictional objection before the adjudicator, he must include that objection in the payment response” (at [66]). However, the Court of Appeal later clarified in <span class="font-italic">Yau</span><span class="font-italic"> Lee </span>that the holding in <span class="font-italic">Audi Construction </span>“in relation to the respondent’s duty to speak was never intended to apply to a situation where the payment claim fell <span class="font-italic">outside the purview of the SOPA from the outset</span>” [emphasis in original] (at [56]). For this reason, the court found that the doctrines of waiver and estoppel could not bar the raising of a jurisdictional objection where the objection was that the payment claim fell outside the ambit of the SOPA (<span class="font-italic">Yau</span><span class="font-italic"> Lee </span>at [65]).  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">84 Taking guidance from the legal principle expressed in <span class="font-italic">Yau</span><span class="font-italic"> Lee</span>, BH could not rely on the doctrines of waiver and estoppel, or s 15(3) of the SOPA, to prevent JP from raising or relying on s 4(2)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the SOPA. Indeed, when s 4(2)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) is engaged, it has the effect of placing any payment claims outside the purview of the SOPA. Section 4(2)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the SOPA was inserted by way of amendments to the SOPA in 2018 to add to the list of contracts enumerated in s 4 to which the SOPA does not apply. Section 4(2)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) applies to certain types of terminated contracts and has the same effect as the other provisions in s 4(2) of the SOPA in placing any payment claims made under such contracts outside the purview of the SOPA. Understood in the context of the present case, s 4(2)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) would be engaged if cl 30.3 of the REDAS Conditions is engaged on the facts. As such, the question of whether cl 30.3 is applicable is, in substance, a question of whether the payment claims fell outside the purview of the SOPA. In other words, it is a jurisdictional objection to which the doctrines of waiver and estoppel cannot operate. Support for this conclusion is best expressed in the Court of Appeal’s statement in <span class="font-italic">Yau</span><span class="font-italic"> Lee</span>: that “the duty to speak does not extend to payment claims which are <span class="font-italic">outside</span> the ambit of the SOPA” [emphasis in original] (at [70]); instead, the duty to speak applies to jurisdictional objections “in respect of payment claims that were otherwise within the purview of the SOPA” (at [56]). The doctrines such as estoppel and waiver therefore cannot apply to extend the learned Adjudicator’s jurisdiction to claims which the SOPA was never intended to regulate. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">85 Lastly, as for the issue of whether JP’s failure to raise the <span class="font-italic">functus officio</span> argument in its payment response precluded it from raising it as an objection at the adjudication stage, it is now moot given my findings that the <span class="font-italic">functus officio</span> argument has, in any event, no bearing on the learned Adjudicator’s jurisdiction to determine SOP/AA 164 of 2022.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">86 For the above reasons, I exercise my powers under ss 27(8)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) and 27(8)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the SOPA to set aside the Adjudication Determination and to remit it to the learned Adjudicator for his determination on whether cl 30.3 of the REDAS Conditions, which suspends further payments to BH, has any application in this case. If cl 30.3 applies, PC 40 would fall outside the ambit of the SOPA and SOP/AA 164 of 2022 should be dismissed on the basis that the learned Adjudicator has no jurisdiction. If, however, cl 30.3 is not engaged because the Contract had already been terminated by BH pursuant to its general contractual right to terminate the Contract for JP’s alleged repudiatory breaches, <span class="font-italic">before</span> JP futilely purported to terminate BH’s employment under cl 30.2.2 of the Contract, then PC 40 should be assessed on the merits.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">87 To conclude, I express my gratitude to the learned counsel for both parties for their comprehensive written and oral submissions, from which I derived substantial assistance in the rendering of this judgment. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">88 I will hear the parties on costs.</div><table class="table table-sm table-borderless"><tbody><tr><td><div class="txt-body text-left">Teh Hwee Hwee<br/>Judicial Commissioner</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-left"></div></td></tr></tbody></table><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Lee Peng Khoon Edwin and Amanda Koh Jia Yi (Eldan Law LLP) for the claimant;</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Chuah Chee Kian Christopher, Tan Jia Wei Justin and Huang Zixian (WongPartnership LLP) for the defendant.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
