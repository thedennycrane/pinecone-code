<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       This was an application by the plaintiff for an
                    interim payment of $80,000 from the first defendant pursuant to O 29
                    r 10 of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2006 Rev Ed)
                    (“the Rules of Court”). I granted the plaintiff’s
                    application, and, given the novelty of some of the issues involved, I now
                    provide the grounds of my decision.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       Under O 29 r 11(1) of the Rules of
                    Court, the court has the power to make an order for interim payment, but this
                    power is curtailed in the circumstances provided for in O 29 r 11(2).
                    For convenience, the relevant provisions of O 29 r 11 are as
                    follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>Order for interim payment in respect of damages (O. 29,
                            r. 11)</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>11</b>.—(1) If, on the
                        hearing of an application under Rule 10 in an action for damages, the Court
                        is satisfied —</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(<em>b</em>) that the plaintiff has obtained
                            judgment against the defendant for damages to be assessed;
                            …</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">the Court may, if it thinks fit and subject to paragraph (2), order the
                        defendant to make an interim payment of such amount as it thinks just, not
                        exceeding a reasonable proportion of the damages which in the opinion of the
                        Court are likely to be recovered by the plaintiff after taking into account
                        any relevant contributory negligence and any set-off, cross-claim or
                        counterclaim on which the defendant may be entitled to rely.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(2) No order shall be made under paragraph (1) in an action
                        for personal injuries if it appears to the Court that the defendant is not a
                        person falling within one of the following categories:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(<em>a</em>) a person who is insured in respect
                            of the plaintiff’s claim; or</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(<em>b</em>) a person whose means and resources
                            are such as to enable him to make the interim payment.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       It was not disputed that O 29
                        r 11(1)(<em>b</em>) of the Rules of Court was
                    satisfied, since the plaintiff had obtained interlocutory judgment against the
                    first defendant (see <a href="#p1_9">[9]</a> below). Instead, the
                    dispute was essentially as to O 29 r 11(2), <em>ie</em>, whether the first defendant was “a person who is
                    insured in respect of the plaintiff’s claim” or “a person
                    whose means and resources are such as to enable him to make the interim
                    payment”. Due to the somewhat awkward phrasing of O 29 r 11(2),
                    I should clarify that in these grounds, when I refer to either limb of O 29
                    r 11(2) “applying” or being “satisfied”, I mean
                    that an interim payment cannot be ordered, <em>ie</em>, the
                    defendant is <em>not</em>, for instance, a person who is
                    insured in respect of the plaintiff’s claim.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Background</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Suit 74 of 2010</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       On 15 October 2008, at about 3.03am, while
                    riding his motorcycle along the Pan Island Expressway, the plaintiff was
                    involved in a serious road accident when a motor car (“SGT 6356X”)
                    driven by the first defendant collided into him. As a result of the accident,
                    the plaintiff suffered serious injuries which necessitated the amputation of a
                    portion of his left leg.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       The first defendant was not in fact the owner of
                    SGT 6356X. That person was his sister, Lua Bee Leng Sally (“Sally
                    Lua”), who had been issued a comprehensive motor insurance policy
                    (“the Policy”) by M/s Allianz Insurance Company of Singapore Pte
                    Ltd ( “Allianz” or the “second defendant”, depending
                    on the capacity in which it acted). As required by the Motor Vehicles
                    (Third-Party Risks and Compensation) Act (Cap 189, 2000 Rev Ed)
                    (“the Act”), the Policy provided insurance coverage to Sally Lua
                    and other authorised drivers of SGT 6356X in respect of, <em>inter alia</em>, third party risks. It should be said that the first
                    defendant was driving SGT 6356X with the authority of Sally Lua, and would,
                        <em>prima facie</em> at least, therefore have been
                    insured under the Policy.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       Subsequently, in respect of the accident, the
                    first defendant was charged with, and on 13 August 2010 convicted of,
                        <em>inter alia</em>, an offence of driving while under
                    the influence of drink under s 67(1)(<em>b</em>) of
                    the Road Traffic Act (Cap 276, 2004 Rev Ed).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       The plaintiff then commenced the present suit
                    against the first defendant, who, as is common in these types of cases, was
                    initially represented by M/s Global Law Alliance LLC (“Global
                    Law”), the solicitors for Allianz. On 25 June 2010, however, Global
                    Law wrote to the first defendant, stating that Allianz repudiated liability
                    under the Policy to indemnify him against the plaintiff’s claim, on
                    account of the fact that the first defendant had been driving while under the
                    influence of alcohol. Allianz’s purported repudiation of liability under
                    the Policy was pursuant to cl 5.3, which provided:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>5.3</b>
                
              <b>When are you not insured?</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">You are not insured under any part of this Policy:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">a)    if Your Car is being
                            driven by a person</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">…</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">iv)    who has more than the legal limit of any
                                alcohol in his blood or breath</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       Once Allianz purported to repudiate liability
                    under the Policy, Global Law was no longer in a position to act for the first
                    defendant, and, accordingly, on 26 October 2010 the first defendant engaged
                    M/s KhattarWong to represent him. Immediately thereafter, on 27 October
                    2010, Allianz applied to be joined as the second defendant, represented by
                    Global Law, which application was granted on 24 November 2010. However, at
                    all points in these proceedings, no direct claim was being made by the plaintiff
                    against the second defendant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       On 11 January 2011, the trial was heard by
                    Andrew Ang J, and interlocutory judgment was entered in favour of the
                    plaintiff against the first defendant only, with costs and damages reserved to
                    the Registrar.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Summons 1368 of 2011: first hearing</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     That was the background against which the
                    parties appeared before me on 11 May 2011 in respect of the plaintiff’s
                    application for interim payment. It was quite clear that O 29
                        r 11(1)(<em>b</em>) of the Rules of Court was
                    satisfied (see <a href="#p1_3">[3]</a> above), and so the
                    remaining question was whether O 29 r 11(2) precluded me from
                    entertaining the plaintiff’s application.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     Counsel for the second defendant, Mr Niru
                    Pillai, was unfortunately scheduled to attend another hearing, and therefore was
                    only able to briefly set out the second defendant’s position. This was to
                    the effect that the second defendant did not consider itself to be in a position
                    to consent or object to the application, because it had repudiated liability
                        <em>vis-à-vis</em> the first defendant, and its
                    statutory obligation under s 9 of the Act to satisfy a judgment obtained by
                    the plaintiff was only triggered when the plaintiff obtained a <em>final</em> judgment. Mr Pillai thereafter left it to the
                    first defendant to deal with the plaintiff’s application.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     Counsel for the plaintiff, Mr N
                    Srinivasan, clarified that interim payment was only being sought against the
                    first defendant and not the second defendant. Mr Srinivasan’s
                    submission in support of the application was essentially that, notwithstanding
                    that the second defendant had purported to repudiate its liability under the
                    Policy, nonetheless the first defendant was still “a person who is
                    insured in respect of the plaintiff’s claim”, and therefore
                    O 29 r 11(2)(<em>a</em>) of the Rules of Court
                    did not apply. For this proposition Mr Srinivasan relied on <em>Du Zhao Di (suing as Committee of the Person and Estate of Jiang
                        Hui Ping) v Lee Chee Yian (Mayban General Assurance, intervener)</em>
                    [2007] SGHC 88 (“<em>Du Zhao
                    Di</em>”), which he submitted was on all fours with the present
                    case, save that in <em>Du Zhao Di</em> interlocutory
                    judgment had not been obtained.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     Counsel for the first defendant,
                    Mr Patrick Yeo, objected to the plaintiff’s application. He allied
                    himself with the second defendant’s position and argued that, since the
                    second defendant had repudiated liability under the Policy, and given that the
                    second defendant was not obliged under the Act to satisfy interlocutory
                    judgments, the second defendant was therefore not obliged to meet any order of
                    interim payment. According to the English Court of Appeal in <em>O’Driscoll v Sleigh and another</em> (unreported,
                    20 November 1984) (“<em>O’Driscoll</em>”), cited with approval in <em>Du Zhao Di</em>, the test under O 29 r 11(2)(<em>a</em>) was whether the insurer would be obliged to meet any
                    interim award. Since the second defendant was not so obliged, Mr Yeo
                    submitted, the first defendant was not “a person who is insured in
                    respect of the plaintiff’s claim” and therefore O 29
                        r 11(2)(<em>a</em>) applied, making it
                    impermissible for me to make an order for interim payment.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     There was also some argument as to O 29
                        r 11(2)(<em>b</em>), <em>ie</em>, whether the first defendant was “a person whose means
                    and resources are such as to enable him to make the interim payment”.
                    Mr Srinivasan argued that since the first defendant had been able to retain
                    KhattarWong throughout these proceedings (as well as proceedings in the
                    Subordinate Courts in respect of his criminal charges), O 29
                        r 11(2)(<em>b</em>) did not apply, while
                    Mr Yeo’s response was that no affidavit evidence had been produced by
                    the plaintiff as to the first defendant’s means and
                resources.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     As I required some time to consider
                    parties’ arguments, as well as the applicability of <em>Du
                        Zhao Di</em>, I reserved my judgment.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Summons 1368 of 2011: second hearing</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     After considering the matter, however, I was
                    concerned that certain points had not been fully addressed during the hearing,
                    and I therefore invited parties to clarify the following:</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(a)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">The authorities on which the second defendant
                            claimed to take the position that, under s 9 of the Act, it was
                            only obliged to satisfy final and not interlocutory
                        judgments;</div>

<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(d)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">Whether, if interim payment was ordered, it could

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     Parties appeared before me again on
                    13 June 2011, and, after hearing arguments from counsel for all parties on
                    the above points, I granted the plaintiff’s application.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Issues</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     The issues which arose for my consideration,
                    therefore, were as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_18-p2_a"></a>(a)     Whether, notwithstanding that the
                        second defendant had purported to repudiate its liability under the Policy,
                        the first defendant was nonetheless “a person who is insured in
                        respect of the plaintiff’s claims” within the meaning of
                        O 29 r 11(2)(<em>a</em>) of the Rules of
                        Court; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_18-p2_b"></a>(b)     Who
                        bore the burden of proving whether the first defendant was “a person
                        whose means and resources are such as to enable him to make the interim
                        payment” within the meaning of O 29 r 11(2)(<em>b</em>), and whether that burden had been
                        discharged;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_18-p2_c"></a>(c)     Whether, if neither O 29 r 11(2)(<em>a</em>)
                        nor O 29 r 11(2)(<em>b</em>) was applicable,
                        I ought to exercise my discretion to order interim payment, and if so the
                        amount of interim payment to be granted; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_18-p2_d"></a>(d)     Whether, if interim payment was ordered, it
                        could be paid to the plaintiff personally, or whether, under s 9 of the
                        Act, it had to be paid to the Public Trustee.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">O 29 r 11(2)(a) of the Rules of Court</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     I should say that, unlike the second issue
                    under O 29 r 11(2)(<em>b</em>) of the Rules of
                    Court (see <a href="#p1_47">[47]</a> below), no question of
                    burden of proof arose under O 29 r 11(2)(<em>a</em>), because, as Mr Srinivasan rightly pointed out, the
                    parties being agreed on all material facts, the only questions were questions of
                    law, <em>viz</em>, the meaning of the phrase “a
                    person who is insured in respect of the plaintiff’s claim” and
                    whether the agreed facts fell within O 29 r 11(2)(<em>a</em>) as properly construed. Although this question was ostensibly
                    one of construction of O 29 r 11(2)(<em>a</em>),
                    that task was made more difficult due to the fact that the scheme of compulsory
                    third party motor insurance under the Act had to be taken into account, because
                    whether or not the first defendant was “insured in respect of the
                    plaintiff’s claim” depended very much on some of the provisions of
                    the Act.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The Act</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     The Act originally derived from the UK’s
                    Road Traffic Act 1930 (c 43) (UK) (“the RTA 1930”) and its
                    many iterations, the most material for present purposes being the Road Traffic
                    Act 1934 (c 50) (UK) (“the RTA 1934”), Road Traffic Act 1972
                    (c 20) (UK) (“the RTA 1972”) and Road Traffic Act 1988
                    (c 52) (UK) (“the RTA 1988”). The Act was introduced to
                    ensure that innocent victims of road accidents (“third parties”)
                    would be adequately protected in the event of fatality or bodily injury. As Tan
                    Lee Meng, <em>Insurance Law in Singapore</em> (Butterworths
                    Asia, 2<sup>nd</sup> ed, 1997) explains at p 573:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The [Act], which is intended to safeguard the legal rights of third
                        parties who have been injured or killed by persons who use motor vehicles on
                        the road, establishes a system for compulsory motor insurance in Singapore
                        with regard to third party liability. It requires a motor insurer to meet
                        the insured’s obligations to a third party… in the event that
                        the insured does not do so.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     Some salient features of the Act should be
                    mentioned. Under s 3 of the Act, all users of motor vehicles must be issued
                    an insurance policy which insures the user and other authorised drivers against
                    third party risks, in particular, liability incurred by the user in respect of
                    the death or bodily injury of any person as a result of the use of the motor
                    vehicle (see s 4(1)(<em>b</em>) of the Act). The
                    insured person must also be issued a certificate of insurance under s 4(9)
                    of the Act. Once those requirements have been complied with, the Act’s
                    object is then to see that any third parties who are the victims of road
                    accidents will generally receive the compensation they are entitled to, and it
                    achieves this by, <em>inter alia</em>, statutorily removing
                    some of the insurer’s freedom to contract out of its liabilities to the
                    insured person. Under ss 7 and 8 of the Act, for instance, the third
                    party’s position has been considerably strengthened by legislative
                    intervention, because where these sections apply, certain attempts by the
                    insurer to restrict or exclude its liability under the insurance policy to
                    indemnify the insured person are rendered ineffective, and the insurer will be
                    contractually obliged to indemnify the insured person under the insurance policy
                    in respect of the third party’s claim against the insured person for
                    damages, which sums the insurer may be able to recover from the insured person
                    (as of right in the case of s 8 of the Act, but only if the insurance
                    policy so provides in the case of s 7). As I will be referring to ss 7
                    and 8 later in these grounds, it will be useful to set out exactly what they
                    provide:</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     It was apparent, therefore, that simply
                    because the second defendant had purported to repudiate its liability to
                    indemnify the first defendant under the Policy in respect of the
                    plaintiff’s claim, it did not follow that the first defendant was not
                    therefore “insured”: it might have been that, as a matter of law,
                    such repudiation was ineffective due to one of the provisions of the Act, as was
                    held to be the case in <em>Du Zhao Di</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Du Zhao Di</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     The facts of <em>Du Zhao
                        Di</em>, as Mr Srinivasan noted, were materially similar to those
                    in the present case. The plaintiff and defendant were involved in an accident
                    when the defendant opened the door of his car and the plaintiff, while riding a
                    bicycle, collided into the open door. The plaintiff sued the defendant seeking
                    substantial damages. The defendant was initially represented by lawyers acting
                    for the intervener, Mayban General Assurance Berhad, who had issued a third
                    party motor vehicle insurance policy to the defendant. However, as a result of
                    the defendant’s non-cooperation in the preparation of the defence, the
                    intervener purportedly repudiated liability on the insurance policy. The matter
                    then came before the learned assistant registrar (“AR”)
                    Mr Mohamed Faizal on the plaintiff’s application for an interim
                    payment. One of the grounds on which the intervener opposed the application was
                    that, given that it had repudiated liability to the defendant under the
                    insurance policy, the defendant was not “insured in respect of the
                    plaintiff’s claim” within the meaning of O 29
                        r 11(2)(<em>a</em>).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     The learned AR rejected this argument. He held
                    that the intervener’s repudiation of liability under the insurance policy
                    would not affect the plaintiff for the following reasons:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">33    … Insofar as the [plaintiff] was concerned,
                            such a breach of the insurance contract on the part of the defendant
                            that would afford repudiation can only operate <em>inter
                                partes</em> and not <em>omni partes</em>.
                            Put another way, there was no doubt that, so far as the [plaintiff] was
                            concerned, the [defendant] was covered by a valid policy of insurance,
                            for it is conventional wisdom that “conditions precedent to
                            liability and conditions subsequent to avoiding liability cannot be used
                            in respect of claims by a third party in respect of injury or death
                            which has been caused by the injured tortfeasor”: see Goh-Low
                            Soen Yin <em>et al</em>, “Insurance
                            Law”, <em>Articles on Singapore Law</em>
                            (24, 2005). For that reason, if, in fact, the term does attempt to
                            impinge upon the rights of third parties (such as the [plaintiff] here),
                            it must necessarily be held to be void (at least <em>vis-à-vis</em> the third party), for <b>such
                                a term would be the quintessential form of term that would fall foul
                                of s 7(1) of the Act</b>…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">34    Therefore… I was of the view that the
                            [intervener] would, by virtue of the above reasoning, be treated, so far
                            as the [plaintiff] was concerned, as insurers with a duty to indemnify
                            the defendant in respect of the claim. No reliance can be had to the
                            purported repudiation for the purposes of any action that had been
                            commenced by a third party, since such third party could not, in law, be
                            burdened by the ramifications of such a term that may otherwise be
                            binding on the parties <em>inter partes</em>. As
                            such, <b>it was not open for the [intervener] to argue
                                that there had been repudiation since such repudiation was
                                predicated upon the efficacy of a term that had no effect</b><b><em>vis-à-vis</em></b><b>the [plaintiff]</b>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added in bold]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The learned AR’s reasoning in these passages could be summarised
                    as follows. The intervener’s purported repudiation of its liability under
                    the insurance policy to indemnify the defendant in respect of the
                    plaintiff’s claim was of no effect as far as the plaintiff was concerned,
                    because it fell foul of s 7(1) of the Act (see <a href="#p1_22">[22]</a> above). Therefore, by operation of s 7(1), the
                    intervener was still contractually obliged to indemnify the defendant under the
                    insurance policy in respect of the plaintiff’s claim. As a result, the
                    defendant was to be considered “insured in respect of the
                    plaintiff’s claim” under O 29 r 11(2)(<em>a</em>) of the Rules of Court, and an interim payment could be (and
                    was) ordered.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">O’Driscoll</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     At [35] of <em>Du Zhao Di</em>, the learned AR
                    found support for his approach in the English case of <em>O’Driscoll</em>, where the plaintiff was a passenger in a bus
                    and was injured when the bus braked suddenly, as a result of the first
                    defendant’s motor car losing a wheel and skidding across the road. The
                    first defendant was covered by a policy of motor insurance, which on the face of
                    it covered his potential liability to the plaintiff in respect of the accident.
                    However, as in <em>Du Zhao Di</em> and the present case,
                    his insurers purported to repudiate their liability to him under the policy, on
                    the basis of certain clauses to the effect that the insurers would be relieved
                    of liability if the first defendant’s vehicle was defective or if he
                    failed to give notice of the accident to them within a specified time. The
                    question for the Court of Appeal, therefore, was whether the insurers’
                    purported repudiation of liability meant that the first defendant was not
                    “a person who is insured in respect of the plaintiff’s
                    claims” within the meaning of Order 29, rule 11(2)(<em>a</em>) of the Rules of the Supreme Court (SI 1965/1776) (“the
                    RSC”) (<em>in pari materia</em> with O 29
                        r 11(2)(<em>a</em>) of the ROC).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     Griffiths LJ held that the purpose of Order
                    29, rule 11(2) of the RSC was to ensure that interim payments would only be
                    ordered where it was likely that such an order would be met, either because the
                    defendant was insured and it could be assumed that the insurance company would
                    meet the interim payment, or because the defendant himself had the means and
                    resources to make the interim payment. Griffiths LJ stated that the
                    “obvious purpose” of Order 29, rule 11(2) of the RSC was to ensure
                    that “costs and time are not wasted in making applications for interim
                    payments which, however meritorious, have no realistic likelihood of being
                    met.” Accordingly, his Lordship construed Order 29, rule 11(2)(<em>a</em>) of the RSC as being concerned with whether
                    “there is a policy in existence which obliges an insurer to meet an
                    interim award”. As stated (see <a href="#p1_13">[13]</a>
                    above), this conclusion was adopted by the learned AR in <em>Du
                        Zhao Di</em> (at [37]), and I
                    would add my respectful agreement that Griffiths LJ’s views enunciate the
                    true purpose of O 29 r 11(2) of the ROC.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     On the facts of <em>O’Driscoll</em>, Griffiths LJ held that the application of
                    Order 29, rule 11(2)(<em>a</em>) of the RSC was not
                    attracted, as a result of s 148 of the RTA 1972, subsection (2) of which
                    was in all material respects identical to s 7 of the Act, while subsection
                    (1) corresponded to s 8 of the Act (see <a href="#p1_22">[22]</a> above). It will be recalled that the insurers in <em>O’Driscoll</em> attempted to repudiate liability to the
                    first defendant under the policy pursuant to clauses relating to the condition
                    of the vehicle and notice to be given by the first defendant. Insofar as
                    reliance on the former clause was concerned, that was rendered ineffective by
                        s 148(1)(<em>b</em>) of the RTA 1972
                    (corresponding to s 8(1)(<em>b</em>) of the Act),
                    while the insurer’s attempt to invoke the latter clause was nullified by
                    s 148(2) of the RTA 1972 (corresponding to s 7(1) of the Act).
                    Consequently, Griffiths LJ concluded that “[s]o the position is that
                    insurers will, by virtue of those two subsections, be treated, so far as the
                    plaintiff is concerned, as insurers with a duty to indemnify the first defendant
                    in respect of her claim”, and therefore the first defendant was
                    “insured in respect of the plaintiff’s claim”, and Order 29,
                    rule 11(2)(<em>a</em>) of the RSC did not
                apply.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Discussion</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(1)   Authorities inapplicable</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     Notwithstanding the fact that both <em>Du Zhao Di</em> and <em>O’Driscoll</em> appeared to be strongly in the
                    plaintiff’s favour, I was of the view that neither authority directly
                    applied on the facts of this case, because both judgments turned on legislative
                    provisions which did not apply here.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     Both <em>Du Zhao Di</em>
                    and <em>O’Driscoll</em> relied on s 7 of the Act
                    (or its English equivalent) to hold that the purported repudiations of liability
                    under the respective policies were of no effect (<em>vis-à-vis</em> the plaintiffs). Unfortunately, s 7 of the Act
                    only applies where the contractual clause in question relieves the insurer of
                    liability “in the event of some specified thing being done or omitted to
                    be done <em>after the happening of the event giving rise to a
                        claim under the policy</em>” [emphasis added]. In <em>Du Zhao Di</em>, the “specified thing” was the
                    defendant’s non-cooperation in the preparation of the defence, while in
                        <em>O’Driscoll</em> it was the first
                    defendant’s failure to give sufficient notice. Both of these
                    unquestionably occurred after the happening of the event which gave rise to a
                    claim under the respective policies, <em>viz</em>, the
                    accidents. In this case, however, the “specified thing” was the
                    first defendant’s driving while under the influence of alcohol (see
                        <a href="#p1_7">[7]</a> above), which occurred <em>before</em> the accident, and as a result s 7 of the Act
                    could not apply.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     Admittedly, it was possible to reach a
                    different conclusion if one was inclined to take a very narrow reading of
                    cl 5.3 of the Policy. On such a reading, whether SGT 6356X was driven by a
                    person with “more than the legal limit of any alcohol in his blood or
                    breath” could only be determined with any certainty when the driver was
                    charged or upon his conviction by a court of law, and if so then in this case
                    that determination only took place <em>after</em> the
                    occurrence of the accident giving rise to the plaintiff’s claim. Such a
                    reading of cl 5.3, however, was highly strained and surely did not reflect
                    the intention of the parties to the Policy, and as such was not an
                    interpretation which I considered as being open to me to take.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     The decision in <em>O’Driscoll</em> also rested on the English equivalent of
                        s 8(1)(<em>b</em>) of the Act (see <a href="#p1_28">[28]</a> above), but clearly cl 5.3 of the Policy
                    had nothing to do with “the condition of the
                vehicle”.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(2)   Section 8(1)(<em>a</em>) of the
                Act</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     Notwithstanding this, however, <em>O’Driscoll</em> showed the way forward, because if
                    cl 5.3 of the Policy fell foul of any of the other limbs of s 8(1) of
                    the Act, the second defendant’s purported repudiation of liability under
                    the Policy would have been of no effect <em>vis-à-vis</em>
                    the plaintiff. The prime candidate in this respect was s 8(1)(<em>a</em>), <em>ie</em>, could cl 5.3
                    be regarded as a term of the Policy which purported to “restrict the
                    insurance of the person insured… by reference to… (a) the age or
                    physical or mental condition of persons driving the vehicle”? In other
                    words, could driving under the influence of alcohol be said to relate to a
                    “physical or mental condition”?</p>

                        s 148(2)(<em>a</em>) of the RTA 1988:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The insurers may not rely upon any policy term relating to “the age

                        <b>This provision</b> has been held not extend
                            [<em>sic</em>] to a condition requiring the assured
                        to exercise reasonable care and to employ only steady and sober drivers,
                        although it <b>clearly extends to conditions which purport

                            driven by persons under the influence of drugs or alcohol</b>. In
                            <em>Bernaldez</em> the European Court of Justice
                        confirmed that a compulsory cover could not exclude liability for loss or
                        damage inflicted by a drunken driver. <b>The English courts
                            had independently reached the view prior to the adoption of compulsory

                    they preceded the introduction of compulsory third party motor insurance, and
                    they only decided that, as a matter of public policy, an insured person was not
                    precluded from suing his insurer for an indemnity in respect of liability
                    incurred by him towards a third party who had been killed or injured as a result
                    of the insured person’s criminal conduct, as long as such conduct was
                    negligent rather than intentional (see to similar effect the decision of the
                    Singapore Court of Appeal in <em>The New India Assurance Co Ltd v
                        Woo Ching Fong</em> [1962] MLJ 432). <em>Tinline</em> and <em>James</em>, therefore, were
                    decided solely on the basis that the rule of public policy known as <em>ex turpi causa non oritur actio</em> did not apply, and,
                    because in neither case was there a clause in the insurance policy by which the
                    insurer purported to restrict the scope of the policy or exclude its liability
                    by reference to the insured person’s criminal behaviour, <em>Tinline</em> and <em>James</em> did not
                    need to consider whether the insurers could rely on such a clause.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     In <em>Louden</em> (which
                    was the authority cited in <em>The Law of Motor
                        Insurance</em> in relation to the proposition that
                        s 148(2)(<em>a</em>) of the RTA 1988
                    “clearly extends to conditions which purport to restrict the
                    insurers’ liability where the vehicle is being driven by persons under the
                    influence of… alcohol” (see <a href="#p1_35">[35]</a> above)), the court was required to confront just such a
                    question. There the insured person had taken out a comprehensive motor insurance
                    policy, which contained an exclusion clause stating that the insurer would not
                    be liable under the policy to the insured person in respect of bodily injury
                    “sustained whilst under the influence of… intoxicating
                    liquor”. The insured person died as a result of an accident which
                    occurred while he was under the influence of alcohol, and the question was
                    whether the insurer was liable under the policy to the insured person’s
                    estate. Lawton J held (at 158) that, on the evidence, the insured person
                    had been under the influence of intoxicating liquor within the meaning of the
                    exclusion clause (on which see <a href="#p1_41">[41]</a> below),
                    and gave judgment for the insurer. However, <em>Louden</em>
                    was not directly relevant because, there being no claim by a third party, there
                    was no consideration of the English equivalent of s 8(1)(<em>a</em>) of the Act.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     Similarly, in <em>Marcel Beller
                        Ltd v Hayden</em> [1978] 1 Lloyd’s Rep 472
                        (“<em>Marcell Beller</em>”), a life
                    assurance policy excluded liability for “death… directly or
                    indirectly resulting from… the insured person’s own criminal
                    act”, and the insured person had died in a road accident caused by his
                    driving under the influence of drink contrary to s 5 of the RTA 1972. The
                    court held that the insurer was entitled to rely on the exclusion clause and
                    deny liability to the insured person. Again, however, <em>Marcell
                        Beller</em> was not quite on point because no question of compulsory
                    third party motor insurance was involved.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     The above cases therefore fell into two
                    categories. There were cases (<em>James</em>) which held
                    that, at common law, an insurer could not exclude liability (under the doctrine
                    of <em>ex turpi causa</em>) to indemnify the insured person
                    against a third party’s claim by reference to the insured person’s
                    drink driving, but where the policy in question did not contain an exclusion
                    clause. There were also cases (<em>Louden</em> and
                        <em>Marcel Beller</em>) which held that, at common law,
                    an insurer could exclude liability to the insured person by reference to an
                    exclusion clause relating to his being under the influence of alcohol or his
                    criminal behaviour, but which only concerned the insured person’s own
                    claim, and not a claim by him for an indemnity in respect of damages to be paid
                    to a third party victim.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     Consequently, somewhat surprisingly, it
                    appeared that the question of whether a clause in an insurance policy, such as
                    cl 5.3 of the Policy, which excluded the insurer’s liability to
                    indemnify the insured person against a third party’s claim where the
                    insured person had been driving under the influence of alcohol fell foul of
                        s 8(1)(<em>a</em>) of the Act was untouched by
                    authority, and it was open to me to consider the matter from first
                    principles.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     It seemed to me that there was every reason to
                    construe s 8(1)(<em>a</em>) of the Act as nullifying
                    cl 5.3 of the Policy.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     First, on a literal interpretation, I could
                    not see how a clause in an insurance policy which referred to the driver of a
                    vehicle having “more than the legal limit of any alcohol in his blood or
                    breath” did not relate to the “physical or mental
                    condition” of the person driving the vehicle. A contamination of a
                    person’s bloodstream by a foreign substance (such as alcohol) seemed to me
                    to be eminently a matter of that person’s “physical…
                    condition”. The manner in which the exemption clause in <em>Louden</em> had been construed was also instructive in this
                    regard. Lawton J, in interpreting the words “under the influence of
                    intoxicating liquor”, applied a construction which had long been settled
                    in England since the case of <em>Mair v Railway Passengers
                        Assurance Company, Ltd</em> (1877) 37 LT 356, <em>viz</em>, that those words connoted the disturbance of
                    “the balance of a man’s mind” or “the quiet, calm,
                    intelligent exercise of the faculties” (<em>Louden</em> at 157). That appeared to me to indicate that exclusion
                    clauses in insurance policies which referred to driving under the influence of
                    alcohol (or variants thereof) were to be understood as relating to the
                    “mental condition” of the driver.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     Second, a purposive interpretation (as
                    required by s 9A of the Interpretation Act (Cap 1, 2002 Rev Ed))
                    led to the same conclusion. Section 8 of the Act had its origins in s 10 of
                    the RTA 1934 (see <em>Colinvaux’s Law of
                        Insurance</em> at para 22-036 at fn 309), which was enacted to ensure
                    that the system of compulsory third party motor insurance established by the RTA
                    1930 was not circumvented and undermined by motor insurers contracting out of
                    liability by imposing terms and conditions of their choosing (see <em>Zurich General Accident and Liability Insurance Company, Limited v
                        Morrison and others</em> [1942] 2 KB 53 at 61 to 62
                        (<em>per</em> Goddard LJ)). Section 10 of the RTA
                    1934 (and now s 8 of the Act) was to be seen, therefore, as preventing
                    motor insurers from excluding liability for common risks, in keeping with the
                    avowed purpose of the Act of ensuring compensation to third party victims of
                    road accidents (see <a href="#p1_21">[21]</a> above). Viewed in
                    this light, it was entirely understandable for the UK Parliament to have
                    provided that insurers could not escape liability by stipulating that the
                    insurance policy did not cover liabilities arising, for example, from drivers
                    being underage (now embodied in s 8(1)(<em>a</em>) of
                    the Act), or in poor health (s 8(1)(<em>a</em>)), or
                    from vehicles that were poorly maintained (s 8(1)(<em>b</em>)) or overloaded (s 8(1)(<em>c</em>)
                    and (<em>d</em>)). That these occurrences were frequent
                    dangers in 1934 could be seen from the fact that most if not all of them were
                    prohibited under the RTA 1930 (see for instance ss 3, 5, 9, 25 and 30 of
                    the RTA 1930), and I considered it reasonable to regard driving while under the
                    influence of drink (proscribed by s 15 of the RTA 1930) as a common risk
                    that insurers were to be prevented from deploying as a basis on which to escape
                    liability under the insurance policy.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     In addition, I did not regard this
                    construction of s 8(1)(<em>a</em>) of the Act as being
                    particularly oppressive towards motor insurers, who were, after all, given a
                    statutory right under s 8(3) of the Act (see <a href="#p1_22">[22]</a> above) to claw back from the insured person whatever moneys
                    had to be paid out as a result.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Conclusion on O 29 r 11(2)(a) of the ROC</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     For the foregoing reasons, I concluded that
                    the second defendant’s purported repudiation of liability under the Policy
                    to indemnify the first defendant in respect of the plaintiff’s claim,
                    pursuant to cl 5.3 of the Policy, was of no effect as far as the plaintiff
                    was concerned, by operation of s 8(1)(<em>a</em>) of
                    the Act. As such, the second defendant was still contractually obliged to
                    indemnify the first defendant against the plaintiff’s claim, and that
                    being the case, there was clearly a policy of motor insurance in existence which
                    obliged an insurer to meet an interim payment, and therefore, in accordance with
                    Griffith LJ’s views in <em>O’Driscoll</em> (see
                        <a href="#p1_27">[27]</a> above), O 29
                        r 11(2)(<em>a</em>) of the Rules of Court did not
                    apply.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">O 29 r 11(2)(b) of the Rules of Court</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     It was held in <em>Du Zhao
                        Di</em> (at [29]) that the two
                    limbs of O 29 r 11(2) were to be read disjunctively, so it was
                    sufficient for the success of the plaintiff’s application that at least
                    one of the limbs of O 29 r 11(2) did not apply.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     In the event that I was wrong in my
                    construction of O 29 r 11(2)(<em>a</em>) of the
                    Rules of Court, therefore, it was necessary to consider whether the same result
                    would be reached (<em>ie</em>, that the interim payment
                    could be ordered), because O 29 r 11(2)(<em>b</em>) did not apply.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Burden of proof</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     Given the dispute between the parties over
                    whether the evidence in this case established that the first defendant was
                    “a person whose means and resources are such as to enable him to make the
                    interim payment”, whether O 29 r 11(2)(<em>b</em>) applied turned on the issue of the burden of proof, hence my
                    invitation to parties to address me on this point (see <a href="#p1_16">[16]</a> above).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     Again, what authorities there were shed little
                    light on this matter. Neither <em>Du Zhao Di</em> nor
                        <em>O’Driscoll</em> was applicable, because it
                    was either assumed without argument that the burden rested on the plaintiff
                        (<em>Du Zhao Di</em> at [23] and [30]), or it
                    was accepted that O 29 r 11(2)(<em>b</em>) in
                    fact applied, <em>ie</em>, the defendant did not have the
                    means and resources to enable him to make the interim payment (<em>O’Driscoll</em>). Indeed, I was not directed to any
                    case where the question of the burden of proof under O 29
                        r 11(2)(<em>b</em>) had arisen for explicit
                    consideration.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     Although I was initially inclined to the view
                    that the burden of proof under O 29 r 11(2)(<em>b</em>) rested with the plaintiff, I eventually decided that the
                    burden of proof was on the first defendant, as a result of ss 105 and 108
                    of the Evidence Act (Cap 97, 1997 Rev Ed) (“the EA”),
                    which provide:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">

</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">

                        particular fact lies on that person who wishes the court to believe in its

                        shall lie on any particular person.</p>

                    Steven Chong J approved the view (see <em>Sir John Woodroffe
                        &amp; Syed Amir Ali’s Law of Evidence</em> (V Kesava Rao ed)
                    (LexisNexis Butterworths Wadhwa Nagpur, 18<sup>th</sup> ed,
                    2008) at p 4476) that s 108 was:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… designed to meet certain exceptional cases in which it would be
                        impossible, or at any rate disproportionately difficult, for the [plaintiff]
                        to establish facts which are ‘especially’ within the knowledge
                        of the [defendant] and which [the defendant] could prove without difficulty
                        or inconvenience… The word ‘especially’… means
                        facts that are pre-eminently or exceptionally within his knowledge.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     Whether the first defendant had the
                    “means and resources… to enable him to make the interim
                    payment” within the meaning of O 29 r 11(2)(<em>b</em>) was a fact especially within the first defendant’s
                    knowledge, and the first defendant could (dis)prove it without difficulty or
                    inconvenience, whereas it would be impossible or disproportionately difficult
                    for the plaintiff to prove it. After all, it was hard to imagine who else but
                    the first defendant would have knowledge of his financial affairs. Consequently,
                    the first defendant bore the burden of proving that he was not “a person
                    whose means and resources are such as to enable him to make the interim
                    payment”, whether as a particular fact the existence of which he wished
                    me to believe under s 105 of the EA, or as a fact especially within his
                    knowledge under s 108 of the EA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     I found clear support for this approach in
                        <em>The “Asia Star”</em> [2010]
                    2 SLR 1154, a decision of the Court of Appeal on the duty to mitigate
                    in the context of a breach of a voyage charterparty by the appellant
                    shipowner’s failure to deliver the chartered vessel. In rejecting the
                    respondent charterer’s argument that it had acted reasonably in refusing
                    to spend US$399,500 to engage an alternative available vessel (“the
                        <em>Puma</em>”) and thereby mitigate its loss,
                    because of its impecuniosity, the Court of Appeal held that the burden of
                    proving the fact that chartering the <em>Puma</em> would
                    have been financially prohibitive lay on the respondent, stating (at [63]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In the present case, the respondent wished to rely on the alleged fact
                        that the additional US$399,500 which it would have had to pay if it had
                        chartered the <em>Puma</em> was a financially
                        prohibitive sum that it could not afford –
                        <em>ie</em>, <b>it wanted the court to
                            believe in the existence of this fact (see s 105 of the Evidence
                            Act). This fact was “especially within the knowledge of [the
                            respondent]” for the purposes of s 108 of the Evidence Act
                            since only the respondent could be fully aware of all the relevant
                            particulars of its own financial position at the material

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added in bold]</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Discharging the burden</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     The next question was whether the first
                    defendant had discharged his burden of proof by adducing evidence that he was
                    not “a person whose means and resources are such as to enable him to make
                    the interim payment” under O 29 r 11(2)(<em>b</em>) of the Rules of Court.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     No affidavit evidence was produced by the
                    first defendant to prove that he lacked the means and resources to enable him to
                    make the interim payment. In contrast, as Mr Srinivasan pointed out, the
                    first defendant had retained KhattarWong throughout these proceedings and those
                    in the Subordinate Courts (see <a href="#p1_14">[14]</a> above),
                    and I was entitled to presume under s 116(<em>f</em>)
                    of the EA that, in the common course of business, KhattarWong would have charged
                    (and the first defendant would have agreed to pay) a not insignificant retainer.
                    On that basis, I was not persuaded that O 29 r 11(2)(<em>b</em>) of the Rules of Court had been made out by the first
                    defendant.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Whether to order interim payment and the quantum to be
                ordered</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     This issue could be taken relatively shortly.
                    Since neither O 29 r 11(2)(<em>a</em>) nor
                        (<em>b</em>) of the Rules of Court applied, it was
                    appropriate for me to exercise my discretion to order interim payment in view of
                    the plaintiff’s dire injuries and his consequent need to pay for his
                    medical treatment, which I was told is ongoing. As for the quantum, Mr Yeo
                    very fairly conceded at the first hearing that if interim payment was to be
                    ordered, he would not quarrel with the sum of $80,000.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Whether interim payment was to be paid to the plaintiff
                personally</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     This issue initially arose because I
                    considered it possible that, if s 9 of the Act applied in this case, under
                        s 9(1)(<em>a</em>), an interim payment obtained by
                    the plaintiff against the first defendant, being a sum payable under a judgment
                    in respect of a liability required to be covered by the Policy, had to be paid
                    by the second defendant to the Public Trustee (see <a href="#p1_22">[22]</a> above).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     However, upon further consideration, it became
                    clear to me that s 9 of the Act was not being invoked (because the
                    plaintiff was not making a direct claim against the second defendant but was
                    merely applying for interim payment against the first defendant) and, unlike
                    s 8 (see <a href="#p1_44">[44]</a> above), had no other
                    relevance in this case. Therefore, as a matter of course, interim payment was to
                    be paid by the first defendant to the plaintiff personally.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a>58     I should add that, thus far, I have not
                    referred to the first and second defendants’ submission that, under
                    s 9 of the Act, the second defendant is only obliged to satisfy final and
                    not interlocutory judgments (see <a href="#p1_11">[11]</a> and
                        <a href="#p1_13">[13]</a> above). Nonetheless, as both
                    defendants founded themselves strongly upon this argument, it would be a
                    disservice to their counsels’ efforts if I did not articulate my reasons
                    for agreeing with their submissions, albeit only tentatively, because the
                    question of whether s 9 of the Act applied to interlocutory as well as
                    final judgments appeared never to have arisen before and I was therefore
                    unguided by authority on an issue which was not directly pertinent to this
                    application.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a>59     First, although s 9 of the Act does not
                    in terms distinguish between final and interlocutory judgments, some of the
                    language in s 9, <em>eg</em>, s 9(2)(<em>a</em>) which speaks of a “judgment <em>for a sum</em> not exceeding the relevant amount” [emphasis
                    added] (see <a href="#p1_22">[22]</a> above), more naturally
                    described final rather than interlocutory judgments (see also
                        s 9(3)(<em>b</em>) which speaks of
                    “execution” of the judgment – interlocutory judgments cannot
                    be enforced (<em>Tan Kim Seng v Ibrahim Victor Adam</em>
                    [2004] 1 SLR(R) 181 at [31])).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a>60     Second, in virtually all the cases in which
                    s 9 had been successfully relied upon, the third party had obtained final
                    judgment against the insured person. Indeed, it was difficult to imagine why the
                    third party would need to rely on s 9 of the Act to enforce an
                    interlocutory judgment (obtained against the tortfeasor) against the insurer by
                    applying for an interim payment to be paid by the insurer to the Public Trustee.
                    The only situation in which such a course of action was conceivably necessary
                    was where the insurer had purported to repudiate liability to the insured
                    person, but such repudiation was rendered ineffective <em>vis-à-vis</em> the third party due to ss 7 or 8 of the Act, and
                    the third party had obtained interlocutory judgment and an order for interim
                    payment against the insured person, who then absconded from jurisdiction. Even
                    so, however, it was surely more principled to require the third party to avail
                    himself of the normal measures for executing court orders (to enforce the order
                    for interim payment), and/or proceed expeditiously to final judgment before
                    resorting to s 9 of the Act, than to distort the natural language of
                    s 9 in order to force it to encompass interlocutory
                judgments.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a>61     My attention was also drawn to <em>The Public Trustee Practice Circular 1 of 2004: Administration of
                        Accident Compensation Monies under the Motor Vehicles (Third-Party Risks and
                        Compensation) Act (Cap 189)</em>, para 7 of which stated
                    clearly that “[t]he Public Trustee will not administer any cases for
                    interim payment only”. Although this was, strictly speaking, an
                    administrative restriction imposed by the Public Trustee rather than a legal one
                    under s 9 of the Act, the Public Trustee’s position reinforced the
                    view that, in practice, there was little or no need for the third party to use
                    s 9 of the Act to enforce an interlocutory judgment (obtained against the
                    tortfeasor) against the insurer.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_62"></a>62     Had it been necessary to decide the point,
                    therefore, I should have thought that s 9 of the Act ought to be construed
                    as covering only final and not interlocutory judgments. Fortunately, however,
                    the point did not arise in the present case, and therefore I need say no more
                    about this issue.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_63"></a>63     For all the foregoing reasons, I granted the
                    plaintiff’s application for an interim payment of $80,000 from the first
                    defendant, pursuant to which I made an order in terms of prayers 1 and 2 of the
                    summons.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_64"></a>64     Since the plaintiff succeeded against the
                    first defendant, I ordered that costs of $2,000 be paid by the latter to the
                    former. However, as the second defendant had been unnecessarily burdened by
                    these proceedings despite the fact that the plaintiff had no direct claim
                    against it, I ordered that the plaintiff pay costs of $500 to the second
                    defendant.</p>
