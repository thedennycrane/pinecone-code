Likewise, it should not be surprising when the facts don’t matter, the calibre of advocacy becomes largely irrelevant, and outcomes that leave the average person speechless, confused, and shocked are par for the course</span>.” </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Immediately Singapore sprung to my mind, especially your <span class="font-weight-bold">Opening of the Legal Year 2021 Speech</span>.<span class="font-weight-bold font-italic"> </span>I was also reminded of my fight against a system which I believe is riddled with inequity due to cronyism. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">In your 2021 speech, it wasn’t what you said, but what you didn’t say that I found concerning. You said, “… <span class="font-italic">the quest for a sound system of justice begins with the selection of judges with the appropriate temperament, ability and integrity and commitment to carry out their heavy responsibilities.  But even so, judges are not infallible</span>.”  </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">You didn’t mention that judges in Singapore were selected, in addition to the virtues mentioned, for their courage to seek/determine the truth. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Neither did you mention two very high-profile cases in 2020: that of <span class="font-weight-bold">Li </span><span class="font-weight-bold">Shengwu</span> and that of <span class="font-weight-bold">Lee Suet Fern</span>. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Yes, <span class="font-weight-bold">Parti Liyani</span>, which you did mention, may have been acquitted, but the Singapore system of justice did fail her because justice delayed is justice denied.  In the case of Lee Suet Fern, <span class="font-weight-bold">a Queen’s Counsel has stated</span> that the findings of the Court of Three Judges were “legally unsound” and that it was a “serious error” of judgment to find Lee Suet Fern guilty of professional misconduct. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Neither you nor the Attorney-General made any mention of either of these two cases. This omission led many to question if it was because Li Shengwu and Lee Suet Fern were not prosecuted but persecuted due to a family feud between the Prime Minister and his siblings. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Ironically, Li Shengwu was charged for comments made in a private Facebook post that suggested the judiciary is not independent but is susceptible to influence/pressure from the Government. It wasn’t Li Shengwu who is undermining the confidence in the administration of justice; it is the Courts themselves that is doing just that. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Aristotle stated, “<span class="font-italic">Courage is the mother of all virtues because without it, you cannot consistently perform the others</span>.” </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Were those involved in prosecuting Parti Liyani, Li Shengwu and Lee Suet Fern doing so out of out of a fear of the political elites or as a favour to them?  </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">To the layperson (e.g. me) the action against Parti Liyani appears to be driven by the need to protect the Liew family, while the actions against Li Shengwu and Lee Suet Fern appear to be driven by a fear of the Prime Minister. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">If Lee Hsien Yang’s family members are not safe from persecution, then who is?

Accordingly, Mr Xu takes the position that the court need not make any order as regards the AG’s prayer for him to cease and desist from future publication.

Turning to consider whether the <span class="font-italic">actus reus</span> of s 3(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) is made out, I note that Mr Xu does not dispute that he published the Article.   </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 The dispute accordingly centres on whether the Article imputes improper motives to or impugns the integrity, propriety, or impartiality of any court under s 3(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)(i) of the AJPA. In my view, on an objective interpretation, the Article impugns the integrity and impartiality of the Singapore courts for the following reasons.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 The Article opens by citing an online comment by “Jonathan Pollard, a US-based lawyer”, that “[i]f you build a legal system that is largely political, <span class="font-italic">favours people who have money/power, favours people who knows the judges and are connected to the power structure</span> – it should not be the least bit surprising that the system is riddled with dysfunction and inequity” [emphasis added]. This was followed by “Immediately Singapore sprung to my mind”. It should be clear to any reasonable reader that the author was trying to convey that Singapore’s legal system fits the descriptions by “Jonathan Pollard”, being one that favours those who have money and power and those who know judges. I agree with the AG that such insinuations, especially the insinuation that Singapore’s system favours those who have connections with judges, directly implicates the Singapore judiciary, and impugns the integrity and impartiality of the courts and judges. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 The Article goes on to point out that the Chief Justice’s speech at the Opening of the Legal Year 2021 listed various virtues for which judges are selected, but “didn’t mention that judges in Singapore were selected … <span class="font-italic">for their courage to seek/determine the truth</span>” [emphasis added]. The implication here is that Singapore judges are <span class="font-italic">not </span>selected for their courage to seek or determine the truth. When read together with the previous allegation that Singapore’s legal system favours those with money, power, and connections with judges, I am of the view that a reasonable reader would interpret this portion of the Article to mean that Singapore judges are not impartial and prioritise other considerations over truth-finding in dealing with their cases. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 The Article then refers to recent legal proceedings against Mrs Lee and Mr Li, stating that the omissions of these cases in the Chief Justice’s speech “led many to question if it was because [Mr Li] and [Mrs Lee] were not<span class="font-italic"> </span>prosecuted but persecuted due to a family feud between the Prime Minister and his siblings”. The Article also stated that a Queen’s Counsel had commented that the court’s findings in Mrs Lee’s matter were “legally unsound” and a “serious error” of judgment. In that regard, the Article included a hyperlink to an article by TOC on 11 January 2021 which reported the statements of Timothy Dutton CBE QC and Sir David Thomas Rowell Lewis, the Lord Mayor of London, in which they criticised the court’s decision in Mrs Lee’s matter. Taken together, I am of the view that the Article creates the impression to a reasonable reader that the court arrived at the decision in Mrs Lee’s matter for political reasons, namely, the “family feud between the Prime Minister and his siblings”. This is, once again, a direct attack on the integrity, propriety, and impartiality of the court. The reference to “Queen’s Counsel” also conjures a false sheen of legitimacy which would cause a reasonable layperson reading the Article to form the view that there is some legitimacy to this allegation. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 Next, the following paragraph of the Article states: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… [Mr Li] was charged for comments made in a private Facebook post that suggested the judiciary is not independent but is susceptible to influence/pressure from the Government: <span class="font-italic">It wasn’t </span><span class="font-italic">[Mr Li] who is undermining the confidence in the administration of justice; it is the Courts themselves that is doing just that</span>.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">I am of the view that the emphasised portion of the extract is a direct attack on the Singapore courts. It directly accuses the courts of deciding cases under political influence, rather than on their merits, thus undermining public confidence in the administration of justice. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 The Article then raises the question, “[w]ere those involved in prosecuting Parti Liyani, [Mr Li] and [Mrs Lee] <span class="font-italic">doing so out of out of a fear of the political elites or as a favour to them</span>?” [emphasis added], before stating that “[t]o the layperson (e.g. me) the action against Parti Liyani appears to be <span class="font-italic">driven by the need to protect the Liew family</span>, while the actions against [Mr Li] and [Mrs Lee] appear to be <span class="font-italic">driven by a fear of the Prime Minister</span>” [emphasis added]. These sentences, <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span>, appear to be criticisms directed at the AGC, suggesting that it commenced actions against these individuals out of political motives. However, the Article immediately went on to pose a final question: “If Lee Hsien Yang’s family members are not safe from persecution, then who is? <span class="font-italic">Just how equitable is the system of justice in Singapore</span>?” [emphasis added]. The reference to “the system of justice in Singapore” necessarily includes the Judiciary. Reading these sentences together, I am of the view that a reasonable reader would understand that the criticisms were directed not only at the AGC, but also other institutions in Singapore’s legal system, which includes the Judiciary. The gist of the Article’s allegation is that the AGC and the courts are complicit in the persecution of certain people in Singapore for political reasons.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 For these reasons, I am of the view that the Article, when read as a whole, suggests to a reasonable reader that: (a) the Singapore courts favour those who have money, power or connections with judges; (b) Singapore’s judges are <span class="font-italic">not </span>selected for their courage to seek or determine the truth; and (c) the courts are complicit with the AGC in the political persecution of certain people and are deciding cases based on political reasons rather than on their merits. Therefore, I am of the view that the Article impugns the integrity, impartiality, and propriety of the courts and that s 3(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)(i) of the AJPA is made out.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 Mr Xu argues that he understood the Letter “to be a criticism of the [AGC] in the way prosecutions are handled in Singapore” and “not… as an attack on the integrity of the Singapore Judiciary or an attempt to scandalise it”.

</div>
</div>
</div> In illustrating this, Mr Xu refers to two sentences which say, “[Mr Li] and [Mrs Lee] were not<span class="font-italic"> </span>prosecuted but persecuted due to a family feud due to a family feud between the Prime Minister and his siblings”, and “Were those involved in prosecuting Parti Liyani, [Mr Li] and [Mrs Lee] doing so out of out of a fear of the political elites or as a favour to them?”. Mr Xu argues that these sentences suggest that the author is criticising the AGC, and not the Judiciary, for its role in prosecuting those individuals.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 I see no merit in this argument. As I have explained at [47] above, the attacks were targeted at Singapore’s “system of justice” which necessarily includes the Judiciary. Just because the Article criticises the way prosecutions were handled in these cases does not mean that it cannot also be a <span class="font-italic">simultaneous</span> attack on the Judiciary. This is especially when there are direct attacks on the Judiciary in the earlier parts of the Article, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, that Singapore’s legal system favours those who have connections with the judges, that judges are not selected for their courage to seek or determine the truth, and that the courts are undermining the administration of justice in Singapore. Reading the Letter as a whole, it is clear that while there was criticism of the way prosecutions are handled in Singapore, there was also an attack on the Judiciary’s integrity, propriety, and impartiality. This brings the Letter (and consequently, the Article which reproduced the Letter) within the ambit of s 3(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)(i) of the AJPA.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 Mr Xu also argues that Ms O’Connor is a layperson and that her criticisms of the legal system and “system of justice” in Singapore were not meant to be attacks on the courts. I find this argument unconvincing. First, I am of the view that even to a layperson, the courts will certainly be regarded as part of a country’s legal system. Second, and more importantly, the question for me to decide is not what Ms O’Connor subjectively meant by the statement, but what the objective effect of the statement on the average reasonable person would be: <span class="font-italic">Shadrake</span> at [32]–[35]. As I have explained at [48] above, an objective, reasonable person will understand the Article to be an attack on the integrity, impartiality, and propriety of the courts. Consequently, I find that s 3(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)(i) of the AJPA has been made out.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 Next, I turn to consider whether the Article poses a risk of undermining public confidence in the administration of justice under s 3(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)(ii) of the AJPA. The Court of Appeal has observed that “[a]n assertion that a Judiciary would decide matters otherwise than in accordance with the merits is self-evidently among the most serious attacks that one can make against courts and the administration of justice” and “goes to the very heart and essence of the judicial mission and oath”: <span class="font-italic">Jolovan Wham</span><span class="font-italic"> (CA)</span> at [33]. The Article, as published on the TOC Website, was publicly available. The nature of the assertions made in the Article, as described above, is that the courts decide matters under political influence, rather than in accordance with the merits of the cases. This directly impugns the independence and impartiality of the judiciary and “would necessarily as well as undoubtedly undermine public confidence in the judiciary”: <span class="font-italic">Au Wai Pang</span> at [37]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 Mr Xu argues that if it was so clear that the Article and the Facebook Post pose a risk of undermining public confidence in the administration of justice, the AG would have asked him to remove the posts on 29 January 2021 when investigations started, and not have waited for months before raiding Mr Xu’s home on 8 March 2021 and requesting him to take down the post on 22 June 2021. Mr Xu further claims that the delay was because the police was trying to find evidence suggesting collusion between Mr Xu and Ms O’Connor. After the investigations revealed nothing, the AG commenced the present committal proceeding to “save face”.

</div> This argument is pure speculation on Mr Xu’s part, and there is absolutely nothing to suggest anything improper in the AG’s conduct of these proceedings. In any event, even if there was a delay in the bringing of these proceedings, that does not alter the answer to the question as to whether the Article poses a risk of undermining public confidence in the administration of justice which is determined on an objective basis. Consequently, I dismiss Mr Xu’s argument on this point and find that s 3(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)(ii) has been made out on the facts.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 Turning to consider the <span class="font-italic">mens rea </span>element under s 3(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the AJPA, I note that Mr Xu does not contest this. Mr Xu was the Chief Editor and web publisher of TOC. During investigations, he admitted to intentionally publishing the Article on the TOC Website on 27 January 2021. I reiterate that there is no need to prove that the contemnor had the intention to undermine public confidence in the administration of justice (<span class="font-italic">Au Wai Pang</span> at [17(c)]). Therefore, the <span class="font-italic">mens rea</span> under s 3(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) is made out. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 Lastly, I turn to consider whether the Article constitutes fair criticism. Mr Xu argues that the Article is a fair criticism of the omissions in the Chief Justice’s speech at the Opening of Legal Year 2021,

The requirements of fair criticism have been set out at [17] above.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 I am of the view that the Article does not constitute fair criticism. Although the Article is framed as a criticism of the omissions in the Chief Justice’s speech, the central message it seeks to convey is that the Chief Justice did not mention certain cases because they arose from political persecution and were not determined on their merits by the courts. No objective or rational basis is provided for the allegation that the court rulings against Mrs Lee and Mr Li were made under political influence. The mere reference to a Queen’s Counsel’s criticisms of the findings in Mrs Lee’s case as “legally unsound” does not offer any support for the conclusion that the court’s ruling in that case was the result of “persecution” against Mrs Lee. Furthermore, the allegations do not appear to be made in good faith. The allegations made in the Article impugns the integrity and impartiality of the court, which attacks the “very heart and essence of the judicial mission and oath” (<span class="font-italic">Jolovan Wham</span><span class="font-italic"> (CA)</span> at [33]). Not only are these grave allegations completely unsubstantiated, they are also not made in a respectful or dispassionate manner, with statements describing Singapore’s legal system as being “riddled with inequity due to cronyism” and asserting that “it is the Courts themselves” that are undermining confidence in the administration of justice. Therefore, considering (a) the nature of the allegations in the Article; (b) the lack of any objective or rational basis for such allegations; and (c) the lack of good faith in making such allegations, I am of the view that the statements in the Article do not amount to fair criticism of the courts.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 As both the <span class="font-italic">actus reus</span> and <span class="font-italic">mens rea</span> under s 3(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the AJPA are satisfied, and the Article does not constitute fair criticism, I find Mr Xu guilty of contempt by publishing the Article on the TOC Website. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Contempt by intentionally publishing the Facebook Post on the TOC Facebook Page</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 Next, the AG alleges that Mr Xu also committed contempt under                 s 3(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the AJPA by intentionally publishing the Facebook Post on the TOC Facebook Page.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 In relation to the element of publication, during investigations, Mr Xu admitted that he was the “owner” of the TOC Facebook Page and had sole authority to decide what would be published on it.

These include insinuations that judges in Singapore are not selected for their courage to seek or determine the truth, and that Mrs Lee and Mr Li were persecuted due to a family feud between the Prime Minister and his siblings. The Article thus forms part of the Facebook Post, and the Facebook Post had published and endorsed the views expressed in the Article. My analysis at [42] to [48] applies with equal force to the Facebook Post. Therefore, I find that the Facebook Post imputes improper motives to and impugns the integrity, propriety and impartiality of the Singapore judiciary, and that s 3(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)(i) of the AJPA is satisfied.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 In relation to s 3(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)(ii) of the AJPA, I am of the view that the Facebook Post poses a risk that public confidence in the administration of justice would be undermined.

</div> In the absence of any evidence suggesting that the Facebook Post was posted without Mr Xu’s instructions or knowledge, I find that Mr Xu had intentionally published the Facebook Post on 27 January 2021, and that the <span class="font-italic">mens rea </span>element under s 3(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the AJPA is made out.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 For the same reasons set out at [56], I am of the view that the Facebook Post does not constitute fair criticism.

At the hearing, Ms Tan clarified that this allegation is an alternative one, should liability not be found on the basis of the first two allegations. If liability is found, as is the case now, the question becomes one of whether the refusal to remove may be regarded as an aggravating factor in relation to the punishment to be imposed, to which I now turn.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Punishment </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 Under s 12(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the AJPA, contemnors found liable for contempt of court under s 3(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the AJPA may be punished with a fine of up to S$100,000, or with imprisonment for a term not exceeding three years, or with both.

He had carefully perused the content of the Letter, as evidenced by the stylistic edits he made when reproducing the Letter as the Article and his selection of the accompanying text for the Facebook Post.

</div>
</div> he failed to practise responsible journalism, and instead proceeded to publish scurrilous allegations against the courts in the Article and the Facebook Post to influence the opinions of TOC’s readers on the same morning (27 January 2021) that Ms O’Connor published the Letter on her blog. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 Second, Mr Xu’s culpability is aggravated by the fact that he showed a complete lack of remorse for his actions. He persisted in maintaining the Article on the TOC Website and the Facebook Post on the TOC Facebook Page even after AGC informed him that the publications contained contemptuous allegations. To date, Mr Xu has also not apologised for his actions. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 Third, the Article and the Facebook Post are rife with grave allegations levelled against the Judiciary. As I have mentioned above at [52] and [56], the allegations go to the very heart and essence of the judicial mission and oath, insinuating that the courts decide matters under political influence, rather than in accordance with their merits. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">71 Fourth, the actual and potential reach of the Article and the Facebook Post is another aggravating factor. The Article and the Facebook Post were accessible to the public at large as of 27 January 2021. As mentioned at [11] above, between 18 January 2021 and 24 March 2021, the TOC Website attracted 5,041,423 page views, while the Article on TOC’s Website attracted 4,310 page views. As of 17 June 2021, the TOC Facebook Page was “liked” by 143,718 Facebook users and had 211,343 followers, while the Facebook Post had received a total of 146 Facebook reactions, 31 comments and 44 shares.

</div> Moreover, the Article and the Facebook Post would have been further disseminated in the sense that when a reader “liked”, “shared” or commented on the Facebook Post, it would have actively resurfaced on the news feeds of other individuals. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">72 In light of the above factors, I am of the view that a fine of S$18,000 is an appropriate sentence. Such a sentence is also in line with the sentencing precedents of <span class="font-italic">Au Wai Pang, Jo</span><span class="font-italic">lovan Wham (CA) </span>and <span class="font-italic">Li Shengwu</span>, which are as follows:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) In <span class="font-italic">Au Wai Pang</span>, the contemnor (“Mr Au”) was fined S$8,000 for publishing an article on his blog that insinuated that the Chief Justice and Justice Quentin Loh had rescheduled certain hearings because of their vested and improper interests in upholding the constitutionality of a particular statutory provision. Mr Au removed his contemptuous article from his blog (albeit not the posts responding to the article) after the court granted the AG leave to apply for an order of committal against him (see <span class="font-italic">Au Wai Pang </span>at [3(d)]). Mr Au also apologised for his actions (see <span class="font-italic">Au Wai Pang</span> at [10]).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) In <span class="font-italic">Jolovan Wham</span><span class="font-italic"> (CA)</span>, the contemnor (“Mr Wham”) was fined S$5,000, with one week’s imprisonment in default of payment of the fine. Mr Wham had published a short post on his Facebook profile with a bare statement that Singapore’s judges decide cases with political implications otherwise than in accordance with their merits. Mr Wham did not show any remorse for his post as he refused to remove it from his Facebook profile and apologise for his conduct, even after he was found liable for contempt.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) In <span class="font-italic">Li Shengwu</span>, Mr Li was fined S$15,000, with one week’s imprisonment in default of payment of the fine. Mr Li had published a post on Facebook, that was viewable only by users who were his Facebook “Friends”, which conveyed that the Judiciary decides legal proceedings brought by leaders of the Government in their favour not by reason of the merits, but because it was compliant and subservient to the Government. When the AG demanded Mr Li to delete the offending post, he refused to do so. However, Mr Li amended his post to remove the offending words and clarify what he purportedly meant. That said, Mr Li expressed no contrition and refused to participate in the judicial process of the contempt proceedings. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">73 In my judgment, Mr Xu’s offending conduct is more egregious than that of the contemnors in <span class="font-italic">Au Wai Pang</span>, <span class="font-italic">Jolovan Wham</span><span class="font-italic"> (CA)</span> and <span class="font-italic">Li Shengwu</span> and therefore warrants a higher sentence than those cases. I say this for these reasons.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">74 First, in terms of standing, Mr Xu’s position as Chief Editor of TOC, a media outlet of general interest to the Singapore public, makes him a more prominent figure with a wider reach compared to Mr Wham (a social activist) and Mr Au (a blogger). At the hearing, Mr Lim argued that Mr Xu is in a different position from Mr Li, who is a very public figure in Singapore, being a member of the Prime Minister’s extended family. While Mr Xu, in his personal capacity, may not be a public figure, the TOC is a relatively renowned internet media outlet in Singapore, as evidenced by the millions of page views within a mere span of two months between 18 January 2021 and 24 March 2021. I agree with the AG that Mr Xu’s standing, in his capacity as the Chief Editor of the TOC, is comparable in relation to Mr Li.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">75 Second, the extent of publication in the present case greatly exceeds those in the cases of <span class="font-italic">Au Wai Pang</span>, <span class="font-italic">Jolovan Wham</span><span class="font-italic"> (CA)</span> and <span class="font-italic">Li Shengwu</span>. In <span class="font-italic">Au Wai Pang</span>, Mr Au only posted the contemptuous article on his blog, as compared to Mr Xu who published the contemptuous statements on the website and social media page of a media outlet of general interest to the Singapore public. In <span class="font-italic">Jolovan Wham</span><span class="font-italic"> (CA)</span>, Mr Wham published the contemptuous post on his Facebook account which only had 7,200 Facebook followers (<span class="font-italic">Jolovan Wham</span><span class="font-italic"> (CA) </span>at [20]), as compared to the 211,343 followers that the TOC Facebook Page had. In <span class="font-italic">Li Shengwu</span>, Mr Li only posted his post on a “Friends only” privacy setting; it was one or more of his Facebook “Friends” who republished the Post to the general public. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">76 Third, Mr Xu’s degree of culpability is also higher than those of the contemnors in <span class="font-italic">Au Wai Pang </span>and <span class="font-italic">Li Shengwu</span>. In <span class="font-italic">Au Wai Pang</span>, Mr Au had apologised for his actions, which was taken into account by the judge in determining the appropriate fine (see <span class="font-italic">Au Wai Pang</span> at [10]). In <span class="font-italic">Li Shengwu</span>, although Mr Li refused to delete the offending post or apologise, he amended his post to remove the offending words and to clarify what he purportedly meant. In the present case, not only did Mr Xu refuse to apologise, he also refused to remove the Article and the Facebook Post after the AGC issued him with a letter of demand on 22 June 2021.

</div>
</div>
</div> I agree with the AG that Mr Xu’s actions do not demonstrate any genuine remorse on his part. Indeed, I am of the view that Mr Xu’s removal of the contemptuous material had been selective and belated, and he is more culpable than the contemnors in <span class="font-italic">Au Wai Pang </span>and <span class="font-italic">Li Shengwu</span>. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">78 Therefore, I am of the view that a higher fine should be imposed on Mr Xu as compared to the contemnors in <span class="font-italic">Au Wai Pang</span>, <span class="font-italic">Jolovan Wham</span><span class="font-italic"> (CA)</span> and <span class="font-italic">Li Shengwu</span> and that a fine of S$18,000 is appropriate in the circumstances. This should be paid within four weeks of the sentence. In default of payment of the fine, I impose a term of ten days’ imprisonment. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Other orders sought by the AG </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">79 I now turn to the AG’s prayer for an order that Mr Xu “is to delete the Article and the Facebook Post from the [TOC Website] and the [Facebook Page] respectively, and cease further publication of the Article and the Facebook Post”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">80 In this connection, Mr Xu claims that the operating rights of the TOC Website and the TOC Facebook Page have been transferred to Miao Yi, and that the TOC website was republished by Miao Yi on 16 September 2022. However, it is clear that Mr Xu still has power and control over the content that is published on these platforms. First, the content of the Article was altered in or around December 2022 and replaced with the accompanying statement reproduced at [77] above.

</div> Second, the public announcement on 16 September 2022 that TOC would be revived and relocated was made via a post on the TOC Facebook Page that was signed off personally by Mr Xu.

</div> Third, the current write-up on the “About Us” page on the TOC Website still states that Mr Xu is the “Chief Editor” of TOC.

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">81 These suggest to me that notwithstanding the transfer of TOC’s operating rights to Miao Yi, Mr Xu continues to play a central and active role in TOC, including controlling its online publications. In contrast, there is an absence of evidence from Mr Xu to suggest that he has no control over the contents of the TOC Website and the TOC Facebook page. In fact, he does not address this issue in his affidavit of 14 December 2022 (see [34] above). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">82 As for Mr Xu’s contention that the Article has been removed from the TOC Website, this is not accurate. The title of the Article remains, with the accompanying statement reproduced at [77] above. Therefore, I order Mr Xu to delete the Article from the TOC Website. For the avoidance of doubt, Mr Xu is to remove the title of the Article and the accompanying statement from the TOC Website. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">83 My order, however, does not extend to the removal of the webpage carrying the Article itself, or the accompanying comments on the webpage which are left by readers. The AG asks for the entire webpage to be taken down, so as to include the removal of the comments. The AG argues that the comments continue to breathe life into the initial contemptuous statements in the Article and prevent them from fading from the public spotlight. However, during the further hearing on 1 March 2023, Ms Tan accepted that the comments do not form part of the Article, and that the comments by themselves are not contemptuous. More importantly, the AG’s application in SUM 3816 did not define the Article to include the comments on the webpage. As such, the prayer for the deletion of the Article would not include the deletion of the comments. Accordingly, I limit my order to only a deletion of the Article, including its title and the accompanying statement, from the TOC Website.   </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">84 In relation to the Facebook Post, a deletion order is no longer necessary as it has already been removed, albeit only in January or February 2023. That said, in light of Mr Xu’s cavalier attitude and lack of remorse, I am of the view that it is necessary and appropriate for me to make an order restraining Mr Xu from any future publication of the Facebook Post, along with the Article. In this connection, given his conduct thus far, I do not accept Mr Xu’s bare assertion that he has no intention to republish the contemptuous material. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">85 By reason of the above, I find Mr Xu liable for contempt under s 3(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the AJPA by intentionally publishing the Article on the TOC Website and for intentionally publishing the Facebook Post on the TOC Facebook Page. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">86 I impose a fine of S$18,000 to be paid within four weeks of the judgment. In default of the payment of the fine, Mr Xu is to serve ten days of imprisonment. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">87 Further, I order Mr Xu to delete the Article (being the title and the accompanying statement concerning the removal of the content of the Article) from the TOC Website within seven days of the judgment. As explained above at [83], this does not extend to the removal of the webpage, so as to remove the comments which are left by readers.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">88 As set out in [84] above, I also order Mr Xu to desist from any future publication of the Article and the Facebook Post. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">89 Finally, I deal with the costs of OS 694 (which were reserved) and SUM 3816. Having heard the parties’ submissions, I order costs of OS 694 fixed at $4,000 (all in) and costs of SUM 3816 fixed at $8,000 (all in) to be paid by Mr Xu to the AG. </div><table class="table table-sm table-borderless"><tbody><tr><td><div class="txt-body text-left">Hoo Sheau Peng<br/>Judge of the High Court</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-left"></div></td></tr></tbody></table><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Tan Ruyan Kristy SC, Jean Goh and Sivanathan Jheevanesh (Attorney-General’s Chambers) for the applicant;</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Lim Tean (Carson Law Chambers) for the respondent.</div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"></div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
