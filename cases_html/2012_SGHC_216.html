<p class="Judg-Author">
        Woo Bih Li J:</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       The plaintiff Ong Wui Swoon (“the
                    Plaintiff”) and the defendant Ong Wui Teck (“the
                    Defendant”) are siblings. The Plaintiff alleged that the Defendant failed
                    in his duty as an administrator of their late father Ong Thiat Gan’s
                    estate (“the Estate”) to render an accurate account of its assets.
                    She therefore sued the Defendant, asking him to not only render another account
                    of all the Estate’s assets, but also to pay damages for his alleged breach
                    of duty. The Plaintiff also asserted a beneficial interest in the sale proceeds
                    of a private property, which she claimed the Defendant held on trust for their
                    father.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The facts</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Family background</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The Defendant is the eldest son of Ong Thiat Gan
                    (“the Father”) and Chew Chen Chin (“the Mother”).
                    There were five other children. In descending order of position, their names are
                    Ong Wui Tee, Ong Wui Jin, the Plaintiff, Ong Wui Leng, and Ong Wui Yong
                    (collectively “the Ong Family”). Ong Wui Tee committed suicide in
                    1990.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       The Father died intestate on 14 February
                    1984.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       A schedule of the Estate’s assets
                    (“the Estate Duty Schedule”) was subsequently prepared ostensibly
                    by the Mother and the Defendant. On 13 May 1986, the Deputy Commissioner of
                    Estate Duties certified the payment of estate duty in respect of the
                    Estate’s assets as stated in the Estate Duty Schedule. Later, on 22
                    December 1986, the Grant of Letters of Administration was issued by the High
                    Court. The Mother and the Defendant were appointed joint administrators of the
                    Estate.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       Both parties did not dispute that under the
                    rules of intestate distribution then in force, the Mother as the surviving
                    spouse was entitled to half of the Estate’s assets, and the six children
                    were entitled to the other half equally. Each of the six children was therefore
                    the beneficiary of one-twelfth of the Estate.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       As for the Mother, she passed away on 8 January
                    2005, leaving a will dated 3 January 2005 which named the Defendant as its sole
                    executor. The validity of this will was contested by the other four surviving
                    children of the Mother. Hence, the Defendant filed District Court Suit No 2260
                    of 2005/H (“the 2005 DC Suit”) to uphold the validity of the will.
                    The will was upheld by the District Court in 2007. Appeals from the judgment in
                    the 2005 DC Suit to the High Court (District Court Appeal No 1 of 2008/F) and
                    the Court of Appeal (Civil Appeal No 4 of 2009/Q) were dismissed.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Procedural history</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       The dispute in this action centres primarily on
                    the assets of the Estate.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       The action was originally commenced as
                    Magistrate’s Court Suit No 10516 of 2010/B (“the 2010 MC
                    Suit”). The Plaintiff successfully applied (in Originating Summons No 15
                    of 2011/B) to transfer the proceedings to the High Court.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       At the High Court, the Plaintiff applied for
                    summary judgment (in Summons No 2818 of 2011/C) against the Defendant for him,
                    as one of the Estate’s administrators, to render an account of all the
                    Estate’s assets. (This was one of the reliefs claimed in the amended
                    Statement of Claim.) An Assistant Registrar granted the application on 1 August
                    2011 and ordered the Defendant to give a statement of accounts by 15 August 2011
                    (“the Summary Judgment”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     On 8 August 2011, the Defendant tendered what
                    he claimed to be an accurate account of all the Estate’s assets
                    (“the August 2011 Account”) to the High Court and the
                        Plaintiff.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The residential properties</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     Before I proceed further, I would elaborate on
                    three residential properties which were mentioned in this dispute.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     The first property is a Housing and
                    Development Board (“HDB”) flat located at Block 72, Marine Drive,
                    #22-65, Singapore 440072 (“the Marine Drive flat”). According to
                    the Defendant, it was owned by the Father and the Mother in joint tenancy until
                    the Father died, and, subsequently, solely by the Mother until her
                        death.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span> The Defendant also told the Court that
                    the Marine Drive flat had recently been sold, but no further details were
                        provided.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     The second property is a private apartment
                    located at 30B Sea Avenue, Singapore 424251 (“the Sea Avenue
                    property”). It was bought in 1983 for a stated price of
                        $330,000.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span> This property was transferred to the
                    Defendant upon completion of that purchase.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     The Defendant claimed that the true purchase
                    price of the Sea Avenue property was $323,000 as a result of a vendor’s
                    rebate of $7,000 (because the actual size of the Sea Avenue property was smaller
                    than the vendor had represented).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_5" id="Ftn_5_1"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span> Apart from the Defendant’s
                    oral testimony, only two pieces of (circumstantial) evidence of this rebate were
                    presented to the Court. The first was a handwritten squib
                    “S$323,000” on a letter of inquiry dated 23 May 1984 from the
                    Inland Revenue Department to the Defendant.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_6" id="Ftn_6_1"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span> The second was the Notes of Evidence
                    of the 2005 DC Suit, which showed the Defendant’s brother Ong Wui Jin
                    testifying under oath that the Sea Avenue property cost $323,000.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_7" id="Ftn_7_1"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     On 6 June 2002, the Sea Avenue property was
                    sold by the Defendant for $575,000.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_8" id="Ftn_8_1"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     The third property is a private property
                    located at 114 Pemimpin Place, Singapore 576111 (“the Pemimpin Place
                    property”). On 10 December 1998, it was bought and transferred to the
                    Defendant’s wife, Doreen Tay, for a stated price of $888,000.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_9" id="Ftn_9_1"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span> Apparently, the
                    Defendant and his wife reside there.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The Plaintiff’s claims</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     Dissatisfied with the alleged incompleteness
                    and inaccuracy of the August 2011 Account given by the Defendant and having
                    received no distribution from the Estate, the Plaintiff sought an account from
                    the Defendant of all the Estate’s assets, as well as damages for the
                    Defendant’s breach of duty as an administrator of the Estate.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_10" id="Ftn_10_1"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     The Plaintiff also claimed that the Sea Avenue
                    property was held by the Defendant on trust for the Father from the time of
                    purchase in 1983, and subsequently for the benefit of the Estate upon the
                    Father’s death.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_11" id="Ftn_11_1"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     It was further asserted that the Defendant, in
                    breach of trust, “converted” to his own use the rental collected
                    from the Sea Avenue property and the sale proceeds of said property.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_12" id="Ftn_12_1"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     The Plaintiff lastly alleged that the sale
                    proceeds of the Sea Avenue property could be traced into the purchase of the
                    Pemimpin Place property. She therefore claimed a beneficial interest in the
                    Pemimpin Place property too.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_13" id="Ftn_13_1"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The Defendant’s response</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     The Defendant maintained that the August 2011
                    Account was accurate.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     He denied that he had wrongfully and in breach
                    of trust converted the Estate’s assets, since the balance of the Estate
                    was “negative” and there was thus nothing to convert. In fact, the
                    Defendant said that he remained in deficit as a result of not being able to get
                    reimbursement for the testamentary and administration expenses he incurred on
                    behalf of the Estate.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_14" id="Ftn_14_1"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     The Defendant also argued that the Sea Avenue
                    property was never held on trust for the Father, and that this must have been so
                    since the latter did not intend to contravene the HDB and Central Provident Fund
                    (“CPF”) rules.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_15" id="Ftn_15_1"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span> There was consequently no
                    breach of trust to complain about.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     Finally, the Defendant said that there was no
                    question of the Plaintiff having any beneficial interest in the Pemimpin Place
                    property, since he had not used the sale proceeds of the Sea Avenue property
                    towards the purchase of the Pemimpin Place property (an asset in which the
                    Defendant himself had no beneficial interest at all).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_16" id="Ftn_16_1"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The preliminary issues of limitation, laches and
                acquiescence</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     The Defendant raised a preliminary argument to
                    the Plaintiff’s claims. As the Plaintiff had commenced the present action
                    some 27 years after the Father’s death, the Defendant contended that a
                    statutory limitation period barred the Plaintiff’s claims. For the same
                    reason, the doctrines of laches and/or acquiescence should apply as
                        well.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_17" id="Ftn_17_1"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     The Plaintiff argued however that limitation
                    did not apply because she could not, even with reasonable diligence, have found
                    out about the Defendant’s fraudulent breach of trust until the occasion of
                    the Defendant’s oral testimony in the 2005 DC Suit.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_18" id="Ftn_18_1"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a></span> She also
                    argued that the Defendant was, for a similar reason, not entitled to rely on the
                    doctrines of laches and acquiescence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     After careful consideration, it is my view
                    that the defences of limitation, laches or acquiescence could not avail the
                    Defendant of any relief, but not for the reasons the Plaintiff put forth. As I
                    will explain at [42]-[44] below, I do not need in this case to inquire into the
                    merits of the arguments raised by each party. Since submissions were made by
                    both sides, however, I will pass brief remarks on their arguments. I then set
                    out my reasons as to why, in the circumstances, the Defendant’s
                    contentions on limitation, laches and acquiescence were moot.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The defence based on the Limitation Act</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     Before I discuss the statutory provisions, I
                    would note as a matter of definition that “trust” as defined in
                    the Limitation Act (Cap 163, 1996 Rev Ed) (“Limitation Act”)
                    includes the duties incident to the office of a personal representative, and
                    “trustee” includes a personal representative (s 2(1) of the
                    Limitation Act, read with s 3 of the Trustees Act (Cap 337, 2005 Rev Ed)). As an
                    administrator of the Estate, the Defendant was a “trustee” for the
                    purposes of the Limitation Act.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     In response to the Plaintiff’s claims
                    for, <em>inter alia</em>, an account of the Estate’s
                    assets and an interest in the Pemimpin Place property as the asset into which
                    the sale proceeds of the Sea Avenue property could be traced, the Defendant
                    relied on the statutory time bar provided in s 23 of the Limitation
                        Act.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_19" id="Ftn_19_1"><sup>[note: 19]</sup></a></span> That section reads as follows:</p>

<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(<em>b</em>)    to recover from

                                to his use.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     Notwithstanding that both parties appeared to
                    accept the application of s 23 to the Plaintiff’s claims, this was not so
                    obvious to me. For example, as regards the claim to trace the proceeds of the
                    sale of the Sea Avenue property, it is arguable that the Defendant should have
                    pleaded s 21 of the Limitation Act (that section is titled “Limitation of
                    actions to recover money secured by mortgage or charge or to recover proceeds of
                    sale of land”). Then, as against the Plaintiff’s claim for an
                    account of the Estate’s assets, s 6(2) of the Limitation Act seemed to be
                    the more suitable provision applicable. Section 6(2) reads as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>6.</b>—(2) An action for an account shall
                        not be brought in respect of any matter which arose more than 6 years before
                        the commencement of the action.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     Therefore, while I do not wish to express any
                    definitive view on this matter, it seems that the time bar provided in s 23 of
                    the Limitation Act may not apply to <em>all</em> actions in
                    relation to the administration of a deceased person’s estate. That section
                    may apply <em>only</em> to actions brought <em>in respect of a claim to the personal estate of a deceased person
                        or any share or interest thereof</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     In this regard, I refer to the views expressed
                    by Chadwick LJ in <em>Re Loftus</em> [2007] 1 WLR 591
                        (“<em>Loftus</em>”). The plaintiffs there
                    had claimed, <em>inter alia</em>, for an account of the
                    administration of the estate to be rendered by the defendant administratrix. The
                    trial judge accepted that this claim fell within s 22(<em>a</em>) of the UK Limitation Act 1980 (c 58) (“UK Limitation
                    Act 1980”), which is <em>in pari </em><em>materia</em> with s 23(<em>a</em>) of
                    our Limitation Act (see [29] above).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     On appeal, however, Chadwick LJ (with whom the
                    other members of the court agreed) held that this was an incorrect position for
                    the trial judge to have taken (<em>Loftus</em> at [19] and
                    [32]):</p>

                … I find it
                            difficult to understand why a claim against an administrator for an
                            account of the assets an unadministered estate [<em>sic</em>] which have come into his or her hands (and for
                            payment of the amount found due on the taking of that account) should
                            not fall within section 21(1) of the 1980 Act—read with section 23
                            of the Act. And, if the claim does fall within section 21(1) of the Act,

                            the duty to account.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     I will make only two observations on these
                    provisions cited immediately above. First, s 21(1)(<em>b</em>) of the UK Limitation Act 1980 is <em>in pari
                        </em><em>materia</em> with s 22(1)(<em>b</em>) of our Limitation Act (see [30] above).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     Second, s 23 of the UK Limitation Act 1980 is
                    phrased and intended to operate in a different way from s 6(2) of our Limitation
                    Act (see [31] above). The former provision allows for a <em>varying</em> limitation period depending on the claim which is the
                    basis of the duty to account. Less charmingly put, the limitation period in the
                    UK for an action for an account is “parasitic” on the limitation
                    period relating to some other independent cause of action (Andrew McGee,
                        <em>Limitation Periods</em> (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 6th
                    Ed, 2010) at para 17.002). The latter provision, however, lays down a <em>fixed</em> limitation period of six years for an action for
                    an account. This difference in the Singapore and UK positions appears not to
                    have been noticed by the contributors to <em>Halsbury’s
                        Laws of Singapore</em> (see vol 9(4) (LexisNexis, 2012 Reissue) at
                    para 110.950) where they assert the UK position instead of the Singapore
                    one.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     
          <em>Loftus</em> is law in
                    the UK that, in the context of estate administration, the limitation period
                    applicable to an action for an account and for payment of amounts found due upon
                    the taking of the account is <em>not</em> that laid down in
                    respect of claims to the personal estate of a deceased person. Rather, such an
                    action for an account and payment is seen as a claim to trust property in the
                    possession of the personal representative. In Singapore, the situation is less
                    clear since the action for an account <em>by itself</em>
                    may already be caught by s 6(2) of our Limitation Act. There is an important
                    question as to how ss 6(2), 22(1) and 23(a) of our Limitation Act operate
                        <em>inter se</em> in actions for an account in the
                    context of estate administration (see, <em>eg</em>, the
                    Straits Settlements case of <em>Re Yap Teck </em><em>Hee</em> (1940) 9 MLJ 122 at 125-126, where the court in an
                    estate administration suit dealt with the arguments on limitation by looking at
                    the substance and not the form of the claimed relief). However, as this issue
                    was not argued before me and is, in any event, moot as explained later below at
                    [42]-[44], I will say no more.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Laches and acquiescence</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     In addition to the Limitation Act, the
                    Defendant also pleaded the equitable doctrines of laches and acquiescence. If a
                    defence based on the Limitation Act fails, this does not end the inquiry.
                    Section 32 of the Limitation Act states that nothing in that Act “shall
                    affect any equitable jurisdiction to refuse relief on the ground of
                    acquiescence, laches or otherwise”. It has been repeatedly held that
                    s 32 preserves a defendant’s right to raise a defence of laches or
                    acquiescence, notwithstanding the operation of any provision in the Limitation
                    Act (see, <em>eg</em>, <em>Re Estate of Tan
                        Kow </em><em>Quee</em> [2007] 2 SLR(R) 417 at
                    [27]-[31] (“<em>Tan Kow </em><em>Quee</em>”)).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     In the circumstances, however, the arguments
                    on laches and acquiescence could be disposed of without inquiring into their
                    merits (see [42]-[44] below). If I had found it necessary to so inquire,
                    however, it was arguable that the Plaintiff’s claims were barred by
                    laches. First, the period between the Father’s death and the commencement
                    of the instant proceedings was some 27 years. That is without doubt a long
                    period of time. One of the factors in <em>Tan Kow
                        </em><em>Quee</em> supporting the defence of
                    laches there was the deceased having passed away some 50 years before the action
                    was instituted.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     Second, it was relevant that, during the
                    interim delay of 27 years, one of the administrators of the Estate (<em>viz</em>, the Mother) had passed away. Given that the
                    Plaintiff already believed <em>prior</em> to the
                    Mother’s death, rightly or wrongly, that there was at least one
                    significant Estate asset (<em>ie</em>, the Sea Avenue
                    property) left undistributed in the hands of the Defendant (see [122] and [125]
                    below), it was unclear why the Plaintiff had not brought proceedings against the
                    Defendant any sooner to claim either for an account of the administration of the
                    Estate or for the Sea Avenue property itself (or its sale
                proceeds).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The failure to appeal against the Summary Judgment is
                dispositive</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     As I have mentioned, however, I am content to
                    dispose of both parties’ arguments on limitation, laches and acquiescence
                    on another ground.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     It will be remembered that the Summary
                    Judgment was given on 1 August 2011 (see [9] above). That required the Defendant
                    to produce a statement of accounts of the Estate’s assets. The Defendant
                    did not challenge the Summary Judgment by way of an appeal. For this reason, the
                    Plaintiff pointed out that the Defendant’s liability to account was not in
                        dispute.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_21" id="Ftn_21_1"><sup>[note: 21]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     In my view, the Defendant’s failure to
                    appeal against the Summary Judgment is dispositive of the issue, and obviates
                    the need in this case to examine the merits of any argument on limitation,
                    laches or acquiescence. The Summary Judgment is an Order of Court requiring
                    compliance with the orders made therein, until and unless it is subsequently set
                    aside by another ruling. There was no appeal by the Defendant against the
                    Summary Judgment. Indeed, he even sought to comply with the Summary Judgment by
                    producing the August 2011 Account. It is therefore no longer open to the
                    Defendant to argue the defences of limitation, laches or
                acquiescence.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The disputed matters in this case</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     Having dealt with the preliminary issue of the
                    defences of limitation, laches and acquiescence, I now focus on the substantive
                    matters which were contested by each side.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The Defendant’s admission of liability for
                non-distribution</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     It was not disputed by both parties that,
                    after the Father died in 1984, the Defendant told the Plaintiff that the Estate
                    was “negative”, meaning that its liabilities exceeded its
                    assets.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     The evidence as to precisely when the
                    Defendant told the Plaintiff this was unclear. According to the Plaintiff, it
                    was said some time after the Father’s death but before she was chased out
                    of the Marine Drive flat by the Defendant in 1989.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_22" id="Ftn_22_1"><sup>[note: 22]</sup></a></span> The Defendant denied she
                    was chased out, however, and stated that the Plaintiff moved out because she
                    could not get along with Ong Wui Tee, who had mild mental depression then. The
                    Defendant insisted that this was for the Plaintiff’s own
                        safety.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_23" id="Ftn_23_1"><sup>[note: 23]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     The Defendant also did not say exactly when he
                    told the Plaintiff that the Estate was “negative”. In his
                    affidavit of evidence-in-chief (“AEIC”), he stated that after the
                    grant of letters of administration to the Mother and himself, they discovered
                    that they were unable to realise the Father’s shares in some private
                    companies and consequently, the Estate was “negative”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_24" id="Ftn_24_1"><sup>[note: 24]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     The Defendant also said that he thought the
                    balance “negative” at that time because “after deducting
                    the assets not available for intestate distribution … the remaining
                    assets realised [were] not … enough to cover the liabilities and
                    testamentary and administrative expenses incurred”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_25" id="Ftn_25_1"><sup>[note: 25]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     In his AEIC, the Defendant stated that
                    “whatever was realised was only enough to pay the estate
                        duty”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_26" id="Ftn_26_1"><sup>[note: 26]</sup></a></span></p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     To the Plaintiff, these answers constituted an
                    admission by the Defendant that the latter had breached his duties as an
                    administrator of the Estate by failing to distribute the Estate’s assets
                    to the beneficiaries. This led the Plaintiff to file a Magistrate’s
                    Complaint (“MAG-3392-2006”) on
                        17 October 2006.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_28" id="Ftn_28_1"><sup>[note: 28]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     However, MAG-3392-2006 was closed without any
                    findings made by the Magistrate.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_29" id="Ftn_29_1"><sup>[note: 29]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     On the other hand, the Defendant insisted that
                    the purported admission of liability in the 2005 DC Suit arose:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_30" id="Ftn_30_1"><sup>[note: 30]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">from a mistaken belief that my father’s CPF was meant for intestate
                        distribution … [C]larification was subsequently given during DC
                        2260/2005/H itself that my father had nominated my mother for his CPF, which
                        hence became unavailable for intestate distribution. <em>My
                            admission … was made on the premise of joint and several
                            liability, by virtue of the CPF going to my mother instead of the
                            estate, if such was not in accordance with the rules of distribution
                            under the Intestate Succession Act, and not that I admitted to breach of
                            trust by converting and taking assets for my own use</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     What I understood the Defendant to be saying
                    was this: he had admitted to breaching his duties as an estate administrator
                        <em>only because</em> he had (mistakenly) thought that
                    the Father’s CPF monies—which went to the Mother—were to be
                    distributed amongst <em>all</em> the beneficiaries. After
                    the Defendant found out that those monies were given lawfully to the Mother in
                    her capacity as the Father’s CPF nominee, the Defendant ceased to have any
                    liability since (in his view) there was no breach in the first place. However,
                    the Defendant was unclear or unforthcoming as to when he actually discovered the
                    above information and why he did not discover it earlier.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_31" id="Ftn_31_1"><sup>[note: 31]</sup></a></span> I do not
                    accept his explanation for his admission. I am of the view that he did admit in
                    the 2005 DC Suit that he was in breach of his duties as an administrator of the
                    Estate and he was using the Mother as an excuse.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Did the Estate have money to send Ong Wui Yong for an overseas
                education?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     In the course of cross-examination, the
                    Defendant was asked to explain one particular incident relating to the outgoings
                    of the Estate. This was the matter of Ong Wui Yong’s educational expenses.
                    Ong Wui Yong is the youngest sibling.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     The Defendant claimed that all the members of
                    the Ong Family attended a family meeting in 1988. At the meeting, the matter of
                    funding Ong Wui Yong’s university education in the United States was
                        raised.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_32" id="Ftn_32_1"><sup>[note: 32]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a>58     The meeting agreed that the residual funds of
                    the Estate would be used to finance Ong Wui Yong’s education in the United
                    States, <em>in lieu of reimbursement to the Defendant for the
                        testamentary and administration expenses incurred by the
                        Defendant</em>. This was the Defendant’s position in the August
                    2011 Account, his AEIC,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_33" id="Ftn_33_1"><sup>[note: 33]</sup></a></span> and in his oral testimony.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_34" id="Ftn_34_1"><sup>[note: 34]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a>59     However, the Defendant had also said that the
                    balance of the Estate was “negative” (see above at [46]-[49]). He
                    now appeared to throw this statement into doubt by his own testimony that
                        <em>the Estate had money to pay for Ong Wui Yong’s
                        overseas education</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a>60     After much “clarification” from
                    the Defendant, I understood the Defendant to be saying this: it was the
                    Defendant’s altruism which led him to forego any reimbursement from the
                    Estate for the testamentary and administrative expenses he had incurred on
                    behalf of the Estate. Instead, some of the Estate’s funds would be
                    channelled to finance Ong Wui Yong’s overseas education. The Defendant had
                    listed the testamentary and administrative expenses in the August 2011 Account
                    and this contributed to the final negative figure in the August 2011 Account
                    (see [65]-[66] below). However, the August 2011 Account did <em>not</em> refer to payment of expenses for Ong Wui Yong’s
                    overseas education.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a>61     The Plaintiff, on the other hand, denied that
                    the 1988 meeting even took place. She was therefore not aware that the
                    Estate’s funds had been used to finance Ong Wui Yong’s overseas
                        education.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_35" id="Ftn_35_1"><sup>[note: 35]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_62"></a>62     The burden of proof was on the Defendant to
                    establish that the family had reached the alleged agreement. In the absence of
                    further evidence and the absence of documentary evidence to show that the
                    Estate’s funds had been used to finance Ong Wui Yong’s overseas
                    education, I reject the Defendant’s assertions.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The Defendant’s accounts of the Estate’s assets</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_63"></a>63     I come now to one of the main points of
                    contention between the parties. The Plaintiff alleged that the Defendant’s
                    accounts of the Estate’s assets, as presented in the Estate Duty Schedule
                    and the August 2011 Account (collectively “the Accounts”), were
                    incomplete and inaccurate. Her allegation was based on certain documents in a
                    file which she claimed to have retrieved from Ong Wui Jin in July 2011
                    (“the Estate file”), after she threatened that sibling with legal
                    action if he did not hand it to her.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_36" id="Ftn_36_1"><sup>[note: 36]</sup></a></span></p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_66"></a>66     Presumably, the Defendant was also relying on
                    the negative figure finally arrived at in the August 2011 Account to support his
                    contention that the balance of the Estate was “negative” (see
                    [46]-[49] above).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Were the Accounts complete and accurate?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_67"></a>67     As mentioned, the Plaintiff argued that the
                    August 2011 Account was incomplete and inaccurate.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_68"></a>68     Before I deal with each of the various assets
                    which she claimed were owned by the Estate and unaccounted for, I should point
                    out that the Plaintiff engaged a certified public accountant Mr Ong Boon Lee
                    (“the Accountant”) to comment on the August 2011 Account. A report
                    dated 18 April 2012 was subsequently prepared by the Accountant (“the
                        Report”).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_37" id="Ftn_37_1"><sup>[note: 37]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_69"></a>69     The Report provided the following
                    information:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_69-p2_a"></a>(a)     the amounts received by the Estate
                        for its shares in Mecman Engineering Consultants Pte Ltd
                        (“Mecman”) and Kenwell Freight Express (S) Pte Ltd
                        (“Kenwell Freight”) were $5,365.68 (22,357 shares at $0.24 per
                        share) and $4,708 (4,400 shares at $1.07 per share)
                    respectively;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_69-p2_b"></a>(b)     the
                        estimated scrap value of a car owned by the Father was $6,000. I add that
                        the car was a Mercedes Benz 200 with the licence plate number EE 2226 S
                        (“the Car”); and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_69-p2_c"></a>(c)     the share prices of certain Malaysian companies as at 23
                        March 2012 were:</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_69-p2_c-p3_i"></a>(i)       United Plantations Bhd at
                            $10.33 (RM 24.80/2.4) per share;</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_69-p2_c-p3_ii"></a>(ii)       Malaysian Resources Corp Bhd at $0.79 (RM
                            1.9/2.4) per share.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">These amounts and
                    valuations were not challenged by the Defendant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_70"></a>70     The Report also mentioned that the Defendant
                    had admitted on 9 September 2010 (in the 2010 MC Suit; see above at [8])
                    that the Sea Avenue property, which was purchased with a gift of $85,000 from
                    the Father, was held in trust for the Estate. It went on to say that the $85,000
                    was 25.76% of the purchase price of $330,000 and as the Sea Avenue property had
                    been sold for $575,000, the Estate’s share of those proceeds was 25.76% of
                    $575,000, or $148,120.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_71"></a>71     I would say at the outset that as regards the
                    statement in the Report about the Defendant having admitted in the 2010 MC Suit
                    that the Sea Avenue property was held on trust for the Estate, the Accountant
                    had simply adopted the Plaintiff’s allegation.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_38" id="Ftn_38_1"><sup>[note: 38]</sup></a></span> He did
                    not appear to have checked the veracity of the allegation for himself because,
                    as I will elaborate below, the evidence on which the Plaintiff was relying did
                    not amount to such an admission by the Defendant. Indeed, the Defendant was
                    rejecting any suggestion of such a trust.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_72"></a>72     The Report was therefore not helpful on the
                    Sea Avenue property which was the most valuable asset in issue. With that, I
                    turn now to the assets which the Plaintiff claimed belong to the Estate or which
                    were otherwise stated in the Accounts.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">(1)   Shares in Kenwell Freight and Mecman </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_73"></a>73     The Plaintiff claimed that the Estate’s
                    shares in Kenwell Freight and Mecman were wrongly stated as being unrealised in
                    the August 2011 Account.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_74"></a>74     The Defendant admitted that the Estate’s
                    shares in Kenwell Freight and Mecman were realised sometime in 1988 (“the
                    Realised Shares”).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_39" id="Ftn_39_1"><sup>[note: 39]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_75"></a>75     According to written correspondence in June
                    1988 between the Estate and Kenwell Freight, Kenwell Freight agreed to
                    repurchase the Estate’s 4,400 shares in Kenwell Freight at $1.07 per
                    share, making a total of $4,708.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_40" id="Ftn_40_1"><sup>[note: 40]</sup></a></span> Similarly, letters in June and July
                    1988 showed that Mecman agreed to buy the Estate’s 22,357 shares in Mecman
                    at $0.24 per share, making a total of $5,365.68.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_41" id="Ftn_41_1"><sup>[note: 41]</sup></a></span> Presumably, this was how the
                    Accountant had derived the same figures as stated in the Report.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_76"></a>76     The sale proceeds from the Realised Shares
                    therefore amounted to $10,073.68 (“the Shares Sale
                    Proceeds”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_77"></a>77     However, the Defendant claimed that $5,000 of
                    the Shares Sale Proceeds had been used to repay one Mr Eu Siak Fu, a creditor of
                    the Father.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_42" id="Ftn_42_1"><sup>[note: 42]</sup></a></span>
                    Nevertheless, the Defendant was not able to provide any evidence, apart from his
                    own testimony, of the payments to Mr Eu.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_78"></a>78     Mr Eu was not listed as a creditor of the
                    Estate in the Estate Duty Schedule. The Defendant, when cross-examined on this,
                    first said that Mr Eu had not approached the Estate “prior to [the] grant
                    of probate [<em>sic</em>]”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_43" id="Ftn_43_1"><sup>[note: 43]</sup></a></span> When counsel
                    then asked why an amended schedule was not filed subsequently in order to reduce
                    the quantum of estate duty, the Defendant replied that he could not recall but
                    the sum was “not significant enough to do that [since] the legal fees
                    would have been much more”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_44" id="Ftn_44_1"><sup>[note: 44]</sup></a></span> In any event, the Defendant did
                    not disclose in the August 2011 Account that he had received the Shares Sale
                    Proceeds or that he had used these proceeds. Instead, as mentioned above, he had
                    stated that the shares in question were unrealised for intestate distribution.
                    This was misleading. I do not accept the Defendant’s explanation about the
                    payment of $5,000 to Mr Eu.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_79"></a>79     The Defendant also said that some of the
                    Shares Sale Proceeds went towards paying for Ong Wui Yong’s relocation to
                    the United States for his studies.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_45" id="Ftn_45_1"><sup>[note: 45]</sup></a></span> However, the Defendant did not satisfactorily
                    establish that part of the Shares Sale Proceeds was used to pay for Ong Wui
                    Yong’s overseas educational expenses (see also above at
                [62]).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">(2)   Oversea-Chinese Banking Corporation Limited
                (“OCBC”) shares</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_80"></a>80     In the course of cross-examination, the
                    Defendant was asked about the shares in OCBC held by the Estate (“the
                    OCBC Shares”). The August 2011 Account showed the OCBC Shares to be
                    “realised”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_81"></a>81     The Defendant said that the OCBC Shares had
                    been transferred into the Mother’s name <em>in her capacity
                        as an administrator of the Estate</em>.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_46" id="Ftn_46_1"><sup>[note: 46]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_82"></a>82     When questioned further, the Defendant gave an
                    explanation which I understood to be to the following effect. As the Mother had
                    satisfied the Estate’s estate duty liabilities from her own funds, the
                    Estate transferred the OCBC Shares to her as a form of reimbursement. However,
                    this explanation only came out in the course of his
                        cross-examination.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_47" id="Ftn_47_1"><sup>[note: 47]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_83"></a>83     There was another point which was related to
                    the “reimbursement” of the Mother. The Defendant appeared to be
                    saying that he had placed the OCBC Shares under the “realised”
                    column in the August 2011 Account, not because the OCBC Shares had actually been
                    sold in the market for money, but because they were used to reimburse the Mother
                    in kind for her having paid the Estate’s estate duty liabilities or part
                        thereof.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_48" id="Ftn_48_1"><sup>[note: 48]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_84"></a>84     Yet there was no other evidence to establish
                    that the Mother had in fact paid any estate duty for the Estate and, if so, how
                    much. I reject the Defendant’s explanation that the Mother had paid any
                    estate duty for the Estate.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">(3)   Tay Cheng Weng &amp; Co (Pte) Ltd (“TCWC Pte
                Ltd”) shares</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_85"></a>85     The Plaintiff alleged that the Estate’s
                    15,000 shares in TCWC Pte Ltd were unaccounted for.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_49" id="Ftn_49_1"><sup>[note: 49]</sup></a></span> However, as I will explain, it appeared in the
                    end that those shares <em>had</em> been accounted
                    for.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_86"></a>86     An important point was made by the Defendant
                    in this regard. He submitted in closing that TCWC Pte Ltd was actually the
                    former name of Kenwell &amp; Co (Pte) Ltd (“Kenwell”) (this is not
                    the same company as Kenwell Freight referred to at [69(a)] above).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_50" id="Ftn_50_1"><sup>[note: 50]</sup></a></span> The Plaintiff did not state a contrary
                    position in her closing submissions in reply. I note further that the TCWC Pte
                    Ltd share certificates in evidence showed a typewritten notation “Kenwell
                    &amp; Co. (Pte) Ltd” at the top of each certificate.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_51" id="Ftn_51_1"><sup>[note: 51]</sup></a></span> In the absence of
                    further evidence, I accept that TCWC Pte Ltd and Kenwell are one and the same
                    company.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_87"></a>87     The number of shares owned by the Estate in
                    Kenwell/TCWC Pte Ltd, as represented by all the Kenwell and TCWC Pte Ltd share
                    certificates in evidence, totalled 58,556 (“the Kenwell
                        Shares”).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_52" id="Ftn_52_1"><sup>[note: 52]</sup></a></span> This matched the number of Kenwell
                    shares already disclosed in the Accounts. I would point out also that when
                    Plaintiff’s counsel cross-examined the Defendant, she took no issue with
                    him on the 15,000 TCWC Pte Ltd shares allegedly unaccounted for.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_88"></a>88     I therefore conclude that the Estate’s
                    shareholding in Kenwell was fully disclosed in the Accounts.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_89"></a>89     The Defendant admitted that he had not
                    realised the Kenwell Shares and distributed the proceeds among the
                        beneficiaries.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_53" id="Ftn_53_1"><sup>[note: 53]</sup></a></span> However, there was documentary evidence that
                    this company was wound up by an order of court on 13 December 2002, with the
                    Official Receiver appointed as liquidator.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_54" id="Ftn_54_1"><sup>[note: 54]</sup></a></span> In the
                    circumstances, I accept that these shares have no realisable
                value.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">(4)   Haw Par (London) Limited shares</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_90"></a>90     The Plaintiff discovered from the Estate file
                    copies of two share certificates showing the Father as the registered
                    shareholder of a total of 2,000 shares in Haw Par (London) Limited.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_55" id="Ftn_55_1"><sup>[note: 55]</sup></a></span> These shares were

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_91"></a>91     On this particular non-disclosure, the
                    Defendant gave the reason that he did not have the Estate file which was left
                    with the Mother and he had only received copies of documents therein from the
                    Plaintiff recently.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_56" id="Ftn_56_1"><sup>[note: 56]</sup></a></span> The Plaintiff’s position was that she in
                    turn had to obtain that file from another brother Ong Wui Jin after threatening
                    that sibling with legal action if he did not hand the file over to her (see [63]
                    above). After she obtained it, she disclosed it to the Defendant.</p>

                    Plaintiff also did not appear to have made her own investigations or bothered to
                    seek further information even though the share certificates stated Barbinder

<p class="Judg-Heading-3">(5)   United Plantations Bhd (“UP”) shares</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_93"></a>93     While 100 UP shares were disclosed in the
                    Accounts, the corresponding share certificates (if any) were not presented to
                    the Court in evidence. However, the Plaintiff did discover from the Estate file
                    a share certificate for what appeared to be 24 bonus UP shares belonging to the
                        Estate.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_58" id="Ftn_58_1"><sup>[note: 58]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_94"></a>94     The Defendant protested during
                    cross-examination that there was a reason he had not accounted for these 24
                    bonus UP shares: he had no knowledge of these shares for the same reason stated
                    above at [91], <em>ie</em>, he did not have the Estate file
                    with him. In any event, he suggested that it was not economical to take steps in
                    Malaysia to claim the UP shares.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_59" id="Ftn_59_1"><sup>[note: 59]</sup></a></span> He was not challenged on
                    this second point.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_95"></a>95     The documentary evidence, however, showed that
                    even excluding the 24 bonus UP shares, the Estate’s shareholding in UP had
                        <em>prima facie</em> not been properly accounted for.
                    There was a letter from UP dated 8 August 1987 which stated that, based on the
                    Estate’s shareholding in UP at the time, the Estate was entitled to 24
                    bonus UP shares (“the UP Letter”).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_60" id="Ftn_60_1"><sup>[note: 60]</sup></a></span> As this was a one-for-five bonus share
                    issue, the logical conclusion is that the Estate held <em>120</em> ordinary UP shares then. Indeed, this seemed to be confirmed
                    by a Statement of Bonus Share Certificate(s) Issued (accompanying the UP Letter)
                    which stated on its face that the Father—and thus the Estate—owned
                    120 ordinary UP shares.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_61" id="Ftn_61_1"><sup>[note: 61]</sup></a></span>
                    Clearly, this was at variance with the Accounts showing the Estate’s
                    shareholding in UP to be only 100 shares. The Defendant was never asked about,
                    and therefore did not explain, this apparent discrepancy.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">(6)   Malaysian Resources Corp Bhd (“MRC”)
                shares</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_96"></a>96     Indeed, the Defendant’s excuse for not
                    taking further steps to claim the UP shares applied also to the 1,900 MRC shares
                    disclosed in the Accounts.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_62" id="Ftn_62_1"><sup>[note: 62]</sup></a></span> Again, the corresponding MRC
                    share certificates (if any) were not produced in evidence. However, the
                    Plaintiff was not complaining about non-disclosure of the 1,900 MRC shares and
                    it was not clear what she wanted the Defendant to do in respect of the
                    Estate’s shares in both UP and MRC.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">(7)   Other shares</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_97"></a>97     The Plaintiff also relied on a bill dated 14
                    May 1984 from Wee’s Secretarial Service addressed to the Mother and the
                    Defendant (“the WSS Bill”).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_63" id="Ftn_63_1"><sup>[note: 63]</sup></a></span> The WSS Bill included an item for
                    “attending to completion of transfer deeds and forwarding for
                    registration through stockbrokers”. The Plaintiff said that this
                    suggested the Estate held more shares than were accounted for but she did not
                    elaborate.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_98"></a>98     On the other hand, the Defendant claimed that
                    the impugned item of the WSS Bill was for services rendered by one Mr Wee Aik
                    Ann to the Father <em>prior</em> to the Father’s
                        death.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_64" id="Ftn_64_1"><sup>[note: 64]</sup></a></span> This had nothing to do with any
                    transfer of shares from the Father’s name to the administrators <em>subsequent</em> to the Father’s decease.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_99"></a>99     In my view, the evidence for the Plaintiff was
                    inconclusive as to the existence of any other shares the Estate might hold or
                    have held.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">(8)   The Car </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_100"></a>100    The Estate’s assets included the Car
                    (see [69(b)]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_101"></a>101    The Plaintiff claimed that the Car was
                    improperly valued at $20,000 in the Estate Duty Schedule, relying on an
                    estimated valuation of $23,000 as stated in a vehicle insurance policy dated 4
                    January 1985.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_65" id="Ftn_65_1"><sup>[note: 65]</sup></a></span>
                    In my view, the difference in valuation is immaterial since the Car was not sold
                    in 1985, as I will elaborate below.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_102"></a>102    The Defendant explained that after the
                    Father’s death, the Car was used as a family car by various members of the
                    Ong Family.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_66" id="Ftn_66_1"><sup>[note: 66]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_103"></a>103    The Plaintiff did not dispute the
                    Defendant’s account that the Car was used by her family members after the
                    Father’s death. In fact, she admitted that the Car had been driven by her
                    brothers (although she did not state the final outcome of the Car).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_67" id="Ftn_67_1"><sup>[note: 67]</sup></a></span> Nevertheless,
                    it was still incumbent on the Defendant to explain what happened to the Car
                    eventually. The August 2011 Account merely stated that the Car was used as a
                    family car. The Defendant said in his AEIC that Ong Wui Leng “finally
                    scrapped it”,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_68" id="Ftn_68_1"><sup>[note: 68]</sup></a></span> but did not elaborate anywhere as to
                    whether any money was received for the Car. On the other hand, the Report
                    attributed $6,000 as the scrap value of the Car (see [69(b)]
                above).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">(9)   Missing United Overseas Bank (“UOB”)
                account</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_104"></a>104    The Plaintiff also pointed out that the
                    Accounts did not reflect the existence of a UOB savings account numbered [xxx]
                    in the name of the Estate (“the UOB Account”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_105"></a>105    The Plaintiff learned about the UOB Account
                    from a letter dated 3 September 2011 from UOB to the Estate which was sent
                    to the Marine Drive flat.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_69" id="Ftn_69_1"><sup>[note: 69]</sup></a></span> The letter stated that the UOB Account
                    was closed on 3 September 2011. At that time, it was
                overdrawn.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_106"></a>106    The Defendant did not deny the existence of
                    the UOB Account although he said that he did not remember it.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_70" id="Ftn_70_1"><sup>[note: 70]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">(10)   Insurance commissions</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_107"></a>107    The Plaintiff claimed that the Defendant
                    converted certain insurance commissions which belonged to the
                        Estate.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_71" id="Ftn_71_1"><sup>[note: 71]</sup></a></span> No evidence was adduced in support of this

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_108"></a>108    On the contrary, the Defendant had a ready
                    explanation on this matter.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_73" id="Ftn_73_1"><sup>[note: 73]</sup></a></span> He said that the Father was originally the
                    insurance agent who had acquired these insurance accounts. When the Father fell
                    ill and was unable to service these insurance accounts, the Father asked him to
                    take over the accounts.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_109"></a>109    The Defendant therefore contended that the
                    commissions were paid out by the insurer to the Defendant in his role as the
                    agent servicing the insurance accounts. Consequently, these commissions belonged
                    to him and not the Estate. In the absence of more evidence from the Plaintiff, I
                    accepted the evidence from the Defendant.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">(11)   Fixed deposits and bank account in credit </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_110"></a>110    As disclosed in the Accounts, the Estate
                    also held two fixed deposits with Asia Commercial Bank (“the ACB Fixed
                    Deposits”) and one bank account with Overseas Union Bank (“the OUB
                    Bank Account”), all standing to its credit. There was no elaboration by
                    either side about these assets.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">(12)   The Sea Avenue property</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_111"></a>111    I turn now to the matter of the Sea Avenue
                    property. According to the Plaintiff, the Accounts were incomplete because they
                    did not include the Sea Avenue property as part of the Estate’s assets.
                    Her claim that the Sea Avenue property was held on trust by the Defendant for
                    the Father rested on five grounds, namely, that:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_111-p2_a"></a>(a)     the Father had provided $85,000 of
                        the purchase price of the Sea Avenue property;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_111-p2_b"></a>(b)     the Father had paid for the renovation of the
                        Sea Avenue property and a renovation contractor had referred to the Father
                        as the owner thereof;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_111-p2_c"></a>(c)     the male children of the Ong Family had stayed at the
                        Sea Avenue property;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_111-p2_d"></a>(d)     the Father had told the Ong Family of his purchase of an investment
                        property; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_111-p2_e"></a>(e)     the Defendant had admitted in the 2010 MC Suit that he held the Sea Avenue
                        property on trust for the Father.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_112"></a>112    I will look at each of these grounds
                    separately.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(A)   The $85,000</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_113"></a>113    The Estate Duty Schedule disclosed a
                    purported gift of $85,000 from the Father to the Defendant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_114"></a>114    The Plaintiff said that, rather than being a
                    gift, the $85,000 was to facilitate the Father’s investment purchase of a
                    private property. The Father would own the private property beneficially, and
                    the Defendant would be the registered owner. This arrangement was necessary
                    because the Marine Drive flat—an HDB property—was in the joint names
                    of the Father and the Mother, and the Father was prohibited by the HDB rules
                    from owning both an HDB property and a private property.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_74" id="Ftn_74_1"><sup>[note: 74]</sup></a></span> However, the Plaintiff admitted that she
                    had no firsthand knowledge of the $85,000 at all.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_75" id="Ftn_75_1"><sup>[note: 75]</sup></a></span> Her entire
                    argument—that the $85,000 was the Father’s investment
                    monies—hinged on her brother Ong Wui Jin’s testimony in the 2005 DC
                    Suit (see above at [6]).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_76" id="Ftn_76_1"><sup>[note: 76]</sup></a></span> It is pertinent to note that apparently the
                    Plaintiff, <em>until hearing Ong Wui Jin in the 2005 DC Suit, did
                        not know that a sum of $85,000 had been provided by the Father to the
                        Defendant for purchasing the Sea Avenue property</em>.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_77" id="Ftn_77_1"><sup>[note: 77]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_115"></a>115    On the other hand, the Defendant averred
                    that this $85,000 was a gift to him to enable him to purchase a private property
                    in his own right. He suggested that he had nothing to hide, and this was
                    evidenced by his having disclosed the gift in the Estate Duty
                        Schedule.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_78" id="Ftn_78_1"><sup>[note: 78]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_116"></a>116    The Defendant also seemed to suggest that it
                    was because the HDB rules did not allow the Father to acquire a private property
                    while also owning an HDB property that the Father decided not to acquire a
                    private property.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_79" id="Ftn_79_1"><sup>[note: 79]</sup></a></span> Furthermore, the Defendant was adamant
                    that the Father would not have circumvented any legal restrictions through the
                    use of a trust arrangement.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_80" id="Ftn_80_1"><sup>[note: 80]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_117"></a>117    The Defendant then pointed out that the
                    entire purchase price for the Sea Avenue property was more than $85,000. It was
                    $323,000 (see above at [14]). This was not disputed by the Plaintiff. The
                    Defendant stated that he had used his own money to pay for the balance of the
                    purchase price, including the payment of instalments on a loan taken out to
                    finance the purchase of the Sea Avenue property.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_81" id="Ftn_81_1"><sup>[note: 81]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_118"></a>118    Furthermore, it was not clear whether the
                    Plaintiff was claiming that the Defendant had held the entire Sea Avenue
                    property or only a part thereof in trust for the Father, given the fact that the
                    Plaintiff was not alleging that the Father had paid the entire purchase
                        price.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_82" id="Ftn_82_1"><sup>[note: 82]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_119"></a>119    I am of the view that the fact of the Father
                    having provided $85,000 to the Defendant was equivocal.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(B)   The Father had paid for the renovation of the Sea Avenue
                property and a renovation contractor had referred to the Father as the owner
                thereof</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_120"></a>120    I will quickly dispose of the
                    Plaintiff’s reliance on a letter of quotation from a renovation contractor
                    Design &amp; Interior Contractor (“Design”) dated 18 November 1983
                    to the Father.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_83" id="Ftn_83_1"><sup>[note: 83]</sup></a></span>
                    In that letter, Design had written, “With reference to our meeting with
                    your Mrs. and your son <em>at your flat</em> No 30-B, Sea
                    Avenue ...” (emphasis added). The Plaintiff alleged that the words
                    emphasised showed that the Father was the beneficial owner of the Sea Avenue
                    property. However, the writer of the letter was not called by the Plaintiff to
                    give evidence. In my view, the letter was not admissible in evidence. Even if it
                    was admissible, it carried little weight to establish that the Father was in
                    fact the true owner. Design might well have written the letter that way because
                    the Father was the one communicating with it, and it might be that Design had
                    simply assumed that the Sea Avenue property belonged to the
                Father.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_121"></a>121    As for the Father having paid for the
                    renovation of the Sea Avenue property, the Plaintiff relied on a copy of a
                    receipt from Design dated 23 December 1983 which acknowledged part payment of
                    $2,000 by the Father for renovations to the Sea Avenue property.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_84" id="Ftn_84_1"><sup>[note: 84]</sup></a></span> However, there was no
                    evidence as to the <em>total</em> cost of the renovations.
                    As it was, there was a copy of another receipt for $4,000 from Design dated 16
                    March 1984 in favour of the Defendant for renovations to the Sea Avenue property
                        too.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_85" id="Ftn_85_1"><sup>[note: 85]</sup></a></span> In my view, the
                    Father’s part payment of $2,000 was equivocal.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(C)   The male children of the Ong Family had stayed at the Sea
                Avenue property</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_122"></a>122    The Plaintiff said that the male children of
                    the Ong Family had stayed at the Sea Avenue property after it was purchased in
                    the name of the Defendant.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_86" id="Ftn_86_1"><sup>[note: 86]</sup></a></span> She suggested that this supported
                    her allegation that the Father had bought the property as an investment. She
                    claimed that it had also been his intention for his sons to stay there as they
                    could then easily look after their mother at the Marine Drive flat (which was
                    located near the Sea Avenue property).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_87" id="Ftn_87_1"><sup>[note: 87]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_123"></a>123    The Defendant said that he had allowed Ong
                    Wui Jin to stay at the Sea Avenue property from 1983 to 1986.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_88" id="Ftn_88_1"><sup>[note: 88]</sup></a></span> He appeared to
                    accept that other brothers had stayed there too. He explained that that was the
                    Father’s wish and having received $85,000 from the latter, he was hardly
                    in a position to dictate terms to the Father.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_89" id="Ftn_89_1"><sup>[note: 89]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_124"></a>124    Again, the fact that the male children had
                    stayed at the Sea Avenue property did not advance the Plaintiff’s primary
                    contention (about a trust for the Father) much.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(D)   The Father had told the Ong Family that he had purchased an
                investment property</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_125"></a>125    The Plaintiff said that the Father had told
                    the family of his investment in the Sea Avenue property.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_90" id="Ftn_90_1"><sup>[note: 90]</sup></a></span> He wanted to buy the Sea Avenue
                    property because, as mentioned above, it would facilitate his sons going to the
                    Marine Drive flat to take care of the Mother.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_126"></a>126    The Defendant did not agree that the Father
                    had said he had invested in the Sea Avenue property. He suggested that the
                    Father, at his late stage of life then, would not have thought of buying an
                    investment property on a trust arrangement, but rather be thinking of making a
                        bequeath.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_91" id="Ftn_91_1"><sup>[note: 91]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_127"></a>127    Unfortunately for the Plaintiff, she did not
                    call on any other sibling to give evidence in the present trial to support her
                    contention about what the Father had allegedly said about investing in a
                    property near the Marine Drive flat. Her allegation was therefore
                    uncorroborated.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(E)   The Defendant’s “admission” in the 2010
                MC Suit</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_128"></a>128    The Plaintiff pointed to something the
                    Defendant said as a litigant-in-person in the 2010 MC Suit (recorded in the
                    Notes of Evidence of 9 September 2010 at p 9) as evidence that there was a trust
                    of the Sea Avenue property. The Defendant had stated then that:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_92" id="Ftn_92_1"><sup>[note: 92]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">$85,000 was given to me because my father wanted me to purchase a
                        property. Only in my own name. I was the eldest. <em>CPF does
                            not allow Defendant [ie, Ong Wui </em><em>Teck] to
                            buy property to be held on trust</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_129"></a>129    On this basis, the Plaintiff said that the
                    Defendant had admitted holding the Sea Avenue property on trust.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_130"></a>130    I note that the evidence mentioned in [128]
                    above referred to CPF legislation and not HDB legislation. That is immaterial
                    for present purposes. It is clear to me that the Defendant had not made the
                    alleged admission and was, instead, denying the trust. He was merely stating
                    what he thought was the legal position at the time—that if CPF monies were
                    used to purchase a property, then that property could not be held on trust by
                    the purchaser.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_93" id="Ftn_93_1"><sup>[note: 93]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(F)   Factors against the trust allegation</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_131"></a>131    Unfortunately for the Plaintiff, there were
                    other factors which militated against her allegation that the Sea Avenue
                    property was held in trust in favour of the Father.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_132"></a>132    First, I have already mentioned that no
                    other sibling gave evidence in the present trial to corroborate her evidence
                    about such a trust. I add that no other sibling was claiming such a trust. For
                    completeness, I note that Ong Wui Jin had testified in the 2005 DC Suit that the
                    Sea Avenue property was an investment.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_94" id="Ftn_94_1"><sup>[note: 94]</sup></a></span>
                    Nevertheless, I was not inclined to take that prior testimony into
                    consideration. He was not called to give evidence in this trial, nor did it
                    appear that the Plaintiff was relying much on his testimony in the 2005 DC Suit
                    in asserting a trust of the Sea Avenue property (apart from the matter of the
                    $85,000; see [114] above).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_133"></a>133    Second, the Plaintiff’s allegations
                    about: (a) what the Father had said about having bought an investment property,
                    and (b) her brothers staying at the Sea Avenue property near the Mother so as to
                    take care of her, were not found in her AEIC. This suggested that such oral
                    evidence was a belated embellishment of the truth.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_134"></a>134    Third, if the Sea Avenue property was held
                    by the Defendant on trust for the Father, why did she take so long to present
                    this claim for an interest in the same property? The fact that the Defendant had
                    said that the Estate was “negative” was not a sufficient reason
                    for the delay in the context of making a claim for the Sea Avenue property, as
                    opposed to other assets of the Estate of which the Plaintiff might not have been
                    fully aware. Surely she would have asked him to elaborate on the negative value
                    then if the Sea Avenue property was really the Father’s, but she did
                    not.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_135"></a>135    Fourth, the Mother survived the Father for
                    more than 20 years. While the Plaintiff stressed that the Mother could not speak
                    or write English, she did not dispute that the Mother was literate in the
                    Chinese language. Neither did she dispute the Defendant’s suggestion that
                    the Mother was a capable person. The Defendant had suggested that while the
                    Mother was alive, she as the matriarch would have settled the problems between
                    the siblings.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_95" id="Ftn_95_1"><sup>[note: 95]</sup></a></span> If the Sea Avenue property was held by the
                    Defendant on trust for the Father and the family members were aware of this,
                    surely the Mother would have ensured that the Defendant make arrangements to
                    give his siblings their fair share of the Sea Avenue property whether or not she
                    knew that the property was sold on 6 June 2002 (which was before she passed away
                    in 2005). It was doubtful that the Mother would have made the gift of $50,000 to
                    the Defendant under her will if he was keeping the Sea Avenue property all to
                    himself when he was not supposed to.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(G)   The Court’s conclusion on the Sea Avenue
                property</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_136"></a>136    In my view, the Plaintiff has come too late
                    with too little evidence. She has failed to establish that the Defendant held
                    the Sea Avenue property, or part thereof, in trust for the Father.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_137"></a>137    I add that the Plaintiff did not adduce any
                    evidence that the rent or sale proceeds from the Sea Avenue property were used
                    to purchase the Pemimpin Place property in the name of the Defendant’s
                    wife. Indeed, the Pemimpin Place property was transferred to the
                    Defendant’s wife by the vendors on 10 December 1998,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_96" id="Ftn_96_1"><sup>[note: 96]</sup></a></span><em>before</em> the Sea Avenue property was sold on 6 June
                    2002. Therefore, the Plaintiff’s claim of a beneficial interest in the
                    Pemimpin Place property must also fail.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Summary of this Court’s decision</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_138"></a>138    In summary, I find that the Defendant has
                    not given a proper account of the assets of the Estate in the August 2011
                    Account. It is not open to him to argue that he was unable to do so because he
                    did not have the Estate file which was at the Marine Drive flat (of which he was
                    allegedly locked out) or that the Estate file had been taken or kept by one of
                    his brothers, <em>ie</em>, Ong Wui Jin.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_97" id="Ftn_97_1"><sup>[note: 97]</sup></a></span> He made
                    no attempt to try and get that file. Indeed, as mentioned above at [63], it was
                    the Plaintiff who managed to obtain that file after she demanded the same from
                    Ong Wui Jin and threatened him that she would take legal action to obtain the
                    file if he refused to hand it over to her. Apparently she made discovery of the
                    file to the Defendant after she obtained it, while the Defendant was content to
                    use his non-possession of the file as an excuse whenever the August 2011 Account
                    was shown to be inaccurate or incomplete.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_139"></a>139    From the Accounts and the evidence, I find
                    that:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_139-p2_a"></a>(a)     the Shares Sale Proceeds, <em>ie</em>, $10,073.68 (see [74]-[76] above) are still part
                        of the Estate’s assets;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_139-p2_b"></a>(b)     the OCBC Shares, while perhaps currently registered in
                        the Mother’s name, are to be treated as part of the Estate’s
                        assets. No evidence of the current value of the OCBC Shares was given by
                        either side. Neither did they elaborate on any benefit such as dividends,
                        bonus shares or rights derived from the OCBC Shares;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_139-p2_c"></a>(c)     the Haw Par (London) Limited shares
                        are part of the Estate’s assets and may have a
                    value;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_139-p2_d"></a>(d)     the UP
                        shares and the MRC shares are part of the Estate’s assets. In
                        particular, taking into account the bonus shares issued by UP in 1987, the
                        Estate’s shareholding in UP may be at least 144 shares, <em>ie</em>, 120 ordinary shares plus 24 bonus
                    shares;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_139-p2_e"></a>(e)     the
                        Kenwell Shares have no realisable value;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_139-p2_f"></a>(f)     the Plaintiff has failed to establish that the
                        Estate owns other shares;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_139-p2_g"></a>(g)     the scrap value of the Car is part of the Estate’s
                        assets;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_139-p2_h"></a>(h)     as the
                        UOB Account was overdrawn and closed, it is no longer a part of the
                        Estate’s assets;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_139-p2_i"></a>(i)     the insurance commissions are not part of the
                        Estate’s assets;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_139-p2_j"></a>(j)     the ACB Fixed Deposits and the OUB Bank Account are part
                        of the Estate’s assets; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_139-p2_k"></a>(k)     the Sea Avenue property is not part of the
                        Estate’s assets.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_140"></a>140    I should also mention in passing that both
                    sides have not presented their cases well even though each had the benefit of
                    solicitors acting for him/her.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_141"></a>141    The Defendant seemed to think that he could
                    do what he liked and give whatever explanation he liked.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_142"></a>142    The Plaintiff was similarly content to make
                    allegations without elaboration and investigation on her part. She was also not
                    clear as to what she wanted. For example:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_142-p2_a"></a>(a)     she made mere references to the
                        OCBC Shares without checking how much benefit had been derived from these
                        shares. Her counsel did not even ask the Defendant to account for any
                        benefit which had accrued over the years;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_142-p2_b"></a>(b)     she did not conduct her own investigations into
                        the Haw Par (London) Limited shares to find out what their present status
                        was or what had happened to them since the death of the
                    Father;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_142-p2_c"></a>(c)     she did
                        not say what she wanted the Defendant to do in respect of the UP shares and
                        the MRC shares which were shares in Malaysian companies. Was she prepared
                        for expenses to be incurred for the Defendant to follow up on them? What
                        would the expenses amount to etc? What about the benefits which had possibly
                        accrued to these shares over the years? Such questions were not asked of the
                        Defendant; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_142-p2_d"></a>(d)     she did not clarify whether she was accepting that the credit balances held
                        by the Estate had been used to pay the Estate’s debts or expenses as
                        stated in the Accounts or not.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_143"></a>143    In light of the unsatisfactory
                    circumstances, I will order an inquiry before the Registrar of the Supreme Court
                    to:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_143-p2_a"></a>(a)     determine, according to the
                        guidelines stated at [145]-[147] below, the total number of shares owned by
                        the Estate (and for which the Defendant is liable to account) in:</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_143-p2_a-p3_i"></a>(i)       OCBC;</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_143-p2_a-p3_ii"></a>(ii)       Haw Par (London)

<p class="Judg-2">bearing in
                        mind that benefits in kind may have accrued to these shares (such as scrip
                        dividends and shares arising from a bonus or rights issue) since the
                        Father’s death in 1984;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_143-p2_b"></a>(b)     subject to the determination in (a), determine the value
                        of all the Estate’s assets as stated above at [139], bearing in mind
                        in the case of shares that other benefits (such as cash dividends) may have
                        accrued to them and for which the Defendant is liable to account (in which
                        case the guidelines stated at [145] below are to apply). For the avoidance
                        of doubt, I will allow parties to also review the value of the Car as
                        scrapped if either side so wishes; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_143-p2_c"></a>(c)     subject to the determination in (b), determine the total
                        value of the Estate available for distribution to the beneficiaries, after
                        taking into account the debts, expenses and permitted deductions of the
                        Estate. For the avoidance of doubt, the Plaintiff is precluded from adducing
                        further evidence on items (e), (f), (h), (i) and (k) of [139] or to
                        establish any other assets not mentioned in [139]. Further, as the Plaintiff
                        did not dispute the alleged debts of the Estate (stated in the Accounts to
                        be about $77,000) or the funeral, testamentary, probate and administration
                        expenses claimed in the August 2011 Account to have been incurred by the
                        Estate (amounting to some $30,000), the Defendant does not have to adduce
                        evidence to establish the same. On the other hand, and for the avoidance of
                        doubt, the Defendant is precluded from establishing any further debts or
                        expenses of the Estate (except amounts expended to collect the
                        Estate’s assets) and also from adducing further evidence about the
                        Estate’s assets being used to pay the educational expenses of Ong Wui
                        Yong.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_144"></a>144    In my view, while the Summary Judgment only
                    ordered the Defendant to give a statement of accounts and did not elaborate any
                    further, the Defendant would be liable as an administrator of the Estate not
                    only to account for those assets which he himself listed in the August 2011
                    Account as belonging to the Estate (subject to my findings above), <em>but also to account for those assets which were actually received
                        by the Estate or by him for the Estate, as well as assets which would have
                        been received by the Estate without any further action on the
                        Defendant’s part at the relevant time</em>. The Defendant would
                        <em>not</em> be liable, however, to account for assets
                    which he would have received for the Estate if not for his wilful default. This
                    was because the Plaintiff never charged the Defendant with wilful default here,
                    nor did she claim for an account on the footing of wilful default (see <em>Mayer v Murray</em> (1878) 8 Ch D 424 at 426-427; <em>Ong Jane Rebecca v Lim Lie Hoa</em> [2005] SGCA 4 at
                    [59]-[61]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_145"></a>145    The OCBC Shares provide an illustration of
                    what I have said in the previous paragraph. These shares were listed in the
                    Accounts as belonging to the Estate. Even if the OCBC Shares are now registered
                    in the Mother’s name (and this should not be too difficult to ascertain),
                    the Defendant is still bound to account for these shares, since I do not accept
                    his oral testimony of how the OCBC Shares had been used to reimburse the Mother
                    for paying the Estate’s estate duty liabilities (see [84] above). Any
                    bonus share issues or scrip or cash dividends relating to the OCBC Shares would
                    also have to be accounted for by the Defendant, since these bonus shares or
                    dividends would have accrued without any further action on the Defendant’s
                    part at the relevant time. If the Estate or the Defendant did not receive any of
                    these assets (for example, because the relevant documentation was sent to the
                    wrong address), the Defendant is to take steps to recover them if it is
                    cost-effective to do so.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_146"></a>146    As for any rights issue with respect to the
                    OCBC Shares, if the evidence before the Registrar shows that a rights issue was
                    taken up, then the Defendant is to account for the shares acquired pursuant to
                    the rights issue, but he is entitled to an offset against the consideration paid
                    for the shares. <em>However</em>, if the Plaintiff cannot
                    establish that any particular rights issue was taken up with respect to the OCBC
                    Shares, the Defendant is <em>not</em> required to account
                    for the shares which would have been acquired pursuant to that rights issue. An
                    extra expenditure of monies is needed to take up a rights issue. It was not
                    argued that the Defendant had a duty or obligation to take up any rights issue,
                    much less that the Defendant had breached any duty or was negligent in not
                    taking up any rights issue. In summary, the Defendant is not to be treated as
                    having subscribed to a rights issue, if the Plaintiff cannot establish to the
                    satisfaction of the Registrar that that rights issue was taken up. The Defendant
                    was <em>not</em> being asked to account on the footing of
                    wilful default here.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_147"></a>147    I have explained in some detail how the
                    Registrar is to determine the total number of shares owned by the Estate in OCBC
                    and which are to be accounted for in the inquiry. The guidelines apply <em>mutatis mutandis</em> to the Estate’s shares in Haw Par
                    (London) Limited, UP and MRC.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_148"></a>148    Notwithstanding anything in [145]-[147],
                    however, the Registrar may disregard the value of any of the Estate’s
                    shares, <em>eg</em>, shares in UP and MRC, from the
                    determination in [143(c)] if the cost of collecting those shares would exceed
                    the value of the said shares.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_149"></a>149    The costs of the inquiry and interest are
                    also to be determined by the Registrar.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_150"></a>150    Although the Plaintiff has not expressly
                    claimed a distribution of her share of the Estate’s assets, I am of the
                    view in the circumstances that this is implied from her claim for an accounting.
                    Having been ordered in the Summary Judgment to give an account, the Defendant
                    becomes liable to pay any amount found due from him; <em>Doss v
                        Doss</em> (1843) 3 Moo Ind App 175 at 196-197; 18 ER 464 at 472. It
                    would be a waste of effort if the Defendant was only required to render an
                    account without him also having to pay any amount subsequently found due from
                    him. In the future, however, it may be preferable to avoid any argument if one
                    were to plead expressly for all the reliefs being sought and also to claim such
                    further or other relief as the court may order.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_151"></a>151    If, therefore, after the inquiry the
                    Registrar should determine that the total value of the Estate available for
                    distribution is positive, I order the Defendant to distribute to the Plaintiff
                    her share of the Estate, <em>ie</em>, one-twelfth of the
                    Estate in kind or in cash. The Registrar may decide whether, in the interests of
                    facilitating such a distribution, any of the assets of the Estate are to be
                    realised and converted to money.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_152"></a>152    Given my order for an inquiry as stated
                    above and for the Defendant to distribute to the Plaintiff her share of the
                    Estate, I make no other order as to the Plaintiff’s vague claim for
                    damages or her allegation of the Defendant having converted the Estate’s
                    assets.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_153"></a>153    I grant the parties liberty to
                apply.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_154"></a>154    I will hear parties on the costs of the
                    trial.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_155"></a>155    Bearing in mind the small number of shares
                    in OCBC, Haw Par (London) Limited, UP and MRC that the Estate started off with
                    and considering the rest of the Estate’s assets and its liabilities (as
                    disclosed in the Accounts), the Plaintiff may, upon her own further
                    investigation in this respect, find it impractical to incur more time and costs
                    in even pursuing the inquiry in the first place. However, that is for her to
                    decide. I urge the parties to try to reconcile their differences before causing
                    more damage to themselves and making a bad relationship worse.</p>
