His explanation was that Mubin had instructed him to take the bundles from the condominium unit, pass one bundle to one “Edy”, and return the other to Mubin’s residence, a flat at Holland Close. Mubin, who was subsequently arrested on 5 October 2015, maintained in contrast that he had no knowledge of the drugs in the condominium. He denied giving any instructions to Lokman for the delivery of the bundles. After trial, I rejected Mubin’s evidence and accepted Lokman’s version of events (see <span class="font-italic">Lokman</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [80]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">3 Lokman was initially charged under s 5(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) read with 5(2) of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2008 Rev Ed) (“MDA”) for trafficking two bundles of granular substances containing not less than 39.28 grams of diamorphine. The Court of Appeal’s decision in <span class="font-italic">Ramesh a/l Perumal v Public Prosecutor</span> [2019] 1 SLR 1003 was applicable to Lokman’s version of events. Lokman’s original charge of trafficking was amended into two charges, one of trafficking under s 5(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) read with s 5(2) of the MDA, of either 1 bundle of powdery/granular substance containing not less than 19.88 grams of diamorphine, or 1 bundle of powdery/granular substance containing not less than 19.40 grams of diamorphine, and the other, a new charge for possession under s 8(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the MDA of either 1 bundle of powdery/granular substance containing not less than 19.88 grams of diamorphine, or 1 bundle of powdery/granular substance containing not less than 19.40 grams of diamorphine (at [76] – [77]).

His charge was also altered into two offences, one for an offence of abetting Lokman to traffic the drugs under s 5(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) read with s 5(2) and s 12 of the MDA, of either 1 bundle of powdery/granular substance containing not less than 19.88 grams of diamorphine, or 1 bundle of powdery/granular substance containing not less than 19.40 grams of diamorphine, and a new charge for trafficking under s 5(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the MDA of either 1 bundle of powdery/granular substance containing not less than 19.88 grams of diamorphine, or 1 bundle of powdery/granular substance containing not less than 19.40 grams of diamorphine (at [87] – [88]). When I dealt with Mubin’s sentence, only s 33B(2) of the MDA arose for consideration at the time as no assertion was made then that Mubin was of unsound mind. Consonant with my factual findings, I held that Mubin was not a courier and the Prosecution did not furnish a Certificate of Substantive Assistance (“CSA”) (<span class="font-italic">Lokman</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [92]). The death penalty was mandatory and I so ordered.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">5 Mubin appealed against his conviction and sentence in Criminal Appeal No 7 of 2020 (“CCA 7”). On 26 August 2020, in his Petition of Appeal, Mubin raised for the first time that he had been suffering from such abnormality of mind which substantially impaired his mental responsibility for his actions at the time of the offence. Subsequently, Mubin’s new counsel under the Legal Assistance Scheme for Capital Offences, Mr Eugene Thuraisingam (“Mr Thuraisingam”), wrote in on 14 September 2020.

First, he acknowledged that there was a significant period of time between his interview with Mubin and the time of the offence. As such, there could be issues with accuracy due to memory distortion. Secondly, he acknowledged that some of what he was told by Mubin would have been “afterthoughts of a desperate man, of course, trying to save himself” and that his opinion was predicated on the truthfulness of Mubin’s reports. Finally, he reiterated that the assessment of what constitutes significant distress is subjective and rests on the assessor, such that two assessors may reach different conclusions as to whether the threshold of significant distress is reached.

</div> The argument was premised on Dr Ung’s First Report.

His Adjustment Disorder, Unspecified Stimulant-Related Disorder and Stimulant Withdrawal are significant contributory factors in his decision to continue to use large quantities of methamphetamine. The necessity to finance such use resulted in resorting to transactions of drugs to fund his stimulant use.

Rather, Dr Ung acknowledged that Mubin would have been able to exercise self-control in his general decision-making processes. Before and after the text above was the following:

When queried about how Unspecified Stimulant-Related Disorder could affect the brain, Dr Cheok stated that he did not know whether there was injury of the mind in this specific case, because the methamphetamine consumption in the present case was recent and different drugs have a different impact on the brain. Mubin was introduced to methamphetamine in 2014 by Tihani (see [17]). Mubin had a history of drug use, although he was inconsistent in his account of the initial years. To Dr Sarkar, he reported that he started smoking cannabis at 17 and heroin a couple of years later.

In the lead up to the offence, Mubin was able to coordinate the receipt of the drugs from one Mohd Zaini bin Zainutdin and Mohd Noor bin Ismail, and thereafter able to give Lokman clear instructions on the specific locations, recipients and timings for the delivery of the drugs (see <span class="font-italic">Lokman</span>, at [66]). These arrangements involved Mubin liaising with his suppliers, storing the drugs at the condominium unit, and acting as the middleman between his customer, Edy, and his courier, Lokman. After Lokman’s arrest on the night of 5 September 2015, Mubin made several phone calls to Lokman and Edy in order to ascertain Lokman’s whereabouts and to understand why the prior arrangement had fallen through. He castigated Lokman for failing to execute the delivery in a phone call at 2.42 am the next day, alluding to the risk of the drug transaction being detected:

</div> there was no agreement from the Prosecution that Unspecified Stimulant-Related Disorder amounted to an abnormality of mind. Whether there was abnormality remained in the present case a fact-specific exercise to be proven on the facts. For Mubin, the medical evidence was weak and there was no evidence from his behaviour or conduct to indicate that his mental state was abnormal in any way. In contrast to Roszaidi, Mubin’s routine and interests indicated that drug consumption was not the consuming focus of Mubin’s life. On the facts before me, I was of the view that Mubin had the capacity to understand events, judge the rightness and wrongfulness of his actions, and to exercise self-control. There was no abnormality of mind.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Aetiology</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 Following from my conclusion that Mubin was not suffering from an abnormality of mind, that there was no need for me to consider the second and third limbs of the <span class="font-italic">Nagaenthran</span> test. I address these briefly.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 The Defence’s contention regarding the second limb was that the stimulant disorder was a disease, or that Mubin’s continual consumption permanently altered his mind, resulting in an inherent cause. In <span class="font-italic">Roszaidi</span>, the second limb was fulfilled because it was accepted that the Major Depressive Disorder arose from an inherent cause (see [61], <span class="font-italic">Roszaidi</span>) and the Major Depressive Disorder and Substance Use Disorder operated synergistically, such that the Major Depressive Disorder formed the underlying substrate for his Substance Use Disorder. This accounted for the intensity at which his Substance Use Disorder operated at the time of the offence (see [78] and [183] of <span class="font-italic">Roszaidi</span>). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 The short answer to the Defence’s contention was that <span class="font-italic">Roszaidi</span> makes clear at [58] that the position in <span class="font-italic">Nagaenthran</span> at [31] remains the law. The exception does not apply to self-induced or transient conditions. Both of the agreed medical conditions were self-induced; further, Stimulant Withdrawal was transient. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 Mr Thuraisingam argued that the effect of Substance Use Disorder acting alone was left open in <span class="font-italic">Roszaidi</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [81] to “an appropriate future case”. The Court of Appeal also referred in that paragraph to extracts in Stanley Yeo, Neil Morgan &amp; Chan Wing Cheong, <span class="font-italic">Criminal Law in </span><span class="font-italic">Singapore </span>(paras 25.47 – 25.48 and 26.35 – 26.38) on self-induced intoxication and brain injury arising therefrom. In this context, Dr Cheok did not question the Defence’s assumption that Stimulant Use Disorder was akin to Substance Use Disorder and that Unspecified Stimulant-Related Disorder was akin to Stimulant Use Disorder.

</div> Notwithstanding, reading the <span class="font-italic">Roszaidi</span> judgment as a whole, it is clear that the present case would not be an appropriate one. In <span class="font-italic">Roszaidi</span>, the Major Depressive Disorder as an underlying substrate and the synergistic operation of Major Depressive Disorder and Substance Use Disorder were crucial. Further, the remarks on Substance Use Disorder at [81], which must be read consistently with the prefacing remarks on self-induced conditions at [58], were made in the context of an accepted intensity of Substance Use Disorder (see [78] of <span class="font-italic">Roszaidi</span>)<span class="font-italic"> </span>such that there was an abnormality of mind.

The facts showed no functional impairment. <span class="font-italic">Roszaidi</span>, on the other hand (at [197]), requires that there be a real and material effect on the ability to exercise control over actions. Dr Ung conceded in cross-examination that Mubin’s engagement with the offence in question was a result of his “poor choices”.
