</div> On the same day, Mr Freh informed the plaintiff over a phone call that the DLIF was introduced by one of the defendant’s clients and as long as there was no underlying fraud in the Fund, the fact sheet pointed towards the Fund’s very strong performance. The plaintiff then instructed Mr Freh to invest the sum of US$1m in the DLIF. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) On 20 February 2018, Mr Freh sent an e-mail to the plaintiff titled “Suggestions” providing investment advice including recommendations of certain investments to the plaintiff for his consideration.

He also noted that it may occur to someone looking at the DLIF to question whether there was a Ponzi scheme or something similar in place. However, he mentioned that there were two other family offices which had invested in the DLIF, done due diligence and felt comfortable with the risk. Thereafter, the plaintiff instructed Mr Freh to invest a further US$1.5m in the DLIF. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">9 Sometime in 2019, allegations of a multi-year fraud by DLI and its Chief Executive Officer, Brendan Ross, emerged.

</div> In essence, the defendant argued that the Contract Claims and the Tort Claim were factually and legally unsustainable. In any event, the plaintiff’s claims should be struck out as the defendant did not cause the plaintiff’s loss. These arguments were maintained in RA 275. I outline the parties’ positions on each of these arguments <span class="font-italic">seriatim</span>. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Contract Claims</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">12 The defendant submitted that the plaintiff’s Contract Claims should be struck out because the APA Service had not been engaged and accordingly Section II of the Investment T&amp;Cs did not apply to the plaintiff’s investment in the DLIF. This was evidenced by the fact that Mr Freh was not a designated investment specialist and the DLIF was outside of the defendant’s investment universe and not subject to monitoring. Therefore, seeing as the Contract Claims were premised principally upon the defendant’s alleged breach of the express terms in Section II of the Investment T&amp;Cs, it followed that they should be struck out.

The plaintiff argued that the APA Service need not be provided by an internally designated investment specialist, and it sufficed that a representative of the defendant provided investment services for the APA Service to be engaged.

</div> Lastly, there were at least serious questions to be tried on the following issues: (a) the interpretation of the term “investment specialist” and “investment universe” in the Investment T&amp;Cs (b) whether the defendant is estopped from relying on its strict contractual rights in light of the representations it made; and (c) the meaning of and the practice surrounding the defendant’s use of an e-mail disclaimer stating that the e-mail and any offering material sent with it had been sent pursuant to a request “received by UBS” from the addressee (in the present case, the plaintiff).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Tort Claim</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">14 The defendant contended that the plaintiff’s Tort Claim should be struck out as it did not owe a duty of care to advise him on his investment in the DLIF or to monitor his investment in the same. The defendant observed that the plaintiff primarily sought to rely on the Investment T&amp;Cs as a basis for the imposition of a duty of care. Since they were inapplicable, the plaintiff’s Tort Claim fell away. Furthermore, the General T&amp;Cs made clear that: (a) the defendant did not assume any responsibility in advising the plaintiff; (b) the plaintiff did not rely on the defendant taking such care when making investment decisions; and (c) the plaintiff was not a vulnerable investor.

In particular, he noted that cl 11.1 of Section II of the Investment T&amp;Cs clearly pointed towards an imposition of a duty of care. In this regard, cl 11.1 provided that, “[i]n performing its obligations hereunder, the Bank shall act diligently and carefully in providing investment advice with respect to the Mandated Account”. In any event, even if the Investment T&amp;Cs did not apply, the General T&amp;Cs did not exclude a duty of care from arising.

Moreover, it appeared that the defendant was put on notice or had suspicions of the risk of investing in the DLIF or that there may have been fraud in the DLIF.

It was common ground that the plaintiff’s case in respect of the Contract Claims hinged on whether the APA Service had been engaged, since the Investment T&amp;Cs were only applicable to the plaintiff’s investment in the DLIF in such a scenario. Quite simply, if they were not applicable, the plaintiff had no basis (as pleaded) for his claim for breach of contract as no contractual duties under the Investment T&amp;Cs would have arisen.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 I was of the view that the plaintiff did not have a factually sustainable claim that the APA Service had been engaged by the plaintiff in respect of his investment in the DLIF.

As the AR rightly noted, the Investment T&amp;Cs did not contain a definition of “investment specialists” and it was unclear on the face of the documents whether it was intended to be a term of art or to describe a general category of persons equipped with specific knowledge or skillsets. This was notwithstanding the defendant’s evidence that based on its own <span class="font-italic">internal</span> human resources Global Consolidated Reporting System, Mr Freh’s function description was listed as “GFO SEA (SG/Indo)”, indicating that he was not a member of the APA team and instead belonged to the “South East Asia team under the Defendant’s Global Family Office client advisor desk”.

</div> something which Mr Freh never once did. Notably, the AR highlighted that the plaintiff’s conduct in failing to contact Mr Kim was in fact consistent with his claim that he understood Mr Freh to be his investment specialist. I make two observations here. First, it was immaterial that the plaintiff did not respond to Mr Kim, since it was not disputed that he could have done so. Second, the plaintiff <span class="font-italic">did not</span> plead that Mr Freh was his “investment specialist” or that Mr Freh had held himself out as one.

</div> Yet, as the defendant rightly pointed out, it was perfectly plausible that he had laboured under a serious misunderstanding of the contractual terms in both the Account Opening Form and the APA Service that he had subscribed to.

</div> This had led the plaintiff to believe that Mr Freh could provide and did provide the APA Service to him. The plain inference was that, in all likelihood, he had not made any real effort to read the contractual terms carefully (or at all) before he signed on the dotted line. It would appear that he had not attempted to fully understand their meaning or seek any clarification from Mr Freh or any other person in the defendant’s employ as to how the APA Service worked and in particular, <span class="font-italic">who</span> would administer it for him. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 It therefore followed that the plaintiff’s argument on estoppel was also unsustainable. The plaintiff argued that even if the APA Service comprised services provided by designated investment specialists of the defendant and applied to investments in the defendant’s investment universe, the defendant was estopped from asserting that Mr Freh did not have the authority to provide the APA Service. To this end, the plaintiff submitted that the defendant had made a representation or acted in a manner which represented that Mr Freh had the authority to provide investment advisory services to the plaintiff, by holding out Mr Freh as a client advisor, and permitting him to send e-mails containing investment recommendations together with a UBS disclaimer that such e-mails were sent as a result of a request “received by UBS”. The plaintiff’s argument clearly missed the point. It simply did not matter whether the defendant had represented that Mr Freh had the authority to provide investment advisory services to the plaintiff. What was crucial was whether the defendant had represented to the plaintiff that Mr Freh was an investment specialist who was capable of providing the APA Service to him. However, this was patently not the plaintiff’s submission. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 Further, I should add that the plaintiff’s reliance on the UBS disclaimer did not take him very far. As noted by the defendant, the disclaimer did not specifically pertain to the APA Service and there was no mention of the APA Service anywhere in the disclaimer.

</div> Moreover, the fact that Mr Freh communicated with the plaintiff using his UBS e-mail account did not transform the DLIF into a UBS recommendation, much less into a form of advice rendered under the APA Service by Mr Freh as an “investment specialist”. Thus, I once again differed from the AR’s view that this issue of estoppel was a factual issue that was best resolved at trial.

He did not plead that Mr Freh had held himself out as an “investment specialist”. He also did not plead that he was denied access to any investment advice (or advisor) as far as the DLIF was concerned. As such, the plaintiff’s argument on Mr Freh’s role appeared to be an afterthought. Finally, it was undisputed that the DLIF was not within the defendant’s investment universe and further it was clear to me that there was no basis for estoppel to apply. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 Given the factual context, I did not accept that contractual duties arose under the Investment T&amp;Cs.

It would not be appropriate to determine the import of the clauses and rationalise the interaction between them based on affidavit evidence alone. The <span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">proper construction of the various contractual terms relied upon may involve findings of fact which are best resolved at trial.

</div> In this regard, I noted that the determination of whether a particular clause is reasonable is an extremely fact specific inquiry. This was observed by Judith Prakash J (as she then was) in <span class="font-italic">Press Automation Technology Pte Ltd v Trans-Link Exhibition Forwarding Pte Ltd </span>[2003] 1 SLR(R) 712 at [45] in the following terms:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">… The mere fact that a party had apparently willingly entered into a contract containing exclusion and limitation terms also did not prevent him from subsequently raising questions of reasonableness. Further, a provision that was commonly found in an industry may be reasonable by reason of it being in common use; but it could also be unreasonable nevertheless. The question whether a contractual term satisfied the requirement of reasonableness depended on the facts of each case. In principle, a term which had been found to satisfy the reasonableness requirement in one case may not satisfy it in another.</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">Accordingly, it would be more appropriate for the reasonableness of the clauses to be determined at trial after the factual background of the parties’ relationship is fully canvassed.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 For the above reasons, I was not convinced that the plaintiff’s Tort Claim was factually and legally unsustainable such as to warrant being struck out. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Causation</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 Finally, the defendant contended that even if it owed the plaintiff contractual and/or tortious duties and breached the same, the plaintiff’s claims should nonetheless be struck out because it did not cause the plaintiff’s loss.

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> I agreed with the AR and the defendant that no reliance should be placed on Mr Wilson’s affidavit. To the extent that Mr Wilson’s affidavit was intended to be relied upon by the plaintiff as expert evidence, it is well-established that it must comply with the requirements set out in O 40A r 3 of the ROC. Mr Wilson did not provide expert evidence in a written report exhibited to his affidavit in contravention of O 40A r 3(1) of the ROC. Further, his affidavit largely contained conclusions based on third-party due diligence reports regarding the DLIF which had not been identified or placed before the court contrary to O 40A r 3(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the ROC.

</div> Even if I accepted that Mr Wilson’s affidavit was purely meant to serve as a factual affidavit, pursuant to O 41 r 5(1) of the ROC, it should only contain such facts as he was able of his own knowledge to prove. While for interlocutory proceedings, an affidavit may contain statements of information or belief with the sources and grounds thereof (see O 41 r 5(2) of the ROC), Mr Wilson’s affidavit merely contained a summary of a number of third-party due diligence reports which were not referenced or identified. Moreover, Mr Wilson did not attest to any facts which were within his own personal knowledge. This was highly wanting of a factual affidavit.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 I return to the defendant’s argument on causation. In this regard, I confine the following analysis to the plaintiff’s Tort Claim given my earlier finding that the plaintiff’s Contractual Claims were unsustainable and ought to be struck out. On the basis of the plaintiff’s Tort Claim, I was of the view that there were issues to be decided at trial as to whether the alleged breach of the defendant’s tortious duties caused the plaintiff’s loss. From the evidence available (excluding Mr Wilson’s affidavit), I agreed with the AR that it was unclear at this stage whether any monitoring of the DLIF on the defendant’s part would necessarily have been futile.
