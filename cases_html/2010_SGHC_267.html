<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       The present matter involves an application by
                    the plaintiffs in <em>ABB Holdings Pte Ltd and others v. Sher
                        Hock Guan Charles</em> [2009] 4 SLR(R) 111 (‘<em>ABB Holdings</em>’) for leave to amend its Statement of
                    Claim (Amendment No. 3). Judgment has been granted in <em>ABB
                        Holdings</em> for the second and third plaintiffs to elect between
                    damages to be assessed <em>or</em> an account of the
                    defendant’s profits to be taken. The plaintiffs now seek, by way of an
                    amendment to the statement of claim, to obtain remedies in general damages
                        <em>and</em> restitutionary damages.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Factual Background</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The plaintiffs are part of a worldwide group of
                    companies which bear the name (“ABB Group”). The defendant worked
                    for various companies in the ABB Group. While still in the employ of the second
                    and third plaintiffs, the defendant had communicated with a former ABB Group
                    employee (‘Mr Leonhardt’) in relation to enquiries by a Chinese
                    body, Xian High Voltage Apparatus Reasearch Institute ("XIHARI"), regarding
                    whether the former employee would act as XIHARI's technical advisor in research
                    and development projects relating to the development of a new generation of
                    medium voltage circuit breakers. After leaving the second and third plaintiffs
                    in 2003, the defendant joined a company in China called Xiamen Huadian
                    Switchgear Co Ltd ("Huadian") as its General Manager. Huadian was a manufacturer
                    of, <em>inter alia</em>, medium voltage circuit breakers.
                    The defendant later became the Managing Director of Huadian.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       Subsequently, the plaintiffs commenced
                    proceedings against the defendant, alleging that the defendant was in breach of
                    several express and implied fiduciary duties and that he had caused damage to
                    the plaintiffs by such breaches. The parties have agreed to leave the question
                    of “<b><em>assessment of damages or calculation of
                        profits</em></b>” at a later stage. A consent order was granted on
                    7 January 2009 for the trial to be bifurcated with “damages (if any)
                    or calculation of profits (if any) to be assessed at a later stage”
                    (‘consent order’).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       In <em>ABB Holdings</em>,
                    the Court found that the defendant did not owe any fiduciary duties to the first
                    plaintiff. The defendant was however found to be a fiduciary of the second and
                    third plaintiffs, and on the facts, he had been in breach of the fiduciary
                    duties owed. He was also in breach of his duty of fidelity to the third
                    plaintiff. The Court granted judgment in favour for the second and third
                    plaintiffs against the defendant for <em>damages to be
                        assessed</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       Thereafter, the plaintiffs requested for an
                    audience before the same Judge who heard <em>ABB
                        Holdings</em> (‘the Judge’) to clarify the options of
                    remedies available to the plaintiffs. The plaintiffs stated in a letter dated 8
                    July 2009 that they have yet to elect the specific remedy to satisfy the
                    plaintiffs’ claim, and requested for a clarification of the judgment to be
                    read as “<b><em>damages to be assessed or an account of
                        profits, at the plaintiffs’ option</em></b>”. After hearing
                    submissions from both parties, the Judge gave a Final Judgment dated 6 July
                    2009 (‘Final Judgment’) that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">2.    There be judgment
                            for the 2<sup>nd</sup> and
                                3<sup>rd</sup> Plaintiffs against the Defendant for
                                <b><em>either damages to be assessed or an account of
                                the Defendant’s profits to be taken</em></b>, at the
                            election of the 2<sup>nd</sup> and
                                3<sup>rd</sup> Plaintiffs in respect of the
                            following:-</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(a)    the breach by the Defendant of his
                            fiduciary duty to the 2<sup>nd</sup> and
                                3<sup>rd</sup> Plaintiffs and of his duty of
                            fidelity to the 3<sup>rd</sup> Plaintiff when he failed
                            to inform them of XIHARI’s intention to develop and market a new
                            generation of circuit breakers;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(b)    the breach by the Defendant of his
                            fiduciary duty to the same parties when he communicated with
                            Mr Leonhardt with a view to obtaining the latter’s services,
                            as a consultant for XIHARI and Huadian; and</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(c)    the breach by the Defendant of his duty of
                            fidelity to the 3<sup>rd</sup> Plaintiff when he spent
                            time after about November 2002 working on plans to develop and run the
                            business of Huadian.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis in bold added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       About a year later and before proceeding to the
                    stage of assessment of damages (or account of profits), the plaintiffs now
                    sought to amend the ‘particulars of damages’ in its Statement of
                    Claim (Amendment No. 3). Paragraph 14(d) sought to adjust (to a higher
                    quantum) the costs incurred in the investigation of the defendant’s
                    breaches. Paragraph 14(e) is an addition to the Statement of Claim which seeks
                    to obtain, <em>inter alia</em>, the amount of salary,
                    allowances and bonuses during the period when the defendant had breached its
                    duties. By way of paragraph 14(f), the plaintiffs sought for restitutionary
                    damages in addition to general damages:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">14.    In addition to general damages, Plaintiffs have
                            suffered additional special damages by reason of the aforesaid acts of
                            the Defendant.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(f)    To the best of the Plaintiffs’ knowledge to
                            date and subject to further discovery, the difference between RMB
                            33,091,585.88 (the value of the Defendant’s shares in Hua Dian)
                            and Euro 180,000 (the Defendant’s capital investment in Gelpag
                            GmbH), which difference represents the value of the Defendant’s
                            wrongful gain and restitutionary damages</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The Issue</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       I grant leave to amend paragraph 14(d) and (e).
                    The plaintiff has the burden of adducing sufficient evidence for paragraph 14(d)
                    to justify its claim before the assessing registrar. Paragraph 14(e) may
                    require some authority to justify, such as the decision of <em>John While Springs (S) Pte Ltd and another v. Goh Sai Chuah Justin and
                        Others</em> [2004] SGHC 150, but that is a matter to be
                    decided by the assessing registrar.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       The only issue that remains is whether the
                    plaintiffs can amend its statement of claim to seek for restitutionary damages
                    in addition to general damages for the losses it suffered.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The Decision</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">General principles governing the grant of leave for amendment of
                pleadings</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       The principles that guide the Court in deciding
                    whether to grant leave for amendment of pleadings have been clarified by the
                    Court of Appeal in <em>Review Publishing Co Ltd v Lee Hsien
                        Loong</em> [2010] 1 SLR 52 (‘<em>Review
                        Publishing</em>’). The guiding principle is that the amendment
                    should be allowed if it would enable the real question between the parties to be
                    determined. However, it must be just for leave to be granted, having regard to
                    all circumstances of the case and bearing in mind two key factors; whether the
                    amendment would result in prejudice irremediable with costs, and whether the
                    amendment is essentially a ‘second bite at the cherry’. It is
                    apposite to visit the statements of principle laid down in <em>Review Publishing</em> (at [110]-[114]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">110    ... O 20 r 5(1) of the Rules of
                        Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2006 Rev Ed) gives the court a wide discretion to allow
                        pleadings to be amended at any stage of the proceedings on such terms as may
                        be just. Order 20 r 5(1) reads:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">Subject to Order 15, Rules 6, 6A, 7 and 8, and this Rule, the Court
                            may at any stage of the proceedings allow the plaintiff to amend his
                            writ, or any party to amend his pleading, <em>on such
                                terms as to costs or otherwise as may be just and in such manner (if
                                any) as it may direct</em>. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">111    In <em>Chwee Kin Keong v
                            Digilandmall.com Pte Ltd</em> [2005] 1 SLR(R) 502
                            (<em>'Chwee Kin Keong'</em>), this court said at
                        [101]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Under O 20 r 5(1) of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5,
                        2004 Rev Ed), the court may grant leave to amend a pleading at
                            <em>any</em> stage of the proceedings. <em>This can be before or during the trial, or after judgment or on
                            appeal</em>. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">112    Indeed, local case law shows that
                        our courts have allowed amendments to be made to pleadings even:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(a)    at the final stages of a trial after the
                            parties have made their closing submissions (see <em>Chwee Kin Keong</em> at [101]-[103] and <em>Lee Siew Chun v Sourgrapes Packaging Products Trading Pte
                                Ltd</em> [1992] 3 SLR(R) 855 at [91]-[96]);</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(b)    after summary or interlocutory judgment has
                            been obtained (see <em>Invar Realty Pte Ltd v Kenzo Tange
                                Urtec Inc</em> [1990] 2 SLR(R) 66 at [21]-[22]);
                            and</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(c)    pending an appeal or in the course of an
                            appeal itself (see <em>Soon Peng Yam v Maimon bte
                                Ahmad</em> [1995] 1 SLR(R) 279 at [25]-[30],
                                <em>Asia Business Forum Pte Ltd v Long Ai
                                Sin</em> [2004] 2 SLR(R) 173 (<em>'Asia Business Forum'</em>) at [17] and <em>Susilawati v American Express Bank Ltd</em> [2009]
                            2 SLR(R) 737 ('Susilawati') at [56]; see also O 57 r 13(1) of
                            the Rules of Court, which states that 'the Court of Appeal shall have
                            all the powers and duties as to amendment and otherwise of the High
                            Court').</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">113    The guiding principle is that amendments to
                        pleadings ought to be allowed if they would enable the real question and/or
                        issue in controversy between the parties to be determined ... However, an
                        important caveat to granting leave for the amendment of pleadings is that it
                        must be just to grant such leave, having regard to all the circumstances of
                        the case. Thus, this court held in <em>Asia Business
                            Forum</em> that the court, in determining whether to grant a party
                        leave to amend his pleadings, must have regard to 'the justice of the case'
                        (at <a href="#p1_12">[12]</a>) and must bear in mind (at
                        least) two key factors, namely, whether the amendments would cause any
                        prejudice to the other party which cannot be compensated in costs and
                        whether the party applying for leave to amend is 'effectively asking for a
                        second bite at the cherry' (at [18]). These two key factors were endorsed
                        recently again by this court in <em>Susilawati</em> at
                        [58].</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">114    It cannot be over-emphasised that
                        all the relevant circumstances of the case at hand should be considered by
                        the court in deciding whether or not to allow an amendment to pleadings, and
                        that delay in bringing the application for leave to amend per se does not
                        constitute prejudice to the other party. As this court stated in <em>Wright Norman</em> at [23]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">In our opinion, at the end of the day, the most important question
                            which the court must ask itself is, are the ends of justice served by
                            allowing the proposed amendment. Pleadings should not be used as a means
                            to punish a party for his errors or the errors of his solicitors. All
                            relevant issues should be investigated, provided the other party will
                            not be prejudiced in a way which cannot be compensated by costs. All
                            relevant circumstances should be considered by the court before it
                            exercises its discretion [as to] whether it would allow an amendment.
                                <em>While the time at which an amendment is made is a
                                relevant consideration it is not necessarily decisive. Delay per se
                                does not equal prejudice or injustice</em>. We do not think
                            any rigid rule should or can be laid down on this.</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     In the present case, the correspondence which
                    showed the agreement to bifurcate the trial had made no mention of
                    restitutionary damages. The parties decided to bifurcate on the basis that
                    damages will be assessed or an account of profits will be taken at a later
                    stage. The plaintiffs’ letter dated 1 December 2008 invited the defendant
                    to bifurcate the matter on this basis<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span>:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In the circumstances, the sensible and practical approach would be for
                        this action to be “split” into two stages. The first stage
                        concerns the issue of liability, i.e. whether our clients’ rights were
                        infringed. The second stage, which is contingent upon liability being
                        established at the first stage, is concerned with the <em>question of assessment of damages or calculation of profits</em>.
                        In this way, the costs of exploring damages or profits are put off until it
                        is clear that our clients’ rights were indeed infringed and the
                        invasion of confidence necessarily involved in discovery of your
                        client’s documents is postponed or, if your client is not liable,
                        entirely obviated. We suggest such an approach.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     The defendant’s letter dated
                    30 December 2008<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span> states:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">...our client is agreeable to your proposal...that the action be
                        “split” into two stages, i.e. for the trial to proceed on
                        liability only, with damages (if any) to be assessed at a later
                        stage.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     The parties’ intentions were
                    crystallised in a consent order dated 7 January 2009 for the trial to be
                    bifurcated with “<b><em>damages (if any) or calculation of
                        profits (if any) to be assessed at a later stage</em></b>”. After
                    the conclusion of the trial, the parties’ appeared before the Judge on
                    20 July 2009 to clarify the options of remedies available to the
                    plaintiffs. The plaintiffs insisted in its right to elect its remedies between
                    damages and the alternative of an account of profits. Thereafter, the Judge made
                    an order of the remedies <em>available</em> to the
                        2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> plaintiffs
                    in the Final Judgment, where they can elect between damages and an account of
                    profits.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     The specific question is whether the
                    plaintiffs can include an additional remedy of restitutionary damages in light
                    of the Final Judgment. In <em>Tang Man Sit v. Capacious
                        Investments Ltd</em> [1996] AC 514 (‘<em>Tang Man Sit</em>’), the Privy Council decided that a
                    plaintiff can change his choice of remedies even at a very stage, so long as the
                    Court has not rendered judgment for the remedy to be given:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Faced with alternative and inconsistent remedies a plaintiff must choose,
                        or elect, between them. He cannot have both. The basic principle governing
                        when a plaintiff must make his choice is simple and clear. <em>He is required to choose when, but not before, judgment is
                            given in his favour and the judge is asked to make orders against the
                            defendant</em>. A plaintiff is not required to make his choice
                        when he launches his proceedings. He may claim one remedy initially, and
                        then by amendment of his writ and his pleadings abandon that claim in favour
                        of the other. He may claim both remedies, as alternatives. But he must make
                        up his mind when judgment is being entered against the defendant. Court
                        orders are intended to be obeyed. In the nature of things, therefore, the
                        court should not make orders which would afford a plaintiff both of two
                        alternative remedies.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     The same position was adopted by the House of
                    Lords decision of <em>United Australia v. Barclays
                        Bank</em> [1941] AC 1 (‘<em>United
                        Australia</em>’) , where Viscount Simon LC emphasized that the
                    there is nothing special about the remedies stated in the statement of claim as
                    leave could always be granted for amendment any time <em>before</em> judgment has been rendered:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">There is nothing conclusive about the form in which the writ is issued, or
                        about the claims made in the statement of claim. A plaintiff may at any time
                        before judgment be permitted to amend. The substance of the matter is that
                        on certain facts he is claiming redress either in the form of compensation,
                        i.e., damages as for a tort, or in the form of restitution of money to which
                        he is entitled, but which the defendant has wrongfully received. The same
                        set of facts entitles the plaintiff to claim either form of redress. At some
                        stage of the proceedings the plaintiff must elect which remedy he will have.
                        There is, however, no reason of principle or convenience why that stage
                        should be deemed to be reached until the plaintiff applies for
                        judgment.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     Similarly, Lord Atkin emphasized that the
                    relevant step when the plaintiff is estopped from electing a different remedy
                    was when judgment for the remedy has been given:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">...on a question of alternative remedies no question of election arises
                        until one or other claim has been brought to judgment. Up to that stage the
                        plaintiff may pursue both remedies together, or pursuing one may amend and
                        pursue the other: but he can take judgment only for the one, and his cause
                        of action on both will then be merged in the one.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     In the present case, it is obvious that
                    parties have proceeded on the basis that the remedies available to them in the
                    event that they succeeded on their claims, would be damages. The alternative
                    remedy is an account of profits. They have consistently acted on this basis from
                    the beginning where the first statement of claim was filed, where the parties
                    agreed to bifurcate the trial and until the time when the Final Judgment was
                    given. The plaintiffs did not dispute the fact that no mention was made of
                    restitutionary damages throughout these series of events. In the present
                    circumstances and with particular reference to the Final Judgment, I find that
                    the plaintiffs have elected their remedies <em>in so far
                        as</em> the plaintiffs have decided that an assessment of damages will
                    be in the <em>alternative</em> (as opposed to <em>cumulative</em>) to a gains based remedy of an account in
                    profits. The plaintiffs are of course free to elect the <em>specific remedy</em> to satisfy its claim, be it in damages, or in an
                    account of profits. However, <em>to the extent</em> that
                    the plaintiffs have <em>elected the options</em> of
                    alternative remedies <em>available</em> to the plaintiffs
                    in the form of either damages <em>or</em> an account of
                    profits <em>by the time the Final Judgment had been
                        given</em>, I find that the plaintiffs are estopped from raising an
                    additional remedy of restitutionary damages.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     In my view, to allow the amendment at this
                    stage would cause substantial prejudice to the defendant that cannot be remedied
                    by costs – the defendant was denied the opportunity to defend in trial the
                    issues in relation to the difference between the defendant’s shares in Hua
                    Dian and his capital investment in Gelpag GmbH, pursuant to his breaches of
                    fiduciary duties. Although it was found that the defendant had acted in breach
                    of his fiduciary duties when it undertook a commission from XIHARI to
                    communicate with Mr Leonhardt, there were no questions placed before the
                    defendant in trial that the monies (constituting the commission received) were
                    causally linked to his shares in Hua Dian or capital investment in Gelpag GmbH.
                    It was also determined in trial that the defendant was in breach of his
                    fiduciary duties when he failed to inform the second and third plaintiffs of
                    XIHARI’s intention to develop and market new generation of circuit
                    breakers, and when he spent time after November 2002 working on plans to develop
                    and run the business of Hua Dian. However, the defendant was denied the
                    opportunity to cross-examine on the plaintiffs’ implied assertions (by way
                    of the present application for leave to amend) that the defendant has wrongfully
                    obtained benefits in the course of committing such breaches.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     Indeed, the plaintiffs’ attempt to bring
                    in the question of the alleged capital investment in Gelpag GmbH (by way of the
                    present application) at the stage of assessment of damages is a blatant attempt
                    to <b><em>re-litigate</em></b> before the assessing registrar an
                    issue that has already been <b><em>decided</em></b> by the Judge.
                    The plaintiffs asserted in trial that the defendant’s capital investment
                    in Gelpag GmbH came from the substantial proceeds in the Xiamen Project; and the
                    plaintiffs are entitled to such proceeds/capital investment because of the
                    proceeds were obtained contrary to the defendant’s express duty not to
                    participate in other business activities<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span>. This has been conclusively
                    dismissed by the Judge in view of the lack of evidence (see ABB Holdings at para
                    [66]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Having considered the evidence very carefully, I think that there is not
                        enough evidence to show that apart from receiving and passing on the
                        opportunity the defendant during the period of his employment with the third
                        plaintiff actively participated in Great Vision or the Xiamen project. There
                        was no evidence that during the period between the formation of Great Vision
                        and the defendant's resignation, he spent any time in China during which he
                        could have been working on the project. The fact that the defendant made a
                        substantial profit from the Xiamen project is not indicative of any active
                        participation by him during this period: such payment could well have been
                        his reward (or commission) for simply obtaining the opportunity and passing
                        it on to his brother to develop in conjunction with Huang Jianhuang and
                        Mr Lin. Again the documentation relating to the so called loan of
                        RMB70,000 is equivocal. The defendant firmly maintained that his name was
                        reflected by mistake and the document itself showed that the money was
                        received by someone else. Even if the defendant was the ultimate recipient
                        of the loan, this would not be sufficient to prove that he was actually
                        engaged in any business in relation to the Xiamen project.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     The plaintiffs’ counsel submitted that
                    there is no question of prejudice as the plaintiffs has the right to amend the
                    statement of claim at any time before the assessment stage to include all
                    aspects of remedies, since the trial in <em>ABB
                        Holdings</em> had only dealt with the question of liability. This was
                    so because the parties have already agreed to bifurcate the dispute. I am unable
                    to accept this submission. The parties’ agreement to bifurcate the trial
                    in December 2008 was <em>made on the basis of the</em>
                    plaintiffs’ statement of claim dated 14 March 2008, which had made
                        <em>no mention of restitutionary damages</em> and where
                    the plaintiffs had sought for damages or an account of profits. The decision to
                    bifurcate may or may not have been different; it is not for this forum to
                    speculate on that. It is undisputed however, that the defendant has been denied
                    the opportunity to consider in full the consequences of bifurcation, having had
                    no knowledge that the plaintiffs would include an additional remedy in
                    restitutionary damages in the event that they have succeeded in their claim
                    against the defendant. In this regard, I add parenthically the observation that
                    although the Privy Council in <em>Tang Man Sit</em> found
                    that there was no election before the stage of assessment of damages had been
                    completed because the defendant had failed to give sufficient disclosure of
                    information for the plaintiff to make an informed election (even though the
                    plaintiff had already enforced a charging order pursuant to a remedy for an
                    account of profits <em>before</em> proceeding to an
                    assessment of damages), the question that faced the Privy Council was whether
                    there had been an election between the remedies ordered by the Court; it did not
                    involve the question of having an <em>additional</em>
                    remedy of restitutionary damages which goes <em>beyond</em>
                    the option of remedies available to the plaintiff as already ordered by the
                    Court.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Abuse of Process</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     The plaintiffs’ counsel made an
                    ingenuous argument that the reference to “damages” in the consent
                    order, the Final Judgment and the parties’ agreement to bifurcate the
                    trial had included (as a ‘subset’ of damages, so to speak),
                    restitutionary damages. The plaintiffs are essentially asking for compensatory
                    damages <b><em>and</em></b> restitutionary damages. This is but a
                    mere attempt at circumventing the Final Judgment which had ordered an election
                    between <em>alternative</em> remedies of damages and an
                    account of profits. As pointed out by the defendant’s counsel, both
                    parties have appeared before the Judge on 20 July 2009 to clarify the
                    remedies available to the plaintiffs. They had the opportunity to raise the
                    issue of restitutionary damages before the Judge but failed to do so. Given that
                    both parties have made submissions to the Judge on the remedies available to the
                    plaintiff for election, and where the Judge has decided on that basis to award
                    remedies in the alternative, I find that to allow the amendment to have an
                    additional remedy in restitutionary damages would be to give the plaintiffs a
                    second bite at the cherry. In my view, the Court would be condoning an abuse of
                    process if the plaintiffs are allowed to circumvent the Final Judgment with a
                    convenient labelling of ‘damages’ as inclusive of restitutionary
                    damages. (I add parenthically (as this pertains only to the assessing
                    registrar), that there could be an issue of double recovery if both compensatory
                    and restitutionary damages are granted). To the extent stated above, I agree
                    with the submissions made by the defendant’s counsel that the application
                    for leave to amend is an abuse of process.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     Indeed, the present situation is analogous to
                    the one in <em>World Wide Fund and another v. World Wrestling
                        Federation Entertainment Inc</em> [2008] 1 WLR 445
                        (‘<em>World Wide Fund</em>’) where the
                    plaintiffs commenced proceedings against the defendants claiming an injunction
                    to restrain the defendants from using the plaintiffs’ initials. In October
                    2001, Jacob J gave summary judgment where the injunction was granted, but
                        <em>refused the claimants permission to include a claim for
                        an account of profits</em>. The plaintiffs did not appeal against
                    Jacob J’s decision. Subsequently, the plaintiffs applied successfully to
                    amend its pleadings to include a claim under <em>restitutionary
                        damages</em>. The Court of Appeal decided that the plaintiffs ought to
                    have raised the issue of <em>restitutionary damages</em>
                    before Jacob J at the same time when the plaintiffs had asked for permission to
                    include a claim in an account of profits. The failure to do so, coupled with the
                    subsequent attempt to raise the issue by way of an amendment of its pleadings,
                    amounted to an abuse of process (per Lord Justice Chadwick at para [74]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In those circumstances the answer to the “crucial question”
                        posed by Lord Bingham [in <em>Johnson v. Gore Wood &amp;
                            Co</em> [2002] 2 AC 1]in the passage which I have just
                        cited is that the fund is seeking to abuse the process of the court by
                        seeking to raise, in October 2004 (and, by amendment, in March 2005) a claim
                        for <em>Wrotham Park</em> damages which it could have
                        raised in October 2001 and which (but for the fact that it had decided,
                        then, not to pursue that claim) it should have raised in October 2001. The
                        abuse, as it seems to me, lies in seeking now to pursue a claim for
                            <em>Wrotham Park</em> damages in these proceedings
                        after inviting Jacob J to decide the issue which was before him in
                        October 2001 (whether to order an account of profits) on the basis that
                        there would be no claim for <em>Wrotham Park</em>
                        damages in the proceedings. The course which the fund has adopted is
                        inconsistent with the underlying interest that there should be finality in
                        litigation and that a party should not be vexed twice in the same matter: it
                        is inconsistent with the need for economy and efficiency in the conduct of
                        litigation, in the interests of the parties and of the public as a whole.
                        The federation was entitled to proceed on the basis that, a claim to an
                        award of <em>Wrotham Park</em> damages not having been
                        sought in 2001, such a claim was not being pursued in these proceedings. The
                        flaw in the judge's reasoning, as it seems to me, lies in his failure to
                        appreciate that the claim to <em>Wrotham Park</em>
                        damages (if it were to be raised at all) should have been raised before
                        Jacob J in conjunction with the claim to an account of profits.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     In the same vein, I find that the plaintiffs
                    ought to have raised the question of restitutionary damages before the Judge on
                    20 July 2009 where both parties have clarified the remedies available to
                    the plaintiffs, and where the plaintiffs have brought up the issue of an account
                    of profits before the Judge.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     The present decision however, does not purport
                    to assert that an account of profits is the <em>same
                        remedy</em> as that of restitutionary damages. Indeed, the desire to
                    keep the two remedies conceptually distinct is shown when Lord Nicholls said in
                        <em>Attorney General v. Blake</em> [2001]
                    1 A.C. 268 [House of Lords] at 254 (‘<em>AG v.
                        Blake</em>’):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">...there seems to be no reason, in principle, why the court must in all
                        circumstances rule out an account of profits as a remedy for breach of
                        contract. I prefer to avoid the unhappy expression "restitutionary
                        damages".</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     The irony however, is that this statement
                    shows that the two remedies of restitutionary damages and an account of profits
                    have often been used in the same context, underlying their common attributes
                    where the Court has found it fit to use one of these remedies (by looking at the
                    gain obtained by the wrongdoer) when there is a failure to establish financially
                    measurable loss. In this regard, Lord Nicholls have pertinently observed that
                        (<em>AG v. Blake</em> at 285):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Remedies are the law's response to a wrong (or, more precisely, to a cause
                        of action). When, exceptionally, a just response to a breach of contract so
                        requires, the court should be able to grant the discretionary remedy of
                        requiring a defendant to account to the plaintiff for the benefits he has
                        received from his breach of contract. In the same way as a plaintiff's
                        interest in performance of a contract may render it just and equitable for
                        the court to make an order for specific performance or grant an injunction,
                        so the plaintiff's interest in performance may make it just and equitable
                        that the defendant should retain no benefit from his breach of
                        contract...The law recognises that damages are not always a sufficient
                        remedy for breach of contract. This is the foundation of the court's
                        jurisdiction to grant the remedies of specific performance and
                            injunction<em>. Even when awarding damages, the law does
                            not adhere slavishly to the concept of compensation for financially
                            measurable loss. When the circumstances require, damages are measured by
                            reference to the benefit obtained by the wrongdoer</em>. This
                        applies to interference with property rights. Recently, the like approach
                        has been adopted to breach of contract. Further, in certain circumstances
                            <em>an account of profits is ordered in preference to an
                            award of damages</em>. Sometimes the injured party is given the
                        choice: either compensatory damages or an account of the wrongdoer's
                        profits. Breach of confidence is an instance of this. If confidential
                        information is wrongfully divulged in breach of a non-disclosure agreement,
                        it would be nothing short of sophistry to say that an account of profits may
                        be ordered in respect of the equitable wrong but not in respect of the
                        breach of contract which governs the relationship between the parties. With
                        the established authorities going thus far, I consider it would be only a
                        modest step for the law to recognise openly that, exceptionally, an account
                        of profits may be the most appropriate remedy for breach of contract.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     In the English Court of Appeal decision of
                        <em>Experience Hendrix v. PPX Enterprises Inc</em>
                    [2003] 1 All ER (Comm) 830 (‘<em>Hendrix’</em>), the claim was in respect of the grant of
                    licenses in breach of a settlement agreement made in relation to the use of
                    master recordings by Jimi Hendrix. The claimant obtained injunctions to restrain
                    further releases of the recordings; it had claimed in both restitutionary
                    damages and an account of profits. The claimant had however, conceded that it
                    could not show financial loss as a result of the breaches prior to the
                    injunction. The English Court of Appeal found it appropriate to draw a <em>close analogy</em> from the decision of <em>AG
                        v. Blake</em> (where the House of Lords allowed exceptionally for an
                        <em>account of profits</em> to be obtained as a remedy
                    for breach of contract), a decision described by Lord Justice Mance (at para
                    [16]) as marking “a new start in this area of law”. Although Lord
                    Nicholls has decided <em>AG v. Blake</em> on the basis of
                    an award of “account of profits”, the English Court of Appeal in
                        <em>Hendrix</em> observed that the decision of
                        <em>AG v. Blake</em> has opened the door for a bolder
                    approach in awarding <em>restitutionary damages</em> where
                    the claimant was unable to establish any identifiable financial loss (at
                    [34]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Since Blake I see no reason why, if the beneficiary of a restrictive
                        covenant is unaware of its infringement in time to obtain an injunction
                        immediately, but is able to obtain an injunction for the future after the
                        defendant by the infringement has obtained some benefit, the appellant
                        should be precluded from obtaining an injunction and, <em>if
                            justice requires</em>, <em>a reasonable sum to
                            compensate for the past infringement, even though he may not be able to
                            show any financial loss to himself</em>. If compensation on this
                        basis is available in respect of the permanent deprivation of a right
                        because the law does not consider that injunctive relief is appropriate,
                        there seems no justification for refusing it in respect of a temporary
                        deprivation arising because the infringement has been committed too quickly
                        for the law to be able to intervene. In either case, though for different
                        reasons, the compensation awarded would be in substitution for an
                        injunction.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     In addition to the above, the English Court of
                    Appeal in <em>Hendrix</em> adopted an analysis similar to
                    the awarding of an account of profits in <em>AG v.
                        Blake</em>, it was found that the defendant had deliberately did what
                    it had contracted not to do, and that the claimant had a legitimate interest in
                    preventing the defendant from profiting from the breach. Nevertheless, there
                    remain some differences between the two remedies. The English Court of Appeal in
                        <em>Hendrix</em> awarded restitutionary damages even
                    though the circumstances were found to be insufficiently
                    ‘exceptional’ to justify an account of profits. Lord Justice Mance
                    described (at para [35]) a claim in restitutionary damages as a “lesser
                    claim” than that of an account of profits, and observed (at para [24])
                    that Lord Nicholls (in <em>AG v. Blake</em>) did not apply
                    “the same epithet or qualification” of exceptionality to an award
                    of restitutionary damages. On the contrary, the High Court in <em>Cheong Lay Yong v. Muthukumaran s/o Varthan and another</em> [2010]
                    3 SLR 16 at [58] stated that restitutionary damages are awarded in
                    exceptional cases.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     In addition, the Court of Appeal’s
                    reference to “compensation” (see <a href="#p1_25">[25]</a> above) is consistent with the observation by the Court of
                    Appeal in <em>World Wide Fund</em> (at para [47]) that
                    restitutionary damages are essentially <em>compensatory</em> in nature (in reliance of Lord Hobhouse’s
                    dissenting judgment in <em>AG v. Blake</em>). These
                    observations must of course be read in light of Lord Nicholls’ observation
                    that (<em>AG v. Blake</em> at p 283):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The <em>Wrotham Park</em> [<em>Wrotham
                            Park Estate Co Ltd v Parkside Homes Ltd</em> [1974]
                        1 WLR 798] case, therefore, still shines, rather as a solitary
                        beacon, showing that in contract as well as tort <em>damages
                            are not always narrowly confined to recoupment of financial
                            loss</em>. In a suitable case damages for breach of contract may
                        be measured by the benefit gained by the wrongdoer from the breach. The
                        defendant must make a reasonable payment in respect of the benefit he has
                        gained.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     In addition, there is some suggestion that the
                    object of an award in restitutionary damages is <em>not
                        compensatory</em> (thus inclining it towards a closer position to the
                    remedy of an account of profits), from the Court of Appeal decision of <em>Friis and another v. Casetech Trading Pte Ltd and
                        another</em> [2000] 2 SLR(R) 511 where the decision of Steyn
                    LJ’s observations in <em>Surrey County Council v Bredero
                        Homes Ltd</em> [1993] 3 All ER 705 was endorsed with
                    approval:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">An award of compensation for breach of contract serves to protect three
                        separate interests. The starting principle is that the aggrieved party ought
                        to be compensated for loss of his positive or expectation interests. In
                        other words, the object is to put the aggrieved party in the same financial
                        position as if the contract had been fully performed. But the law also
                        protects the negative interest of the aggrieved party. If the aggrieved
                        party is unable to establish the value of a loss of bargain he may seek
                        compensation in respect of his reliance losses. The object of such an award
                        is to compensate the aggrieved party for expenses incurred and losses
                        suffered in reliance of the contract. These two complementary principles
                        share one feature. Both are pure compensatory principles ...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">There is, however, a third principle which protects the aggrieved party's
                        restitutionary interest. The object of such an award is not to compensate
                        the plaintiff for a loss, but to deprive the defendant of the benefit he
                        gained by the breach of contract. The classic illustration is a claim for
                        the return of goods sold and delivered where the buyer has repudiated his
                        obligation to pay the price. It is not traditional to describe a claim for
                        restitution following a breach of contract as damages. What matters is that
                        a coherent law of obligations must inevitably extend its protection to cover
                        certain restitutionary interests. How far that protection should extend is
                        the essence of the problem before us.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     Based on the authorities of <em>AG v. Blake</em> and <em>Hendrix</em>, I find
                    that the remedies of restitutionary damages and an account of profits are, from
                    a <em>practical</em> perspective, <em>similar in so far</em> as these are remedies open to the plaintiff
                    where the Court acknowledges the need to find an <em>appropriate
                        and just response</em> to the defendant’s breaches (by looking
                    at the gain obtained by the defendant), in the event where the plaintiff is
                    unable to establish any identifiable financial loss. As observed by the Court of
                    Appeal in <em>World Wide Fund</em> at para [59] (the
                    references to ‘compensation’ are however, reservedly debatable and
                    as yet untested by the House of Lords):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">When the court makes an award of damages on the Wrotham Park basis it does
                        so because it is satisfied that that is a <em>just
                            response</em> to circumstances in which the compensation which is
                        the claimant's due cannot be measured (or cannot be measured solely) by
                        reference to identifiable financial loss. Lord Nicholls's analysis in
                        Blake's case demonstrates that there are exceptional cases in which
                            <em>the just response to circumstances in which the
                            compensation which is the claimant's due cannot be measured by reference
                            to identifiable financial loss is an order which deprives the wrongdoer
                            of all the fruits of his wrong</em>. The circumstances in which an
                        award of damages on the Wrotham Park basis may be an appropriate response,
                        and those in which the appropriate response is an account of profits, may
                        differ in degree. But <em>the underlying feature, in both
                            cases, is that the court recognises the need to compensate the claimant
                            in circumstances where he cannot demonstrate identifiable financial
                            loss</em>. To label an award of damages on the Wrotham Park basis
                        as a “compensatory” remedy and an order for an account of
                        profits as a “gains-based” remedy does not assist an
                        understanding of the principles on which the court acts. The two remedies
                        should, I think, each be seen as a flexible response to the need to
                        compensate the claimant for the wrong which has been done to him.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     In view of the similar aspect between the two
                    remedies, I find that the plaintiffs’ application for leave to amend is in
                    substance a backdoor approach to have a second bite at the cherry, where the
                    plaintiffs have already submitted before the Judge for an alternative remedy in
                    an account of profits. Allowing the plaintiffs a claim in both general damages
                    and restitutionary damages would contradict the Final Judgment which had ordered
                    for an account of profits to be <em>in the alternative</em>
                    to damages.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     For the reasons above, I refuse leave to amend
                    paragraph 14(f). In view of the attempt to <em>re-litigate</em> the issue in relation to Gelpag GmbH (see para
                        <a href="#p1_18">[18]</a>) above, I grant the plaintiffs
                    liberty to amend paragraph 14(f) (within 7 days of this Judgment) only to assert
                    its position that the value of the defendant’s shares in Hua Dian may be a
                    measure of the general damages suffered by the second and third plaintiffs (the
                    references to restitutionary damages and the capital investment in Gelpag GmbH
                    shall not be included).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     The plaintiffs are to file and serve its
                    amended Statement of Claim in relation to the amendments allowed in paragraphs
                    14(d) and (e) within 7 days of this Judgment. The defendant is granted leave to
                    file and serve its defence (in response to the amendments allowed for in
                    paragraph 14(d) and (e)) within 14 days of service of the amended statement of
                    claim. The plaintiffs are granted liberty to reply within 14 days of service of
                    the amended defence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     In view of the delay in bringing the
                    application to amend, and with regard to the fact that this episode could have
                    been avoided as the plaintiffs could have easily raised the question of
                    restitutionary damages when both parties appeared before the Judge to clarify
                    the remedies available (coupled with the fact that much time has been expended
                    by counsels in preparing authorities and submissions), I order costs to the
                    defendant fixed at $2,800 including disbursements.</p>
