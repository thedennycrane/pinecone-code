I therefore found that Yogesswaran’s Contemporaneous Statement had been made voluntarily. I also found that the prejudicial effect of Yogesswaran’s Contemporaneous Statement did not outweigh its probative value. Accordingly, I admitted Yogesswaran’s Contemporaneous Statement.

It is incumbent on the Prosecution to establish an <span class="font-italic">unbroken</span> chain of custody and to account for the movement of the exhibits from the point of seizure to the point of analysis, such that <span class="font-italic">there cannot be a single moment that is not accounted for</span> if this might give rise to a reasonable doubt as to the identity of the exhibits. However, speculative arguments about the <span class="font-italic">possibilit</span><span class="font-italic">y</span> of contamination are insufficient to raise a reasonable doubt as to the identity of the exhibits: see <span class="font-italic">Parthiban a/l Kanapathy v Public Prosecutor</span> [2021] 2 SLR 847 (“<span class="font-italic">Parthiban</span>”) at [14], referring to<span class="font-italic"> </span><span class="font-italic">Affandi</span> at [39] and [118].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 In <span class="font-italic">Affandi</span>, one of the offenders argued that the chain of custody was broken because: (a) there were differing accounts as to who in the arresting party had possession of the relevant drug exhibits from the time they were seized until they were handed over to the investigating officer (the “IO”); and (b) after the IO took possession of the exhibits, she did not lock them in her safe but left them on the floor of her office instead. The majority of the Court of Appeal found that the Prosecution failed to establish beyond a reasonable doubt the actual chain of custody in the first place, as there were “two complete and mutually exclusive chains of custody of exhibits, neither of which was disproved” (<span class="font-italic">Affandi</span> at [43]–[51]). However, the Court of Appeal rejected the argument that the leaving of drug exhibits in tamper-proof bags on the floor of the IO’s office, unsealed and unsigned, for approximately 34 hours gave rise to a possibility that the exhibits were tampered with. The argument was found to be “speculative and … founded purely on the <span class="font-italic">theoretical</span> possibility of the exhibits being tampered with” [emphasis in original], as there was no other evidence suggesting that there was unauthorised entry into the IO’s office (<span class="font-italic">Affandi</span> at [54]–[56]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 Where there is a discrepancy between the weights of the drug exhibits recorded by the officers from the CNB and those obtained after analysis at the HSA, the Prosecution must explain the discrepancy in proving its case beyond a reasonable doubt (<span class="font-italic">Lim Swee Seng v Public Prosecutor</span> [1995] 1 SLR(R) 32 (“<span class="font-italic">Lim Swee </span><span class="font-italic">Seng</span>”) at [70]). However, where the discrepancy in weight is minute, it may not suffice to raise a reasonable doubt that there has been a break in the chain of custody. In this regard, a consistent weight difference across multiple exhibits would lead to an inference that whatever the reason for the discrepancy, it would not have been caused by a break in the chain of custody (<span class="font-italic">Parthiban</span> at [18]). In <span class="font-italic">Lim Swee Seng</span>, the Court of Appeal found that a reasonable doubt existed as to whether the exhibits sent to the HSA for analysis were the same exhibits seized from the offender, as there was a weight discrepancy of 78.13g between the scientific officer’s measurements and the investigating officer’s measurements (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, 16.49% of the weight measured by the investigating officer) (at [71] and [76]). Conversely, in <span class="font-italic">Parthiban</span>, the court considered that a weight discrepancy of about 1% was insufficient to raise a reasonable doubt as to the identity of the drug exhibits in question (at [18]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 I now analyse the facts. First, when I heard counsel in oral closing, the Prosecution accepted that the presence of Yogesswaran’s DNA on the Relevant Bundles only assisted the Prosecution in proving the chain of custody of the Relevant Drugs up to the point where the Relevant Bundles were processed in the EMR.

</div>
</div> the fact that Yogesswaran’s DNA was on the outer packaging of the bundles did not assist the Prosecution in showing that there was no mix up among the Three Drug Exhibits themselves. Secondly, at the same hearing, counsel accepted that any mix up (if it had occurred) would at most mean that “D1A1” had been mistakenly swapped with one of either “C1A1” or “C1B1”. Moreover, counsel for Yogesswaran confirmed that the submission that there could have been a mix-up among the Three Drug Exhibits was effectively limited to a careless mix-up, rather than extending to deliberate tampering or substitution.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 In essence, the submission by Yogesswaran is that when (a) the discrepancies in the weights of the Three Drug Exhibits recorded by ASP Yang and Dr Ong (and in particular the fact that the weight of “D1A1” recorded at the HSA was higher while those of “C1A1” and “C1B1” were lower) (see [35] above) and (b) the lack of opportunity for either Yogesswaran or Teo to observe what took place at the Press Release Photo-taking are taken together, the court should find that there is a reasonable doubt as to whether the chain of custody of the Relevant Drugs remained unbroken.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 I begin by observing that the reason why a drug exhibit is ordinarily kept within sight of an arrested person until it has been sealed is to eliminate or reduce the possibility of that arrested person asserting that there has been a break in the chain of custody. This minimises disputes and hence facilitates proof at the trial of the chain of custody. However, this does not mean that the inability of an accused person to observe the processing and/or sealing of a drug exhibit automatically breaks the chain of custody during that period of non-observation. What ultimately matters is the <span class="font-italic">actual</span> chain of custody of the material drug exhibit(s) by the police, as opposed to the accused person’s observation of that chain of custody. A period during which the accused did not have the opportunity to observe the exhibit merely raises a question that must be answered by the evidence of someone who in fact had custody of the material drug exhibit(s) during that period. If credible evidence is given in that regard, then the necessary link in the chain of custody would be established.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 Here, the Prosecution chiefly relies on the evidence of ASP Yang and SSS Huang. They were both present throughout the Press Release Photo-taking. Taken together with the evidence of XT4 Toh, their evidence shows that either the Same Formation Method or the Under Exhibit Method was used to prevent a mix-up of the Three Drug Exhibits. The adoption of either method would be sufficient to ensure that the Three Drug Exhibits were not mixed up. In light of the passage of time between the Press Release Photo-taking and the present proceedings, it is not surprising that they could not remember specifically which method was used. I am satisfied that there was no break in the chain of custody. The Three Drug Exhibits were placed on the table in the EMR under the observation and control of ASP Yang. That she could not remember if the exhibit markings were placed beneath them or to match their formation does not matter. This is merely an incidental detail. What transpired in the present case is quite different from the situation in <span class="font-italic">Affandi</span> where there were differing accounts as to who in the arresting party had possession of the relevant drug exhibits from the time they were seized until they were handed over to the investigating officer. Here, there is no question of where and under whose control the Three Drug Exhibits were.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 I would further observe that it is legitimate for the police to issue a press release about a seizure of drugs as part of the goal of reasonable transparency concerning their activities. Including photographs of the drugs in such a press release is also legitimate. Having a policy that the accused persons not be present during such photo-taking is defensible, so long as the police take appropriate measures both to ensure the chain of custody is not broken and to facilitate proof of the unbroken chain of custody. While I accept the evidence of ASP Yang, SSS Huang and XT4 Toh and accordingly find that there was no break in the chain of custody, it would facilitate proof of the chain of custody if the fact and duration of photo-taking for a press release is recorded in the investigation diary and mentioned in the relevant conditioned statements. It should not be left to be uncovered by defence detective work.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 I now turn to the discrepancies in weight. I accept the evidence of Dr Ong that the recorded weight of a drug exhibit may differ depending on the placement of the exhibit on the weighing scale. This is because the drugs take the form of granular blocks or clumps. This could explain why she recorded a lower weight for “C1A1” and “C1B1” (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the Relevant Drugs) while recording a higher weight for “D1A1”. Further, the percentage differences in weight were small. Those differences could not give rise to any doubt at all concerning whether the exhibits Dr Ong weighed were the same exhibits that had been weighed in the EMR.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 Accordingly, I hold that the Prosecution has proved the chain of custody of the Relevant Drugs beyond a reasonable doubt.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Whether Yogesswaran has rebutted the presumption of knowledge </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 Yogesswaran submits that he has successfully rebutted the presumption of knowledge under s 18(2) of the MDA by proving on a balance of probabilities that he did not know the Relevant Drugs were diamorphine.

The Court of Appeal distilled the following principles from the established case law (at [57]): </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) As a matter of common sense and practical application, an accused person who seeks to rebut the presumption of knowledge under s 18(2) of the MDA should be able to say what he thought or believed he was carrying, and a claim that he simply did not know what he was carrying would not usually suffice. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) While the inquiry into the accused person’s state of mind or knowledge is a subjective inquiry, the court will assess the veracity of the accused person’s assertion as to his subjective state of mind against the objective facts and examine his actions and conduct relating to the transported item in question in that light in assessing the credibility of his assertion. Relevant considerations might include: (i) the physical nature, value and quantity of the item; (ii) any reward that was to be paid for transporting it; and (iii) any amount that was to be collected upon delivering it. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Where an accused person’s defence is patently and inherently incredible, no evidential burden will be imposed on the Prosecution to rebut. That being said, in assessing the evidence, the court should bear in mind the inherent difficulties of proving a negative, and the burden on the accused person should not be so onerous that it becomes virtually impossible to discharge. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 The two broad categories of cases in which accused persons have successfully rebutted the presumption of knowledge in s 18(2) of the MDA are: (a) where the accused person is able to prove that he believed he was carrying something innocuous, even if he is unable to specify exactly what that was; and (b) where the accused person is able to prove that he believed he was in possession of some contraband item or drug other than the specific drug in his possession (<span class="font-italic">Gobi</span> at [59]). Ultimately, the presumption of knowledge will be rebutted where the court accepts that the accused person formed a <span class="font-italic">positive belief that was incompatible</span> with knowledge that the thing he was carrying was the specific drug in his possession (<span class="font-italic">Gobi </span>at [60]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 Furthermore, an accused person who is indifferent to what he is carrying cannot be said to believe that the nature of the thing in his possession is something other than or incompatible with the specific drug he is in possession of, because an indifferent accused person is simply nonchalant about what the thing in his possession is, and therefore cannot be said to have formed any view as to what it is or is not (<span class="font-italic">Gobi</span> at [65] and [69]). An accused person who is in a position to verify or ascertain the nature of what he is carrying may be described as being indifferent to the nature of what he is carrying if he knows that the thing he is carrying is a contraband item, but does not care to find out what that contraband item is or is not (<span class="font-italic">Gobi</span> at [67(b)]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 The essence of Yogesswaran’s Knowledge Defence is that he thought the Relevant Bundles contained either drugs that attracted a “light sentence” or cigarettes as that was what “Nithiya” told him. However, it would rarely, if ever, be sufficient for an accused person to rebut the presumption of knowledge by stating simply that he believed whatever he was told in relation to what was in his possession. Where such a claim is made, the court must consider whether it believes that bare claim, having regard to the entire factual matrix and context, including the relationship between the parties and all the surrounding circumstances (<span class="font-italic">Mohamed Shalleh bin Abdul Latiff v Public Prosecutor</span> [2022] 2 SLR 79 at [32]).

</div> Leaving aside whether ASP Yang had in fact given such instructions to Yogesswaran, Yogesswaran also failed to raise the Knowledge Defence in his long statements. In this regard, Yogesswaran testified that he had used the words “light sentence” and “party drugs” during the recording of his long statements, which were not recorded. However, Yogesswaran accepted that the long statements were read back to him. He claims that he did not raise any objections to either ASP Yang or the interpreter, Mdm Vijaya, because he was not concentrating.

Having been warned that the court may be less likely to believe any fact or matter that he does not disclose in his cautioned statements, it is unbelievable that Yogesswaran would have been so distracted that he did not realise something as important as the Knowledge Defence was not recorded in his long statements. Instead, if the Knowledge Defence were true, one would reasonably expect Yogesswaran to have insisted on it being recorded in his long statements, especially after allegedly being informed by ASP Yang that he could provide more details in his long statements that were not captured in his cautioned statement.

</div> It also merits noting that Teo’s oral evidence of his consumption rate was vague – he claimed that he would consume heroin until he “felt that [he] enjoyed it” or felt the “effect” or “kick” of the drugs. He submits that as a result, he cannot identify a fixed or definitive amount of heroin that he consumed daily.

My wife is sick and was operated on for 5 times within 3 years. The medical fee is high and my son is unable to help with the situation. That was why I trafficked drug last time. Now it is the same problem again. I tried not to do this but life is really hard and the Chinese New Year is around the corner. I need the money. I have no other way.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">102 When questioned why he continued to sell drugs after being released on bail for a separate offence, Teo stated in his third long statement recorded on 20 January 2020: “… I am already 74 years old. I can’t work anymore. However, I still need to survive. I have no other way but [to] continue to sell ‘Bai fen’.”

</div> Similarly, during his examination at the IMH, Teo had informed Dr Yeo that he would earn a profit of about S$10,000 to S$15,000 a month by selling heroin. Teo stated that he had spent the money he earned on himself, his son and his granddaughter and thus had little savings. He also admitted that he could not find any job that could sustain him financially and that he had taken a calculated risk to sell illicit drugs.

</div> There was also no mention in that statement of any incident occurring in 2019, and Teo has not provided any explanation for believing that SSgt Eric was referring to any other bundle of drugs besides the Relevant Bundles containing the Relevant Drugs. It would have been abundantly clear to Teo that SSgt Eric was questioning him about the Relevant Bundles containing the Relevant Drugs, and not about what Teo intended to do in 2019. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">106 Teo stresses that despite the CNB seizing Teo’s mobile phone, no evidence was produced of Teo’s intended customers. Teo argues the reason why he was not questioned on his list of customers by the CNB officers is that such evidence was completely absent.
