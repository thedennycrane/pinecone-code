<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">1

        The Plaintiffs were at all material times the

owners of the industrial premises known as Lot A18060 at 5 Woodlands Sector 1, Woodlands

East Industrial Estate ("the Property"). They utilise the Property for their

glass design and manufacturing business. The Defendants are building and general

contractors and are also involved in processing and distributing glass and glass fixtures.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">2

        On 18 April 2001, in consideration of the sum

of $17,000 (being 1% of the price), the Plaintiffs granted the Defendants an option

("the Option") to purchase the Property at the price of $1.7 million. On 2 May

2001 the Defendants accepted the offer contained in the Option by making a further payment

of $153,000 (being 9% of the price) to Keppel TatLee Bank Ltd, the mortgagees of the

Property, as stakeholders pending completion of the sale and purchase agreement ("the

Agreement") that arose from the acceptance. The balance $1,530,000 was to be paid on

completion. The Option provided, <i>inter alia</i>, for the following terms:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">(i) the Agreement was subject to <i>The

    Singapore Law Society’s Conditions of Sale 1999</i> ("the Law Society

    Conditions") so far as they are applicable to a sale by private treaty and not varied

    by the terms in the Option;</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">(ii) the Agreement was subject to

    the written approval of the Jurong Town Corporation ("JTC") for the sale of the

    Property to the Defendants; and</font></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">(iii) completion was to within 12

    weeks from the date of acceptance of the Option or within 4 weeks from the date of receipt

    of approval from JTC, whichever is later.</font></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">3

        On 25 June 2001, in anticipation of completion

on 25 July, the parties entered into a tenancy agreement wherein the Defendants agreed to

let the Property to the Plaintiffs for the purposes of their glass designing and

manufacturing business for a period of two years from 1 August 2001 at the rent of $15,000

per month. Upon entering into the tenancy agreement the Plaintiffs gave the Defendants two

cheques, the first for $30,000 being two months’ rent as deposit and the second for

$15,000 being advance payment of rent for August 2001.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">4

        By letter dated 15<sup> </sup>June 2001, JTC

gave their in-principle approval for the sale and purchase of the Property subject to

certain terms and conditions. Therefore pursuant to the Agreement, the completion of the

sale and purchase of the Property would be 25<sup> </sup>July 2001, being 12 weeks from 2

May 2001, the date of exercise of the Option.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">5

        One of the conditions imposed by JTC was that

the Plaintiffs were to furnish the Certificate of Statutory Completion ("CSC")

for a mezzanine floor extension prior to the completion. Construction of the mezzanine

floor in the Property was undertaken in 1999 but no CSC had been obtained then. The

Plaintiffs instructed their architects to set about obtaining it. However by mid-July it

did not appear that the CSC could be obtained by the completion date of 25 July. The

Plaintiffs therefore sought and obtained the approval of JTC for the completion to proceed

with an undertaking given by the purchasers – the Defendants – to furnish the

CSC after completion. With this, the Plaintiffs’ solicitors wrote a letter on 20 July

to the Defendants’ solicitors to ask if the Defendants would be prepared to give such

an undertaking upon the Plaintiffs giving the Defendants a corresponding undertaking. On

23 July the Defendants’ solicitors replied to say that the Defendants were not

prepared to furnish any undertaking to JTC. The letter ended with the following:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Your clients are required to

    obtain the Certificate of Statutory Completion for the mezzanine floor extension prior to

    completion as this is one of the conditions for JTC’s consent.</font></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">In view of the above, please note

    that our clients will only complete with your clients when your clients have procured the

    Certificate of Statutory Completion.  Please keep us informed at least three (3) days

    before completion.</font></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">6

        In the event completion did not take place on

the 25 July 2001. By letter dated 7 August 2001, the Defendants’ solicitors asked the

Plaintiffs’ solicitors when the Plaintiffs expected to obtain the CSC. The letter

also contained a 21-day notice to complete the sale and purchase of the Property under

condition 29.10 of the Law Society Conditions. The Plaintiffs’ solicitors replied on

15 August to say that the Defendants had agreed to extend the date for completion to end

October. That letter states as follows:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">We refer to your telefax dated of

    7 August 2001. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">We are instructed that the

    Certificate of Statutory Completion for the mezzanine floor extension is expected by

    end-October. Our clients have also applied to the Jurong Town Corporation for extension of

    time for completion. We are further informed that our clients have communicated with your

    clients in this regard and your clients has agreed to complete the sale and purchase in

    end-October 2001. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Kindly confirm your clients’

    agreement to the above. </font></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">7

        There was no reply from the Defendants or their

solicitors until 11 September 2001. But that was only a holding letter which states as

follows:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">We refer to your letter dated 15

    August 2001.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Please note that we are taking

    our clients’ instructions and will revert to you in due course.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">All our clients’ rights are

    reserved.</font></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">It is notable that the 21-day

period given in the Defendants’ notice to complete had expired on 28 August and there

had been no letter after that date until this one. Between 3 September and 22 October

there were transactions conducted between the parties which is the subject of considerable

dispute and I shall pass over them for the time being.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">8

        On 22 October 2001 the Plaintiffs finally

obtained the CSC. So on 23 October the Plaintiffs’ solicitors wrote to the

Defendants’ solicitors to advise that they were ready to complete on 31 October.

However the Defendants’ solicitors replied on 25 October to say that the Defendants

had never agreed to extend completion to end October and reserved their rights in respect

of the failure to complete within the 21-day period given in the 7 August notice to

complete. There followed an exchange of letters between the solicitors setting out the

parties’ respective positions in respect of the facts. This culminated in two

letters, the first from the Plaintiffs’ solicitors dated 26 October giving the

Defendants 21 days' notice to complete under Condition 29 of the Law Society Conditions.

In their reply dated 29 October the Defendants’ solicitors made a demand pursuant to

Condition 29.10 of the Law Society Conditions for the return of the $170,000 paid by the

Defendants.</font></p>
<b xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Findings of fact</font></p></b>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">9

        The main dispute of fact is whether the

Defendants had agreed to grant an extension of time until end October 2001 for the

completion. The persons who represented the parties throughout are the Plaintiffs’

director Edmund Lim Cheng Kiat ("Lim") and the Defendants’ director, Low

Hang Teow ("Low"). There is also a third party and a most important actor in

this little drama. He is John Tan ("Tan") who appears to be a freelance agent

and wheeler-dealer <i>extraordinaire</i>. He was the person who brought together the

parties on the sale and purchase and had also procured for both sides other unrelated

financing opportunities. Unfortunately neither side saw fit to call him as a witness in

this matter although he would have been able to throw much light on the case as he was the

intermediary between the parties in several crucial transactions. He is the only one who

can support or contradict the evidence of the protagonists in those matters.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">10

        It is the common position of the parties that

the entire transaction was a sale and leaseback agreement. At the time the Plaintiffs were

experiencing a severe cashflow problem and facing foreclosure by the mortgagee-bank as

they had been unable to satisfactorily service their bank facilities. It was in these

circumstances that Tan came into the picture and he was able to procure some bank

financing for the Plaintiffs for a fee. But this was insufficient to tide the Plaintiffs

over their difficult period and Tan suggested to Lim to sell the Property. Tan said that

he had buyers who were interested to make such investments. Lim said that he would be

prepared to do it provided the Defendants could lease the Property back as he wished to

continue with the business and it was expensive to relocate to another location. In the

negotiations leading up to the sale, the parties agreed that after the purchase the

Property would be leased back to the Plaintiffs at a monthly rent of $15,000, a sum which

the Defendants felt would give a satisfactory return on their investment.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">11

        However there was just one problem: JTC did not

permit their factory premises to be rented out. Lim explained that JTC required the lessor

to conduct operations on the leased premises. However this problem did not seem to be

insurmountable as far as the parties were concerned. Lim said this in cross-examination:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">JTC does not allow a person to

    buy a JTC factory to merely rent out. To overcome this, we came up with this joint

    arrangement, whereby Defendant would purchase the property, machine remained there, we

    would transfer our technical know how to Defendant.</font></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Lim explained that the Plaintiffs

would in their application to JTC put up a bogus proposal which stated that the Plaintiffs

and Defendants were entering into a joint venture and for that purpose required the

transfer of the lease to the Defendants. Lim said that:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">… the joint arrangement was

    to fulfill JTC's requirements. I had earlier mentioned that JTC did not allow a purchaser

    to lease the property. That's why there is no $15,000 rental in [the application]

    document.</font></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Lim admitted quite frankly that

they were trying to "hoodwink" JTC in order to get their approval for the sale.

It was in this context that the scheme fell flat arising from the delay in the CSC.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">12

        According to Lim, after the Defendants’

solicitors served the 21-day notice to complete on 7 August, he telephoned Low about the

delay in obtaining the CSC. Low told him to "carry on" with the application for

it. Then on 10 August, Tan contacted Lim to say that Low would be prepared to extend the

completion on condition that the Defendants agreed to pay compensation of $15,000 per

month until completion. This figure corresponds to the agreed rental after completion. Lim

agreed. Tan said that the $15,000 advance paid in June for the August 2001 rent would be

utilised towards the compensation for the month of August, and the next payment due from

the Plaintiffs would be in September 2001. To confirm this, the Plaintiffs sent a letter

dated 10 August to the Defendants which states as follows:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">As regards the above matter, we

    sincerely apologize for the delay in completion.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">At present, the CSC is in

    process. The schedule of completing the whole process of CSC will be completed end of

    October. (Attached with letter from our architect).</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">As to show we are sincerely to

    complete the sale, we will commence to pay our rent with effect from 1<sup>st</sup> August

    2001 till the completion.</font></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">13

        Lim said that the Plaintiffs made two further

payments of $15,000 on 5 September and 5 October to the Defendants pursuant to this

agreement to extend the completion date. The payment on 5 September was made by way of a

cash cheque which the Plaintiffs handed to Tan. The Plaintiffs produced a copy of that

cheque which appears to show on the reverse that it was encashed on 6 September and

Low’s signature is there. As for the payment of 5 October, Lim said that he made out

a cheque and met Low at the Pasir Panjang Hawker Centre to hand it over. However Low told

him to hand it to Tan. This was done by Jacky Tan ("Jacky"), the

Plaintiff’s other director, on 9 October at a coffee shop in Ang Mo Kio. However Tan

informed Jacky that Low wanted it in cash. Jacky telephoned Lim and told him of this. Lim

telephoned Tan and arranged to hand over the cash to him the following day. On 10 October

Jacky handed $15,000 in cash to Tan at a coffee shop in Sembawang. Lim said that Low

subsequently confirmed by telephone that Tan had handed this sum to him.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">14

        I now turn to Low’s version. From the

beginning until August 2001, it adheres to Lim’s version very closely except for one

crucial fact. That is the price. Although the Option states that the price is $1.7

million, Low maintained that it was actually $1.8 million and he had to pay the Plaintiffs

$100,000 in cash. This came about at the negotiation stage when the Plaintiffs, through

Tan, had asked for an additional $100,000 to be paid "under the table" to enable

them to "roll" their business. Presumably this meant that the Plaintiffs did not

wish to reflect this sum in the Option and they could have access to this sum for their

business instead of it being paid to the bank to reduce the loan.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">15

        Low said that the "under the table"

$100,000 was not recorded in any document. Neither did the parties talk about when it

should be paid. However upon the grant of in-principle approval by JTC in June 2001, Tan

informed him that the Plaintiffs wanted to be paid the $100,000. Low was reluctant to do

this as there was no assurance that the sale and purchase would be completed. Tan then

told him that the Plaintiffs were prepared to sign the Tenancy Agreement and pay him a

deposit of two months’ rent plus one month’s rent in advance. Low said that it

was then that he agreed to pay the $100,000 to the Plaintiffs, as he reckoned that his

exposure would be reduced by the $45,000 he would receive from them in the form of three

months’ rent. Low gave Tan a cheque for $70,000. He said that the balance $30,000 was

to come from Tan, who owed this sum to him. Low claimed that Tan had paid the $100,000 to

the Plaintiffs although he admitted that he was not present when this was done. Indeed Low

said that all communications with the Plaintiffs in respect of this payment of $100,000

was done through Tan. He said that he knew that the Plaintiffs had received the money

because Tan had told him not to cash the two cheques for $45,000 until after Tan had

handed the $100,000 to the Plaintiffs who could then place funds in their account for the

$45,000 to be encashed.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">16

        Low said that at no time prior to 15 August did

Lim propose to him to extend the completion to end October. Low pointed out that there was

no need for a side agreement on compensation for late completion as there already was such

a provision in the Law Society Conditions that would have yielded a similar amount.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">17

        Low deposed that after the 21-day period of the

notice to complete given by his solicitors on 7 August, he told Tan that he was no longer

interested in purchasing the Property. He requested for the return of the $100,000.

Although Tan tried to persuade him to go through with it, he was not moved. Tan initially

said the $100,000 would be paid in two instalments. However he later said that the

Plaintiffs had changed their minds and Tan handed him three personal cheques drawn by Lim.

Low said that none of these cheques were presented by the Defendants because the

Plaintiffs eventually made the refunds in cash. Two of the cheques, which were for $22,000

and $23,000, were subsequently returned and Low exhibited the third one, a cash cheque for

the sum of $30,000 and drawn on Lim’s personal account. However at the reverse of the

cheque are the words in Lim’s handwriting: "RETURN FOR PERSONAL LOAN". Lim

explained that he had given this cheque to Tan as repayment for a personal loan he had

taken from him.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">18

        Low said that eventually the Plaintiffs

refunded to him two sums, all in cash, totalling $40,000. The first refund was made on 3

September when Jacky gave him $25,000 in Tan’s presence. The second was a few days

after 5 October, when Lim gave him $15,000.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">19

        I must say that Low’s version is as full

of holes as Lim’s version is corroborated and consistent. Firstly, the story of the

$100,000 "under the table" payment is rather far fetched if one were to consider

why the Plaintiffs would agree to it without any documentation. Once the Option is

exercised, the Defendants would have a specifically enforceable contract to purchase the

Property for $1.7 million (assuming no complications). In going about it in this manner

the Plaintiffs would be taking the high risk that the Defendants would renege on the

promise to pay the $100,000.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">20

        Secondly, Low seemed to have a high degree of

trust in Tan when he handed him the $70,000 to pass to the Plaintiffs. Not only did he not

require a written acknowledgement of receipt from the Plaintiffs, he did not even get an

oral acknowledgement. This must be seen in the light of the fact that it was the

Defendants’ case that Tan was the Plaintiffs’ property agent.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">21

        Thirdly, Low had no explanation as to why the

Plaintiffs’ solicitors letter of 15 August, which alleged that Low had agreed to

extend completion to end October, was not rebutted within a reasonable time if he had not

made such a concession. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">22

        Fourthly, Low’s story about Lim’s

cheque is rather incredible. Why Lim would give the Defendants his personal cheque for

$30,000 to reduce a debt owed by the Plaintiffs is rather puzzling. It would have been a

simple matter for Lim to pay this sum into the Plaintiffs’ bank so that it can be

reflected as a director’s loan, and have the Plaintiffs give their cheque to the

Defendants. Furthermore, Low had no cogent explanation as to why Lim would have written

the words "return for personal loan" and the only plausible one is that given by

Lim, i.e. that it was indeed a repayment of a personal loan from Tan.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">23

        Fifthly, Low admitted receiving the

Plaintiffs’ cheque dated 5 September 2001 for $15,000. The Plaintiffs had claimed

that this was compensation for late completion in respect of September. Low said that the

cheque was rejected by the bank when he presented it for payment and so he passed it to

Tan. It was accepted that payment had been made on the cheque because there is a

"PAID" stamp on its face. On the reverse there are the following machine printed

words:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">

<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Override By SA35</font></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Counsel for the Defendants put it

as their case that "HOST SUP OVERRIDE BY SA35" meant that the cheque was

rejected due to insufficient funds in the account. However he did not produce any evidence

to support this contention. The cheque in fact appears to be paid in that same transaction

because the word "Paid" is stamped on the front of the cheque. The words and

symbols at the reverse could well mean that an override was required by a person of higher

authority in the bank because the sum in the cash cheque exceeded $10,000. But this is

speculation. Whatever it is, the Defendants have not given any evidence to support a

contention that appears to contradict the ordinary meaning of the words on the face of the

cheque.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">24

        Sixthly, Low’s evidence depends heavily on

Tan because Low was not the one who paid the Plaintiffs the $100,000 nor the one who

directly communicated with Lim in respect of many crucial aspects of his version of

events. Even if Low were telling the truth, it would be from his point of view and in

respect of many of the events he was relying on what Tan had told him. In particular Low

was relying wholly on Tan for his claim that he had paid the Plaintiffs $100,000

"under the table". Therefore his failure to call Tan as a witness to support his

version of events must affect the credibility of his evidence.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">25

        Finally those inconsistencies must be

contrasted with the well corroborated versions of the Plaintiffs’ witnesses which

were fully supported by documents. In respect of demeanour, I found Lim to be earnest and

truthful whereas Low was evasive and bare with the details.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">26

        I therefore made the finding that Low was not

telling the truth and accepted Lim’s version of events. Specifically I found that the

Defendants had agreed to extend the time for completion to end October 2001. Therefore

they were in breach of the Agreement in refusing to complete on 31 October upon the

Plaintiff’s request. I also found that there was no agreement to pay the $100,000

"under the table" and consequently no such payment took place. I further found

that the Plaintiffs had paid the Defendants $30,000 as two months’ deposit and three

further sums of $15,000 each. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">27

        In their Statement of Claim, the Plaintiffs had

prayed for specific performance of the Agreement. However in the midst of submission on 23

August 2002 counsel for the Plaintiffs withdrew this prayer and advised that they would

only ask for damages in law and under the Law Society Conditions.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">28

        I disallowed the recovery. The Agreement was

conditional upon the approval of JTC. Such approval was obtained through a deceptive

application by the Plaintiffs with the concurrence and co-operation of the Defendants. On

the Plaintiffs’ case, had the fact that the transaction was in reality a sale and

leaseback arrangement been revealed to JTC, such approval would not have been given. This

would have rendered the Agreement null and void according to its terms.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">29

        In <i>Brown, Jenkinson &amp; Co Ltd v Percy

Dalton (London) Ltd</i> [1957] 2 All ER 844, the plaintiffs sought to enforce an indemnity

given by the defendants in consideration of the issue of a clean bill of lading by the

carrier when it was not justified to do so. The headnote gives the following facts:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">The plaintiffs as agents for

    shipowners agreed with the defendants for the shipment of one hundred barrels of

    concentrated orange juice f.o.b. London to Hamburg, freight to be paid by the defendants.

    The defendants stipulated that they should have clean on board bills of lading. The

    barrels were in fact old and leaking, as the defendants knew and as the plaintiffs learnt

    when the barrels were brought to the dock. At the request of the defendants the plaintiffs

    agreed to issue and did issue bills of lading describing the goods as in "apparent

    good order and condition", the defendants agreeing to indemnify the shipowners

    against all losses or damage arising from the issue of clean bills of lading. Owing to the

    condition of the barrels a considerable quantity of the orange juice leaked away before

    they were delivered to the ultimate purchasers. The shipowners having paid the amount of

    the loss so arising assigned to the plaintiffs their rights under the agreement of

    indemnity. The plaintiffs, when they issued clean bills of lading, knew that bankers would

    not ordinarily advance money against bills of lading unless the bills were clean bills of

    lading, but the plaintiffs had not contemplated that anyone should be defrauded by the

    issue of these bills of lading and did not know what was intended to be done with the

    bills of lading by any purchasers of the goods from the defendants.</font></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">30

        The clean bill was requested in order to induce

the bank to advance money on the bill. The English Court of Appeal, by a majority, refused

to enforce the defendants’ promise to indemnify the shipowners on the basis that it

arose out of a transaction which contained all the elements of the tort of deceit. Morris

LJ said at p 853:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">The promise on which the

    plaintiffs rely is, in effect, this: If you will make a false representation which will

    deceive indorsees or bankers, we will indemnify you against any loss that may result to

    you. I cannot think that a court should lend its aid to enforce such a bargain.</font></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">31

        In <i>Suntoso Jacob v Kong Miao Ming</i> [1986] SLR 59 the plaintiff, an Indonesian, had transferred shares in a ship-owning company to

the defendant, a Singaporean, to be held on trust by the latter for his benefit. The

purpose of this was to get around the administrative requirement in force at the time that

a ship would be considered foreign-owned if the majority of shares in the owner-company

was not held by Singaporeans. The defendant had signed a blank transfer of the shares he

held on trust but had refused to deliver the share certificates when requested to do so by

the plaintiff. The suit was taken out for a declaration that the defendant was not

entitled to the shares and that he held them as trustee for the plaintiff. The Court of

Appeal upheld the decision of Lai Kew Chai J to refuse the plaintiff any remedy as he had

practised a deception on the public administration.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">32

        <i>Suntoso’s case</i> was applied in <i>Tan

Soi v Pow Kwee Lan &amp; Ors</i> <a class="remove" href1="/scripts/lp/dll/prospect.dll?GetHTML_lpqs&amp;type=1&amp;CaseID=46691&amp;freetext=" target="LWBMainFrame">[1998] 3 SLR 191</a> which concerns a Housing and Development

Board ("HDB") shop. The plaintiff and one Phua had entered into a trust deed in

1976 by which the latter agreed to hold a tenancy for the shop on trust for the former.

After Phua died the tenancy was registered in the name of his widow. In 1994, the HDB

offered to sell the premises to the sitting tenant, namely the widow. She subsequently

transferred this offer to her four children, the second to fifth defendants, who exercised

the right accordingly and purchased an 82-year lease for the premises. The plaintiff

claimed that the premises were held on trust for him. The defendants argued, <i>inter alia</i>,

that the trust deed was unenforceable as it was made for the purpose of deceiving the HDB.

The court found that the purpose of the trust deed was to facilitate a scheme by which

Phua allowed the plaintiff to take advantage of the benefit of the reduced rental he was

offered by virtue of his status as a resettled tenant and that this offended the policy

behind the reduced rental. The trust deed was accordingly unenforceable as the plaintiff

did not come to court with clean hands</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">33

        In the present case the Plaintiffs also did not

come to the Court with clean hands. That was probably the reason that they had withdrawn

their prayer for specific performance and asked only for damages for breach of contract.

But this prayer has two problems:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">(i) The first problem is the

    method of assessing the loss. Although the Agreement is for sale and purchase of the

    Property, the parties had intended that it existed alongside the Tenancy Agreement. The

    true intention of the parties was to enter into a sale and leaseback agreement. This would

    not have been permitted by JTC and therefore it would not have been possible for the

    Plaintiffs to secure a corresponding sale and leaseback agreement in relation to which

    their losses, if any, could be assessed.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">(ii) The second problem is this.

    Equity deems to be done what ought to have been done. Therefore had the parties revealed

    the fact of the sale and leaseback agreement to JTC, as they ought to, approval would not

    have been given and pursuant to the Agreement it becomes null and void.</font></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">34

        Accordingly, I held that the Defendants were

not liable for damages.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">35

        There remained the question of the $153,000

that the Defendants had paid to the stakeholders pending completion. Ordinarily losses

would lie where they fall in such situations. However the stakeholders require an order of

court to deal with the money in their hands. I was of the view that I have a discretion in

the matter and proceeded to weigh the relative equities of the parties. In my opinion, the

parties were <i>in pari delicto</i> in this matter and if an order was required, they

should as far as possible be returned to their original positions, i.e. a reversal of all

payments would be appropriate. Counsel for the parties agreed that, after accounting for

all the payments made by the parties to each other, such reversal would be achieved by an

order to the stakeholders to pay the sum of $58,000 to the Plaintiffs and the balance

$95,000 to the Defendants, and I so ordered.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">36

        On the question of costs, I was of the view

that it would be appropriate to make no order as to costs.</font></p>
