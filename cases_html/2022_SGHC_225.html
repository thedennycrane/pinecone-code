The second relates to the repayment of moneys in the sum of $820,746 (as set out at [9] above) to himself (“the Repayment of Moneys”). That said, OP3 accepts these were valid debts owing to Mr Foo.

</div>
</div> In this regard, Mr Foo’s submission is not entirely clear. It is not clear whether Mr Foo means to argue that prior to the company being insolvent, such a duty only arises when the company is on the verge of insolvency (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, that the duty does not arise when a company is merely in a parlous financial state), or that being on the verge of insolvency is synonymous to being in a parlous financial situation.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 On either formulation, Mr Foo’s submissions are unpersuasive. On the former, this goes against the weight of the authorities. In <span class="font-italic">Progen Engineering</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [48], the Court of Appeal held that the duty to consider the interests of creditors arises when a company is in a financially parlous situation. The term, “parlous financial situation”, was then also used in <span class="font-italic">Parakou Investment </span><span class="font-italic">Holdings Pte Ltd and another v Parakou Shipping Pte Ltd (in liquidation) and other appeals </span>[2018] 1 SLR 271 (“<span class="font-italic">Parakou (CA)</span>”) at [99], albeit indirectly, when the Court of Appeal discussed whether the company was in such a state, to determine whether the director owed a duty to consider the interests of creditors. I further note that Mr Foo appears to rely primarily on <span class="font-italic">W&amp;P Piling Pte Ltd (in liquidation) v Chew Yin What and others </span>[2007] 4 SLR(R) 218 (“<span class="font-italic">W&amp;P Piling</span>”), as the basis to suggest that such a duty only arises when a company is on the verge of insolvency. None of the other authorities highlighted by Mr Foo indicates such a duty arises only when the company is on the verge of insolvency. However, <span class="font-italic">W&amp;P Piling</span> pre-dates <span class="font-italic">Progen Engineering</span><span class="font-italic">.</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 As for the latter formulation of Mr Foo’s submissions, I, again, cannot agree.

A company on the verge of insolvency is clearly in a worse position than a company in a parlous financial situation. This also seems to be the view taken in <span class="font-italic">Diablo </span><span class="font-italic">Fortune Inc v Duncan, Cameron Lindsay and another</span> [2018] 2 SLR 129 (“<span class="font-italic">Diablo Fortune</span>”). There, the court was concerned with the appropriate characterisation of liens on sub-freights. The court rejected that such liens should be understood as agreements to create a charge. On such an understanding, the lien would only be registrable when the lien is exercised in response to a default by the charterer, and “[b]y this time, the charterer would likely be in a parlous financial situation, <span class="font-italic">teetering on the verge of insolvency</span>” [emphasis added], thus allowing “the shipowner to steal a march on the other creditors”: at [65]. While the observation was made in a different context, nothing suggests that it should not apply with equal force in the present situation, in distinguishing between being in a parlous financial situation and being on the verge of insolvency. After all, the comment was made in relation to the financial health of an entity. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 Therefore, I do not agree with Mr Foo’s submissions. It cannot be that such a duty only arises when a company is on the verge of insolvency, given that it arises when a company is in a parlous financial situation (which I understand to be a state of affairs that is less severe than that of being on the verge of insolvency). Having said that, the real difficulty is that it remains unclear when one would consider a company to be in a parlous financial situation or on the verge of insolvency. No serious attempt has been made by parties to delineate the parameters of these terms. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 In these circumstances, it is apposite to note the rationale underlying such a duty, that being to ensure that a company’s assets are not wrongfully dissipated so that debts owing to creditors may be met. In <span class="font-italic">Progen Engineering</span> at [52], it is observed that the company in such a state is “effectively trading and running the company’s business with the creditors’ money”. Further, <span class="font-italic">Dynasty Line</span> is particularly instructive as to when such a duty is triggered as the Court of Appeal explained at [34]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… The weight to be accorded to [the creditors’] interests will <span class="font-italic">vary according to the financial </span><span class="font-italic">health of the company</span>. Where the company is in robust financial health with little, if any, risk to the interests of its creditors a director would be entitled to pay greater heed to what is best for the shareholders<span class="font-italic">. But where there are mounting concerns over its financial health, the pendulum will swing towards its creditors</span>...</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 To reiterate, as mentioned in [27] above, <span class="font-italic">Dynasty Line </span>calls for a broad-based assessment to be undertaken as to the financial health of the company. In my view, whether and to what extent the director should consider the interests of creditors requires a practical assessment of the financial health of the company. There is no fixed or static point on a continuum to determine whether the company is in a parlous financial situation or on the verge of insolvency. This is not only consistent with the rationale underlying such a duty, but also sufficiently encompasses the different nomenclature used in the cases. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 In conclusion, the duty to consider the interests of a company’s creditors does not arise only when a company is on the verge of insolvency; instead, it arises when the company is financially parlous. In any event, these terms, in themselves, are of limited utility in shedding light on when the duty would arise. In this inquiry, a practical and broad assessment of the financial health of the company should be undertaken to decide when, as indicated in <span class="font-italic">Dynasty Line</span>, the pendulum should swing towards the interests of the creditors. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Whether OP3 was insolvent or financially parlous at the material time</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 With that, I turn to consider OP3’s financial health at the material time. In this regard, OP3 argues that it was insolvent or financially parlous as at 17 January 2014 or at the latest on 25 May 2015. Before getting there, the two matters for determination are whether liability pursuant to Suit 498 is a contingent liability to be taken into account in assessing the solvency of OP3, and if so, the value to be ascribed to Suit 498. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Whether liability pursuant to Suit 498 is a contingent liability to be taken into account in assessing OP3’s solvency, and if so, the value to be ascribed    </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 As set out at [15] above, s 125(2)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the IRDA states that in assessing whether a company is unable to pay its debts <span class="font-italic">ie, </span>the solvency of a company, so as to wind up a company, the court “must take into account the <span class="font-italic">contingent</span> and prospective liabilities of the company [emphasis added]”. The parties accept that similarly, where the solvency of a company is being considered in the context of breach of a director’s duties over transactions entered into before liquidation, contingent liabilities should be taken into account: <span class="font-italic">Parakou </span><span class="font-italic">Shipping Pte Ltd (in liquidation) v Liu Cheng Chan and others </span>[2017] SGHC 15<span class="font-italic"> </span>(“<span class="font-italic">Parakou (HC)</span>”)<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [76].</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The applicable test </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 The parties further accept that a contingent liability is a liability or loss which arises out of an existing legal obligation or state of affairs but which is dependent on the happening of an event which may or may not occur, and that whether a contingent liability should be taken into account will depend on whether it is reasonably likely to materialise: <span class="font-italic">Parakou (HC) </span>at [76], [77]–[78].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 Apart from the above, parties also refer to the standards set out in the FRS. Under the FRS, a provision should be made in a company’s accounts under three conditions: (a) an entity has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event; (b) it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation; and (c) a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.

</div> I agree with OP3. While the test outlined in the FRS is proximate to the test outlined under s 125(2)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the IRDA and in <span class="font-italic">Parakou (HC), </span>it is the latter which is applicable in considering the question of insolvency. Mr Foo, in arguing that no provision should be made under the FRS, also relies substantially on the same points as those raised in arguing that the liability pursuant to Suit 498 was not a contingent liability that was reasonably likely to materialise. Little to no distinction is made by Mr Foo between the two tests. In my view, the applicable test would be that set out under s 125(2)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the IRDA and <span class="font-italic">Parakou (HC)</span><span class="font-italic">. </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 Based on the applicable test, the nub of the issue is whether the liability arising from Suit 498 was reasonably likely to materialise. To be exact, this refers to the likelihood of an unfavourable judgment being granted against OP3. It does not merely refer to the likelihood of the action itself materialising. Mr Foo, however, disagrees with OP3’s contentions in relation to how the inquiry as to the reasonable likelihood of a contingent liability materialising is to be undertaken. I now deal with these two issues briefly.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Whether the court is entitled to employ the benefit of hindsight</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 First, OP3 argues that in undertaking the inquiry, the court is entitled to employ the benefit of hindsight.

</div> These authorities, however, do not support their argument. In <span class="font-italic">Parakou (HC)</span>, the court’s reference to the events that happened after the fact was merely confirmatory of the finding of the insolvency of the company at the material time. In <span class="font-italic">Parakou (CA)</span>, the issue of hindsight was not raised at all. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 I reiterate that the court’s inquiry is whether at the material time, a liability was reasonably likely to materialise. This must necessarily be rooted in the facts and circumstances at that point in time. Ultimately, the court’s inquiry is undertaken to assess the conduct of a company and its directors. As Mr Foo argues, a company and its directors cannot possibly be expected to act on the basis of facts and circumstances of which they are unaware, and of which they would only become aware of at some point in the future. I accept his argument. Such an approach is similarly taken in assessing the conduct of auditors and solicitors, in that the court does not rely on <span class="font-italic">ex post facto</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>knowledge but instead rely on the circumstances at the material time: <span class="font-italic">Tan &amp; Au LLP v Goh Tee Lee </span>[2012] 4 SLR 1 at [63]–[66], where it was observed that in assessing whether a solicitor had exercised reasonable skill and care, the solicitor should be judged in light of the circumstances at the time; <span class="font-italic">PlanAssure PAC (formerly known as Patrick Lee PAC) v Gaelic Inns Pte Ltd </span>[2007] 4 SLR(R) 513 at [54], which held that the auditors should not be assessed with the benefit of hindsight. Should the court employ hindsight to consider the question of contingent liability, it is tantamount to indirectly relying on <span class="font-italic">ex post facto </span>knowledge to examine the conduct of the company and its directors. In my view, this would be wrong.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 I accept that subsequent events that occur may be useful in the court’s assessment of a company’s solvency in so far as such events form the factual substratum from which certain inferences may be drawn concerning the state of affairs or state of mind of persons at the material time. However, in so far as OP3 seems to argue that the fact that certain events occurred, in themselves, can be relied on to show that it was reasonably likely that they would eventually occur, and that a company and its directors should or ought to have known of this, I do not agree with OP3.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The burden in proving that the likelihood of the contingent liability materialising was too remote</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 Second, OP3 submits that the party who disputes the existence or extent of the contingent liability bears the burden in proving that the likelihood of the contingent liability materialising was too remote. In particular, OP3 relies on <span class="font-italic">Parakou (CA)</span> at [46] as well as <span class="font-italic">Kon Yin Tong and another v Leow Boon Cher and others </span>[2011] SGHC 228 (“<span class="font-italic">Kon Yin Tong</span>”).

</div> Mr Foo disputes OP3’s interpretation of the cases.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 In <span class="font-italic">Parakou (CA)</span>, the Court of Appeal observed at [46] that “the [appellants], as the party asserting that the claim by [a third party] was only worth S$3,000,000, bear the burden of proving that fact”. OP3 relies on this in support of the proposition advanced. This is erroneous. As Mr Foo correctly argues, the party that puts forward a figure has the burden of establishing the correctness of the figure but the legal burden of demonstrating the existence and extent of the contingent liability remains on the party who asserts so.

In <span class="font-italic">Kon Yin Tong</span>, the court sought to assess the solvency of a company to decide whether to claw back certain payments. One of the issues concerned whether a successful claim by a third party (known as Soon Li Heng) should be taken into account in the assessment of the company’s solvency (see [21]). Part of the company’s argument was that Soon Li Heng’s claim was to be disregarded as the company had commenced a counterclaim (see [95]). In this context, OP3 relies on the court’s observation at [95] that as the company’s counterclaim was subsequently found to be without merit, “the [defendants] (or [one of the defendants], at least, since he was aware of what went on at the site) could not reasonably believe that the counterclaim had much of success.” This, OP3 submits, demonstrates that the burden of proof is shifted to the disputing party. This is incorrect. The observation at [95] relates to one of the defendants’ contemporaneous knowledge of the facts on the site such that they could not have reasonably believed that they would succeed in their counterclaim. Indeed, at [10], the court highlighted that generally, the burden of proof is borne by the party making the allegation of insolvency. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 In sum, the burden of proof remains on the party that seeks to demonstrate the existence and extent of the contingent liability.

</div> An examination of the nature of rectification works performed suggests otherwise. According to Mr Foo, the First Flood was caused by Smile Inc’s failure to clear the floor trap of debris.

</div> As such, an access panel was added to enable Smile Inc to carry out regular monthly maintenance of the drainage system. However, prior to the addition of the access panel, the drainage system was completely sealed off. This meant that Smile Inc was unable to clear the debris in the floor trap (which resulted in the First Flood) <span class="font-italic">because</span> of OP3’s omission in providing an access panel. This was conceded by Mr Foo in the course of cross-examination and demonstrates that, based on his contemporaneous knowledge, he could not have reasonably believed that OP3 should not bear <span class="font-italic">any</span> liability for the First Flood.

</div> Given so, it is tenuous for Mr Foo to then aver that it was not reasonably likely that <span class="font-italic">any</span> liability from Suit 498 would materialise.

</div> In particular, Smile Inc averred that OP3 had caused a hole in the drainage pipe in the Clinic (under Particulars following para 15, at para 18(b)) and failed to ensure that the design and construction of the plumbing and drainage works were properly carried out (under Particulars following para 15, at para 18(a)). In his defence, Mr Foo denied both allegations. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 With respect to the former, I find that there was adequate basis for Mr Foo to reasonably hold the view that the hole in the drainage pipe was not caused by OP3 at the time. He had engaged a third party known as AXN Engineering Pte Ltd on 28 August and 29 August 2014 to conduct water pressure tests, and the reports showed that there were no defects with the drainage pipes.

</div> On the other hand, he accepts that during a pre-trial conference for Suit 498, Parwani Law clarified to the court that the design of the drainage system was undertaken solely by OP3.

</div> Given that whether OP3 designed the drainage system should have been an issue well within Mr Foo’s knowledge, it is peculiar that Mr Foo’s position is equivocal. In the alternative, Mr Foo’s view that the design and construction of the drainage system was not defective may be supported by the expert report obtained from Dr Chee Yan Pong (“Dr Chee”), who opined that the design and construction of the drainage system was not defective.

The fact of the matter is that the Second Flood occurred even after rectification works. That said, I am mindful that Mr Foo’s position is not based solely on the facts known at the material time, but that it is also in part due to the legal advice from Parwani Law. With that, I turn to the issue of the legal advice on the merits of Suit 498.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-5 text-left">(B) Legal advice on the merits of Suit 498 from Parwani Law </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 Mr Foo emphasizes that after receiving the LOD, he was advised by Parwani Law that “[OP3] had <span class="font-italic">a strong defence</span> against any claims from Smile Inc and that Smile Inc was <span class="font-italic">highly unlikely to succeed in its claim</span> against [OP3]” [emphasis added]. This is stated in paragraph 24 of Mr Foo’s affidavit of evidence in chief (“AEIC”).

I begin with the Letter. This is not a contemporaneous document sent to Mr Foo in the course of Suit 498 but was specifically sent to Mr Foo for the purpose of the litigation in the present suit to confirm that legal advice was rendered, the dates on which legal advice was rendered, and the nature of the legal advice rendered. However, there is no one from Parwani Law to testify as to its contents. Such evidence is hearsay and inadmissible. Mr Foo is not relying on the mere fact of the Letter, as he contends. He seeks to demonstrate that he received legal advice of a certain nature on a particular date. For him to do so, he must rely on the contents of the Letter, namely, the confirmation by Parwani Law that they previously informed him on 15 December 2015 by way of email that he had a strong defence in Suit 498. In doing so, he is relying on an out-of-court statement (the Letter) that has been tendered to prove the facts that it refers to (the confirmation that they had provided legal advice of a certain nature on a certain date). This puts him in breach of the rule against hearsay. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 In contrast, Mr Foo’s evidence of Parwani Law’s legal advice to him at the material time, as set out in paragraphs 24 and 36 of his AEIC, is not hearsay evidence.

</div> As for the Email, it is similarly not hearsay evidence. Mr Foo received the Email, and relies on the fact of the Email to show that he received such legal advice at the time. Unlike the Letter, Mr Foo does not rely on the truth of the contents of the Email, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, that he had a strong defence in Suit 498 (which would then put into issue the factual contents of the Email), but merely the existence of such a communication from Parwani Law.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 With that, I turn to the nub of the issue, that is, the extent to which Mr Foo could have relied on the legal advice. Here, OP3 seeks to impugn the quality of Parwani Law’s legal advice by suggesting that Mr Foo failed to provide all relevant information to Parwani Law. OP3 highlights the equivocal position taken in Suit 498 vis-à-vis the design works for the Clinic to suggest that an incomplete account of the facts was provided to Parwani Law.

</div> In response, Mr Foo argues that the assertion by OP3 is baseless and that there is no evidence to suggest that Mr Foo should not have relied on Parwani Law’s legal advice. Additionally, Mr Foo contends that if OP3 had sought to advance such a proposition, OP3 should have called a representative of Parwani Law as a witness.

</div> In any event, as Mr Foo contends, it was indicated at a pre-trial conference of Suit 498 that OP3 was involved in the design of the works at the Clinic. For present purposes, it suffices to note that Parwani Law was informed that OP3 was involved in the design works, as evinced by the position communicated at the pre-trial conference, which directly contradicts OP3’s factual basis for impugning the quality of Parwani Law’s legal advice. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">71 Having said that, it is unclear whether Mr Foo may rely on the legal advice provided by Parwani Law to the extent that he seeks to justify his position that it was not reasonably likely that <span class="font-italic">any</span> liability would arise from Suit 498. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">72 In <span class="font-italic">Turf Club Auto Emporium Pte Ltd and others v Yeo Boong Hua and others and another appeal </span>[2018] 2 SLR 655 (“<span class="font-italic">Turf Club Auto Emporium</span>”), the court outlined the extent to which a fiduciary may rely on legal advice in the context of deciding whether the director had breached his fiduciary duties to the company. In particular, the court noted:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">338 The more critical inquiry is whether and to what extent the fact that a defendant-director acted on legal advice before adopting a certain course may be relied on to prove that he had acted <span class="font-italic">bona fide</span> in the interests of the company. In our view, that mere fact cannot necessarily mean that the defendant-director <span class="font-italic">had</span> acted <span class="font-italic">bona fide</span> – this would, as the Respondents submit, encourage and enable directors to use their lawyers as “legal cover”. Rather, it is simply one factor to be considered in the overall analysis. Further, where a person attempts to rely on the fact that he had acted on legal advice to prove his <span class="font-italic">bona fides</span>, it is necessary for the court to be given sufficient information about the circumstances under which such advice was provided so as to be able to evaluate the appropriate <span class="font-italic">extent</span> to which that person can rely on that fact.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis in original]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">73 In <span class="font-italic">Turf Club Auto Emporium</span>, the court placed little weight on the advice provided to the defendant-director as it was unclear what the terms of the advice provided were (as it was not given in written form) and that there were “no briefs, instructions, letters or attendance notes on this matter (if any at all) in evidence” (see [339]). As such, there was no real clarity as to what the legal counsel was consulted on, or as to what background information was provided by the defendant-director.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">74 Drawing guidance from <span class="font-italic">Turf Club Auto Emporium</span>, for legal advice to meaningfully form the basis for a course of action, there must be sufficient information about the circumstances in which such advice has been provided. On Mr Foo’s case, apart from the Email referred to in the Letter, he has not provided any further evidence concerning the circumstances and context in which the legal advice was provided. As I pointed out, the contents of the Email cannot be referred to, and the Letter is inadmissible for hearsay. Even if I were to consider the contents of the Email and or the Letter, both are short on details. They only state an overall assessment of the merits of the case. They do not contain any analysis of the factual and legal disputes. No reasons are furnished. No information concerning the surrounding context and circumstances of the legal advice are set out, and there is no reference to any other briefs, instructions, letters or attendance notes. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">75 While the present proceedings are not concerned with the merits of the legal advice provided by Parwani Law, the chink in Mr Foo’s position is that not enough has been done to demonstrate the context and circumstances under which the legal advice was obtained to justify his reliance on the legal advice to the extent that he did. In this regard, I disagree with Mr Foo that it fell upon OP3 to call a representative from Parwani Law to dispute his position. In the absence of any further evidence, it is difficult for Mr Foo to seek to rely on the legal advice to the extent he seeks – that OP3 bears no liability for the matters in Suit 498.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-5 text-left">(C) LOD and the closure of the Clinic</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">76 In its case against Mr Foo, OP3 further relies on the LOD and the closure of the Clinic following the First and Second Floods. For both items, I accept that they are not in themselves indicative of liability. In response, Mr Foo deals with both matters as part of his broader narrative that OP3 was not liable based on an objective assessment of the merits of Suit 498 and the legal advice received from Parwani Law. As such, I rely on my earlier findings at [61] and [75]. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(3) Conclusion</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">77 In the round, I find that Suit 498 is a contingent liability that was reasonably likely to materialise as at 25 May 2015. Based on an objective assessment of Suit 498, Mr Foo could not have reasonably opined that it was not likely that OP3 would face any liability at all. The legal advice provided to Mr Foo cannot be relied on by him for such a position. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The value to be ascribed to Suit 498 as a contingent liability</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">78 Parties agree that the value to be ascribed to Suit 498 should be based on an objective assessment<span class="font-italic"> </span>of the facts and evidence: <span class="font-italic">Parakou (CA)</span> at [44].

Between the two values, OP3 argues that Mr Foo, being a director, should have accounted for the larger sum.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">79 Mr Foo, in turn, maintains that no value should be ascribed to Suit 498 as a contingent liability. Given the various figures provided by OP3’s witnesses, there is no way to reliably estimate the value of Suit 498.

</div> In Mr Jagtiani’s view, it was clear that the claim for loss of management and time lacked robust evidence or support. In response, Mr Foo highlights that Mr Jagtiani’s assessment was made without reference to the Defence or Counterclaim filed in Suit 498, Parwani Law’s legal advice, the expert report by Dr Chee, or the judgment on liability issued in Suit 498. I agree with Mr Foo’s criticisms of Mr Jagtiani’s methodology. Based on paragraph 3.4 of Mr Jagtiani’s report, his assessment was undermined by the limited documents provided to him.

</div> Yet, between the two estimates, there is a noticeable difference of $224,186. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">83 That said, I have rejected Mr Foo’s primary case that no value should be ascribed to Suit 498. Mr Foo’s secondary case is that even if a value is to be ascribed, it will not be insolvency inducing. The issue, however, is that Mr Foo has not indicated what such a value would be. While it might appear that there is some difficulty in estimating the value of liability arising from Suit 498, this should not be overstated. It is not for Mr Foo to argue that the difficulty of estimating the liability of Suit 498 is so insurmountable that no value should be ascribed. This is especially so when Mr Foo bears the evidential burden, on its secondary case, in asserting that any value that might be ascribed would not be insolvency inducing, as indicated at [49].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">84 Keeping in mind that an objective (and not a subjective) inquiry is to be undertaken to determine the liability to be ascribed to Suit 498, I broadly consider the following factors: (a) the LOD, Writ of Summons and Statement of Claim; (b) the legal advice provided by Parwani Law; and (c) the events leading up to Suit 498.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">85 I begin with the full sum claimed in the Writ of Summons and Statement of Claim of $1,807,626. This is not only a fair reflection of the facts known to Mr Foo as at 25 May 2015 but it also takes OP3’s case at its highest at the time. Both the liquidator and Mr Jagtiani take the view that the claim for loss of management time and effort, amounting to $265,420, was without basis. For the liquidator, he explained that it is difficult to obtain a reliable estimate of such costs.

</div> Given so, it would have been reasonable for Mr Foo to find that this head of claim was without merit. This would leave Mr Foo with a sum of approximately $1,551,206 (by taking off $265,420 from sum of $1,807,626), based solely on the Statement of Claim. Further, Mr Foo had a <span class="font-italic">bona fide</span> belief in the counterclaim he had commenced against OP3, in the sum of approximately $79,000 for the amount owing under the original contract. Accounting for this figure, and rounding off, Mr Foo would have had to consider a sum of approximately $1,470,000. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">86 At the material time, Mr Foo received legal advice in OP3’s favour. Weight can be placed on the legal advice given (although not to the extent that Mr Foo had sought to do so in their primary case). Specifically, he was informed that he had a “strong defence”. Ordinarily, such advice would be understood to mean that there is a more than likely chance that the claim would be successfully defended. However, as pointed out earlier, no details to support the advice are given. That said, as the advice is couched in strong terms, it would have been fair and reasonable for Mr Foo to apply not an insubstantial discount on the working sum of $1,470,000. Conservatively, it would have been fair and reasonable for Mr Foo to understand that Smile Inc might only have a 35% to 40% chance of winning the case in its entirety and conservatively apply a discount between 60% and 65% to the working sum of $1,470,000. This would also broadly take into account Mr Foo’s view that OP3 was not responsible for the hole in the drainage pipe, as explained at [57].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">87 Further, Mr Foo would have also reasonably perceived the figures to be inflated. It cannot be gainsaid that the Writ of Summons sought a sum that was close to triple the amount sought in the LOD that was sent on 22 August 2014. Put simply, within a year, the claim sought by Smile Inc almost tripled in value. Following the receipt of the LOD, Mr Foo, sought a breakdown of the sum sought in the LOD to no avail.

</div> Further, Suit 498 originated from a dispute over a contract with a value of $158,010. That said, a major part of the increase in the claim arose from the closure of the Clinic for an additional period after the Second Flood. These factors, in the round, would have given some basis for Mr Foo to have applied a further marginal discount of about 5%. On a rough and ready basis, it would have been reasonable for Mr Foo to have discounted between 65% to 70% from $1,470,000, to arrive at a range of around $441,000 to $514,500. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">88 For the reasons stated above, based on an objective assessment of the evidence placed before me, OP3 is unable to prove that either the sum of $1,542,206 or the sum of $534,189 should be attributed to the contingent liability. Instead, I find that the liability likely to arise from Suit 498 would range between $441,000 and $514,500. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">89 In conclusion, I find that it was reasonably likely that some liability arising from Suit 498 would materialise. Arising from Mr Foo’s position that no liability of any extent was reasonably likely to materialise, the mere finding that some liability was reasonably likely to materialise means that Mr Foo’s primary case must be rejected. Based on an objective assessment of the evidence, as at 25 May 2015, a sum of between $441,000 to $514,500 should have been accounted for.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Whether OP3 was insolvent or financially parlous from 25 May 2015 onwards </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">90 Before determining OP3’s solvency from 25 May 2015 onwards, I make two observations. First, both parties primarily rely on the technical accounting tests, <span class="font-italic">ie, </span>the balance sheet test and the cash flow test, to submit on the financial health of OP3 at the end of 2015, 2016 and 2017. No financial documents were available for the dates of the impugned transactions. This gap was especially glaring for the dividend sum of $400,000 paid on 13 July 2016 – which is a date sandwiched between the close of two financial years, <span class="font-italic">ie, </span>31 December 2015 and 31 December 2016. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">91 Bearing in mind the contingent liability arising from Suit 498, I will analyse OP3’s solvency with reference to these tests for the end of financial years of 2015, 2016 and 2017. In this process, the reports of Mr Jagtiani and Mr Foo’s expert witness, Mr Kon Yin Tong (“Mr Kon”), could not be fully relied on. In respect of Mr Jagtiani, I do not accept the figures he attributed to the contingent liability arising from Suit 498. As for Mr Kon, he proceeded on the premise that no contingent liability should be accounted for in December 2015 (which I disagree with). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">92 Second, in line with <span class="font-italic">Dynasty Line,</span> the parties also rely on a broad assessment of the facts and circumstances of the case to argue whether OP3 was financially parlous at the material time. I agree, and it is the approach I adopt below. With that said, I will begin to consider OP3’s financial health. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Financial state of OP3 as at 31 December 2015</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">93 Beginning with the balance sheet test, as at 31 December 2015, OP3 had net assets of $1,136,982. This is an updated figure after correcting for the erroneous recording of the payment of the dividend sum of $400,000 (see s/n 3 of the table at [9]) in the 2015 financial statement when it was, in fact, declared and paid in 2016.

</div> This was the state of affairs <span class="font-italic">after </span>the dividend sums totalling $1,900,000 paid on 11 December 2015 and the repayment of $138,352 (see s/n 1, 2 and 5 of the table at [9] above). Factoring in the contingent liability likely to arise from Suit 498, of between $441,000 to $514,500, OP3 was balance sheet solvent.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">94 Turning to the cash flow test, as at 31 December 2015, OP3 had cash and cash equivalents of $1,551,604. OP3’s bank balance was $1,289,216.30. The invoices due and payable as at 31 December 2015 amounted to a sum of $941,224.81. However, if the invoices which have no specified due dates (which amounted to a sum of $456,349.12) were considered, OP3 would be cash flow insolvent. In this regard, Mr Foo avers that he would, in any event, have provided the necessary funds to OP3 to make the payments. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">95 In <span class="font-italic">Kon Yin Tong</span>, the court offered guidance on the application of the cash flow test in the context of ascertaining the solvency of a company to decide whether a director has breached his duties. The primary concern of the cash flow test is whether a company’s financial position allows it to continue in business and pay its way: <span class="font-italic">Kon Yin Tong</span> at [38]. Essentially, the company should be able to meet its obligations as and when they fall due. The court further clarified that obligations “as they fall due” indicates a continuous succession of debts rather than a calculation of debts existing on any particular day: <span class="font-italic">Kon Yin Tong </span>at [38]. Further considerations in the application of the cash flow test include a determination of all of the assets of the company as at that time in order to determine the extent to which those assets were liquid or were realisable within a timeframe that would allow each of the debts to be paid as and when it becomes payable: <span class="font-italic">Kon Yin Tong</span> at [37(b)].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">96 Keeping in mind that the burden of proof is borne by the party making the allegation of insolvency, it falls on OP3 to demonstrate that it was cash flow insolvent at the material time: <span class="font-italic">Kon Yin Tong </span>at [35]. To this end, if OP3’s case rests on the invoices with no specified due dates being taken into account, OP3 must establish why these invoices ought to be considered. While Mr Foo has not provided evidence as to his assertion that he would provide the necessary funds for OP3, this presupposes that the invoices with no due dates ought to be considered such that funds would be required. Further, OP3 has not shown, for instance, that the assets of OP3 were illiquid or not realisable within a timeframe which would have enabled OP3 to pay the debts as and when they became payable. As such, I find that OP3 has failed to show that it was cash flow insolvent as at 31 December 2015.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">97 I am unpersuaded by OP3’s alternative case that it was in a parlous financial state. Briefly, OP3 alleges that: (a) there was no doubt that the contingent liability for Suit 498 would materialise; (b) Mr Foo knew that OP3  was likely to be held liable based on the facts known to him; (c) Mr Foo started preparations to move the business from OP3 to OP3 Creative since May 2015; and (d) Mr Foo diverted all new business to OP3 Creative and/or that OP3’s revenue was at risk because of Suit 498.

Even if these amounts were considered in full, it is unclear if OP3 was in a parlous financial state. The present situation is quite unlike <span class="font-italic">Dynasty Line</span> where the court held at [36] that the company was in a position of or approaching insolvency. There, the company faced significant liabilities of HK$230m. Yet, the director therein pledged away the company’s <span class="font-italic">sole</span> asset. Point (c) is entirely unsubstantiated and lacking in particularity. As for point (d), this is discussed further at [131]. For present purposes, it suffices to note that OP3 secured five contracts between June 2015 and October 2015.

As explained by Mr Kon, the concept of “going concern” pertains to the position of a company at a particular point in time to determine if there is sufficient working capital to carry on business for the next 12 months, in a manner that is not dissimilar to that of the balance sheet test.

</div> As I have indicated at [44], while auditors use hindsight in the audit of statements, for present purposes, events that occur after-the-fact, such as the liability judgment, should not be taken into account. In other words, at the point of the preparation of the 2016 financial statements, the judgment debt would not have been known by OP3. That said, the contingent liability of between $441,000 and $514,500 for Suit 498 should have been factored in.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">102 Mr Foo, in turn, argues that OP3 had $87,747 in cash or cash equivalents at the end of 2016 as well as ongoing projects which were generating profits. The latter point is bare and unsupported. As for the former, it is unclear what the thrust of Mr Foo’s argument is. By itself, the sum does not indicate that OP3 was cash flow solvent, given my observations at [95]. It also would not have satisfied the value that I have ascribed to Suit 498. Without further analysis, it does not demonstrate OP3’s solvency at the material time.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">103 No cash flow test was done at the end of 2016.

Therefore, it is necessary to consider whether OP3 was insolvent or financially parlous in mid-2016. In this connection, as conceded by the liquidator, there are no financial documents regarding OP3’s financial position in mid-2016.

</div> On the basis that by the end of the year, OP3 still had net assets of $157,683, prior to the transaction involving the dividend sum of $500,000, it does not appear that OP3 was balance sheet insolvent. In particular, OP3 would be in the position to provide for the contingent liability of $441,000 to $514,500 arising from Suit 498.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">105 OP3 argues that it was financially parlous from 25 May 2015 onwards (see above at [97]) and relies mainly on the same arguments for its financial health in mid-2016. Compared to the situation at the end of 2015 as analysed in [97] and [98], one noteworthy development is the sharp drop in revenue from the end of 2015 to the end of 2016 of 87.6%. While parties dispute the reason for the decline (which I set aside for now), I am mindful that Mr Foo does not deny the significant year-to-year drop in revenue. Such effects would arguably have been felt by mid-2016, as confirmed by a net loss of $72,299 at the close of the year. That said, the drop in revenue, by itself, is inadequate. It only reflects a general fall in earnings on a year-to-year basis but says little about whether the drop of revenue experienced by July 2016 should raise concerns about OP3’s financial situation. More context is required. For instance, it would have been useful to have some evidence concerning the status of OP3’s business contracts such that the fall in revenue by July 2016 may be appropriately assessed. It bears reminding that at the close of 2015, OP3 had cash and cash equivalents of $1,551,604, a bank balance of $1,289,216.30, and net assets of $1,136,982. It had sufficient funds to provide for the contingent liability, and to pay the dividend sum of $400,000. Even against the backdrop of worsening business, it seems to me there is insufficient basis to find that OP3 was in a financially parlous state by mid-2016.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Financial state of OP3 as at 31 December 2017</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">106 Without factoring in the contingent liability arising from Suit 498, as at 31 December 2017, OP3 was clearly balance sheet insolvent, bearing negative assets of $545,568.

This understanding appears to be shared by Mr Foo, as seen from the Defence (Amendment No 1) at paragraph 21, which states that “[Mr Foo] avers that he had reasonable grounds to believe that OP3 International was solvent and not in a financially parlous situation at the material time that the dividends were <span class="font-italic">declare</span><span class="font-italic">d”</span> [emphasis added].

It is on this ground alone that OP3 alleges that the declarations of dividends were improper. That Mr Foo has been able to meet OP3’s case on this front is apparent from a review of its closing submissions, which focuses heavily on demonstrating the solvency of OP3 at the material time. As such, I cannot agree that Mr Foo was prejudiced. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Declaration and payment of dividends in 2015</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">114 By 31 December 2015, OP3 was not insolvent or financially parlous (see [99]). Therefore, in acting in the interests of OP3, Mr Foo did not have to consider the interests of creditors. In this regard, OP3’s allegation, which is premised on Mr Foo having such a duty, falls away. Without more, Mr Foo was not in breach of his duties by way of the declarations and payments of the dividend sums in 2015 out of retained earnings for 2012 to 2014 (s/n 1 and s/n 2 at [9]).  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Declaration of dividends in 2016</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">115 In mid-June 2016, OP3 was not insolvent or financially parlous.

</div> In particular, he sought the opinion of Dr Chee (see [59]) and Mr Wong King Kheng (“Mr Wong”), an auditor usually engaged by OP3 to assist with the preparation of the audited accounts.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">117 I disagree that Mr Foo has discharged his duty to consider the interests of creditors. His reliance on the legal advice from Parwani Law and the opinion of Dr Chee is misplaced. The advice provided by both pertain to the merits of Suit 498, and not on Mr Foo’s declaration and payment of dividends in the face of a pending suit. I have also rejected Mr Foo’s reliance on the legal advice from Parwani Law as the basis to suggest that no liability should be ascribed to Suit 498. As for Mr Wong, his advice was premised on the assumption that there was no need for Mr Foo to have made any provision for Suit 498 (which I have rejected). Further, I note that when Mr Foo sought Mr Wong’s advice, it was on an informal basis. Mr Wong was not the auditor engaged by OP3 at the relevant time (as it so happened that Mr Wong was changing his place of employment). When Mr Wong subsequently audited OP3’s 2016 financial statement on 12 December 2019, he expressed doubt about the ability of OP3 to continue as a going concern in part due to the net loss incurred by OP3 of $72,299 (see [101]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">118 Accordingly, I find that Mr Foo was in breach of his fiduciary duty to act <span class="font-italic">bona fide</span> in the best interests of OP3 (including the creditors) through his declaration and payment of the dividend sum of $500,000 (see s/n 4 at the table at [9]). By doing so, Mr Foo reduced the assets of OP3 that should have been available for the discharge of liabilities to its creditors. Moreover, the dividend declaration and payment were clearly for his benefit. I should add that I deal with Mr Foo’s contention that there was a double-counting of this amount below at [120]. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Whether Mr Foo was in breach of his duties in relation to the Repayment of Moneys </span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Repayment of $138,352</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">119 I begin with the repayment of the sum of $138,352 to Mr Foo on 11 December 2015. The premise of OP3’s claim is that it was financially parlous or insolvent as at the end of 2015. Thus, the repayment would amount to an unfair preference payment. However, as I have found at [99], OP3 was not insolvent or in a parlous financial state at the end of 2015.

By seeking $682,394, OP3 has double counted the sum of $500,000. OP3, on the other hand, argues that the dividend sum of $500,000 was paid in 2016. The sum of $682,394 paid in 2017 was a distinct payment.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">121 The starting point of Mr Foo’s argument is that the general ledger shows that $500,000 was owing to Mr Foo as at 31 December 2016, and that a sum of $500,000 was paid to Mr Foo on 25 January 2017.

</div> As there is no evidence that the dividend sum of $500,000 was paid in 2016, it must have been paid on 25 January 2017 (in accordance with the general ledger). To explain the statement of cash flow for 2016, which shows that the dividend sum of $500,000 was indeed paid in 2016, Mr Foo highlights the erroneous booking of the dividend sum of $400,000 for 2016 into the 2015 accounts. This error is accepted by parties (see [93]). Mr Foo suggests that the auditors, at the point of auditing the financial statements, were aware that $2.8m in dividends had been declared in 2015 and 2016. However, because of the error in booking the dividend sum of $400,000 in the 2015 accounts, the 2015 financial statements indicate that $2,300,0000 in dividends have been issued and paid. The auditors then “proceeded on the erroneous assumption that since a total of $2,300,000 in dividends were issued and paid in 2015, the remaining S$500,000 in dividends must have been paid in 2016”.

</div> The sum of $683,294 is also reflected at note six of the 2017 audited financial statements, which show a decrease of $682,394 in the amount due to a director between 2016 and 2017. As for the general ledger that shows that a sum of $500,000 was advanced to Mr Foo in 2017, OP3 contends that it is of little assistance as it shows nothing more than an advancement of the said sum.   </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">123 Mr Foo’s analysis is sound in so far as it accounts for the absence of the dividend sum of $400,000 from the 2016 statement of cash flow due to the erroneous booking of the sum in the 2015 accounts. However, I am unpersuaded by Mr Foo’s contrived explanation that this led to the purported erroneous recording of the dividend sum of $500,000 in the 2016 statement of cash flow. It is unclear why the auditors would have assumed that the 2016 dividend sum of $500,000 <span class="font-italic">must</span> have been paid in 2016 just because the prior dividend sums were purportedly paid in 2015. This also appears to be an afterthought that was not put to Mr Wong, who audited the 2016 and 2017 financial statements. Moreover, the significance of the absence of any direct evidence that the dividend sum of $500,000 was paid in 2016 should not be overstated. For the dividend sum of $400,000, there is similarly no clear evidence to confirm that it was paid in 2016.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">124 In my view, OP3’s explanation for the two separate payments is clear and persuasive. As Mr Foo asserts that the sum of $500,000 is double counted, he must demonstrate this, and show that there were errors in the 2016 and 2017 statements of cash flow. Mr Foo has not done so. I should further add that when Mr Kon was asked to opine about the two separate entries, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, $682,394 (repayment to related parties) and $500,000 (payment of dividends) under the comparative 2016 and 2017 statements of cash flow, his tentative view was that the separate entries indicate that they are separate figures.

</div> Further, considering that these financial statements were audited, and that no issues were raised regarding the cash flow statements, it appears to be against the weight of the evidence that the sum of $500,000 was double counted in the disbursement of $682,794 that was paid to Mr Foo in 2017.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">125 Given my findings that OP3 was insolvent as of end 2016 (see [103] and [106]), Mr Foo would have had the duty to consider the interests of creditors.

In the absence of any legitimate reasons for Mr Foo to procure repayment of the sum to himself in preference to the other creditors, I find that Mr Foo failed to act <span class="font-italic">bona fide</span> in the best interests of OP3 (and the creditors) as he had misapplied OP3’s assets to the prejudice of the creditors.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Whether Mr Foo engaged in Diversion of Business, and if so, whether he was in breach of his duties </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">126 I move on to the allegations in relation to the Diversion of Business. OP3 alleges that Mr Foo started moving OP3’s business and assets to OP3 Creative from 25 May 2015 (the date on which Suit 498 was served on Mr Foo). This is to put the assets of OP3 out of reach of its creditors. For this, OP3 seeks to recover a sum of $1,993,788, which was arrived at by doubling the net profits of OP3 in 2015 (that being, $996,894).

</div> That business was diverted is evinced by the precipitous drop in OP3’s revenue between 2015 and 2017. As pleaded, in 2015, OP3’s revenue in 2015 was $10,834,505. This dropped by 87.6% to $1,343,323 at the end of 2016. By 31 December 2017, the revenue dropped to $316,888 (which was a 97% decline from 31 December 2015). From a profit of $996,894 in 2015, OP3 suffered losses by 2017. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">128 Mr Foo, in turn, argues that OP3’s allegations lack particularity. No specific contract or business opportunity has been identified by OP3. Moreover, OP3 has failed to demonstrate how the association of OP3 Creative’s email and website with OP3 caused the alleged diversion of OP3’s business. As for OP3’s drop in revenue between 2015 and 2017, Mr Foo avers that this was due to Suit 498. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">129 From the outset, OP3’s claim suffers from a lack of particularity. Not a single contract or business opportunity has been particularised to have been diverted from OP3 to OP3 Creative. This stands in stark contrast from other instances where the court has found that there was a diversion of business. OP3 has also failed to demonstrate how Mr Foo allegedly diverted these opportunities, as conceded by the liquidator.

</div> Instead, OP3’s case is heavily reliant on OP3’s drop in revenue and the association of OP3 Creative’s email and website with OP3. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">130 Turning first to the association of OP3 Creative’s email address and website with OP3, OP3 has not demonstrated how these associations have caused business opportunities to be diverted. As Mr Foo contends, it is unclear if any business opportunities were even acquired via these channels.

</div>
</div> In so far as OP3’s case is that the email address created the impression that OP3 Creative and OP3 are the same (thus diverting business to OP3 Creative), OP3 Creative’s email address would only have had such an effect after 29 September 2020. It is thus prima<span class="font-italic"> facie</span> irrelevant to the time frame highlighted by OP3, of between 2015 and 2017. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">131 As for the drop in OP3’s revenue between 2015 and 2017, this, by itself, lends little weight to OP3’s claim. Mr Foo claims that this was caused by Suit 498. Potential clients who conducted litigation searches would view OP3 unfavourably.

</div> This suggests that Suit 498 would not have affected OP3’s revenue significantly. In reply, Mr Foo distinguishes these prior suits, claiming that they involved significantly lower values and were of a different nature, with many of them being claims for non-payment that were quickly resolved.

</div> Suit 498 may be distinguished in so far as it involved a claim sevenfold greater than the next most significant claim brought against OP3 in 2014 for a sum of $266,126.65.

</div> To this extent, Suit 498 stands sufficiently apart from prior suits, and provides a basis for Mr Foo’s suggestion that Suit 498 had an adverse effect on OP3’s revenue that was unobserved hitherto. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">132 OP3 further argues that Mr Foo has overstated the effect of Suit 498 on the willingness of clients to engage OP3. Following Suit 498, OP3 located seven contracts entered in by OP3 between 25 October 2015 and 17 August 2016, suggesting that Suit 498 did not have any adverse impacts.

</div> To this, Mr Foo avers that Suit 498 made it more difficult, but not impossible, for OP3 to obtain contracts. The effects of Suit 498 were felt over a period of time, where it was increasingly difficult to obtain contracts with large corporations.

</div> While there is some intuitive appeal to Mr Foo’s explanation, it is neither here nor there. As pointed out by OP3, a number of companies were still willing to work with OP3 between 2015 and 2016. Only after 2016 did OP3’s revenue fall precipitously. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">133 Be that as it may, the above analysis concerns OP3’s response to Mr Foo’s explanation for the drop in OP3’s revenue. It does not detract from OP3’s more fundamental failure to meet its burden, that is to demonstrate that the drop in revenue was caused by Mr Foo’s diversion of businesses of OP3 from OP3 to OP3 Creative.

</div>
</div> Further, in the final analysis, even if OP3 has demonstrated that Mr Foo diverted business, the claim for $1,993,788 rests on a baseless assumption that OP3 would have earned the same profits in 2016 and 2017 as in 2015. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">134 In sum, OP3 has failed to demonstrate, on a balance of probabilities, that Mr Foo diverted businesses of OP3 from OP3 to OP3 Creative. Crucially, OP3 has failed to demonstrate any particulars of the alleged diversion. It is unclear what business opportunities specifically belonging to OP3 were diverted and by what means Mr Foo effected such diversions, if any. As such, OP3’s claim that Mr Foo was in breach of his duties by engaging in the Diversion of Business must be dismissed. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Whether relief should be granted under s 391 of the Companies Act</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">135 Based on the above, I find that Mr Foo is in breach of his fiduciary duty to act <span class="font-italic">bona fide</span> in the best interests of OP3 (and creditors) by way of the declaration and payment of the dividend sum of $500,000 as well as the repayment of the sum of $682,794 to himself. For relief to be granted under s 391 of the CA, it must be shown that Mr Foo acted honestly and reasonably, and that it is fair to excuse him for his default. These are cumulative requirements.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">136 Mr Foo contends that he acted honestly and reasonably. Mr Foo carried out water pressure tests and sought advice from experts (such as Parwani Law, Dr Chee, and Mr Wong). Similarly, for the Repayment of Moneys, on the advice of various experts, Mr Foo opined that OP3 was not insolvent or on the verge of insolvency. Mr Foo relies on similar reasons to argue that it would be fair to excuse him for his default. I am unable to agree with Mr Foo. These factors mostly pertain to Mr Foo’s reliance on advice from experts pertaining to the likelihood of liability from Suit 498 materialising. They do not go towards Mr Foo’s state of mind at the point that Mr Foo declared and paid the dividends of $500,000 in 2016 or made the repayment of $682,394 in 2017. For instance, the legal advice sought concerned the merits of Suit 498 and not whether Mr Foo should have declared another dividend of $500,000 in face of a pending suit. In any event, as I found above, Mr Foo has no reason to rely on the legal advice to the extent he did. These factors do not demonstrate Mr Foo’s honesty and reasonableness, or that it is fair to excuse him of liability. I decline to grant relief under s 391 of the CA.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">137 Based on the above, I find that a sum totalling $1,182,394, comprising the dividend of $500,000 and the sum of $682,394, should be returned to OP3. This reflects the loss caused by Mr Foo’s breaches of his duty to act <span class="font-italic">bona fide</span> in the best interests of OP3 and its creditors. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">138 Accordingly, I grant judgment against Mr Foo for the sum of $1,182,394.
