On 5 April 2012, the respondent, through his personal assistant, sent to the appellant an email that included a table listing some 277 defects which he had discovered in the Property.

</div> The appellant replied, seeking access to the Property in order to inspect the defects. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">8 Eventually, the parties carried out a joint inspection of the Property on 3 May 2012. In an email dated 15 May 2012, the appellant replied that from its information, most of the alleged defects in the respondent’s list of defects were not truly defects and were capable of rectification within a reasonable period of time. Whilst it made no admissions as to the respondent’s allegations and reserved all its rights, the appellant nonetheless asked for access to investigate the defects, establish the causes of the same and propose rectification steps. However, despite the appellant’s provision of numerous method statements to the respondent, the latter refused to grant the appellant permission to carry out rectification works, on the basis that the proposed works were unsatisfactory and insufficient. Eventually, as the parties remained at an impasse, on 16 July 2014, the respondent, after conducting two tender exercises, engaged a new contractor, JTA Construction Pte Ltd (“JTA Construction”), to carry out the rectification works. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">9 On 10 October 2016, the respondent instituted High Court Suit No 1073 of 2016 against the appellant on the basis that the latter had breached certain express and implied terms of the SPA. It was not in contention that although the respondent had initially sought to invoke cl 17 of the SPA, his suit was premised on claims under the common law. He sought:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) damages for the costs of engaging JTA Construction to rectify a total of 492 defects in the Property (excluding the lifts) (“the general defects”) in the sum of S$894,688.10;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) damages for the costs incurred in engaging independent third parties to investigate the defects in the Property in the sum of S$129,372.29;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) damages for the loss of the use of Property from 15 March 2012 to 28 May 2015 in the sum of S$867,519.64; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) damages for the costs of engaging contractors to rectify the lifts in the Property (“the lift defects”), to be assessed. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">10 The respondent alleged a total of 492 defects.

This was consistent with the principle that a common law right cannot be abrogated in the absence of clear express wording (see the Judgment at [114]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">16 As cl 17 of the SPA did not contain clear words excluding the respondent’s right to claim damages at common law, the Judge held that the respondent’s breach would only affect the amount of damages he would be entitled to, which would be determined in the second tranche of the trial (see the Judgment at [117]).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The parties’ arguments on appeal</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">17 The appellant’s first submission is that the Judge, in reaching his decision, had mischaracterised the key issue before him.

</div> There should not be an artificial distinction drawn between the right to claim under common law for admitted and non-admitted defects, save for situations where the wording of the parties’ defects liability clause expressly provides so. As we explain below (see [46]) many building defects that first manifest themselves within the defects liability period (“DLP”) may appear to be simple defects but later turn out to be more complex. For example, a stained wall that is rectified with some touching up by painting, may in fact have been caused by water ingress some distance away which underlying cause remains undetected and unrectified. Secondly, there are also defects of a serious nature that make living in the house impossible, <span class="font-italic">eg</span>, defects in the structure of the staircase that require demolition and reconstruction. Clause 17 clearly does not make provision for this kind of defect.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 There are also several problems with the appellant’s assertion that cl 17 is meant to function as a condition precedent – this is simply not supported by the wording of cl 17 or the nature of defects liability clauses. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Whether cl 17 of the SPA precluded the respondent from any common law claims for damages</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 As stated above, the appellant argues that cl 17, having been invoked but breached by the respondent, disentitles him from seeking common law damages for the admitted defects;

This kind of clause is commonly found in standard form contracts and espouses a principle commonplace in the building and construction industry. It is also closely tied to another principle regarding delivering possession of a building to a purchaser even though there are minor outstanding works. Hence, certificates of practical completion or handing over possession to a purchaser or employer often come with a list of outstanding minor works. It is common practice to allow completion of these minor outstanding works within a reasonable time from the commencement of the DLP. How long they can extend into the DLP will depend on the terms of the contract and the unique circumstances of each case.     </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Nature of a defects liability clause</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 As a preface to our discussion of defects liability clauses, we must not lose sight of the important fact that before any such clause becomes operative there will have been a breach or breaches by the contractor of its obligations to construct the building in a good and workmanlike manner according to the contract, the specifications and approved plans. It would be this breach or breaches that has given rise to the defects. Prior to the introduction of these kinds of clauses, contractors had no right to return to site to rectify defects; by the same token, an employer had no right to require the contractor to return to site to rectify defects (see I.N. Duncan Wallace, <span class="font-italic">Hudson’s Building and Engineering Contracts</span> (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 11th Ed, 1994) (“Hudson 1994”) at para 5-050). As observed in <span class="font-italic">Pearce</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at 104, while an employer may have a right to recover damages under common law from his contractors for defects, absent a defects liability clause, the employer “would have no right to require the contractors to rectify the defect, apart from the theoretical and speculative possibility that in certain circumstances the court might order specific performance of the contractor’s obligation which had been broken”.<span class="font-italic"> </span>This was clearly not a practical state of affairs. It is important to emphasise that a defects liability clause is, ultimately, for the benefit of both employer and contractor. In a well-recognised standard text, the learned author of <span class="font-italic">Hudson’</span><span class="font-italic">s Building and Engineering Contracts</span> (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 13th Ed, 2015) (“Hudson 2015”) states, at para 4-094:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The right to call for the Contractor [<span class="font-italic">sic</span>] remedy defects is in the interests of both parties and there can be no presumption that it is intended to exclude other remedies for defects. <span class="font-italic">Remedial work can usually be carried out more cheaply, and possibly more efficiently, by the original Contractor rather than by some outside Contractor brought in by the building Employer, so defects clauses may in practice confer a substantial advantage on both parties to the contract.</span> The Contractor may not only be seen as having the obligation but, in many cases, the right to make good at its own cost any defects which appear within the period … [emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 To elaborate on the commonsensical and practical position stated in Hudson 2015, where the defect relates to, <span class="font-italic">eg</span>, a cracked ceramic tile, or chipped stone cladding or a damaged piece of timber or gaps in timber flooring, the developer/contractor can easily obtain those same items either from his left-over material (which almost every contractor has factored into his supply contract to cater for wastage and/or damage) or the original supplier; issues of materials being of a different type, quality or tone will thus be non-existent or minimised. A new contractor engaged to rectify such defects may not have that same capacity for exact replacement and will certainly charge more to rectify those same items with perhaps less satisfactory results. Another example will be painted walls, where the developer/contractor will be able to get the same batch and shade of paint to rectify a patch and will not have to repaint part of or the entire wall. The developer/contractor’s familiarity with the site will also enable such rectification works to be completed more quickly and efficiently. In the case of a defect in concealed electrical wiring or water pipes, there is no question that the developer/contractor who carried out the work will be able to locate or identify the problem area and rectify the same with greater speed and lower costs than a new electrician or plumber who will, in addition, charge an uplift to warrant the same after the repairs are effected.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 However, we should not lose sight of the fact that there is an enormous range of defects that can appear in a building. The types of defects or combinations thereof that can arise in building and construction cases are as myriad as the different kinds of buildings, structures, construction methods and materials used. Defects are unsurprisingly one of the major components of almost all building and construction disputes. We need only raise a few hypothetical examples to illustrate that a defects liability clause, including cl 17, even with a 12-month duration, does not and cannot cater for some of these defects that can arise. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 As noted at [38] above, a discoloured patch in the wall which has not yet blistered, appears to be a simple “touch-up” paint job. But it can mask the real problem – water ingress behind the surface of the wall which may originate from a location that may be quite distant from the manifestation of the problem. It may be some time before the discolouration re-appears or the water ingress causes other problems. One can consider the following scenario. The owner has “invoked” cl 17 by noting and informing the developer/contractor of the presence of discoloured paint. The developer/contractor touches up the patch with paint and the owner signs off on the apparent rectification. A few months later, the discolouration reappears and soon turns into blistered paintwork. How does that problem fit into cl 17 and do the provisions of cl 17 resolve that problem? Clause 17 clearly makes no provision for the reappearance of the discoloured paint and/or blistering within or outside the DLP or the rights of the parties in such a situation. The same kind of difficulty may occur in a staircase with wooden steps anchored onto a reinforced concrete beam. Cracks in the beam are thought to be plaster or surface cracks – they are patched and painted over and the owner signs off on rectification. In actual fact, there are construction and design (reinforcement) defects in the staircase. Fifteen months later, cracks re-appear and the defects are discovered to be due to structural deficiencies requiring the demolition and re-building of the staircase beam. Again, cl 17 does not cater for this scenario. There is yet another kind of issue where the defects are of such a nature that the purchaser or owner has, with good reason, lost confidence in the contractor’s ability to rectify the defect (see <span class="font-italic">eg</span>, Hudson 1994 at para 5-051). This can happen with widespread leaks and waterproofing issues. It surely cannot be the case that the purchaser or owner must continue to allow the developer/contractor multiple opportunities over the course of the DLP to attempt to rectify such defects. Clause 17 also makes no provision for the situation where the owner or purchaser has to vacate the premises for the repairs to be carried out, as in the example of the defective staircase which requires demolition and the subsequent re-construction of the beam and staircase. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 It may be convenient at this juncture to deal with a submission by the appellant, <span class="font-italic">viz</span>, the appellant, exercising his rights under cl 17, can rectify the defect at no cost because he has engaged a main contractor who has to make good the defects without cost to him. That may well be the case here when the developer and contractor are within the same group of companies,

</div>
</div> however they are separate corporations and it remains to be seen if this is the true state of affairs. However, in returning to the appellant’s submission, where there is a developer who has separately engaged a contractor to carry out the construction, it may still not be the case that rectification of defects will be carried out at no cost to the developer. Let us take a hypothetical example. The owner who takes possession of the house finds that his white marble slabs have become stained around the door posts. The developer replaces those marble slabs, which are usually specially cut to fit around the door posts. In time, the replaced marble slab begins to stain again, with the staining becoming progressively worse. The underlying cause of these stains is that the tanalised wooden door post was not properly treated and sleeved to prevent the anti-termite and wood rot chemicals leaching out, thereby staining the white marble slabs. It is possible that the specifications in the main contractor’s contract did not require this sleeving, which might have been an oversight on the part of the developer’s architect or because it was originally envisaged that the floor tiles would be ceramic tiles that would not be affected by such staining, or that between the developer and the purchaser, they agreed to change the flooring ceramic tiles to white marble slabs. Leaving aside the issue of non-rectification of the underlying case, the main contractor would be entitled to payment for this not inconsiderable cost of rectifying the underlying cause. The same problem would arise where there is a complaint of water ingress to doors that face the elements. An architect may have neglected to provide in the specifications for a proper threshold with an adequate slope to ensure proper run-off of rain water, or forgotten to provide a detailed drawing with the required slope to the threshold, or failed to specify the maximum gap between the door and the threshold, or failed to provide the same because a canopy and some wall was removed thereby exposing that door to the elements. Rectification of this defect would result in costs to the developer. Whether a developer would have to pay its contractor would always depend on the facts of each particular case and it cannot be assumed that rectification works will be carried out at no cost to the developer. In any event, the net effect of the appellant’s argument is not that the rectification under the defects liability clause would not involve any costs whatsoever (this is clearly not the case given the admitted defects) but rather that the rectification works would be carried out by its main contractor who has to make good the defects without any cost to the appellant. However, where the rectification costs would ultimately lie would be a function of the terms of the contract between the appellant and the main contractor and the outcome of that inquiry could not possibly exclude the respondent’s common law right to claim damages.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 We note that a defects liability clause certainly does not cover latent defects or defects that will manifest after the DLP.

He placed special emphasis on cl 17.3, that as the respondent’s “right to cause the rectification works to be carried out and to recover from the [appellant] the cost of those rectification works” was premised on the appellant having failed to carry out rectification works despite being duly notified under cl 17.2, cl 17 functioned as a condition precedent to be satisfied before the respondent could pursue an action against the appellant.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 We reject Mr Singh’s argument that cl 17 is a complete code dealing with defects and an examination of the provisions in cl 17 clearly shows it cannot be construed in that way. We have already given our views on the range of defects that can arise in a building and some hypothetical examples which are outside the contemplation and provision of defects liability clause such as cl 17. We start with cl 17.1 which states that the vendor “must” make good, at his own cost and expense, <span class="font-italic">any defect</span> in the building “<span class="font-italic">which becomes apparent within the</span><span class="font-italic"> [DLP]</span>” [emphasis added] which refers to a period of 12 months from the date the purchaser receives the notice of vacant possession. This is an unexceptional statement of a basic obligation, ubiquitous in building and construction contracts, that any defects in the building which appear during the DLP must be made good at the developer/contractor’s own cost. “Defect” is defined in cl 1.1.1 very broadly as “<span class="font-italic">any</span> fault in the Building which is due either to defective workmanship or materials or to the Building not having been constructed in accordance to the Specifications” [emphasis added].

</div>
</div> The existence of such defects is a breach of cl 10. However cl 17 clearly does not deal with defects that appear after the DLP or with latent defects. So clearly, as noted above, not all breaches of cl 10 are governed by cl 17. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 The provisions of cl 17.2 obviously deal with a class of defects that can be rectified within a fairly short space of time. It provides that the vendor “<span class="font-italic">must</span>” [emphasis added] make good any defect <span class="font-italic">within one month</span> of his receiving a notice from the purchaser requiring the vendor to make good such defect. What if the defect is such that it requires more than one month to rectify or repair? Such a defect would appear to fall outside the contemplation of cl 17.2. Clause 17.2 then goes on to say that “failing which the Purchaser <span class="font-italic">may</span>” [emphasis added] embark on a course of action set out therein, <span class="font-italic">viz</span>, notify the vendor of his intention to carry out the rectification and the estimated cost of doing so and give the vendor an opportunity to <span class="font-italic">carry out the proposed rectification works within 1</span><span class="font-italic">4 days of the notice</span>, failing which the purchaser can proceed to rectify the defect by using his own workmen. The first thing to note is that under cl 17.2 the rectification works must be completed within 14 days – it is not sufficient for the vendor to merely <span class="font-italic">start</span> the rectification works within 14 days of receipt of such notice. Secondly, on its plain reading, especially with the use of the words “The Vendor must” in the opening words of cl 17.2 in juxtaposition with the word “may” in relation to what the purchaser may do, it is apparent that the course set out in cl 17.2 is an option open to the purchaser. There is a good reason for this. As noted above, there are sound practical and commercial reasons for the parties to adopt this course of action, especially for simpler and/or more straightforward defects which can be readily identified and rectified within the stipulated period of one month from the receipt of the purchaser’s notice, or rectification of which the vendor/his contractor can complete within 14 days of receiving the cl 17.2(a) notice. However, for defects which require investigation, probably by experienced surveyors or professionals to ascertain the underlying cause of the defect and the method of rectification, it would not be possible to complete the rectification works within a period of 14 days, especially given the need for proper investigations and proposed method statements before rectification works may begin. As noted above, there may also be occasions where the defects are such as to require the purchaser to move out of the premises whilst the repair works are taking place. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 Thus, the timelines in cl 17.2 demonstrate why the procedure in the defects liability clause is merely an option for the respondent to invoke, and why the word “may” is used. Further, as Mr Singh had to accept, if the appellant did not accept an alleged defect as a defect, then the strictures in cl 17 which Mr Singh sought to apply, would be of no application. Similarly, it is evident that if the respondent did not avail himself of the procedure under cl 17, the clause would not apply but could still potentially affect the damages that the respondent would recover from the appellant. There is nothing in cl 17 which even remotely suggests that if the appellant had breached any of its obligations under cl 10, then the only path the respondent could take was rectification under cl 17 and no other. As we have noted above, first, Mr Singh had to concede that cl 17 only covered admitted defects, and secondly, with certain kinds of defects, cl 17 would not be a viable procedure to adopt. We need hardly add that at times, whether something is a defect or not, is not straightforward. This case is itself a good example because in the next tranche, experts will assist the court in determining whether the defects alleged by the respondent were truly defects, and whether the rectification methods that were adopted by JTA Construction were reasonable. We should point out that nothing we have said here prevents an employer and contractor from agreeing to a longer period to rectify defects. That again is outside cl 17.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 On closer examination, the provisions of cl 17.3, upon which Mr Singh anchors his submission, fail to support his construction. It is clear that cl 17.3 comes into effect only <span class="font-italic">if</span> the respondent decides to invoke cl 17.2. If the respondent does not, the obligation remains on the appellant to make good the notified (and accepted) defect within one month of receiving the notice of defect from the respondent. The clock continues to tick if the appellant delays in accepting the notified defect as a defect. If there is any such delay, then the risk of a shortened period to effect rectification falls squarely on the appellant. When would a purchaser invoke cl 17.2? A purchaser is likely to do so if after having given notice of a defect, the vendor delays in effecting the rectification work or does not carry out such work with an adequate degree of competence. If a purchaser does invoke cl 17.2, which is akin to a final chance to the vendor, then the Vendor has “to make good the defect <span class="font-italic">within the specified </span><span class="font-italic">time</span>” [emphasis added], which must refer to the 14 days from the date of the notice. Clause 17.3 provides that if the defect is not made good within the specified time of 14 days, then the purchaser had “the right to cause the rectification works to be carried out and to recover from the Vendor the cost of those rectification works”. Clause 17.3 goes on to provide that alternatively, a purchaser “may deduct” the cost of such rectification works from the stakeholder sums held by the Singapore Academy of Law. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 There are therefore no words in cl 17 suggesting that, upon notification of defects to the vendor, a condition precedent, based upon the right of the vendor to be given an opportunity to rectify defects, must be fulfilled before the purchaser has a right to claim common law damages. On the contrary, there are conditions of time within which the rectification must be done that are imposed on the vendor in cl 17 and, as discussed above, there are some kinds of defects that fall outside the operation of cll 17.2 and 17.3. Clause 17 also does not make provision for the situation where a purchaser gives notice of a defect and the vendor does not complete the rectification within the stipulated time periods. It would appear to be the case that under cl 17 a purchaser can require a vendor’s contractor to stop work, pack up and leave the premises at the end of the stipulated period and proceed to employ his own contractor to rectify the defect. However a final decision on this exact point can await a suitable case where this issue arises. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 It is also evident that cl 17 does not contain words suggesting that the respondent’s common law rights have been replaced by those under cl 17. In our judgment, cl 17 provides a certain procedure to rectify defects that are for the benefit of both parties and cannot be read as excluding the respondent’s common law rights, which can only be done by clear words. There is little doubt that cl 17 was not designed to cater for the more serious defects as discussed above, nor for rectification works that require the respondent to vacate the premises or for defects that appear after the DLP or for latent defects. Further, Mr Singh’s submissions on cl 17 cannot be right because cl 17 clearly does not deal with consequential damages, <span class="font-italic">eg</span>, where, hypothetically speaking, a notified and accepted defect, like widespread ingress of water or the example of the defective staircase above, requires a houseowner to move out of the house during the rectification works (see <span class="font-italic">P &amp; M Kaye v Hosier &amp; Dickinson </span>[1972] 1 All ER 121 at 139, per Lord Diplock, cited by this court in <span class="font-italic">Liang Huat Aluminium </span>at [20]). We nonetheless note, once more, that outside cl 17, the same considerations of cost, effective rectification, efficiency and convenience, may, and often do, result in parties mutually agreeing to extend such tight timelines.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Judicial and academic authorities on defects liability clauses</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 Both the appellant and respondent referred us to various cases concerning defects liability clauses in order to bolster their arguments on the construction of cl 17. As stated above at [18(a)], Mr Singh relied chiefly on the decisions of <span class="font-italic">Sonny Yap</span> and <span class="font-italic">Bitannia</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>to argue that cl 17 served as a condition precedent and a complete code, while counsel for the respondent, Mr Cavinder Bull <span class="font-italic">SC</span>, submitted that we should follow the Court of Appeal’s decision in <span class="font-italic">Liang Huat Aluminium</span>, which opined that cl 17 merely provided an additional avenue for dispute resolution and did not affect the respondent’s rights under the common law.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 <span class="font-italic">Liang Huat Aluminium</span> concerned the construction of a Deed of Indemnity (“the Deed”). The developer, Hong Leong Holdings Ltd (“Hong Leong”) had engaged Comtech Corp Pte Ltd (“Comtech”) as the main contractor to build a condominium – Comtech in turn engaged Liang Huat Aluminium Ltd (“Liang Huat”) as a subcontractor for the aluminium windows and glazing works. Hong Leong later assigned to the management corporation for the condominium development (“the MC”) all their interests, rights and benefits under the Deed (see <span class="font-italic">Liang Huat Aluminium</span> at [4]). Clauses 2, 3 and 4 of the Deed in <span class="font-italic">Liang Huat Aluminium</span> collectively imposed obligations on Comtech and Liang Huat to make good defects in the works upon notice being given to either of them, with the MC being entitled to step in to remedy the defects and thereafter be reimbursed by Comtech and/or Liang Huat for the costs of remedying such defects should Comtech and Liang Huat fail to perform their obligations (see <span class="font-italic">Liang Huat Aluminium</span> at [11]). Clause 4 of the Deed stated:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">4  Should [Comtech] or [Liang Huat] fail to perform their obligations under Clause 2 and 3 above within the time directed by [Hong Leong] or in the absence of such direction, within a reasonable period, [Hong Leong] shall [<span class="font-italic">sic</span>] entitled to remedy the said defects and [Comtech] and [Liang Huat] shall forthwith on demand reimburse [Hong Leong] all costs and expenses incurred by [Hong Leong] for making good the said defects including all legal costs on a Solicitor and Client basis incurred by [Hong Leong] in enforcing this Clause.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 After completion of the works, the MC discovered certain defects in the aluminium windows and glazing of the condominium and gave formal notice of these defects to Liang Huat, and later to Comtech as well. Despite these notices, the defects remained unrectified and the MC commenced legal action against Liang Huat and Comtech for breach of contract. Before trial, Comtech went into liquidation. The trial judge found there were defects and Liang Huat was liable to make good these defects under the Deed. As the Deed was in the nature of an indemnity, the MC was entitled to go ahead with the repairs and claim reimbursement under the Deed from Liang Huat. However, since the MC had not proceeded to rectify and make good the defects and had not expended any moneys therefor, the claim for an indemnity had not arisen. He therefore dismissed their claim. The Court of Appeal, in allowing the appeal, rejected Liang Huat’s argument that the MC’s right against them was confined only to a claim for reimbursement under cl 4 of the Deed (see <span class="font-italic">Liang Huat Aluminium</span> at [16]). The Court framed the crucial issue before it as follows (see <span class="font-italic">Liang Huat Aluminium</span> at [19]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… has cl 4, by its express terms or by necessary implication, taken away the right, which the MC has at law, namely the right of action for damages for breach of contract? The answer is clearly a resounding “No”. There is nothing in cl 4, expressly or impliedly, which suggests that such a right of the MC has been taken away.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 The Court of Appeal held instead that cll 2 and 3 of the Deed constituted an agreement or undertaking to make good defects and a breach of either of these clauses gave rise to an action for damages at law. The MC had the right to claim for damages for breach of contract under common law, a right which continued to subsist. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 The Court of Appeal also cited with approval the English Court of Appeal’s decision in <span class="font-italic">Pearce</span> in determining whether the owners’ right to common law damages had been excluded due to their failure to invoke the defects liability clause (see <span class="font-italic">Liang Huat Aluminium</span> at [21]). The building contract in <span class="font-italic">Pearce</span>, a contract on the JCT Form for Minor Building Works, contained a defects liability clause (cl 2.5) which provided that any defects, excessive shrinkages or other faults, which appeared within six months of practical completion that were due to materials or workmanship not being in accordance with the contract shall be made good by the contractor entirely at his own cost. The owners accepted that the defects became apparent within the DLP but they only raised a claim for defects in their defence and counterclaim, which was after the expiry of the DLP, to a claim by the contractor for the balance owed to it.     </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 Evans LJ found that that any failure to comply with the procedure set out in cl 2.5 would not affect the purchaser’s common law right for damages. In doing so, he disagreed with the decision reached by the Recorder (see 104):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The Recorder proceeded from his finding that notice should be given, to hold that if no notice is given during the period then the employer loses all right to recover damages for the defects which have become apparent. This view, if it is correct, gives the clause a particular potency. The existence of the defect means that there was a breach of contract by the contractors. That clearly is the effect of the opening words. That breach gave the employers, subject to the contract terms, a right to recover damages, but they would have no right to require the contractors to rectify the defect, apart from the theoretical and speculative possibility that in certain circumstances the court might order specific performance of the contractor’s obligation which had been broken. <span class="font-italic">Clause 2.5 gives the employers an express right to require the contractor to return, as well as to the contractor himself the right to return and repair the defect himself, if he is willing to do so. There are no words of exclusion, yet the effect of the clause, if the judgment is correct, is that the employer’s right to damages in respect of the cost of repairs is lost for all time. It is unnecessary to cite authority for the proposition that such a right cannot be excluded except by clear, expres</span><span class="font-italic">s words or by a clear and strong implication from the express words used. </span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Mr Gibson submits for the contractors that if clause 2.5 does not have this effect, then it adds nothing to the parties’ existing rights. I cannot agree. <span class="font-italic">It gives both parties the express rights referred to above, both of which are likely to be a great practical value to the party concerned, without impinging on the employer’s common law right to recover damages for the contractor’s previous breach.</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 Evans LJ also cited with approval the judgment of HHJ Stannard in <span class="font-italic">William Tomkinson</span><span class="font-italic"> and Sons Limited v The Parochial Church Council of St Michael and others </span>[1990] 6 Const LJ 319, at 326: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">In construing such a contract, one starts with the presumption that neither party intends to abandon any remedies for its breach arising by operation of law, and clear and express words must be used in order to rebut this presumption” – per Lord Diplock in <span class="font-italic">Gilbert-Ash (Northern) L</span><span class="font-italic">imited v.

In <span class="font-italic">Sonny Yap</span>, the plaintiff homeowner engaged the first defendant (“the Contractor”) to design and build a three-storey semi-detached dwelling on his property under a memorandum of agreement (“MOA”) which incorporated the 2001 REDAS Design &amp; Build Conditions of Contract (Real Estate Developers’ Association of Singapore, 2001) (“the REDAS Conditions”). The homeowner brought a claim for delays in completion, failure to carry out the homeowner’s instructions in that three of the four bedrooms were less than the stipulated size and for defects in the building. On the last set of claims, the Contractor accepted that there were defects but took the position that first, it had promptly attended to and rectified all defects notified by the homeowners and secondly even if there were outstanding works, the homeowners had, in breach of the MOA, unreasonably refused the Contractor access to the property to carry out the rectification despite repeated oral and written requests to do so. The Contractor submitted that it was “mandatory for the employer to provide access to do remedial work and an employer’s right to have defects remedied within a stipulated time after completion is in substitution for his right to a claim in damages in respect of the cost of remedial work done by another contractor” (see <span class="font-italic">Sonny Yap</span> at [107]). The Contractor relied on a passage in Nigel M Robinson <span class="font-italic">et al</span>, <span class="font-italic">Construction Law in Singapore and Malaysia</span> (Butterworths Asia, 2nd Ed, 1996) (“Nigel Robinson”) at pp 170-171 for this proposition. The Court held that the homeowner was obliged to allow the Contractor to rectify defective works during the maintenance period and to the extent the homeowner prevented the Contractor from rectifying the defects, the homeowner was acting unreasonably and in breach of contract and he therefore could not recover the cost of rectifying those defects from the Contractor.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 It is important to note that <span class="font-italic">Liang Huat Aluminium</span> and <span class="font-italic">Pearce</span> (see [61] - [66] above) were not cited to the learned judge in <span class="font-italic">Sonny Yap</span>. Counsel for the Contractor instead relied on a text that pre-dated those authorities. Furthermore, the Court was not referred to the relevant standard practitioner’s building and construction textbooks at the time like Hudson 1994 and Stephen Furst, <span class="font-italic">Keating on Construction Contracts</span> (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 8th Ed, 2006) (“Keating 2006”), which would have provided useful guidance as to the applicable state of law. Hudson 1994 stated, at para 5-053, that in the absence of express provision, the remedies under maintenance clauses were in addition to, and not in substitution of the common law rights:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">It is always a question of construction whether the rights under the maintenance clause are intended to supplant the right to damages at common law altogether. <span class="font-italic">In the absence of express provision, the remedies under these clauses are in addition to and not in substitution for the common law rights, and even where the defects have appeared within the period the owner may sue for damages rather than call on the contractor to do the work, subject, in that event, to the possibility of the owner’s damages being limited, if he has acted unreasonably</span> in the light of the discussion in the preceding paragraphs, to the cost to the contractor of doing the work at that time, rather than the possibly greater cost of bringing in another contractor either then or at a later date. [emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 Similarly, Keating 2006 made clear at para 10-023 that:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"> “The contractor’s liability in damages is not removed by the existence of a defects clause except by clear words, so that in the absence of such words the clause confers an additional right and does not operate to exclude the contractor’s liability for breach of contract”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">These passages remain valid propositions even today, and are reflected in the modern editions of Hudson and Keating (see Hudson 2015 at para 4-095 and Stephen Furst, <span class="font-italic">Keating on Construction C</span><span class="font-italic">ontracts</span> (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 10th Ed, 2016) (“Keating 2016”) at para 11-033.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">71 Thus, in so far as Nigel Robinson is understood to postulate that the defects liability clause is in substitution for the employer’s right to claim for damages to recover the cost of rectification works carried out by another contractor, with respect, we disagree. That text has, in any case, been overtaken by subsequent case authority. To the extent that the High Court in <span class="font-italic">Sonny Yap</span> took a different view from <span class="font-italic">Liang Huat Aluminium</span> and <span class="font-italic">Pearce</span>, it was wrong and should not be followed on this point.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">72 We turn finally to address the New South Wales Supreme Court’s decision in <span class="font-italic">Bitannia</span>, which the appellant relies on as demonstrating that defects liability clauses ought to be seen as a complete code for regulating the conduct of parties. The case of <span class="font-italic">Bitannia</span> concerned the redevelopment of the Ettalong Hotel at Ettalong on the Central Coast of New South Wales. The plaintiffs had commenced legal action against the defendants for delays and defects in the construction works, and sought damages for the cost of rectification of alleged defects. The relevant clauses in the parties’ construction contract were cll 3.05 and 6.11. Clause 3.05 prescribed the following (see <span class="font-italic">Bitannia</span> at [19]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">3.05 ACCESS TO MAKE GOOD</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-italic">After taking possession of the Works the Proprietor shall allow the Builder reasonable access to the Site and the Works for making goods defects as required by Clause 6.11 provided that in carrying out any such making good the Builder shall take all reasonable measures to minimise inconvenience to the Proprietor or those then authorised by the Proprietor to occupy the Works.</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis in original]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">73 Clause 6.11 provided for the giving of instructions to rectify defects during the DLP and provided as follows (see <span class="font-italic">Bitannia</span> at [25]): </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">6.11 MAKING GOOD DEFECTS</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-italic">If at any time during the Defects Liability Period referred to in Clause 9.11 any faults, omissions, shrinkages or other defects in the Works are apparent then: </span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-italic">6.11.01  The Architect may issue an instruction to the Builder during the Defects Liability Period which shall state in what respect there are defects in the Works and may state a reasonable time within or at which the Builder shall complete the making good of those defects. </span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-italic">6.11.02  The Builder shall promptly make good such defects by appropriate rectification work and shall complete the same within or at any time stated in such instruction. </span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-italic">6.11.03  Where such defects are due to materials and/or workmanship not being in accordance with this Agreement, such making good by the Builder shall be at no cost to the Proprietor. </span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-italic">6.11.04  Where such defects occur notwithstanding that materials and/or workmanship are in accordance with this Agreement such making good shall be dealt with as would a Variation and in accordance with Clause 6.10. </span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-italic">6.11.05  If any defect is not made good within or at the reasonable time as may be so stated by the Architect or otherwise within a reasonable time the Proprietor may have the defect made good by others pursuant to the provisions of Clause 5.06.</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis in original]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">74 It was not in dispute that the plaintiffs had denied access to the defendants to carry out rectification works (see <span class="font-italic">Bitannia</span> at [55]). The defendants argued that cl 6.11 was a code determining the rights and obligations of both parties in respect of the making good of defective work – it relied on the case of <span class="font-italic">Turner Corporation Pty Ltd v Austotel Pty Ltd</span> (1994) 13 BCL 378 (“<span class="font-italic">Turner</span>”). The plaintiffs disagreed, contending that clear and express words were needed to rebut the presumption that the plaintiffs retained all remedies available to them for breach of contract (see <span class="font-italic">Bitannia</span> at [72]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">75 The Supreme Court first noted that the contract before it contained clauses that were the same, or materially the same, as the standard form building contract considered in the earlier decision of <span class="font-italic">Turner</span>. In particular, the defects liability clause was the same. In that decision, Cole J had found that the parties’ contract provided a comprehensive code that governed their respective rights and obligations (see <span class="font-italic">Turner</span> at [394] - [395]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">It follows, in my view, that the contract <span class="font-italic">does provide a code which establishes the rights, obligations and liabilities of the parties, and the mechanisms by which completion of the Works is to be achieved</span> …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-italic">…</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-italic">…</span> the contract specifies and confers upon the Proprietor its rights flowing from such breach; that is, <span class="font-italic">the parties have, by contract, agreed upon the consequences to each of the Proprietor and the Builder, both as rights and powers flowing from and the consequences of, such breach</span> …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">76 Similarly, the New South Wales Supreme Court in <span class="font-italic">Bitannia</span> found that the defects liability clause in that case also operated to restrict the rights of the plaintiffs in pursuing a common law claim for damages as there were <span class="font-italic">sufficiently clear words</span> in the defects liability clause to “rebut the presumption that a contracting party does not intend to abandon any remedies for breach of the contract arising by operation of law” (see <span class="font-italic">Bitannia</span> at [76]). Thus, the plaintiffs would only be entitled to have the work of making good carried out by others and claim the cost of doing so from the defendants in accordance with the procedures in cl 6.11.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">77 In our respectful view, the Supreme Court’s decision in <span class="font-italic">Bitannia</span> must be limited to its own special facts. The decision of the Supreme Court did not make clear which specific words were sufficiently “clear” as to disentitle the plaintiffs from their common law claims. That being said, we note that the parties’ contract in <span class="font-italic">Bitannia</span> contained more prescriptive language in cl 3.05, which expressly provided for access to the contractor during the DLP to make good defects. The contract also went into more detail regarding the applicable procedure should defects be discovered in the property. For example, the contract in <span class="font-italic">Bitan</span><span class="font-italic">nia</span> called for the architect to make the decision on the defects and issue an instruction which had to state in what respect there were defects in the works, as well as specify a reasonable time within which the contractor had to complete the making good of defects. There were also provisions providing for the contractor to notify the architect in writing if the architect’s instructions were either given in error or involved a variation of the works (cl 5.05) or where a defect occurred even though the materials and/or workmanship were in accordance with the contract, in which case it would fall to be treated as a variation (cl 6.11.04). In fact, we find it pertinent to note that other Australian decisions suggest that <span class="font-italic">Bitannia</span> ought to be confined to its specific facts.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">78 Prior to <span class="font-italic">Bitannia</span>, the New South Wales Supreme Court in <span class="font-italic">SAS Trustee Corporation v Scott Carver Pty Limited &amp; </span><span class="font-italic">others</span> [2003] NSWSC 1097 (“<span class="font-italic">SAS Trustee</span>”) had emphasised the principle that a defects liability clause merely confers an additional right to the purchaser. In <span class="font-italic">SAS Trustee</span>, it was argued that the deed between the parties contained a condition precedent to liability, and that the plaintiff had to give notification in accordance with the requirements of the deed before it would be permitted to claim for any defective work. The Court disagreed, stating at [47]–[48] that:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">47 <span class="font-italic">When one looks the terms of clause 2 one does not find any express language that notice is to be a condition precedent.

In these circumstances I am satisfied that it was not a condition precedent to liability that notice of defects be given. In these circumstances it is not necessary to deal with other arguments advanced on the plaintiff’s part in respect of any right to sue on the original contract and whether in fact notice of defects have been given.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">79 It is also important to consider the later decision of <span class="font-italic">Sun Building Services Pty Ltd v Minh &amp; </span><span class="font-italic">another</span> [2015] QCAT 134 (“<span class="font-italic">Sun Building Services</span>”) by the Queensland Civil and Administration Tribunal, which noted that <span class="font-italic">Bitannia</span> had to be seen in its proper context. The tribunal noted that both <span class="font-italic">Bitannia</span> and <span class="font-italic">Turner</span> concerned the use of JCC (Joint Contracts Committee) standard form contracts and that the clauses in those contracts removed a principal’s common law rights to sue for damages given the “detailed allocation of rights” (see <span class="font-italic">Sun Building Services</span> at [128]). The tribunal subsequently distinguished both <span class="font-italic">Bitannia</span> and <span class="font-italic">Turner</span>, holding that there were no clear or express words in the contract before it to justify the exclusion of a common law right to damages (see <span class="font-italic">Sun Building Services </span>at [131]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">80 We therefore find ample authority in support of the holding that unless there are clear words or a clear and strong implication from the express words used in a defects liability clause or in the contract, an owner or employer in a building and construction contract containing a defects liability clause does not thereby lose the right to a claim for damages at common law for defects in the building; this right includes, where applicable, his common law right to claim for consequential damages like costs of alternative accommodation and associated expenses. A defects liability clause typically confers a right on the contractor to return to site, to rectify defects at his own cost as well as the obligation to do so if called upon by the owner or employer; there is the concomitant right of the owner or employer to require the contractor to return to site and rectify defects in the building. These rights and obligations are dictated by considerations of practicality in dealing with such problems. In addition, they confer on both contractor and owner or employer not insubstantial advantages. Accordingly, if the owner or employer does not, without good reason, exercise this option to call for the contractor to return to site and rectify defects or having exercised that right, without good reason, prevents the contractor from carrying out such rectification, then such omissions or acts will impact on the owner’s or employer’s duty to mitigate and will be relevant to the amount of damages the owner or employer may recover from the contractor at common law. What does or does not amount to good reason will depend on all the facts and circumstances of each case and it is not desirable to lay down any hard and fast rule. We have generally adverted to some hypothetical situations which might amount to good reason above and we do no more than that.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">81 As explained in Hudson 2015 at para 4-096:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">...<span class="font-italic">the existence of a defects liability clause may make it reasonable for an Employer to mitigate its loss by notifying the Contractor of the defects so that they are repaired by the Contractor.</span> Thus, where the Employer does not provide the Contractor with a contractual opportunity to rectify defects during the defects liability period, the Employer can still recover the cost of repairing the defects but the sum that the Employer can recover may be limited to how much it would cost the Contractor to rectify the defects. [emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">82 The same view can be found in Keating 2016 at para 11-033:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… If the employer fails to give notice, or otherwise to avail itself of a defects clause, or fails to take up an offer by the contractor to remedy the defect, and brings a claim for <span class="font-italic">damages it may, on the principle of mitigation of loss, be liable to some reduction in the damages which would ordinarily be awarded.</span> It may not be able to recover more than the amount that it would have cost the contractor to perform the obligation.

In our view, the PSSCOC, REDAS Conditions and SIA Conditions have consistently treated their respective defects liability clauses as merely offering an alternative procedure for rectifying construction defects.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">85 A perusal of the REDAS Conditions demonstrates that cl 20 (the defects liability clause therein) does not affect an owner’s common law rights.

Academic commentaries affirm that an owner’s right under common law to sue in relation to latent defects especially (which are unlikely to be adequately covered by defects liability clauses) continue to operate under the REDAS conditions (see Eugenie Lip and Christopher Chuah, <span class="font-italic">Contract Administration Guide: to the REDAS Design and Build Conditions of Contract</span> (LexisNexis, 2012) at para 2.065).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">87 Clause 18.5 of the PSSCOC states explicitly that “[t]he provisions of [cl] 18.1 to 18.4 shall not derogate in any way whatsoever from the Contractor’s liability under the Contract or otherwise for defective work at common law.” This has been described as an “avoidance of doubt provision”, which confirms that “the Employer retains all his other rights under common law to proceed against the Contractor in respect of any defective work” (see Chow Kok Fong, <span class="font-italic">The Singapore Public Sector Construction Contract</span><span class="font-italic">: Commentary on the Public Sector Standard Conditions of Contract 7th Edition</span> (LexisNexis, 2015) at p 329).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">88 The SIA Conditions of Contract are similar to the REDAS Conditions. Clause 27(1), which concerns “maintenance following completion” states that during the defects maintenance period, the contractor “shall complete” any outstanding work, and that an owner “may at any time” following the Completion Certificate give directions or instructions for the making good of defects. The use of the term “may” in relation to the owner suggests that this is merely an option that he may wish to exercise. There is, again, academic authority supporting such a reading of the SIA Conditions (see Eugenie Lip and Choy Chee Yean, <span class="font-italic">Contract Administration Guide to the </span><span class="font-italic">SIA Conditions of Building Contract</span> (LexisNexis, 2009) at para 2.156).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Conclusion on defects liability clauses</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">89 We finally consider the applicable legislative material surrounding the standard form contract that the SPA was based upon. As stated above at [6], the parties’ SPA was in the standard form prescribed by r 12(1) of the Housing Developers Rules. When the Housing Developers (Control &amp; Licensing) Act (Cap 130, 1985 Rev Ed) (“HDA”) was first enacted, the then Minister of National Development, Mr Lim Kim San explained that the main purpose of the Act was to “…give a certain amount of protection to the innocent house purchaser by preventing the excesses of the building developers” (see <span class="font-italic">Singapore Parliamentary Debates</span><span class="font-italic">, Official Report</span> (19 November 1964) vol 23 at col 789). The policy’s aim of protecting home purchasers was reiterated in 1993 when the then Minister of State for National Development, Mr Lim Hng Kiang, explained that the “[Housing Developers Rules] are intended to regulate the practices of housing developers so that the interests of home buyers are protected” (see <span class="font-italic">Singapore Parliamentary Debates</span><span class="font-italic">, Official Report</span> (28 May 1993) vol 61 at cols 262-263). The relevant Parliamentary material surrounding the standard form upon which the SPA was based (the Housing Developers Rules) shows no change in this underlying policy of protecting home buyers; it emphasises avenues of redress for rectification of defects during the DLP and specifically notes that for defects beyond the DLP, homeowners can sue the developers for latent defects on grounds of negligence or breach of contract. There is no suggestion that the DLP provision would replace the homeowners’ rights at common law. During the Second Reading of the Consumer Protection (Fair Trading) (Amendment) Bill, then Minister of State for Trade and Industry, Mr Teo Ser Luck clarified that the standard form SPA under the HDA would not preclude purchasers from pursuing claims pursuant to breach of contract (see <span class="font-italic">Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report</span> (9 March 2012) vol 88 at pp 3-4). He explained:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Members of the public have also asked if properties and building defects are covered under the proposed law. There is already existing legislation governing the sale and purchase of new or uncompleted properties. Under the [HDA] and the Sale of Commercial Properties Act, <span class="font-italic">the standard Sale &amp; Purchase Agreement provides for a one-year defects liability period during which the developer is required to rectify any defects in the property, at the developer’s own cost. Beyond the one-year defects liability period, purchasers can still take civil action against the developer for latent defects on grounds of negligence or breach of contract, within six years from the date that the damage arose, or three years from the date that the damage was dis</span><span class="font-italic">covered, and whichever is later</span> … [emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">90 We therefore align ourselves with the ruling of the Judge that in the present case, cl 17 of the SPA did not preclude the respondent from commencing any common law claim for damages against the appellant. However, having given the appellant a notification of defects under cl 17, insofar as the respondent failed to grant access to the appellant for rectification of the admitted defects, such failure may affect the quantum of damages the respondent is able to recover at common law as a consequence of a failure to mitigate damages. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The Causation Argument</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">91 Before addressing the appellant’s remaining arguments, we find it useful to first make clear that the Judge had found two distinct breaches in the present case. First, the appellant’s breach of cl 10.1 by failing to build the Property in a good and workmanlike manner. Secondly, the respondent’s breach of cl 17 by unreasonably denying the appellant the opportunity to rectify the admitted defects. The appellant’s remaining arguments are premised on the second breach.

In our view, the respondent’s act of disallowing the appellant to conduct rectification works cannot be said to be of such significance that it would displace the appellant’s legal responsibility. We say no more as the next tranche will deal with the assessment of damages and the issue of mitigation of damages. The Judge found the appellant had breached cl 10. The appellant has not appealed against this finding. This means that some of the defects in the Property were the result of a failure to construct the building in a good and workmanlike manner according to the specifications and/or the plans approved by the Commissioner of Building Control and/or other relevant authorities on the part of the appellant. While the respondent may have acted unreasonably after discovering these defects, the appellant’s breach of cl 10.1 remains the underlying cause of the costs incurred by the respondent to rectify the defects.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">95 There is thus no merit in the Causation Argument.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The Prevention Argument</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">96 The appellant argues that to allow the respondent to pursue a claim for common law damages despite having invoked cl 17 would be to allow him to “take advantage” of his own breach of cl 17.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">98 Having earlier found that the respondent’s breach of cl 17 did not constitute a <span class="font-italic">novus actus</span>, the appellant’s Prevention Argument falls apart.

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> This circuity stems from the employer first suing the contractor for the costs of rectification. The contractor would, in turn, sue the employer for damages for his breach of cl 17, with such damages being the contractor’s loss which he would not have suffered if the employer had allowed him to rectify the defects. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">100 At the risk of belabouring the point, the effect of an employer’s denial of access to the contractor, while amounting to a breach of contract under the defects liability clause, does not result in a free-standing cause of action for the contractor. After all, it is undeniable that the defective works are attributable to the contractor, rather than the employer. There is also the not inconsiderable number of alleged defects which the appellant did not accept as defects. We should not pre-judge this issue in any way as exactly how many of these non-admitted defects were in fact defects will be investigated and assessed at the next tranche of the trial. The effect of such an employer’s denial of access is that the court may make a finding that the employer had acted unreasonably in failing to properly mitigate his losses.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">101 As stated by the English Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Pearce</span> at 104:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">There remains, however, the assessment of damages which the employer is entitled to recover. If the contractor does repair the defects, then no loss will be suffered, apart possibly from consequential losses which, both parties agree, are not barred by clause 2.5. If he does not, then the measure of loss will be the cost to the employer of having the defect repaired, unless in special circumstances the diminution in value of the property in question is appropriate. The cost of employing a third party repairer is likely to be higher than the cost to the contractor of doing the work himself would have been. So the right to return in order to repair the defect is valuable to him. <span class="font-italic">The question arises whether, if he is denied that right, the employer is entitled to employ another party and to recover the full cost of doing so as damages for the contractor’s original breach.</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">In my judgment, the contractor is not liable for the full cost of repairs in those circumstances. <span class="font-italic">The employer cannot recover more than the amount which it would have cost the contractor himself to remedy the defects. Thus, the employer’s failure to comply with clause 2.5, whether by refusing to allow the contractor to carry out the repair or by failing to give notice of the defects, limits the amount of damages which he is entitled to recover.</span> This result is achieved as a matter of legal analysis by permitting the contractor to set off against the employer’s damages claim the amount by which he, the contractor, has been disadvantaged by not being able or permitted to carry out the repairs himself, or more simply, by reference to the employer’s duty to mitigate his loss …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">102 Thus, in <span class="font-italic">Sun Building Services</span>, the tribunal decided to disallow the respondent from claiming a 30% margin on the cost of performing the work. The tribunal stated, at [141]–[142]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[141] I have found that clause 21 does not exclude a common law claim in damages. However, failure to give access is a breach of clause 21. It is not necessary to decide whether Sun Building Services has a right to terminate the contract for that breach, because on any view it has affirmed the contract by stating that it wants the opportunity to rectify or complete the works.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[142] I am satisfied that in assessing common law damages for Sun Building Services’ breach I should take into account the homeowners’ breach of clause 21. I accept that disallowing the 30% margin is reasonable. Sun Building Services’ damages for such a breach is, at least the 30% margin on the cost of performing the work because but for the breach it would not be obliged to incur such an amount.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">103 This approach makes eminent sense as it recognises the potential value of a defects liability clause to both the contractor and the purchaser – the purchaser is expressly given a right to require rectification without having to engage in a separate claim for damages under the common law (should he so desire), and the contractor is given the opportunity to rectify certain defects (which would be at a lower cost to him than if the purchaser had engaged a new set of contractors).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">104 The final point that the appellant raises, which is related to its point on circuity, is that there would be no costs involved if the appellant had been allowed to rectify the admitted defects.

<p>----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">Decision of the Court of Appeal (delivered by Justice Quentin Loh):</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">Outcome: CoA dismisses the appeal. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: black; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">Pertinent and significant points of the judgment</span></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li><span style="color: black; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">Defects liability clauses benefit both the employer and the contractor.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: black; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">In the absence of express and clear language, defects liability clauses are in addition to and not in substitution for the employer’s common law rights and do not operate to exclude the contractor’s liability for breach of contract. </span></li>
<li><span style="color: black; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">An employer’s refusal to allow the contractor access to perform rectification works does not operate to extinguish the employer’s common law rights to recover damages for defects but would be relevant for the quantum damages recoverable pursuant to the employer’s duty to mitigate damage. </span></li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">Introduction</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">1<span style="white-space:pre;"> </span>The appellant was the developer of Sandy Island, a collection of 18 waterfront villas located in Sentosa Cover. By way of a Sale and Purchase Agreement (“the SPA”), the respondent purchased a four-storey detached bungalow at Sandy Island (“the Property”). </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">2<span style="white-space:pre;"> </span>The SPA was in the standard form prescribed by r 12(1) of the Housing Developers Rules (Cap 130, R1, 2008 Rev Ed). Under cl  17.1, the appellant had to make good at his own cost and expense any defects that became apparent within a defects liability period of 12 months. Clause 17.2 provided that upon being notified of a defect, the appellant had to make good the defect within one month of its receipt of such notice; and if the appellant failed to carry out the rectification works within the specified time, the respondent had the right to cause the rectification works to be carried out by a third party and to recover from the appellant the cost of those rectification works.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">3<span style="white-space:pre;"> </span>Soon after entering into possession, the respondent complained of numerous defects in the Property. Following a joint inspection of the Property by the parties, the appellant asked for access to investigate the defects, establish the causes of the same and propose rectification steps. However, the respondent refused to grant the appellant permission to carry out rectification works.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">4<span style="white-space:pre;"> </span>Eventually, as the parties remained at an impasse, the respondent, after conducting two tender exercises, engaged a new contractor to carry out the rectification works. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">Background to the appeal</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">5<span style="white-space:pre;"> </span>On 10 October 2016, the respondent instituted High Court Suit No 1073 of 2016 against the appellant on the basis that the latter had breached certain express and implied terms of the SPA. It was not in contention that although the respondent had initially sought to invoke cl 17 of the SPA, his suit was premised on claims under the common law. The respondent sought damages for, <em>inter alia</em>, the costs of engaging its new contractor to rectify a total of 492 defects in the Property. The appellant admitted to 222 defects in full and 85 defects in part, but emphasised that it had been prevented by the respondent from accessing the Property to carry out rectification works.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">6<span style="white-space:pre;"> </span>The parties had agreed that the trial would be held in two tranches with the first tranche centring on the appellant’s liability for defects in the Property, and the second tranche determining the extent and severity of these defects, after the taking of expert evidence. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">7<span style="white-space:pre;"> </span>During the first tranche, the High Court Judge (“the Judge”) considered that the central issue before him was whether, notwithstanding the appellant’s breach, the respondent was precluded from claiming damages against the appellant as a result of his obligations under cl 17. The Judge found that the appellant had breached its obligations under cl 10 (which provided for constructing the building in a good and workmanlike manner according to the contract) as manifested by the many defects but also held that the respondent had breached his duty in refusing to grant access to the appellant to rectify the admitted defects. The Judge held that despite the respondent’s breach, the respondent continued to possess a common law right to claim damages for defects in the Property, but his breach was relevant to the quantum of damages recoverable pursuant to his duty to mitigate damages.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">The decision on appeal</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">8<span style="white-space:pre;"> </span>Contrary to the appellant’s claim, the Judge had properly identified and addressed the key issue before him. In the proceedings before the Judge, the appellant had argued that given the existence of the defects liability clause, as well as the respondent’s breach of said clause, the respondent would not be able to pursue any claim against the appellant for the defects under common law. In the proceedings before the Court of Appeal the appellant changed its position and accepted that the respondent was not precluded from pursuing his common law claims for those defects that the appellant did not admit were defects: at <strong>[31]</strong> - <strong>[32] and [38]</strong>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">9<span style="white-space:pre;"> </span>The Court of Appeal emphasised that defects liability clauses are, ultimately, for the benefit of both employer and contractor. Prior to the introduction of these kinds of clauses, contractors had no right to return to site to rectify defects; by the same token, an employer had no right to require the contractor to return to site to rectify defects: at <strong>[43] - [44]</strong>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">10<span style="white-space:pre;"> </span>Defects liability clauses do not and cannot cater for some of the defects that can arise in building and construction cases. Clause 17 made no provision for circumstances involving recurring defects that stemmed from underlying problems with the Property or for serious rectification works that required the employers to move out of the property: at <strong>[45]</strong> - <strong>[46]</strong>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">11<span style="white-space:pre;"> </span>The defects liability clause contained in cl 17 was merely an option for the respondent to invoke. The provisions of cl 17.2, which required the appellant to rectify any defect within one month of his receiving a notice, dealt only with defects that could be rectified within a fairly short space of time. There were also no words in cl 17 suggesting that, upon notification of defects to the appellant, a condition precedent, based upon the right of the appellant to be given an opportunity to rectify defects, had to be fulfilled before the respondent had a right to claim common law damages: at <strong>[55]</strong> - <strong>[58]</strong>. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">12<span style="white-space:pre;"> </span>The Court of Appeal held that the defects liability clauses contained in the various standard form construction contracts in Singapore had consistently treated their respective defects liability clauses as merely offering an alternative procedure for rectifying construction defects: at <strong>[84]</strong> - <strong>[88]</strong>. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">13<span style="white-space:pre;"> </span>The relevant Parliamentary material surrounding the standard form contract upon which the SPA was based emphasised avenues of redress for rectification of defects during the defects liability period and specifically noted that for defects beyond the defects liability period, homeowners could sue the developers for latent defects on grounds of negligence or breach of contract. There was no suggestion that the homeowners’ rights at common law would be replaced by a defects liability clause: at <strong>[89]</strong>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">14<span style="white-space:pre;"> </span>The Court of Appeal held that the respondent’s act of disallowing the appellant to conduct rectification works could not be said to be of such significance that it would displace the appellant’s legal responsibility for defective works: at <strong>[94]</strong>. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">15<span style="white-space:pre;"> </span>However denying access to or preventing the appellant from carrying out rectification works would be relevant to the quantum of damages recoverable from the appellant pursuant to the respondent’s duty to mitigate his loss: <strong>[100]</strong>. </span></p>
