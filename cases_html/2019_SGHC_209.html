</div> In my view, this has not been precisely pleaded. In fact, the defendant had no objections to the plaintiff’s use of the area as an ORA.

This was because before the plaintiff commenced renovation works in July 2012, the plaintiff had not submitted any renovation plans for the defendant’s approval nor obtained the written permission of URA and it had commenced renovation works before the CSC was issued. According to MP, the structures and wooden decking that the plaintiff was constructing would have delayed the issuance of the CSC as approvals would be required from government authorities such as URA and NEA.

On 24 April 2017, NEA sent the plaintiff a letter of warning pertaining to public complaints received regarding the smell nuisance from the plaintiff’s business, which was affecting the residents living above the Units. In the letter, NEA noted that their inspections revealed that the cooking smell could be detected from the outlet of the plaintiff’s exhaust system.

</div> As such, I do accord Jasper’s testimony its appropriate weight. Second, I note the inconsistencies between the TKC’s AEICs and his <span class="font-italic">viva voce</span> evidence regarding the use of the terms “F&amp;B” or “food court” in NES’s communications to him (see above at [55]). Third, it is unlikely that TKC did not ask and NES also did not mention about the type of business that he intended to operate in the Units, especially after TKC managed to convince NES to purchase two units, instead of one. Fourth, the circumstantial evidence points to TKC’s knowledge of NES’s intention to set up a <span class="font-italic">zichar</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>restaurant. In November 2011, TKC, MP and the defendant’s staff visited the plaintiff’s <span class="font-italic">zichar</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>restaurant in Bedok North to have dinner. According to the plaintiff, this was intended for the defendant to better understand the nature of the plaintiff’s other <span class="font-italic">zichar</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>business in order to help set up the plaintiff’s future business in the Development.

</div> This seems probable and I find that TKC must have been aware of NES’s intention of possibly setting up a <span class="font-italic">zichar</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>restaurant in the Units, especially after visiting the plaintiff’s <span class="font-italic">zichar</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>restaurant in Bedok North. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 On the balance of probabilities, I find that in the meetings prior to the signing of the OTPs on 13 April 2012, TKC did make representations to NES that the Units could be used as a <span class="font-italic">zichar</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>restaurant or food court and that there “should be no problem” (<span class="font-italic">ie</span><span class="font-italic">, </span>Initial R1).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">Implied meaning of Initial R1</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 I now turn to the implied meaning of Initial R1. I am of the view that Initial R1 could not have been (i) a <span class="font-italic">guarantee</span> by the defendant that the Units’ approved use had already been changed or would be changed from a “shop” to a “restaurant” by URA and (ii) a <span class="font-italic">guarantee</span> that the Units would be capable of being used for heavy cooking and the plaintiff’s Principal Activities by ensuring that NEA would approve the plaintiff’s food shop licence. At best, I can accept that Initial R1 implied that the defendant would <span class="font-italic">try its best to </span><span class="font-italic">assist</span> the plaintiff with (a) its applications to URA to change the use of the Units from a “shop” to a “restaurant”; and (b) its applications to NEA for a food shop licence. These are the reasons for my decision.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 First, NES and KC admitted in their testimony that at the time of the signing of the OTPs, when NES asked why the words “restaurant/food court” had not been stated in Clause 20M, TKC’s reply was that “it was not an issue and if the plaintiff encountered any difficulties, they [could] rely on him and the defendant for <span class="font-italic">help</span><span class="font-italic">.</span> [emphasis added]” (see above at [22]). This shows that NES and KC were fully aware that the Units were not approved as restaurants before NES signed the SPAs. Further, Jasper conceded during his cross-examination that no guarantee had been given by TKC (see above at [52]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 Moreover, it is undisputed that only governmental authorities are able to grant a change of the approved use of the Units or the food shop licences. In <span class="font-italic">Pender Development Pte Ltd and another v Chesney Real Estate Group LLP and another and another suit </span>[2009] 3 SLR(R) 1063 (“<span class="font-italic">Pender</span>”), a statement was made by the representor, Vincent, to the representee company’s consultant, Jenny Pang, that the development at Pender Court would definitely attain foreigner eligibility status with his assistance. The High Court found that the statement, even if made, was nothing more than a mere puff as “no one could guarantee that the development would <span class="font-italic">definitely attain</span> foreigner eligibility status save for URA itself”: <span class="font-italic">Pender </span>at [36]. This was especially so, given Jenny Pang’s experience in the property development industry and the fact that she had a team of architects to advise her. It was inconceivable that Vincent’s statement could have induced Jenny Pang to enter into an agreement with Chesney LLP. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 Similarly, in the present case, the statement made by TKC that the Units could be used as a <span class="font-italic">zichar</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>restaurant or food court and that there “should be no problem” are nothing more than mere puffs as TKC could not have guaranteed that URA or NEA would definitely have approved of the plaintiff’s application. In fact, TKC clarified at trial that “no problem” meant that the defendant would <span class="font-italic">try to </span><span class="font-italic">assist</span> the plaintiff to obtain approval for the change of use of the Units from a “shop” to a “restaurant”.

Just like in Pender, the defendant was not a governmental authority and had no authority to approve the change of use of the Units. This also puts paid to the actionability of the plaintiff’s averment that the defendant had further represented (even if it is true) that if there was any issue, the defendant as developers, had the necessary competence to make the necessary applications to the relevant authorities to resolve any issues that might arise.

As such, the implied meaning of Initial R1 conveyed by TKC to NES and as understood by NES was not a <span class="font-italic">guarantee</span>, but a promise by the defendant to <span class="font-italic">try its best to assist</span> the plaintiff in its applications to the relevant government authorities.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 As regards the implied meaning of the words “could be used as a <span class="font-italic">zichar</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>restaurant or food court”, a narrow interpretation of the words would be that the Units had been approved as a restaurant or could be used as a restaurant because its use as such <span class="font-italic">had </span><span class="font-italic">already been approved</span> by the authorities (“narrow interpretation”). This narrow interpretation is supported by the letter of the plaintiff’s lawyer, Ms Wong, to the defendant’s solicitor on 16 April 2012 as the letter sought to confirm that the defendant had represented to NES that the Units had been approved for use as a restaurant. However, a generous interpretation of the words would be that the defendant had represented that it was <span class="font-italic">possible</span> for the plaintiff to obtain approvals from URA and NEA for the Units to be used as a <span class="font-italic">zichar</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>restaurant (“generous interpretation”). This necessarily means that <span class="font-italic">a possible </span><span class="font-italic">technical solution existed</span>, for the plaintiff to run its operation involving heavy cooking, whilst not creating a smell nuisance problem that would result in the revocation of the plaintiff’s NEA food shop licence. I will deal with this generous interpretation of Initial R1 below at [77]. However, it must be emphasised that Ms Wong had never alluded to this generous interpretation as the substance of the representation of R1 when asserting what the actual representation made by TKC to NES was. Due weight must be given to the contemporaneous nature of the written correspondence of Ms Wong, acting for the defendant at that time. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">Clause 20M, Defendant’s Letters, Reassurance 1 and Reassurance 2 </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 I now turn to the objective documentary evidence put before this court and the alleged reassurances made by the defendant from 13 April 2012 to 15 May 2012. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 The premise of the plaintiff’s case on R1 is entirely based on <span class="font-italic">oral</span><span class="font-italic"> representations</span> made by TKC or MP over 7 years ago. Hence, in comparison to the testimonies of TKC, NES and Jasper on their recollection of the exact words communicated between the plaintiff and the defendant, I would place greater relative weight on objective <span class="font-italic">documentary evidence</span> that was contemporaneous with the signing of the SPAs. Due to its high probative value and reliability, the primacy of documentary evidence in the present case cannot be understated. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 For R1 to be an actionable misrepresentation, it must have played a real and substantial part in operating on the mind of the innocent party in inducing the innocent party to enter into an agreement: <span class="font-italic">Panatron</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [23]. In the light of the two pieces of objective documentary evidence (<span class="font-italic">ie</span><span class="font-italic">,</span> Clause 20M and the Defendant’s Letters) that corrected Initial R1, I find that R1 could not have induced the plaintiff to enter into the SPAs.

On 16 April 2012, the plaintiff’s lawyer, Ms Wong, wrote to the defendant’s solicitor, Ms Choy to confirm that “[the defendant had] <span class="font-italic">represented</span> to [NES] that the above unit [had been] <span class="font-italic">approved for use as a restaurant</span> [emphasis added]”. I note that the alleged representation stated in Ms Choy’s letter is worded differently from R1, which is that “the Units <span class="font-italic">could</span> be used as both shops or restaurants including for heavy cooking and the plaintiff’s Principal Activities”. In her letter, Ms Wong also sought to amend the unit’s approved use as a “shop” to a “restaurant” (see above at [26]). On 18 April 2012, Mr Choy replied to the plaintiff with the Defendant’s Letters, and <span class="font-italic">denied</span><span class="font-weight-bold"> </span>that the defendant had represented to the NES that the Units had been <span class="font-italic">approved for </span><span class="font-italic">use as a restaurant</span> and rejected the plaintiff’s request to amend the SPAs’ Approved Use of the Unit: see above at [27]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 Notably, the Defendant’s Letters bear two crucial features. First, it was made while the plaintiff was receiving independent legal advice<span class="font-italic"> </span>from Ms Wong. Second, the correspondence occurred <span class="font-italic">before</span> the plaintiff had signed the SPAs on 15 May 2012. Despite receiving independent legal advice and an unequivocal written representation by the defendant that it had not represented that the Units had been approved for use as restaurants, the plaintiff went ahead to sign the SPAs. The Defendant’s Letters made it very clear to the plaintiff that the defendant <span class="font-italic">had not represented</span> that the Units had been approved for use as restaurants and puts paid to the plaintiff’s averment that R1, based on the narrow interpretation, was made.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">71 As regards the law on the effect of a representor’s correction of his earlier misrepresentation, I reproduce the following excerpts from <span class="font-italic">Broadley</span><span class="font-italic"> Construction Pte Ltd v Alacran Design Pte Ltd </span>[2018] 2 SLR 110 (“<span class="font-italic">Broadley</span>”) at [32]–[33]: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">33 The effect of a representor’s correction of his earlier misrepresentation can be analysed in two ways.

Any further representation really only has <span class="font-italic">the effect </span><span class="font-italic">of altering the effect of the earlier misrepresentation on the representee’s mind, which is essentially an inquiry into inducement. </span>Second, we consider this to be more practically feasible because where a further representation falls short of entirely withdrawing or correcting the earlier misrepresentation but merely qualifies it to an extent, or makes no reference to the earlier misrepresentation at all, the court’s inquiry should not be limited to determining to what extent the earlier misrepresentation had been corrected, <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">but instead focus on the impact both representations, taken together, had on the </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">representee.</span> <span class="font-italic">If there is any ambiguity as to how the representations interact with each other, </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">the determining consideration is whether the earlier misrepresentation was still operative in that it still had the effect of inducing the </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">representee to enter into the contract</span><span class="font-weight-bold">.</span> [emphasis added in italics and bold italics]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">Applying the second approach preferred by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Broadley</span><span class="font-italic">,</span> I find that the plaintiff could not have been induced to enter into the SPAs by Initial R1 premised on its narrow interpretation.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">72 In coming to my decision, I also take into account the plaintiff’s allegation that when NES and KC raised the issue of Clause 20M on 13 April 2012, TKC and MP repeated the Representations and reassured them that the word “shop” was purely administrative in nature and merely a formality (<span class="font-italic">ie</span><span class="font-italic">, </span>Reassurance 1, see above at [22]). Further, NES testified that after receiving the Defendant’s Letters, he had contacted TKC for clarifications about Ms Choy’s letter and TKC had allegedly reiterated that this was purely administrative and that NES should proceed with the purchase and allegedly assured NES that he would have no problem operating a <span class="font-italic">zichar</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>restaurant or food court (<span class="font-italic">ie</span><span class="font-italic">, </span>Reassurance 2, see above at [28]).

</div>
</div> Even if I were to assume both Reassurance 1 and Reassurance 2 as true, I still find that the further representations through Clause 20M and the Defendant’s Letters had corrected Initial R1. The plaintiff was not induced to enter into the SPAs by R1 premised on its narrow interpretation and I now explain the reasons for my decision.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">73 First, the plaintiff is a seasoned operator of F&amp;B outlets and stalls with more than 15 years of experience and 15 coffee shops under its wing. I would expect NES to have had prior experience in signing OTPs and SPAs with property developers for his other businesses. I also would expect an experienced businessman in the F&amp;B industry such as NES to understand the legal significance of clauses in signed contracts. I also do not accept that NES had no knowledge of the legal significance of the Defendant’s Letters: an unequivocal denial of R1 based on its narrow interpretation. Strangely, the plaintiff’s case rests on the theory that NES chose to believe the alleged Reassurance 1 and Reassurance 2, if they happened at all, over the objective documentary evidence such as the Defendant’s Letters and Clause 20M, which squarely contradict Initial R1 based on its narrow interpretation. I find that such Initial R1 could not have been operative on NES’s mind once NES had notice of Clause 20M and the Defendant’s Letters.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">74 Second, NES was legally represented by Ms Wong at the material time, especially before the signing of the SPAs on 15 May 2012. There is no reason why NES should not have understood the legal significance of Clause 20M and the Defendant’s Letters. In fact, Ms Wong had discussed the issue of the Units’ approved use under Clause 20M with NES. This discussion sparked Ms Wong’s decision to write to the defendant on 16 April 2012 to confirm that the defendant had represented to NES that the Units were approved for use as “restaurants”. Ms Wong also requested the defendant to amend Clause 20M. Instead, the defendant’s solicitor replied by way of the Defendant’s Letters on 18 April 2012 to <span class="font-italic">expressly deny</span> that they ever made such a representation and to reject the plaintiff’s request to amend Clause 20M. At that juncture, the combined effect of Clause 20M and the Defendant’s Letters would have altered the effect premised on the narrow interpretation of Initial R1 on NES’s mind, even if I assume that Reassurance 1 and Reassurance 2 had occurred.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">75 Third, the present case is one where the misrepresentation was dispelled by the express terms of the contract: <span class="font-italic">Broadley</span> at [35]. I now reproduce an excerpt from <span class="font-italic">Broadley</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [36]<span class="font-italic">,</span> on the Court of Appeal’s commentary of the English case <span class="font-italic">Peekay</span><span class="font-italic"> Intermark Ltd v Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd</span> [2006] 2 Lloyd’s Rep 511 (“<span class="font-italic">Peekay</span>”):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-italic">Peekay</span> stands for the proposition that a plaintiff <span class="font-italic">would not ordinarily be held to be induced by a misrepresentation if the </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">express contractual terms</span><span class="font-italic">, which the plaintiff placed importance on, read and signed, and which the defendant expected that the plaintiff would read and understand, </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">contradict or correct the defendant’s misrepresentation</span>. … It is still the law that representees are not obliged to test the accuracy of the representations made to them, and it does not matter if they had the opportunity to discover the truth as long as they did not actually discover it (<span class="font-italic">Peekay</span> at [40]). But where the true position appears clearly from the terms of the very contract which the plaintiff says it was induced to enter into by the misrepresentation (<span class="font-italic">Peekay</span> at [43]), the position is quite different. After all, it is a corollary of the basic principle of contract law that a person is bound by the terms of the contract he signs, notwithstanding that he may be unaware of its precise legal effect. <span class="font-italic">Such a claimant should be taken to have actually read the contract and known the falsity of the earlier representation.</span> To hold otherwise would undercut the basis of the conduct of commercial life – that businessmen with equal bargaining power would read their contracts and defend their own interests before entering into contractual obligations, and that they would rely on their counterparties to do the same.  [emphasis in original; emphasis added in bold italics]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">Clause 20M clearly contradicts and dispels Initial R1 premised on its narrow interpretation. It is incumbent on NES to have read and understood the effect of Clause 20M of the SPAs, especially when he had independent legal advice and ample time to go through the clauses of the SPAs. If the issue of the Units’ approved use as restaurants that involved heavy cooking had been such a crucial factor in NES’s decision to enter into the SPAs, it should also have been expressly incorporated as a clause in the SPAs. In fact, Clause 20M specifies that the Units’ approved use was the contrary. In the Specifications of the Unit under the First Schedule of the SPAs, there is also no reference to an effective fumes exhaust system.

</div> Despite the defendant’s rejection of the plaintiff’s request to amend Clause 20M of the SPAs through the Defendant’s Letters, NES still went ahead to sign the SPAs. As such, the plaintiff could not have been induced to enter into the SPAs by R1.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">76 As a side note, I am also unconvinced by the plaintiff’s submission that NES was never informed of the <span class="font-italic">change</span> of Building Plans from BP-1 (where the Units were labelled as “shop/restaurant”) to BP-2 (where the Units were labelled as “shop”) that occurred before he was granted the OTPs and signed the SPAs.

</div> As such, the plaintiff could not have relied on BP-1 prior to signing the SPAs, as it was a document that they never had sight of prior to commencing the present suit. Second, the change of Building Plans from BP-1 to BP-2 occurred on 5 January 2012, before the OTPs were granted and the SPAs were signed. Third, the SPAs made express reference to BP-2 and the plaintiff must be taken to have read and understood the SPAs before entering into the contracts.

There are in fact <span class="font-italic">possible</span> solutions and viable options that remained unexplored by the plaintiff before NES prematurely decided to close down the restaurant in September 2017. Most notably, NEA only issued the plaintiff a warning to resolve the smell nuisance and there was neither any formal closure notice issued nor revocation of licence by NEA. The plaintiff could have addressed NEA’s concerns and continued to use the Units for heavy cooking and its Principal Activities by discharging the exhaust fumes at alternative locations. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">78 For instance, MP proposed a solution of exhausting the hot fumes from heavy cooking in the Units by expelling the fumes through an exhaust outlet <span class="font-italic">beside </span>the carpark exhaust of the Development, behind the Units (“Carpark Exhaust Solution”).

</div> In any case, both Mr Ying and Mr Sim confirmed that the Carpark Exhaust Solution was a possibility, one which the plaintiff had not explored before prematurely closing his business in September 2017. Moreover, in NEA’s letter to the plaintiff dated 13 May 2016, NEA had waived its original requirements of having the “discharge point located [to] be above the roof” subject to the installation of the Electrostatic System, and there was a reasonable possibility that NEA would also provide such a waiver for the Carpark Exhaust Solution.

On top of that, it is Jasper’s testimony that he had heard TKC or MP tell NES, at some point in time before the signing of the OTPs, that the wooden decking would be constructed for the plaintiff to make the ORA available for NES to carry out the plaintiff’s Principal Activities.

</div> As such, I accord little or no weight to this Wooden Decking Plan, without evidence of the provenance of the document as well as the maker of the handwritten notes on the document.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">95 On the balance of probabilities, I find that the plaintiff has not discharged the burden of proof that R3 was in fact made. To my mind, it is unlikely that the defendant, as a property developer, would have made a representation to undertake such an onerous obligation to construct a wooden decking specially for the plaintiff’s intended ORA at its own cost. There is also no such documentation that evidenced a plan to build a wooden decking in the SPAs or in BP-2. In fact, BP-2 evidenced the contrary, that a green verge, not wooden decking, would surround the Development.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">96 Even if I were to accept that R3 had been made, I find that the plaintiff could not have relied on R3 to enter into the SPAs. R3 is clearly not a material representation that would have played a real and substantial part in operating on the mind of NES in inducing him to enter into the agreement: <span class="font-italic">Panatron</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [23]. It is NES’s testimony that the construction of the wooden decking was a “relatively minor issue”. NES therefore decided “not to make a fuss” and asked his own contractor to rectify the issue.
