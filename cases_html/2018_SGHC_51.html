Rather, Takenaka Corporation’s focus was on making out that stay should not be ordered as sufficient reasons existed for the matter not to be sent to arbitration, and that the Company (or Judicial Managers) was not ready and willing at the commencement of proceedings to do all things necessary for the conduct of the arbitration and remained so. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Sufficient reason not to refer to arbitration</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">20 A broad range of factors is captured by the term “sufficient reason” (see <span class="font-italic">Fa</span><span class="font-italic">si Paul Frank v Specialty Laboratories Asia Pte Ltd </span>[1999] 1 SLR (R) 1138 at [18]).

The Judicial Managers argued that only a bare assertion has been made by Takenaka Corporation that the determination of the claim in OS 936/2017 would have a bearing on the Company’s assets and clawback actions. Stay should not be denied simply because the litigation proceedings are linked to the judicial management as a whole and to potential clawback actions, as this would mean that any dispute in respect of a company undergoing judicial management would not be arbitrable.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">23 I was not persuaded that there was anything much to be gained by the Court’s supervision and oversight if the matter proceeded instead of being stayed in favour of arbitration. I accepted the Judicial Managers’ argument that not all aspects of the dispute between the parties would be canvassed if the court proceedings were to be pursued; in contrast, the arbitration would cover the claim and counterclaim between the parties. It may be that there are other areas that are covered neither by OS 936/2017 or the arbitration, but that does not rob the arbitration of the advantage it has over the proof of debt. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 Takenaka Corporation argued that as its proof of debt was rejected because of the set-off from other claims that the Company had against Takenaka Corporation, those other claims were thus linked to OS 936/2017, and therefore court oversight would be beneficial. However, this argument could not be taken as far as Takenaka Corporation hoped. While it may be that the existence of other claims may have led to the rejection of the proof of debt, this fact did not expand the scope of OS 936/2017, which, as argued by the Judicial Managers, was still limited to the question of such rejection only, and there could not be any determination of the other claims. Additionally, Takenaka Corporation could not identify any specific advantages that were to be gained by the Court’s oversight. It may be that court proceedings may ultimately lead to a faster resolution of the entire bundle of disputes between the parties, but that alone could not provide sufficient reason for the Court to disregard the parties’ agreement to arbitrate. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 In addition, I was doubtful of Takenaka Corporation’s argument that it would be better for the Court to have oversight, given the ongoing Judicial Management and other proceedings, including the potential clawback action. These matters are related, and it may be that there will be impact by one on the other. Indeed, the rejection of the proof of debt was tied to the counterclaims by the Company against Takenaka Corporation. But such linkage does not by itself require overview by the Court and the displacement of arbitration. Even if the dispute would be more efficiently resolved through litigation rather than arbitration, greater efficiency alone is not a reason to displace arbitration: the parties’ choice in agreeing to arbitrate would mean that they would be taken to have considered the possibility that arbitration may not proceed as speedily or as efficiently as court-managed cases. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 <span class="font-italic"> </span>I noted that Takenaka Corporation cited <span class="font-italic">Tomolugen</span><span class="font-italic"> Holdings Ltd v Silica Investors Ltd </span>[2016] 1 SLR 373 (“<span class="font-italic">Tomolugen</span>”) (at [186] and [188]) for the proposition that the Court needs to find a balance that serves the ends of justice between a plaintiff’s right to choose where he wants to sue, the Court’s desire to prevent circumvention of the operation of an arbitration agreement, and the Court’s inherent case management power. <span class="font-italic">Tomolugen</span> was a case concerned with the management of multiple proceedings and parties as the arbitration clause in question only applied to one part of a larger dispute in the court proceedings. In contrast, as I found above, not all aspects of the dispute between the parties in the present case would be canvassed if litigation were to be pursued since the court proceeding is limited to the issue of the proof of debt; on the other hand, the arbitration would cover the claim and counterclaim between the parties. In any event, I was of the view that granting the stay was aligned with the ends of justice in the present case, as it was not established that the advantages to be gained from court oversight and case management, if any, were such as to outweigh the need to give effect to the parties’ intention embodied in the arbitration agreement, in the context of Singapore’s strong policy in favour of arbitration.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Ready and willing to arbitrate</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 Takenaka Corporation argued that the evidence showed that the Company was not ready or willing to do all things necessary for the conduct of the arbitration when OS 936/2017 was commenced, and remained so at the hearing of the present application. The Company, it was said, failed to promptly commence arbitration or to stay OS 936/2017, and the Judicial Managers also delayed the adjudication of the proof of debt and was slow in pursuing clawback claims. The Court had to in fact intervene to direct Judicial Managers to decide if the matter was to be referred to arbitration. As the Judicial Managers claimed that the delay was because they were firming up funds, it could not be said that the Company was ready and willing to do all things necessary for the proper conduct of arbitration. The Company’s readiness is conditional on its ability to secure funding. The Judicial Managers have nothing to substantiate its position that APL had firmly committed to fund the arbitration. Even at the time of the hearing, it had not paid its share of the first deposit to the SIAC.

</div> Further, any delay in commencing the arbitration arose solely out of the need to secure funding, and the Company did proceed to pursue its claim expeditiously once such funding was secured.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 I accepted the evidence of the Judicial Managers that they were trying to secure funds, which was a necessary task given the insolvency or near insolvency of the Company. I do not read the statutory requirement that the party seeking a stay be ready and willing at the commencement of the proceedings and remain so at time of the hearing to pursue arbitration as imposing an obligation to pursue arbitration immediately and without any time for preparation. Rather, the objective of the requirement is to ensure that arbitration is not merely a theoretical possibility, and that there is a genuine intention to pursue it. Any delay here was not such as to show that the Company was not ready and willing to do all things necessary for the proper conduct of the arbitration and remained so. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 As for the argument that insufficient assurance has been given even at the point of the hearing that the Company will be able to bear the costs of the arbitration if they lose, APL’s letter of indemnity which was tendered to the Court gave sufficient certainty. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 In any event, the possibility that the party seeking arbitration is not good for any adverse cost order is not in itself a ground to deny a stay in favour of arbitration. A party remains ready and willing so long as it is in position to pursue the arbitration. Neither statute nor case law requires that that party be in a position to pay for the costs that may be incurred by the other side. Exercising the Court’s discretion against a stay in such a situation would not give sufficient weight to the binding nature of the arbitration agreement entered into by the parties, who would have been expected to have factored in the risk of non-reimbursement of costs following arbitration in their choice to arbitrate their disputes. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 For the above reasons, I allowed the stay.
