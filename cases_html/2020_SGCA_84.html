The Judge concluded that there was no such requirement (see <span class="font-italic">Millennium Pharmaceuticals, Inc v Zyfas Medical Co (sued as a firm) </span>[2020] SGHC 28 (“GD”) at [22]–[26]). There was nothing in reg 24(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)(ii) that required the mental elements of knowledge or intention. In contrast, reg 25, which creates offences, referred to such mental elements because of the use of words such as “knows”, “reason to believe” and “intentional”. This difference in language was justified based on the respective purposes of the provisions. While reg 24 was intended as an administrative process by which a registered therapeutic product could be cancelled, reg 25 was a provision that imposed criminal liability. All that Millennium was required to show was that Zyfas failed to disclose any matter that was material to its application. As there was no dispute that Zyfas failed to declare that Millennium’s process patents were in force and as it had conceded that this information was material, the Judge granted the declaration. On 21 November 2019, Zyfas filed this appeal.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The related proceedings</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">14 At the time of filing OS 1034, Millennium also filed HC/S 817/2019 (“Suit 817”) against Zyfas seeking a declaration that Zyfas had infringed its patents and an injunction to restrain Zyfas from continuing to infringe the patents. Millennium does not manufacture, market or supply bortezomib in Singapore but its exclusive licensee in Singapore, Johnson &amp; Johnson Pte Ltd (“J&amp;J”), has supplied bortezomib in Singapore before. Accordingly, J&amp;J was added as the second plaintiff to Suit 817, which is pending before the Judge. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">15 On 29 January 2020, Millennium and J&amp;J filed HC/SUM 430/2020 in Suit 817 seeking an interlocutory injunction to restrain Zyfas from performing any of the acts for which registration of Myborte had been obtained until the conclusion of the suit. The focus of the injunction was the fact that Zyfas had been awarded a tender on 1 November 2019 to supply bortezomib to public hospitals in Singapore. Due to the present appeal, Millennium could not apply to the HSA for cancellation of the registration of Myborte. Millennium therefore sought the interlocutory injunction to restrain Zyfas from supplying Myborte under the tender and from participating in any further tenders. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">16 On 2 April 2020, the Judge granted the application for the interlocutory injunction only in part. He made an order to restrain Zyfas from any future acts for which registration of Myborte had been obtained but permitted Zyfas to continue to supply Myborte to the public hospitals pursuant to the tender. The Judge held that in the context of this tender, damages would be an adequate remedy and the balance of convenience lay in favour of permitting the continued supply of bortezomib to the public hospitals. Millennium’s application for leave to appeal to the Court of Appeal was refused by the Judge on 15 June 2020. Its further application to the Court of Appeal for leave to appeal was dismissed on 21 July 2020 without oral arguments pursuant to O 57 r 2B of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2014 Rev Ed) (“Rules of Court”).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">17 On 4 March 2020, Millennium filed CA/SUM 30/2020 to expedite the present appeal due to its concerns about Zyfas’s supply of Myborte to the public hospitals.

Further, the mere fact that the new point sought to be raised contradicts the case as pleaded below would not invariably lead to the denial of leave (<span class="font-italic">Abhilash </span>at [40], citing <span class="font-italic">Grace Electrical </span>at [36]).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) A different balance will be struck where the new argument to be raised on appeal would involve issues of fact, where it is almost inevitable that the failure to raise the point at trial had resulted in relevant evidence not being fully ventilated (<span class="font-italic">JWR </span>at [29]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 As explained earlier, Zyfas’s only submission before the Judge was that reg 24(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)(ii) required a false or misleading statement or material omission in a declaration to have been made knowingly or intentionally. At the hearing before us, counsel for Zyfas, Mr Wong Siew Hong (“Mr Wong”), explained that he had focused on the mental element required for a “false or misleading” declaration as that was the case Millennium had advanced below. Even so, that could not explain why Zyfas conceded expressly that process patents had to be declared under reg 23(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) or why it maintained its position when it became clear that the Judge was proceeding on the issue of material omission only.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 We think Zyfas’s change in position was highly unsatisfactory. In advancing the new argument on appeal, Zyfas was retracting from the agreed parameters of the case before the High Court. The issue before us would no longer be about the requisite mental state for a declaration under reg 24(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)(ii) of the TPR but about the scope of reg 23(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>). As a result, the High Court’s decision was rendered quite irrelevant in this appeal as its correctness was not being challenged at all. In fact, at the hearing before us, both Mr Wong and counsel for Millennium, Mr Suhaimi Bin Lazim, agreed that the Judge was correct in his interpretation of reg 24(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)(ii). Ordinarily, if both parties agree that the trial court’s decision is unimpeachable, then that should be the end of the matter. However, Zyfas was effectively asking the Court of Appeal to rehear the entire case on a totally different basis, thereby converting what should have been an appeal into a second trial. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 It was even more unsatisfactory that the so called “new argument” was not new at all but was obviously an issue that Zyfas’s counsel had considered and then conceded. The new argument was therefore nothing more than a retraction of its concession on a legal issue. Such a retraction probably arose from a reworking and rethinking of the litigation strategy and Zyfas was essentially doing a 180-degree about-turn on appeal by arguing against the very issue that it had conceded before the Judge.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 In the circumstances, Zyfas’s conduct of its appeal fell within the scope of the criticisms made by this court in <span class="font-italic">JWR </span>at [32]. In reality, there was no appeal before us. We would not be considering whether the Judge was wrong or otherwise in reaching the conclusions stated in his judgment since, as mentioned above, both parties agreed that the Judge was correct in his decision on the issues placed before him. In <span class="font-italic">JWR, </span>we observed that such conduct would amount to an abuse of the appeal process (at [32]). Ordinarily therefore, we could, as we did in <span class="font-italic">JWR</span>, have disallowed the new argument and dismissed the appeal. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 In this case, however, there were some special features that persuaded us to exercise our discretion to allow Zyfas to make the “new argument” despite its concession in the High Court. First, the issue to be canvassed was a question of law which would impact the work of the HSA in implementing the TPR. It was also likely to affect many applicants seeking to register various therapeutic products in an industry that is growing increasingly important. Leaving the scope of reg 23 unclear or seemingly arguable would not be conducive to good administration in such an important industry. It would also create uncertainty for the businesses dealing in therapeutic products. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 Secondly, the new argument would not cause any prejudice to Millennium as it was given ample notice about it and was prepared to argue the issue before us. Its written submissions covered this legal point fully.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 Third, if Zyfas had not made the concession in the High Court and had instead raised this argument in its submissions, we believe that the Judge would in all likelihood have considered himself bound by <span class="font-italic">Drug Houses of Australia </span>anyway (see GD at [13]). We note that in Zyfas’s submissions in the High Court, it referred to the statement on this legal issue in <span class="font-italic">Drug Houses of Australia</span> as <span class="font-italic">obiter dicta </span>but accepted that it represented the law correctly.

</div> If it truly believed that it was <span class="font-italic">obiter dicta</span>, then it should not have made the concession and should not have accepted that the Judge was bound by our earlier decision. Accordingly, based on the special circumstances in this case, we allowed the question of law to be argued on appeal despite the earlier concession by Zyfas.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 Although the correctness of the Judge’s decision was not disputed before us, we would like to express our agreement with his conclusions. We agree that reg 24(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)(ii) of the TPR does not require that a false or misleading statement or an omission to disclose a material matter must be made knowingly or intentionally. However, if such knowledge or intention was found in any  particular case, an offence under reg 25(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) or (<span class="font-italic">b</span>) would be disclosed and the maker of the declaration would be subject to the criminal sanctions spelt out in that regulation.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The interpretation of reg 23(2)(</span><span class="font-weight-bold">a</span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">)</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 The sole issue in this appeal was therefore whether process patents were within the ambit of “a patent under the Patents Act… in force in respect of the therapeutic product”. If so, the process patents must be declared pursuant to reg 23(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the TPR. To answer this question, we first consider whether this issue was an integral part of the reasoning and decision in <span class="font-italic">Drug Houses of Australia</span>, which concerned two of the three process patents in this case and involved the same proprietor of the process patents. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 Zyfas submitted that our reasoning on this issue was <span class="font-italic">obiter dicta</span> and, in any event, the earlier decision was wrong and was not binding on us in this appeal. We rejected the submission on <span class="font-italic">obiter dicta</span>. Our reasoning in <span class="font-italic">Drug Houses of Australia </span>was necessary to the decision that was made in that appeal. Although DHA in that case did not advance the argument specifically that process patents did not fall within the meaning of reg 23(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>), we held that Millennium’s patents fell within the provision and had to be declared. If they did not, then Millennium would have no cause of action against DHA at all. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 For completeness, we consider briefly the parties’ arguments on the application of the purposive approach, which involves three steps (see <span class="font-italic">Tan Cheng Bock </span>at [37]–[53]):</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) First, ascertain the possible interpretations of the provision, having regard not just to the text of the provision but also to the context of that provision within the written law as a whole, aided by rules and canons of statutory construction where relevant.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Second, ascertain the legislative purpose or object of the statute. In doing so, the court may draw from the text of the relevant legislative provision, the statutory context or extraneous material, though primacy should be accorded to the text of the provision and its statutory context. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Third, compare the possible interpretations of the text against the purposes or objects of the statute.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 Section 2 of the Patents Act states that “patent” means “a patent under this Act and includes a patent in force by virtue of section 117(3) [of the Patents Act]”. A patent under the Patents Act includes process patents and the Act generally does not distinguish between product and process patents (see s 2, which refers to “patented process”, and ss 14(2), 51(1), 66, 68). The plain text of reg 23(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) therefore suggested that process patents were included in its scope. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 However, Mr Wong argued that the word “patent” in the TPR must be qualified by the words “in respect of the therapeutic product”. He then pointed to the definition of “therapeutic product” in the HPA. The First Schedule of the HPA states that “therapeutic product” means any substance that has as a constituent any of the following active ingredients, one of which is “any chemical”. Mr Wong highlighted that bortezomib is a chemical and therefore the relevant patent in this case must be one in respect of that chemical. Since Millennium’s patents were in the process of manufacturing the active ingredient bortezomib and not in bortezomib as a product, he submitted that the process patents here were not relevant under the TPR and therefore did not need to be declared in an application for registration. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 In answer to our question during discussions, Mr Wong accepted that it was logically possible for the bortezomib in Myborte to have been manufactured using the processes in Millennium’s process patents although Zyfas’s position was that its therapeutic product did not use those processes to make bortezomib. In our opinion, this meant that the process patents here were “in respect of the therapeutic product” because the active ingredient in that product could have been made using the patented processes. The proper procedure for Zyfas’s application for registration was therefore to declare the existence of the process patents under reg 23(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) and then go on to declare further under reg 23(3)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>)(ii) that it was not the proprietor of the patents but the patents would not be infringed by the doing of the act for which the registration of the therapeutic product is sought, if Zyfas genuinely believed that there was no infringement. It would then be up to the HSA to decide whether to require Zyfas to serve the requisite notice under reg 23(5) on the proprietor. We came to this same conclusion in <span class="font-italic">Drug Houses of Australia</span> at [3]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 The fact that the provisions of the TPR and Form 1 used the word “product” did not mean that the word was intended to restrict “patents” to only product patents.  After all, “product” is part of the term “therapeutic product” which in turn is a “health product” as stated in the First Schedule of the HPA.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 We agree with the Judge that the purpose of reg 23 was to fulfil Singapore’s obligations under the USSFTA through the patent linkage scheme (GD at [13]). Mr Wong argued that the exclusion of process patents from the US patent linkage scheme was relevant because our scheme was modelled on it. However, Mr Wong also accepted that it could not be inferred that Parliament intended to copy the US patent linkage scheme. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 The USSFTA does not refer to process or product patents. Local legislation is to be interpreted as far as possible to be consonant with Singapore’s treaty obligations and not in derogation thereof. However, if the clear words of the legislation indicate that Singapore has done more than what its treaty obligations require, we think that there is nothing objectionable about giving effect to the clear intent. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 Under the patent linkage scheme, after declaration of the patent, HSA can then direct the applicant to notify the proprietors of the patent about any application for registration of a therapeutic product, pursuant to reg 23(5). The proprietor then has the opportunity to object to registration during a 44-day moratorium imposed by reg 23(8) during which it can seek an injunction or a declaration that the patent will be infringed. Regulation 23(9) then provides for a 30-month moratorium for the court to reach a decision and during which the HSA will not register the product. This ensures that while the issue is before the courts, generic products will not flood the market to the prejudice of proprietors (see also <span class="font-italic">Drug Houses of Australia </span>at [10]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 Mr Wong argued that the Broad Interpretation made it onerous for applicants seeking registration of therapeutic products as they would have to declare process patents as well and then wait 30 months after the relevant notice was given before the therapeutic products could be registered. However, he accepted that such applicants could choose to shorten the 30-month wait by being proactive and taking out an action for a declaration of non-infringement if they wanted to. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 We think that the Broad Interpretation would be consonant with the legislative purpose of reg 23 as it was intended to give notice and protection to proprietors of relevant patents, whether they are product or process patents. We see no reason why product patents should be accorded more protection than process patents since a therapeutic product could infringe one or the other.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 For the above reasons, we dismissed Zyfas’s appeal. We awarded costs in favour of Millennium fixed at $40,000 (inclusive of disbursements) and made the usual consequential orders relating to the security for costs of this appeal.</div><div class="Judg-Sign text-left">Andrew Phang Boon Leong          Tay Yong Kwang            Woo Bih Li<br/>Judge of Appeal          Judge of Appeal            Judge</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Wong Siew Hong and Kuek Kai Liang (Eldan Law LLP) for the appellant;</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Suhaimi Bin Lazim and Yan Chongshuo (Mirandah Law LLP)</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">for the respondent. </div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"> </div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
