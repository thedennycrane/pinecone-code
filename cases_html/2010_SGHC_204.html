        Choo Han Teck J:</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       These are appeals against the decision of the
                    Assistant Registrar (“the AR”) with respect to specific discovery
                    and further and better particulars applications. The plaintiff is DBS Bank Ltd
                    (“DBS”). The defendants are Yamazaki Mazak Singapore Pte Ltd
                    (“Yamazaki”), a Singapore-incorporated company in the business of
                    manufacture and repair of machinery and machine tools, and Hwa Lai Heng Ricky
                    (“Ricky Hwa”), who was an Assistant Manager of its sales
                    department. The present appeals only concerned DBS and Yamazaki.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       DBS had a loan agreement with Sin Yuh Industries
                    Pte Ltd (“Sin Yuh”), a Singapore-incorporated company in the
                    business of manufacturing machinery components, to part-finance the purchase
                    monies for the purchase of 31 units of machines by Sin Yuh from Yamazaki.
                    (Yamazaki claimed that it sold the machines to a Sin Yuh’s subsidiary,
                    Zhang Hui Industries Sdn Bhd, but it conceded that this fact was immaterial to
                    the current proceedings.) The loan agreement was made pursuant to a Scheme
                    Funding Line Agreement (“SFLA”) between the Economic Development
                    Board (“EDB”) and DBS to provide financial assistance to local
                    business enterprises. As a pre-condition to the loan agreement, Sin Yuh was
                    required to furnish evidence to DBS to show that the difference between the cost
                    of the machines and the loan amount had been paid to Yamazaki. Ricky Hwa
                    prepared and sent a letter dated 16 December 2002 (“the
                    16 December 2002 letter”) under Yamazaki’s letter head
                    confirming that Yamazaki had received payment from Sin Yuh. In fact, the
                    representation made in the letter was false. Pursuant to the loan agreement, DBS
                    disbursed a sum of $1,940,000 to Yamazaki. Subsequently, Sin Yuh defaulted on
                    repayments of the loan and was eventually wound up.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       DBS had recovered possession of 26 units of the
                    machines and sold them for net sale proceeds of S$688,354.57. The remaining five
                    units of the machines are the subject of litigation in the Johore Bahru courts.
                    Yamazaki claimed against Zhang Hui the title over the 5 machines on the ground
                    that full payment had not been received for those machines. (In a letter from
                    Yamazaki’s previous solicitors dated 29 October 2003, DBS was
                    informed that payments made by Sin Yuh, which were initially towards the
                    purchase of the five machines, were subsequently re-allocated pursuant to Sin
                    Yuh’s instructions.) DBS intervened in the Johore Bahru proceedings and
                    claimed that Yamazaki was estopped from claiming title to the five machines in
                    view of Yamazaki’s alleged false representation in the 16 December
                    2002 letter and that Yamazaki knew or ought to have known that DBS had a fixed
                    charge over the machines.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       DBS therefore brought this suit against the
                    defendants alleging that the defendants defrauded and/or conspired with Sin Yuh
                    and one Roger Cheong to defraud DBS, causing it to suffer loss and damage. DBS
                    claimed that it was deceived and induced by Yamazaki’s letter of
                    16 December 2002 into signing the loan agreement. In the alternative, DBS
                    claimed that it was induced to make the agreement by the defendants’
                    misrepresentation in the letter. DBS claimed damages for losses arising from the
                    disbursement of loan, after taking the sale proceeds it obtained from the sale
                    of the 26 machines into account. Yamazaki denied its involvement in the loan
                    agreement and claimed that the 16 December 2002 letter was prepared by
                    Ricky Hwa acting outside the scope of his authority and does not therefore bind
                    Yamazaki. Yamazaki further contended that DBS had the burden to show that they
                    have used a reasonable mode of sale and that the net sale proceeds is a
                    reasonable quantum.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       In its discovery application (Summons No 1088 of
                    2010 dated 10 March 2010), DBS prayed for the following orders:</p>

                            showing or related to the sale price, valuation price and/or

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       The AR granted (a), (b), (d) and (e). As for
                    (c), he limited discovery to internal documents relating to the financing from
                    DBS of the machines and internal documents showing DBS’ position relating
                    to the 16 December 2002 letter including that of the personnel listed in
                    (c). As for (h), he limited discovery to documents showing or related to the
                    sale price, valuation price and/or circumstance and manner of sale. He refused
                    the application for (f) and (g).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       Before me, DBS appealed against the AR’s
                    decision for categories (c), (f) and (g) and for an order that the documents be
                    disclosed as prayed for (RA 160 of 2010) Yamazaki appealed against the
                    AR’s decision for all except categories (f) and (g) (RA161 of 2010).
                    Pursuant to O 24 r 5 of the Rules of Court, the court may make an order for
                    specific discovery of particular documents where the court is satisfied that the
                    documents sought for are relevant (see O 24 r 5(3)) and necessary for disposing
                    fairly of the cause or matter or for saving costs (see O 24 r 7): see also
                        <em>Tan Chin Seng and others v Raffles Town Club Pte
                        Ltd</em> [2002] 2 SLR(R) 465 at [15]. The discovery process
                    should not be allowed to "fish" a cause of action: see Wright Norman v
                    Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp Ltd [1992] 2 SLR(R) 452. With these
                    principles in mind, I now turn to the individual categories of documents as
                    applied for and contested against.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       With respect to categories (a), (c) and (d), DBS
                    contended that they are directly relevant to determining when Yamazaki were
                    aware that full payment had not yet been received/ that the confirmation in the
                    16 December 2002 letter was false, the persons in Yamazaki who were
                    responsible for and/or ought to have been aware of such matters, and whether
                    Yamazaki had adopted/ratified Ricky Hwa’s actions. Yamazaki contended that
                    documents relating to payments received by them are irrelevant to the pleaded
                    issue in the present case, as they do not shed any light on whether Ricky Hwa
                    was authorized to issue the 16 December 2002 letter. Given that it was
                    crucial to Yamazaki’s defence that it had no knowledge of Ricky
                    Hwa’s actions, and that he had acted outside his authority, I find that
                    the correspondence between Yamazaki and Sin Yuh/Zhang Hui with respect to
                    payments are relevant as they would provide parties with a clearer picture as to
                    the extent of Yamazaki’s involvement in the issuance of the
                    16 December 2002 letter.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       With respect to documents in category (c),
                    before me, counsel for Yamazaki further contended that disclosure, whether as
                    prayed for by DBS or as ordered by the AR should be disallowed. In the
                    alternative, Yamazaki contended that disclosure should be limited to internal
                    documents showing whether the second defendant was authorized to issue the
                    16 December 2002. The AR had limited discovery to internal documents
                    relating to the financing from DBS of the machines and internal documents
                    showing DBS’ position relating to the 16 December 2002 letter. I
                    agree with Yamazaki that unless restricted, disclosure ordered might result in
                    disclosure of documents irrelevant to the pleaded issues. However, I think that
                    the documents relating to financing of the machines are relevant to the issue of
                    Yamazaki’s knowledge of Ricky Hwa’s actions, and therefore, to the
                    issue of whether Yamazaki would be estopped from pleading that he acted outside
                    his scope authority. Accordingly, I saw no need to disturb the AR’s
                    order.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     With respect to category (b), DBS contended
                    that Yamazaki had not disclosed documents pertaining to
                    ‘instructions’ from Sin Yuh to re-allocate funds initially allocated
                    by Sin Yuh to the payment of the five machines elsewhere and that this was
                    relevant because Yamazaki claimed title over the five machines on the ground
                    that it had not received full payment for them. Yamazaki contended that the
                    ownership of the five machines is unrelated to its defence in the present suit.
                    I agree with Yamazaki that this category of documents applied for is not
                    relevant to the present proceedings. As already noted, the issue in the present
                    proceedings concerned Yamazaki’s involvement or acknowledgement of the 16
                    December 2002 letter. Further, DBS is claiming for losses based on the
                    disbursement of loan under misrepresentation, conspiracy or tort of deceit. The
                    ownership of the five machines is therefore irrelevant to Yamazaki’s
                    defence or DBS’ claim. In this respect, DBS is at liberty to apply to the
                    trial judge if evidence at trial indicates otherwise.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     With respect to category (e), DBS contended
                    that these are directly relevant to the matter of whether Ricky Hwa had been
                    authorized, expressly or otherwise, by Yamazaki to issue confirmation letters
                    similar to the 16 December 2002 letter. Yamazaki contended that DBS had to
                    show a prima facie case that the documents exist, and that DBS failed to
                    discharge its burden to do so. I agree with DBS that previous confirmation
                    letters are relevant. They would shed light on the question whether Ricky Hwa
                    had the authority to issue such letters. In addition, disclosure of the kind of
                    personnel who were entitled to issue confirmation letters would be relevant to
                    Yamazaki’s defence that somebody with Ricky Hwa’s position did not
                    have the authority to do so. Given that confirmation letters had previously been
                    issued to other banks e.g. Arab-Malaysian Finance, I find that DBS had shown a
                    prima facie case that such documents exist.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     With respect to categories (f) and (g), DBS
                    contended that the documents will show the scope of Ricky Hwa’s employment
                    with respect to his dealings with financial institutions. Yamazaki contended
                    that the categories of documents are too wide-ranging and have no relation to
                    the pleaded issues in the suits, namely, whether Ricky Hwa had the authority to
                    issue confirmations regarding the status of Yamazaki’s accounts. Since the
                    issue in dispute was whether Ricky Hwa had the authority to issue the
                    16 December 2002 letter and whether Yamazaki was aware of his actions, what
                    is relevant are confirmation letters previously issued, and matters relating to
                    DBS’ financing of the machines. Further, as these would already have been
                    covered by other categories, I am of the view that disclosure of these
                    categories of documents was not necessary.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     With respect to category (h), DBS contended
                    that as Yamazaki made an issue of the quantum of the net sale proceeds of the 26
                    machines recovered and sold by it, it was entitled to evidence of the manner and
                    circumstances of sale of the 5 machines for purposes of comparison. DBS added
                    that it disclosed documents relating to sale and price of the 26 machines.
                    Before me, DBS did not contest the AR’s order to limit discovery to
                    documents showing or related to the sale price, valuation price and/or
                    circumstance and manner of sale. Yamazaki contended that the 5 machines were
                    models which are different from the machines sold by DBS, and therefore, would
                    not be relevant as a basis of comparison. I agree with DBS that the pricing of
                    the 5 machines would serve as a useful comparison to the price obtained by DBS
                    on the 26 machines. I therefore find this category of documents relevant to the
                    question whether DBS sold the 26 machines at market price. I see no reason to
                    disturb the AR’s order and dismiss Yamazaki’s appeal on this
                    point.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     Yamazaki applied for discovery of all
                    documents including memorandum, correspondence and notes relating to and/or
                    evidencing DBS’ proper and prudent assessment of the credit worthiness of
                    Sin Yuh and of the feasibility and suitability of the loan facilities applied
                    for by Sin Yuh and/or in support of DBS’ denial that they were aware of
                    Sin Yuh’s poor financial position prior to the disbursement of the loan.
                    The AR refused, and Yamazaki appealed (RA 162 of 2010).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     Yamazaki contended that one of its defences
                    was that it was not responsible for Sin Yuh’s alleged failure to meet
                    their payment obligations to DBS as at the time of the alleged disbursement of
                    the loan, Sin Yuh was already in a poor financial position. Yamazaki further
                    added that under cl 4.4 of the SFLA, before proceeding to obtain EDB’s
                    approval for the loan, DBS was obliged to conduct a proper and prudent
                    assessment of credit worthiness of Sin Yuh and the feasibility and suitability
                    of the loan. DBS contended that the SFLA was signed between EDB and DBS, and
                    that the SFLA was only in issue in so far as there was a loan risk sharing
                    arrangement between EDB and DBS. Furthermore, DBS denied being aware of Sin
                    Yuh’s poor financial position. Therefore, Yamazaki contended that the
                    documents are relevant to establishing its defence/ proving DBS’ knowledge
                    of Sin Yuh’s financial position. Counsel for DBS submitted that the
                    documents are not relevant to the issues in dispute. I agree. Whether or not DBS
                    assessed the creditworthiness of Sin Yuh had little to do with the issue whether
                    Ricky Hwa had the authority to issue, or Yamazaki knew of the 16 December
                    2002 letter. Further, DBS’ claim that it was unaware of Sin Yuh’s
                    financial position was made merely as a response to allegations by Yamazaki in
                    its defence that Sin Yuh was already in a poor financial position when the loan
                    was made. DBS’ knowledge of Sin Yuh’s financial position was
                    therefore not an issue and did not form part of either parties’ case. I
                    therefore dismiss this appeal by Yamazaki.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     Yamazaki also applied for further and better
                    particulars of the circumstances and manner in which the Plaintiffs recovered
                    possession of 26 units of the Machines, in relation to paragraph 25 of
                    DBS’ statement of claim where it stated that DBS subsequently recovered
                    possession of 26 units of the Machines and sold them for a net sale proceed of
                    S$688,354.57 (Summons No 1203 of 2010 dated 18 March 2010). The AR refused the
                    application, and Yamazaki appealed (RA 163 of 2010). Counsel for Yamazaki
                    submitted that since DBS sought to give credit for the net sale proceeds of the
                    26 Machines (by setting off the sale proceeds from the amount of damages it is
                    claiming). Counsel therefore contended that the time in repossessing and selling
                    the machines would affect the value of DBS’ claim. In response for DBS it
                    was argued that it was Yamazaki who had to plead and prove its case that had DBS
                    sold the machines on an earlier date, the amount recovered would have been
                    greater. Pursuant to O 18 r 12(3), the court may order particulars against
                    a party of any claim, defence or other matter stated in that party’s
                    pleading. The principle of particulars is that the party to whom they are given
                    must know what case he has to meet: Wright Norman v Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp
                    Ltd [1994] 1 SLR 513 at 524. I dismiss this appeal. If Yamazaki took
                    issue with the sale price, the burden of proof lay with it to show that the
                    machines were sold undervalued, e.g., with reference to the market price of
                    similar machines. I therefore dismiss this appeal by Yamazaki.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     In conclusion, with respect to DBS’
                    application for further discovery, I dismiss Yamazaki’s appeal in respect
                    of categories (a), (c) – (e), and (h) but allowed its appeal for category
                    (b). Accordingly, I dismiss DBS’ appeal for disclosure of categories (c),
                    (f) and (g). I further dismiss Yamazaki’s appeal against the AR’s
                    order in its application for discovery and further and better
                    particulars.</p>
