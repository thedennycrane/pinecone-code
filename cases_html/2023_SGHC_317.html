</div> The third defendant, Ms Toh Suling, Stephenie (“Ms Toh”), was a customer of Swift Maids. She also did some work for Swift Maids as a freelance designer, and dealt with Mr Cheong in relation to various design projects while he was working at Swift Maids. The fourth defendant, Ms Thin Thin Aung (“Ms Aung”), is a Burmese national and a former employee of Swift Maids. After she ceased her employment with Swift Maids, she continued to supply biodata of FDWs to them for a period of time. Mr Cheong and Ms Toh were, at various times, registered directors and shareholders of Recruitbee. Ms Aung similarly claims to have been a director and shareholder of Recruitbee, even though she was not registered as such. In addition, the plaintiffs claim against all the defendants for unlawful means conspiracy in setting up and operating Recruitbee to re-direct the plaintiffs’ business and employees to Recruitbee through the use of information which the plaintiffs claim to be confidential. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">3 In the present suit, there has been no application to bifurcate the trial in respect of the issues of liability and quantification of damages, and no bifurcation order was made.

In this regard, the plaintiffs allege that Mr Cheong had taken and made unauthorised use of their confidential information, and that he had provided and caused such confidential information to be misused by the other defendants. It is the plaintiffs’ case that Recruitbee, being new to the market, could not have achieved its level of performance without the benefit of using Swift Maids’ confidential information.

The plaintiffs, however, fail on their other causes of action against Mr Cheong, their causes of action against the other defendants, and their causes of action against Mr Cheong and the other defendants collectively. The plaintiffs have made a litany of allegations against Mr Cheong and the other defendants, and pleaded, in quite blunderbuss fashion, a breach of any conceivable duty related to the allegations. Although I find the plaintiffs’ key witnesses to be straightforward and truthful while on the stand, there are significant gaps in the plaintiffs’ evidence, which the plaintiffs have sought to bridge by their assertions of what, to their minds, must have happened. Clearly, the plaintiffs cannot succeed on that basis. It is trite that he who asserts must prove, and this, the plaintiffs have simply failed to do. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Facts</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The parties</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">6 Swift Maids was founded by Mr Loh Jit Yong (“Mr Loh”),

In my view, even if it were true that Mr Cheong discussed Swift Maids’ business with Mr Augustine during that visit, I do not believe that he was not involved in the discussion of Recruitbee Employment’s business. Mr Cheong’s and Ms Aung’s assertion, that Mr Augustine was careless or confused, and that he had mistakenly sent materials relating to Recruitbee Employment to Mr Cheong,

</div>
</div> was not supported by any satisfactory explanation. It is clear from the face of the e-mails that the trio had discussed with Mr Augustine the services to be provided to Recruitbee Employment, and that Mr Augustine was following up on their discussion. There is no reason why the e-mail would be sent and addressed to Mr Cheong if it were true that he was not involved in the discussion of Recruitbee Employment’s business. As such, it is my view that this is another instance of Mr Cheong’s involvement in the business of Recruitbee Employment. That having been said, it is apposite at this juncture to record that Salween Studio was Ms Aung’s contact, and it was Ms Aung who had introduced Salween Studio to Mr Cheong when he joined Swift Maids.

</div>
</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 Based on the above evidence showing Mr Cheong’s involvement in the setting up and operations of Recruitbee Employment, it is my judgment that Mr Cheong had breached cll 8.3 and 8.4 of his employment contract. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(2) Clause 13.4</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 Further, I find that Mr Cheong had breached the non-competition provision in cl 13.4 of his employment contract. In this regard, I note that cl 13 is not a model of clarity. Although the parties did not raise any issues or make any submissions in relation to that clause, I will briefly touch on my interpretation of cl 13.4, which is a provision which prohibits Mr Cheong from being “… in any way interested in any such business or activity whether as principal, agent, shareholder, or otherwise; or be associated or engaged in or any way concerned [<span class="font-italic">sic</span>] [himself] in such activity”. Specifically, I will consider the meaning of the words “any such business or activity” in cl 13.4, which also appear in cl 13.5. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 I construe the words “any such business or activity” in cll 13.4 and 13.5 to refer to the “business” or “activity” of “providing foreign domestic workers and related services”, which phrase is referred to in cll 13.6 and 13.7, following the Court of Appeal’s guidance in <span class="font-italic">Zurich Insurance (Singapore) Pte Ltd v B-Gold Interior Design &amp; Construction Pte Ltd</span> [2008] 3 SLR(R) 1029 (“<span class="font-italic">Zurich</span>”) at [131] (citing Gerard McMeel, <span class="font-italic">The Construction of Contracts: Interpretation, Implication, and Rectification </span>(Oxford University Press, 2007)) that “the exercise [in interpretation] is one based on the <span class="font-italic">whole contract</span> or an <span class="font-italic">holistic approach</span>. Courts are not excessively focused upon a particular word, phrase, sentence, or clause. Rather the emphasis is on the document or utterance as a whole” [emphasis in original]. Therefore, contractual terms “must always be interpreted in their internal context, which includes other provisions, and the document as a whole” (<span class="font-italic">MCH International Pte Ltd and others v YG Group Pte Ltd and others and other appeals </span>[2019] 2 SLR 837 at [36], citing <span class="font-italic">Zurich </span>at [53]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 While the phrase “any such business or activity” in cll 13.4 and 13.5 is not expressly defined, similar expressions appear in cl 13.6 (“business or activity”) and cl 13.7 (“activity or business”). In each of cll 13.6 and 13.7, the reference is to the business or activity of “providing foreign domestic workers and related services”. Since there is nothing in the rest of cl 13 that specifically describes canvassing, soliciting or approaching for orders (see cl 13.2), or interfering with the continuance of goods or services (see cl 13.3), as a “business” or “activity”, the words “any such business or activity” in cll 13.4 and 13.5 should be construed to refer to the business or activity of “providing foreign domestic workers and related services”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 Based on this reading, cl 13.4 imposed a duty on Mr Cheong not to be interested or engaged in, or associated or concerned with, the business or activity of providing FDWs and related services. I pause to note at this juncture that, <span class="font-italic">per</span> cl 13.1, the obligations in cl 13 were specifically circumscribed temporally and applied only during the term of Mr Cheong’s employment. Given that Mr Cheong was involved in the setting up and operations of a competing business while he was still under the employ of Swift Maids, including significant participation such as his registration as a director and shareholder of Recruitbee Employment, I find him to be in breach of cl 13.4 of his employment contract.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(3) Implied duty of good faith and fidelity</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 In addition to the express terms found in the employment contract, employees are also typically bound by an implied term in the favour of their employer, obliging the employee to serve the employer with good faith and fidelity: <span class="font-italic">Man Financial (S) Pte Ltd (formerly known as E D &amp; F Man International (S) Pte Ltd) v Wong Bark Chuan David</span> [2008] 1 SLR(R) 663 at [193]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 I find that Mr Cheong had also breached the implied duty of good faith and fidelity when he crossed the line into “actual competitive activity (which is <span class="font-italic">not</span> permissible)” [emphasis in original] (<span class="font-italic">Smile Inc Dental Surgeons Pte Ltd v Lui Andrew Stewart</span> [2012] 4 SLR 308 (“<span class="font-italic">Smile Inc</span>”)<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [67]), by involving himself in the operations of Recruitbee Employment. In this regard, the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Smile Inc </span>held at [81] that there would have been a breach of duty if the employee in that case, who was a dentist, had “obtained a licence from the Ministry of Health” and “in his free time, treated patients under the auspices of [the competitor business], in direct competition with [his employer]” or “engaged in active solicitation of his patients when he was under the employ of [his employer]”. The employee in that case was found not to have been in breach, as he appeared to have only engaged in the setting-up process of a competitor firm for about three months at the tail end of his employment with his employer (at [79]–[80]), and the competitor firm of the employee had not obtained a licence to commence servicing clients while the employee was still employed by his employer (at [81]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 Contrary to Mr Cheong’s assertion in his further written submissions that <span class="font-italic">Smile Inc </span>supports Mr Cheong’s defence because of factual similarities between <span class="font-italic">Smile Inc</span> and the present case,

</div> </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Applicable Law </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59  I start by considering the law on the breach of confidence. The leading authorities are the Court of Appeal decisions in <span class="font-italic">I-Admin (Singapore) Pte Ltd v Hong Ying Ting and others</span> [2020] 1 SLR 1130 (“<span class="font-italic">I-Admin</span>”) and <span class="font-italic">Lim Oon </span><span class="font-italic">Kuin and others v Rajah &amp; Tann Singapore LLP and another appeal</span> [2022] 2 SLR 280 (“<span class="font-italic">Lim Oon </span><span class="font-italic">Kuin</span>”). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 <span class="font-italic">I-Admin </span>was a case involving two companies in the business of supplying, amongst other things, payroll-related services (at [4] and [6(c)]). The first respondent in <span class="font-italic">I-Admin</span> was a former employee of the appellant company (at [6(a)]). Whilst still employed by the appellant company, the first respondent had worked with the second respondent, who was a former employee of the appellant company’s subsidiary, to develop a new payroll software (at [6(b)] and [7]). The first and second respondents thereafter incorporated the third respondent company to market the new payroll software, and they resigned to work for the third respondent company (at [8]). Prior to their resignation, the first and second respondents had accessed and downloaded confidential materials belonging to the appellant company, including source codes, databases, business development and client-related materials, and materials related to the appellant company’s operations (at [14]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 In analysing the appellant company’s claim in the law of confidence against the respondents, the Court of Appeal, at [61], set out the applicable test in situations where a plaintiff’s interest to avoid wrongful loss is engaged:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">61 With these considerations in mind, we set out a modified approach that should be taken in relation to breach of confidence claims. Preserving the first two requirements in [<span class="font-italic">Coco v AN Clark (Engineers) Ltd</span> [1969] RPC 41], a court should consider whether the information in question “has the necessary quality of confidence about it” and if it has been “imparted in circumstances importing an obligation of confidence”. An obligation of confidence will also be found where confidential information has been accessed or acquired without a plaintiff’s knowledge or consent. Upon the satisfaction of these prerequisites, an action for breach of confidence is presumed. This might be displaced where, for instance, the defendant came across the information by accident or was unaware of its confidential nature or believed there to be a strong public interest in disclosing it. Whatever the explanation, the burden will be on <span class="font-italic">the defendant</span> to prove that its conscience was unaffected. In our view, this modified approach places greater focus on the wrongful loss interest without undermining the protection of the wrongful profit interest.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis in original]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 Applying this framework, the Court of Appeal first found that it was undisputed that the appellant company’s materials were confidential in nature (at [63]). The Court of Appeal then found that the first and second respondents had specifically acquired the appellant company’s confidential materials to be reviewed and potentially used for the third respondent company’s benefit (at [64]). On the facts of that case, the first and second respondents were found to have acquired, circulated, and referenced the appellant company’s materials without permission (at [63]). They knew that they were not allowed to be in possession of the appellant company’s confidential materials (at [64]). As the respondents had done nothing to displace the presumption that their conscience was negatively affected, the Court of Appeal found that the respondents’ possession and referencing of the appellant company’s confidential materials constituted acts in breach of confidence (at [64]). The first respondent alone was found to have committed a further breach by downloading a database file from the appellant company’s systems by retaining and abusing confidential log-in credentials to access the appellant company’s systems on multiple occasions after leaving the appellant company’s employ (at [65]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 The Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Lim Oon </span><span class="font-italic">Kuin </span>elaborated upon the situations in which the <span class="font-italic">I-Admin</span> approach would be applicable. At [39], the Court of Appeal endorsed the observation made by Professor Ng‑Loy Wee Loon (“Prof Ng‑Loy”) in <span class="font-italic">Law of Intellectual Property of Singapore</span> (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 3rd Ed, 2021) (“<span class="font-italic">Law of Intellectual Property</span>”) at para 41.3.9, emphasising that the <span class="font-italic">I-Admin </span>modified approach was to be applied in cases involving alleged harm to the plaintiff’s “wrongful loss interest”, while in cases involving alleged harm to the plaintiff’s “wrongful gain interest”, the traditional approach set out in <span class="font-italic">Coco v AN Clark (Engineers) Ltd </span>[1969] RPC 41 (“<span class="font-italic">Coco v Clark</span>”) should be applied. Later in the judgment at [41], the Court of Appeal further endorsed the following proposition advanced by Prof Ng-Loy:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"> 41 Thirdly, we also take this opportunity to endorse the following observation made by Prof Ng‑Loy (<span class="font-italic">Law of Intellectual Property</span> at paras 41.3.10–41.3.11):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">It is also likely that the Court of Appeal intended to further limit the application of the ‘modified approach’ to cases involving unauthorised acquisition of the confidential information, that is, the ‘taker’ cases. This conjecture is based on the fact that the court placed a fair amount of emphasis on the defendants’ acquisition (via <span class="font-italic">[the former employees]</span>) of the confidential information without the plaintiff’s knowledge, and more generally, how technology had made it much easier for a person to access and download confidential information without consent.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">There is another reason for this conjecture. Three days before the issuance of the judgment in <span class="font-italic">I</span><span class="font-italic">‑Admin</span>, the Court of Appeal issued a judgment in <span class="font-italic">LVM Law Chambers LLC v Wan Hoe Keet</span>, where breach of confidence was raised as a cause of action. The defendant in this case was <span class="font-italic">not</span> a ‘taker’ of confidential information. The defendant was a lawyer who had acted for a party in a dispute against the plaintiffs arising out of a Ponzi scheme. After negotiations conducted by the parties’ solicitors, this dispute was eventually settled. When the defendant was engaged to act for another party <span class="font-italic">ABC</span> in a suit against the plaintiffs in relation to the same Ponzi scheme, the plaintiffs sought an injunction to prevent the defendant from acting for <span class="font-italic">ABC</span> in this second suit. The plaintiffs claimed that there was confidential information arising out of the circumstances surrounding the settlement of the first dispute, and that the defendant being privy to this confidential information was bound by an equitable obligation of confidence. On the third element (misuse of the confidential information), the Court of Appeal held that this element would be satisfied if there was a ‘serious and reasonable possibility’ of misuse of the confidential information by the defendant. Significantly, the appellate court placed the burden of proving the existence of such possibility of misuse squarely on <span class="font-italic">the plaintiffs</span>. In this case, the plaintiffs failed to discharge this burden and, accordingly, the Court of Appeal refused to grant the injunction sought by the plaintiffs.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis in original]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 The significance of the Court of Appeal’s endorsement of Prof Ng-Loy’s comments in <span class="font-italic">Lim Oon </span><span class="font-italic">Kuin </span>is that the <span class="font-italic">I-Admin </span>modified approach is to apply where the plaintiff’s “wrongful loss interest” is engaged in cases involving unauthorised acquisition of the confidential information (<span class="font-italic">Lim Oon </span><span class="font-italic">Kuin </span>at [41]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 More recently, in <span class="font-italic">Shanghai </span><span class="font-italic">Afute Food and Beverage Management Co Ltd v Tan Swee Meng and others</span> [2023] SGHC 34 (“<span class="font-italic">Shanghai </span><span class="font-italic">Afute Food</span>”), the learned Judge synthesised the comments of the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">I-Admin </span>and <span class="font-italic">Lim Oon </span><span class="font-italic">Kuin</span> at [100], as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">100 I summarise the law on breach of confidence. In <span class="font-italic">I-Admin (Singapore) Pte Ltd v Hong Ying Ting and others</span> [2020] 1 SLR 1130 (“<span class="font-italic">I-Admin</span>”) at [64], the Court of Appeal extended the law on breach of confidence. In summary, the following bifurcated approach is applied to establish an action for the breach of the equitable obligation of confidence:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(a)   First, determine which interest the action for breach of confidence seeks to protect:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-2 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(i)    wrongful gain interest, where the defendant has made unauthorised use or disclosure of confidential information and thereby gained a benefit; or</div><div class="Judg-Quote-2 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(ii)    wrongful loss interest, where the plaintiff is seeking protection for the confidentiality of the information <span class="font-italic">per se</span>, which is loss suffered so long as a defendant’s conscience has been impacted in the breach of the obligation of confidentiality.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(b)   If the wrongful gain interest is at stake, the traditional approach in <span class="font-italic">Coco v AN Clark (Engineers) Ltd</span> [1969] RPC 41 (“<span class="font-italic">Coco</span>”) applies: <span class="font-italic">Lim Oon </span><span class="font-italic">Kuin and others v Rajah &amp; Tann Singapore LLP and another appeal</span> [2022] 2 SLR 280 (“<span class="font-italic">Lim Oon </span><span class="font-italic">Kuin</span>”) at [39] and [41]. The <span class="font-italic">Coco</span> test requires the plaintiff to establish the following:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-2 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(i)    That the information in question has the necessary quality of confidence about it.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-2 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(ii)    The information must have been imparted in circumstances importing an obligation of confidence.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-2 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(iii)    There must be an unauthorised use of the information, and in appropriate cases, this use must be to the detriment of the party who originally communicated it.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(c)   If the wrongful loss interest applies, the test is the modified approach promulgated under <span class="font-italic">I-Admin</span>.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-2 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(i)    If the plaintiff proves [(b)(i)]–[(b)(ii)] (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the relevant information had the necessary quality of confidence and it was imparted in circumstances importing an obligation of confidence), it is presumed that the conscience of the defendant has been impinged (<span class="font-italic">I-Admin</span> at [61]). The presumption may be rebutted if the defendant adduces proof that his conscience was not affected in the circumstances in which the plaintiff’s wrongful loss interest had been harmed or undermined. The burden that shifts to the defendant at the third limb of the modified test is a <span class="font-italic">legal burden</span>, not an evidential one: <span class="font-italic">Lim Oon </span><span class="font-italic">Kuin</span> at [40].</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis in original]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 I note that in a recent decision in <span class="font-italic">Amber Compounding Pharmacy Pte Ltd and another v Lim Suk Ling Priscilla and others</span> [2023] SGHC 241 (“<span class="font-italic">Amber Compounding Pharmacy</span>”), the learned Judge had occasion to revisit his holding above, and clarified that a plaintiff is entitled to plead and claim on the basis of <span class="font-italic">both</span> the wrongful gain interest and the wrongful loss interest in an action for breach of confidence (<span class="font-italic">Amber Compounding Pharmacy</span> at [16] and [30]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 While the plaintiffs have also contended that Mr Cheong had owed obligations of confidence in his capacity as a fiduciary, the relevant law on fiduciary obligations will be discussed in a later part of this judgment together with the broader issue of whether Mr Cheong owed any fiduciary duties to the plaintiffs.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 With these principles in mind, I turn to assess the evidence adduced in the present suit. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Analysis and findings</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 The plaintiffs have made <span class="font-italic">two </span>interlinked claims concerning Mr Cheong’s breaches of his confidentiality obligations.

</div> These interlinked allegations against Mr Cheong personally are inextricably tied to the allegations made by the plaintiffs against the defendants collectively in their action for unlawful means conspiracy, because the plaintiffs have essentially relied on the same factual complaints in advancing their claims. The findings in this section will therefore also be applicable when considering the plaintiffs’ claim against all the defendants for unlawful means conspiracy. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 The plaintiffs have made little distinction between their action against Mr Cheong for breach of his duty of confidence in equity and their action against Mr Cheong for breach of his contractual duty of confidentiality in their closing submissions, and have leaned mainly on the legal framework relevant for determining the obligations of confidence in equity. As the law is clear that these are distinct causes of action and should not be conflated (<span class="font-italic">Adinop</span><span class="font-italic"> Co Ltd v Rovithai Ltd and another</span> [2019] 2 SLR 808 (“<span class="font-italic">Adinop</span>”) at [37]), I will proceed to analyse them separately.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">72 The question of which approach should apply should be answered with reference to the interest that the plaintiffs are seeking to protect. As I explain below, the plaintiffs have pleaded a case based on the protection of their “wrongful gain interest”, where Mr Cheong is alleged to have made unauthorised use or disclosure of confidential information and thereby gained a benefit (see <span class="font-italic">Shanghai </span><span class="font-italic">Afute Food</span> at [100(a)(i)]). This is clear from the plaintiffs’ Statement of Claim (Amendment No 3) (“Statement of Claim”), where they pleaded that Mr Cheong had “utilised the [Confidential Information] to canvass, solicit, and/or approach customers and suppliers and/or FDWs of the Plaintiffs, and caused them to conduct business with Recruitbee instead of the Plaintiffs”.

</div> At paragraph 39(b)(iv) of the Statement of Claim, the plaintiffs further pleaded that “[t]he Defendants therefore must give an account of profits, in respect of their wrongful gain”. This wrongful gain was quantified at paragraph 39(b) as “an unfair benefit amounting to approximately $744,359.31 to date”. Similarly, their closing submissions were in respect of the alleged unauthorised use and disclosure of the Confidential Information by Mr Cheong and the benefit gained by the defendants as a result of such unauthorised use and disclosure. At paragraph 61 of the plaintiffs’ closing submissions, the plaintiffs echoed their pleadings in submitting that “the taking and misuse of the Plaintiffs’ confidential information for the Defendants’ wrongful gain would necessarily cause injury to the Plaintiffs, through the solicitation of business that could have, and has arisen from such misuse”. Having alleged that there had been unauthorised use and disclosure of their Confidential Information to cause Recruitbee to reap a wrongful gain,<span class="font-italic"> </span>it is for the plaintiffs to prove those allegations. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">73 It is not the plaintiffs’ pleaded case that they are seeking to vindicate their “wrongful loss interest” for the protection of “the confidentiality of the information <span class="font-italic">per se</span>” (<span class="font-italic">Shanghai </span><span class="font-italic">Afute Food </span>at [100(a)(ii)]).

In this suit, having pleaded a claim that seeks to protect their “wrongful gain interest”, where Mr Cheong is alleged to have made unauthorised use or disclosure of confidential information and thereby reaped a wrongful gain, the legal burden rests squarely on the plaintiffs to prove their case under the traditional approach in <span class="font-italic">Coco v Clark</span> (<span class="font-italic">Lim Oon </span><span class="font-italic">Kuin </span>at [39]). The legal burden is not on Mr Cheong to prove that his conscience was unaffected. Similarly, in <span class="font-italic">Writers Studio</span>, the learned Judge observed that the plaintiff in that case had framed its pleadings based on the requirements set forth in <span class="font-italic">Coco v Clark</span>, and held that the plaintiff there was not entitled to rely on the <span class="font-italic">I-Admin</span> modified approach and must “let the chips lie where they have fallen” (<span class="font-italic">Writers Studio </span>at [134]–[135]).

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">81 As for the other categories of information, the analysis may differ depending on the time frame. So while Mr Cheong was still employed by Swift Maids, the information he possessed as an employee could be classified as “confidential”, firstly, if this information was explicitly protected by his employment contract, and, secondly, if it would have been a breach of the duty of good faith and fidelity that he owed as an employee, while the employment subsisted, to have used it for his own purposes or to have disclosed it to a competitor (<span class="font-italic">Asia </span><span class="font-italic">Petworld </span>at [42], citing <span class="font-italic">Tang Siew Choy and others v </span><span class="font-italic">Certact Pte Ltd</span> [1993] 1 SLR(R) 835 (“<span class="font-italic">Tang Siew Choy</span>”)<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [16], which in turn cited <span class="font-italic">Faccenda Chicken Ltd v Fowler</span> [1986] 1 All ER 617 (“<span class="font-italic">Faccenda Chicken</span>”)<span class="font-italic"> </span>at 625–627). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">82 Of relevance here is the contact information of Swift Maids’ suppliers. In <span class="font-italic">Asia </span><span class="font-italic">Petworld</span>, the plaintiff company was involved in the drop shipping of pet products, while the first defendant was its employee for around six years. The first defendant had resigned and thereafter ran a rival pet products drop shipping business. The plaintiff company alleged that the first defendant, in running the competitor business, had misused confidential information belonging to the plaintiff company, including customer information, its management dashboard, pricing lists containing vendor’s costs information and an inventory showing its bestselling products (at [21]). The learned Judge in <span class="font-italic">Asia </span><span class="font-italic">Petworld </span>observed that “not all information that an employee is obliged to keep confidential during his employment is information that is protectable as confidential information after he ceases to be employed” (at [42], citing <span class="font-italic">Tang Siew Choy </span>at [16], which in turn cited <span class="font-italic">Faccenda Chicken</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at 625–627). In particular, “the knowledge and experience that an employee acquires during his employment is not protectable confidential information” (<span class="font-italic">Asia </span><span class="font-italic">Petworld </span>at [43], citing <span class="font-italic">Asia Business Forum Pte Ltd v Long Ai Sin and another</span> [2003] 4 SLR(R) 658 at [15] and [17], which in turn cited <span class="font-italic">Sir W C Leng &amp; Co Limited v Andrews </span>[1909] 1 Ch 763 at 773). The learned Judge also referred to the case of <span class="font-italic">E Worsley &amp; Co Ltd v Cooper</span> [1939] 1 All ER 290 (“<span class="font-italic">E Worsley</span>”), which concerned an ex‑employee’s use of his knowledge of suppliers obtained in his previous employ. In <span class="font-italic">E Worsley</span>, the court held that an ex-employee of a paper merchant was entitled to use, in his future business endeavours, his knowledge of the identity of paper mills from which the former employer sourced paper (see <span class="font-italic">Asia </span><span class="font-italic">Petworld</span> at [47]). The learned Judge found that information on where one can source for a particular product at the lowest price was “information in the first defendant’s head which he acquired through the course of his employment” and that this was “not information that possesses the quality of confidence” (<span class="font-italic">Asia </span><span class="font-italic">Petworld </span>at [46]). Similarly, here, Mr Cheong got to know Swift Maids’ suppliers and had contact with them during his two years working for Swift Maids. The information relating to Swift Maids’ suppliers constitutes the knowledge and experience that Mr Cheong, as an employee, acquired during his employment, and no longer retains the necessary quality of confidence after Mr Cheong’s resignation from Swift Maids to remain as protectable confidential information.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">83 In any event, even assuming that all the components of the Confidential Information are protectable, the plaintiffs will still not succeed because they have not been able to satisfy the final limb of the <span class="font-italic">Coco v Clark </span>test, which requires proof of “unauthorised use” of confidential information. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-5 text-left">(C) Unauthorised use of the information and detriment to the plaintiffs  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">84 I begin with an observation about the anaemic state of the plaintiffs’ evidence concerning Mr Cheong’s breaches of his confidentiality obligations. The plaintiffs have not been able to identify a single customer or a single FDW whom Mr Cheong or the other defendants had re-directed to Recruitbee using the Confidential Information. As for suppliers, they did not do more than point to the fact that three suppliers of FDW biodata, one of whom is Ms Aung, had stopped supplying biodata to Swift Maids. There is nothing else to substantiate their claim that Mr Cheong had used the Confidential Information to divert their suppliers to Recruitbee. Indeed, they could do no better than refer to the placement numbers of Recruitbee.

</div> Given that Ms Suliyani supplied to multiple FDW employment agencies, Ms Feonale’s biodata could have been made available by Ms Suliyani, and not by Mr Cheong, to Recruitbee. The plaintiffs did not call Ms Suliyani to give evidence that she had not provided Ms Feonale’s biodata to Recruitbee Employment. If there is such evidence from Ms Suliyani, there would be some basis for the plaintiffs’ allegation that Mr Cheong had provided the biodata to Recruitbee Employment. I mention for completeness that there is even no evidence that Ms Feonale was hired through Recruitbee Employment as the plaintiffs have alleged, much less that Mr Cheong had called the customer to persuade the customer to hire Ms Feonale through Recruitbee Employment. Ms Vivian did not ascertain from Ms Feonale’s employer or Ms Feonale herself which employment agency eventually placed her.

</div>
</div> Swift Maids did not have a branch in Toa Payoh, but Recruitbee Employment had a branch in Toa Payoh. Ms May’s evidence is relevant to the plaintiffs’ submission that customers or FDWs would not trust Recruitbee Employment enough to do business with them since Recruitbee Employment was a newcomer. That trust barrier was allegedly overcome by Mr Cheong taking and misusing Swift Maids’ Confidential Information for the defendants to reach out to the customers and the FDWs who had dealings with Swift Maids, and to divert them to Recruitbee Employment “by deceiving them into thinking that Recruitbee Employment is an extension of the Plaintiffs”.

</div> According to the plaintiffs, that could have been done by informing the customers and FDWs that Swift Maids had a new branch in Toa Payoh. Specifically, for FDWs, the defendants or the staff members of Recruitbee Employment “could have called” and solicited their business.

In fact, it is Mr Lit’s evidence that after his second conversation with Ms Suliyani, Swift Maids did not continue to take biodata of FDWs from Ms Suliyani because “[a]t that point of time, it was during the COVID period.

</div> But no evidence was given as to why Ms Shima stopped supplying biodata to Swift Maids. It is quite telling that despite Mr Hu being “friends” with Ms Shima, he did not get any indication from Ms Shima that Mr Cheong had approached her to re-direct her supply of FDW biodata from Swift Maids to Recruitbee. Ms Toh’s evidence is that Recruitbee started receiving FDW biodata from Ms Shima in July or August 2020.

</div> According to Ms Toh, Ms Aung had provided Ms Shima’s contact information to Ms Chua earlier to approach Ms Shima but Ms Shima did not want to supply to Recruitbee as she found Recruitbee to be too small. She only started supplying to Recruitbee after Ms Peh, Ms Teo and Ms Lim joined Recruitbee, and after Ms Peh had spoken with Ms Shima.

</div> In other words, neither Ms Suliyani nor Ms Shima worked exclusively with Swift Maids. As for Ms Aung, she had a vested interest in Recruitbee. On the facts, I am only able to conclude that Ms Suliyani, Ms Shima and Ms Aung had stopped supplying biodata of FDWs to Swift Maids after Mr Cheong left Swift Maids’ employ. I am, however, unable to come to the conclusion that Mr Cheong had, whether before or after he resigned from Swift Maids, somehow used the Confidential Information to divert the supply to Recruitbee and caused the cessation of supply to Swift Maids. Further, as I have found above at [82], the contact information relating to Swift Maids’ suppliers would form part of Mr Cheong’s working knowledge and experience, and would in any case not be protectable confidential information after Mr Cheong’s resignation from Swift Maids.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">96 In summary, there is insufficient evidence to show that Mr Cheong had misused the Confidential Information or that he had disclosed, divulged or communicated the Confidential Information to the other defendants, or that Mr Cheong or the other defendants had re-directed Swift Maids’ business or suppliers to Recruitbee using the Confidential Information. I find that the plaintiffs have failed to prove on the balance of probabilities that there had been unauthorised use of the Confidential Information, and they have therefore not met the requirement under the third limb of the test in <span class="font-italic">Coco</span><span class="font-italic"> v Clark</span>. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-5 text-left">(D) Application of the modified test and Rebutting the presumption </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">97 I turn now to explain why the plaintiffs will still fail even if the modified approach in <span class="font-italic">I-Admin</span> is applied and an action for breach of confidence is presumed. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-6 text-left font-italic">(I) <span class="font-italic">Confidential Information in Mr Cheong’s possession</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">98 As set out at [63] above, the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Lim Oon </span><span class="font-italic">Kuin </span>endorsed at [41] of the judgment the proposition advanced by Prof Ng-Loy, that the modified approach in <span class="font-italic">I-Admin </span>is limited to cases involving unauthorised acquisition of confidential information.

</div> Mr Cheong’s account is thus that he had limited contact with customers and FDWs, and in turn, limited occasions to deal with them on his personal handphone. The general tenor of Mr Cheong’s evidence – that his job scope was such that he had limited direct contact with customers and FDWs – is corroborated by Mr Lit’s testimony that part of the job of a general manager at Swift Maids was to deal with problems raised by customers when the salespersons were unable to adequately address those problems.

</div> In sum, therefore, the information in Mr Cheong’s personal handphone’s memory is likely limited only to dealings with the customers and FDWs which the salespersons had surfaced for Mr Cheong’s action, and which was not conducted through the office main line. Indeed, the information that could have been captured in Mr Cheong’s handphone would, on the face of things, be patently less useful than the comprehensive compilations and aggregations<span class="font-italic"> </span>of information that were acquired in the precedent cases. For example, in <span class="font-italic">I-Admin</span>, the materials comprised, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, specific source codes for key business systems, databases, business development materials, and documents setting out internal guidelines and policies (<span class="font-italic">I-Admin </span>at [14]). In <span class="font-italic">Angliss</span>, spreadsheets and reports containing sensitive information consisting of, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, information on customers, pricing, sales revenues and targets were involved (<span class="font-italic">Angliss</span> at [40]–[42]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">106 Third, I find that there is, in any event, evidence that Recruitbee had engaged in extensive independent efforts to recruit FDWs and to reach out to customers, which accounted for its business performance and placement numbers. The role and reach of online platforms, which Recruitbee relied on, also support the view that Mr Cheong and the defendants did not make unauthorised use of the Confidential Information. The effect of such evidence is that the inference which the plaintiffs invite me to draw, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>that Mr Cheong and the defendants <span class="font-italic">must have</span> misused the Confidential Information, is an untenable one. The case would have been different, had Swift Maids undertook forensic analysis which might have enabled them to identify FDWs which they say Recruitbee only managed to place because of the Confidential Information. But as this was not done, a broad finding that Mr Cheong and the defendants made unauthorised use of the Confidential Information cannot be made on the balance of probabilities.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">107 In this regard, Ms Toh gave evidence that Recruitbee Employment engaged in extensive efforts to source for FDWs looking to transfer their employment (“transfer FDWs”). Ms Toh testified that unlike other employment agencies, Recruitbee Employment’s staff members had, on every Sunday, stationed themselves in areas where FDWs frequent to engage FDWs, and arranged for meals to be provided to them with goodie bags.

To begin with, it is unclear what Confidential Information was retained in Mr Cheong’s personal handphone after he left the employ of Swift Maids. There is also a lack of evidence that such information went beyond Mr Cheong or that it was not used as intended by the plaintiffs. Specifically, there is a lack of evidence to suggest that Mr Cheong had referred to or used whatever Confidential Information which could have been stored in his personal handphone, or that he had provided Recruitbee with such information to reach out to specific FDWs or customers. More importantly, there is evidence that Recruitbee’s business was generated based on its own marketing strategies and efforts. As for the contact information of suppliers, Mr Cheong’s residual ties to suppliers whom he had worked with in his two years working for Swift Maids had been analysed above at [82]. I am therefore of the view that Recruitbee’s placement numbers cannot reasonably be attributed to the use of whatever Confidential Information that could have been stored on Mr Cheong’s personal handphone. There is no question that Mr Cheong should not have used his personal handphone against company regulations. But the evidence before the court is sufficient to prove that Mr Cheong’s conscience was unaffected for the purposes of the third stage of the modified approach in <span class="font-italic">I-Admin</span>.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">109 Taken in the round, it is my judgment that the plaintiffs’ claim against Mr Cheong for breach of the equitable duty of confidence fails, even if the modified approach in <span class="font-italic">I-Admin</span> is applied.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">114 In the light of the evidence, I consider that Mr Cheong had, on balance, discharged any duty he might have had as general manager by attempting to enforce Swift Maids’ policy of having staff members use only the office phone numbers for their work. The fact that enforcement of this policy was imperfect, despite the intervention of both the general manager and the director of Swift Maids, does not give rise to an inference that Mr Cheong had caused any staff members to store the Confidential Information in their personal handphones and thereafter misuse such information after they left Swift Maids. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">115 In relation to Ms Teo and Ms Lim’s alleged possession and misuse of the Confidential Information, the plaintiffs’ argument is that because Mr Cheong had failed to stop Ms Peh from using her personal handphone number, “there is a high likelihood that other staff, including [Ms Lim] and [Ms Teo], were similarly allowed to, and were, using their personal phones and phone numbers”.

</div> The plaintiffs then invite the court to conclude that Ms Peh, Ms Lim and Ms Teo had all misused the Confidential Information that they allegedly had on their personal handphones when they left to join Recruitbee Employment. I am unable to agree with the plaintiffs. There is no evidence that Ms Lim and Ms Teo continued to use their personal handphones for Swift Maids’ business after the company handphones were issued. It does not follow that just because Ms Peh had continued to use her personal handphone number for Swift Maids’ business, Ms Lim and Ms Teo would necessarily have adopted a similar practice. I am unable to infer from Ms Peh’s refusal to abide by company policy that Ms Teo and Ms Lim also engaged in similar conduct. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">116 Moreover, the plaintiffs have led no evidence to show that Ms Peh, Ms Teo or Ms Lim had <span class="font-italic">used</span> the Confidential Information in their new employment in Recruitbee Employment. As I have already found above, there is a lack of evidence to prove that the Confidential Information was misused to advance Recruitbee’s business interests. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">117 I therefore hold that the plaintiffs do not have a viable claim against Mr Cheong in relation to the alleged misuse of the Confidential Information by Ms Peh, Ms Teo and Ms Lim.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(3) Contractual duty of confidentiality </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">118 Clauses 12.1 and 12.2 of Mr Cheong’s employment contract were reproduced in the plaintiffs’ Statement of Claim together with cll 8, 11 and 13, presumably in relation to the plaintiffs’ action against Mr Cheong for breach of the contractual duty of confidentiality.

</div> But cl 12.2 is drafted to have a sweeping scope. It proscribed Mr Cheong from disclosing, divulging, authorising or permitting delivery of information on matters relating to Swift Maids Pte Ltd and her customers to anyone not entitled thereto. Swift Maids’ customers’ contact information, FDWs’ contact information, FDWs’ biodata and suppliers’ contact information may potentially come within the ambit of cl 12.2. In this suit, the parties did not put the confidentiality of any aspect of the Confidential Information in issue, and the only dispute is whether there has been a breach of Mr Cheong’s contractual confidentiality duty. In this regard, the burden is on the plaintiffs to prove on the balance of probabilities that the contractual confidentiality obligations have been breached under this head of claim. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">120 As I have detailed above, there is insufficient evidence for the court to find that the Confidential Information was misused by Mr Cheong, or given by Mr Cheong to the defendants to use for Recruitbee’s purposes.

</div> I find it hard to believe that Mr Cheong would have entrusted the money to Joseph whom he did not know well. I also find it hard to believe that Joseph would consent to an arrangement for him to take on the responsibility to coordinate payments for transactions unrelated to him, and be potentially accountable to various other parties for moneys due to them.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">128 On balance, I find that Mr Cheong, through Pixelate, was involved in providing the services billed under the Pixelate invoices. He had used Pixelate as a front to subcontract the work to be carried out on terms that he negotiated with the independent contractors, and thereafter billed Swift Maids for the work done. I therefore find Mr Cheong to be in breach of cl 8.4 of his employment contract to “not in any way be connected or engaged with any other company business or concern without prior approval or consent by [Swift Maids Pte Ltd] in writing”. On the facts, Mr Cheong probably knew that approval or consent would not be forthcoming, which was why he had not disclosed that Pixelate was set up by him, and had even used Madcreationinn’s name and company registration number on the invoices without permission in order to be paid.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">129  Despite this finding, the plaintiffs’ claim is problematic because the plaintiffs have not been able to prove any losses arising from the Pixelate transactions.

Thereafter, there are eight rows in the table, with eight different names and corresponding credit figures from 5 July 2019 to 3 March 2020. Under cross-examination, Mr Loh acknowledged that this record shows that after a debit was made from Swift Maids’ account on 12 June 2019 for the $8,190 payment to Ms Suliyani, Swift Maids’ account was gradually credited as deployments were carried out for FDWs sourced by Ms Suliyani.

In this regard, Mr Loh agreed that Mr Cheong’s successor, as the next general manager, should have followed up with Ms Suliyani to ensure that she continued to supply FDW biodata to account for the value of the Outstanding Balance.

From such a payment pattern, the logical inference would be that if Ms Suliyani did not receive the $8,190 from Mr Cheong, she would, as Mr Cheong asserted, have asked Swift Maids for the shortfall in the amount of the deductions for the cash advance.

Instead of investigating and proving that the claim particulars were false, or that Mr Cheong was not performing the plaintiffs’ business at the locations recorded in the 28 allegedly wrongful claims, for example, by adducing evidence that Swift Maids had no FDW arrivals or departures on those days, the plaintiffs simply relied on the fact that Mr Ismadi’s services were not used as constitutive of their case. This is inadequate. The plaintiffs bear the legal burden of proving that the 28 claims were made for expenses unrelated to the plaintiffs’ business, or that Mr Cheong was not performing the plaintiffs’ business at the locations recorded in the 28 allegedly wrongful claims.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">145 It is not disputed that Swift Maids had branches in Far East, Chong Pang and Ang Mo Kio at the material time.

</div> The allegedly wrongful trips were mostly made between HarbourFront Cruise and Ferry Terminal or Changi Airport and locations connected with Swift Maids’ business activities, as well as the “training centre” used by Swift Maids, instead of locations connected with Recruitbee’s business activities. The plaintiffs did not explain why the trips would start from, or end at, premises linked to Swift Maids’ business locations if they were made for Recruitbee’s purposes. Neither did the plaintiffs explain and adduce evidence to show why Mr Cheong had no business to be at those locations on those dates for Swift Maids’ work. Indeed, if, as the plaintiffs assert, Mr Cheong was picking up FDWs from HarbourFront Cruise and Ferry Terminal or Changi Airport for Recruitbee’s purposes, it would be illogical for the trips to end at premises belonging to Swift Maids. Similarly, for those trips that commenced from Swift Maids’ premises, it would again be illogical for the trips to end at HarbourFront Cruise and Ferry Terminal or Changi Airport if those trips were really carried out for Recruitbee’s purposes. It should be borne in mind that the plaintiffs’ pleaded case was that Mr Cheong, in undertaking these 28 allegedly wrongful trips, was “picking … FDWs not for the purposes of the Plaintiffs’ business, but for Recruitbee’s business”.

</div> It beggars belief that Mr Cheong would send Recruitbee’s FDWs to Swift Maids’ premises or pick them up from Swift Maids’ premises. If it is the plaintiffs’ case that Mr Cheong had made use of any other arrangements to exploit the reimbursement system, the plaintiffs did not make clear what those arrangements were.

In addition, referring to Fox LJ’s decision in <span class="font-italic">Lonrho Ltd v Shell Petroleum Co Ltd</span>, The Times 7 March 1981 Transcript No 51 of 1981, the Court of Appeal noted that “a focus on the combination to commit a wrong would be erroneous without also looking at the injury being the <span class="font-italic">purpose</span> rather than the <span class="font-italic">consequence</span> of the combination” [emphasis in original]. At [101], the Court of Appeal further held that:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">101 A claimant in an action for unlawful means conspiracy would have to show that the unlawful means and the conspiracy were targeted or directed at the claimant.

The Court of Appeal opined that a distinction needed to be drawn between two scenarios. In scenario (a), two pizza delivery companies agree to purposefully violate parking regulations and instruct their drivers to park their vehicles across the car park entrance of a third competitor in order to injure the third competitor’s business. In scenario (b), a pizza delivery company instructs its drivers to drive at excessive speeds in order to reduce delivery times to obtain more customers, to the detriment of its competitors. The Court of Appeal opined that scenario (a) would likely amount to an unlawful means conspiracy, while scenario (b) would not. The Court of Appeal held that the focus should be on the <span class="font-italic">intention</span> pursuant to which the unlawful act was done – in this regard, the Court of Appeal agreed (at [93]) with Lord Nicholls’ observations in <span class="font-italic">OBG Ltd v Allan</span> [2008] 1 AC 1 at [160] that “the pizza delivery companies’ criminal conduct in the latter case is ‘not an offence committed against the rival company in any realistic sense of that expression’”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">169 Commentators have further explained this example of the pizza delivery companies as illustrating a controlling factor in moderating the scope of the unlawful means conspiracy tort. In Gary Chan Kok Yew &amp; Lee Pey Woan, <span class="font-italic">The Law of Torts in Singapore </span>(Academy Publishing, 2nd Ed, 2016), the learned authors stated at page 695 at para 15.074:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">In other words, what seems critical is that the illegality must ultimately be shown to be the effective <span class="font-italic">means </span>by which the plaintiff was injured. Absent this critical causal link, there is no basis for imposing liability. Accepting a broad notion of “unlawful means” need not, therefore, inevitably cause the floodgates to be flung wide open, for it is important to bear in mind that relevant control mechanisms may be found <span class="font-italic">apart </span>from the concept of actionability.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[footnotes omitted; emphasis in original] </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">170 In a nutshell, it is insufficient for the defendants to have come together to carry out unlawful acts; the unlawful means and the conspiracy must have been targeted or directed at the plaintiffs and the illegality must ultimately be shown to be the effective <span class="font-italic">means </span>by which the plaintiff was injured. In <span class="font-italic">Sumifru</span><span class="font-italic"> Singapore Pte Ltd v Felix Santos Ishizuka and others</span> [2022] SGHC 14 (“<span class="font-italic">Sumifru</span>”), a suit was brought by the plaintiff fruit company against Felix, its former employee holding the title of “shipping director”, and two companies owned and controlled by Felix (see <span class="font-italic">Sumifru</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [1] and [3]–[4]). One of the incidents complained of by the plaintiff company was a series of unauthorised time charters. Felix had procured one of the defendant companies to enter into contracts with various shipowners to time charter vessels, and the defendant company thereafter chartered out space on board these ships to the plaintiff company, profiting from the difference between the time charter costs and the costs charged to the plaintiff company (<span class="font-italic">Sumifru</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [10]). Moreover, some of the time charters were secured with Felix having falsely represented to the shipowners that the plaintiff company was guaranteeing the performance of the contracts, or that the plaintiff company was the charterer (<span class="font-italic">Sumifru</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [11]). The court found that these unauthorised time charters constituted a breach of Felix’s fiduciary duties owed to the plaintiff company, and that the defendant companies had dishonestly assisted Felix’s breaches (see <span class="font-italic">Sumifru</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [56] and [67]). However, the court held at [72]–[73]<span class="font-italic"> </span>that these findings could not ground a successful claim in unlawful means conspiracy. This was because, on the facts, the plaintiff company could not show that Felix and the defendant companies “had combined with the intention of causing damage or injury to the [plaintiff company]”.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">171 There is a final point to make before turning to the facts.

</div>, is misguided. The Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">JTrust</span><span class="font-italic"> Asia</span> was not considering at [209] the element of loss in an unlawful means conspiracy claim. Instead, as is clearly evident in the header to that section of the judgment (above [205] in <span class="font-italic">JTrust</span><span class="font-italic"> Asia</span>), the Court of Appeal was considering the alleged conspirators’ intention to cause damage or injury to the plaintiff in that case. At [209], the Court of Appeal had considered and <span class="font-italic">rejected</span> the argument that “since a fraudster did not expect to be discovered, he did not <span class="font-italic">intend to cause loss</span> to his victims” [emphasis added]. The Court of Appeal found that the appellant company was exposed to risks which in fact materialised and caused losses to the appellant company, and in particular, stated that the injury caused to the appellant company “would have been intended as a means to an end for [the respondents’] benefit” (at [209]). This is an entirely different proposition from that which the plaintiffs contend. The Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">EFT Holdings </span>at [112(e)]) was crystal clear that a plaintiff in an unlawful means conspiracy claim must show that “the plaintiff suffered loss as a result of the conspiracy”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">172 I turn now to examine the facts. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Analysis and findings</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(1) Scope of the alleged conspiracy</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">173 I first consider the plaintiffs’ pleadings to identify the scope of the conspiracy as pleaded, including the relevant acts and mental states involved. The plaintiffs allege that the defendants had, with the intention to cause damage or injury to the plaintiffs, conspired to set up Recruitbee to divert and/or solicit business and employees away from the plaintiffs, through the breaches of Mr Cheong’s duties to Swift Maids and the unauthorised use of the Confidential Information.

Prior to the incorporation of Recruitbee, [Mr] Cheong, [Ms] Toh, and [Ms Aung] had conspired, agreeing to set up Recruitbee as a vehicle to divert and/or solicit business and employee(s) away from the Plaintiffs with the intention of injuring the Plaintiffs’ business, in order to enrich themselves at the Plaintiffs’ expense. Given that it was widely known amongst the Plaintiffs’ employees and the Plaintiffs’ suppliers that [Mr] Cheong had full authority and unfettered access to the Plaintiffs’ confidential information, [Ms Toh] and [Ms Aung] were both well aware of the same. The Defendants nonetheless conspired and agreed to operate Recruitbee, in a manner which directly injured the Plaintiffs’ business, through the unlawful breaches of [Mr] Cheong’s duties owed to the Plaintiffs and the use of the Plaintiffs’ confidential information.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(2) Combination, accompanied by the intention to injure by unlawful means</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">174 Having examined the circumstances and the acts of the alleged conspirators, I find that, as amongst the defendants, there was no “combination, accompanied by the intention to injure by unlawful means” (<span class="font-italic">EFT Holdings </span>at [96]). The tort of unlawful means conspiracy is not committed if the defendants had simply combined and acted together to set up Recruitbee in direct competition with Swift Maids, while Mr Cheong was still under the employ of Swift Maids. This is so even though the competition would likely be detrimental to Swift Maids. As the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">EFT Holdings</span> held at [101], it is insufficient that “harm to the claimant would be a likely, or probable or even inevitable consequence of the defendant’s conduct”, or that “there was knowledge to found an awareness of the likelihood of particular consequences”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">175 In this case, the evidence shows only that Recruitbee entered the employment agency industry as a competitor to the existing businesses in that industry, including as a competitor to Swift Maids, and was not set up for the purpose of re-directing Swift Maids’ business and employees to Recruitbee through unlawful means. I have already found at [96] above that there is insufficient evidence to prove that Mr Cheong had abused his access to the Confidential Information, or disclosed, divulged or communicated any of the Confidential Information to the rest of the defendants, or that Mr Cheong or the other defendants had used the Confidential Information for Recruitbee’s purposes. I have also found above at [96] that the plaintiffs have not proven that Mr Cheong, either working alone or with the other defendants, had unlawfully diverted and/or solicited business away from Swift Maids to Recruitbee through the use of the Confidential Information. The situation would have been different, however, if the defendants had acted together to target the plaintiffs’ interest through making unauthorised use of the plaintiffs’ Confidential Information to divert and/or solicit Swift Maids’ business and employees away from Swift Maids. But there is no evidence of this. The analysis here ties in with the test of “instrumentality” discussed by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">EFT Holdings </span>at [93]. It is insufficient, for the purposes of making out the tort, for the defendants to have been complicit in the carrying out of unlawful acts. The unlawful acts have to be ones that are committed <span class="font-italic">against</span> the rival company. This is sufficient to dispose of the plaintiffs’ claim in unlawful means conspiracy, but I will address the arguments raised by the plaintiffs for completeness. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(3) The plaintiffs’ allegations of the defendants’ actions in furtherance of the alleged unlawful means conspiracy</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">176 In so far as the three trips that Mr Cheong made to Myanmar are concerned, I find that the first two trips were made for the purposes of Swift Maids’ business. There is evidence that both trips were taken under the instructions of Mr Loh.

</div> I am unable to conclude, from this single conversation between Mr Cheong and Mr Ismadi, that Mr Cheong was carrying out a plan to “test” Mr Ismadi with a view to eventually poach him. The content of this conversation appears to be commonplace gripes about workplace issues. It would be a stretch to infer from such gripes that Mr Cheong was trying to solicit Mr Ismadi to join Recruitbee Employment. I am all the more unable to conclude, from this single conversation between Mr Cheong and Mr Ismadi, that Mr Cheong had similarly “tested the waters” with Ms Peh, Ms Lim and Ms Teo,

</div> and eventually re-directed them to work for Recruitbee Employment.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">188 On balance, I accept that Mr Cheong was contacted by Ms Peh in May 2020, and by Ms Teo and Ms Lim in July 2020, about job opportunities outside the plaintiffs. By this time, Mr Cheong was no longer employed by Swift Maids. It is more likely than not that Mr Cheong had positive things to say about Recruitbee Employment or even encouraged them to join Recruitbee Employment. But that is not unlawful. There is no evidence here that Mr Cheong had solicited them to join Recruitbee during his employment with Swift Maids. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">189 I note that when Ms Peh, Ms Teo and Ms Lim joined Recruitbee Employment, they may well have brought with them some of their professional relationships with customers, FDWs or suppliers. While this may be a boon to Recruitbee Employment, and a detriment to Swift Maids, the plaintiffs did not say how this is illegal. In fact, Mr Loh, under cross-examination, conceded that sales staff need not refer their old customers back to their former employer, should these customers contact the sales staff again after the sales staff have joined a new company.

</div> I am of the view that a closure of the branch of a company cannot, without more, be sufficient proof of loss. This is because the notion of loss <span class="font-italic">presupposes </span>that the branch was profitable for Swift Maids before it was closed. This is something that cannot be assumed by the court. The plaintiffs, as the party advancing their claim, would still have to adduce proof of loss, such as a decline in their revenue due to the closure of the branch. This submission by the plaintiffs is also problematic at a deeper level. Firstly, there is insufficient evidence to attribute the departure of Ms Peh, Ms Lim and Ms Teo to any breach of Mr Cheong’s duties or any combination of the defendants, for the court to hold the defendants liable for loss, if any, arising from the closure of the Yishun branch. Secondly, while I accept that the departure of Ms Peh, Ms Lim and Ms Teo was disruptive to the plaintiffs’ operations, I have doubts that it was so debilitating that it caused the closure of the branch. Mr Loh admitted that “shortly after” the Yishun branch was shut down, Swift Maids opened another branch in Junction Nine (also in Yishun) as part of its “business strategy”.

In <span class="font-italic">Zage</span>, at [20], the Court of Appeal, citing <span class="font-italic">Bansal Hemant </span><span class="font-italic">Govindprasad v Central Bank of India </span>[2003] 2 SLR(R) 33 and <span class="font-italic">Caltong</span><span class="font-italic"> (Australia) Pty Ltd v Tong Tien See Construction Pte Ltd</span> [2002] 2 SLR(R) 94, set out the elements of a claim in dishonest assistance as: “(a) the existence of a trust; (b) a breach of that trust; (c) assistance rendered by the third party towards the breach; and (d) a finding that the assistance rendered by the third party was dishonest”. In <span class="font-italic">Aljunied-Hougang Town Council and another v Lim Swee Lian Sylvia and others and another suit </span>[2019] SGHC 241, the learned Judge, in explaining the holding in <span class="font-italic">Zage</span>, held that the reference to “the existence of a trust” in <span class="font-italic">Zage </span>“was merely a shorthand used by the court for the existence of a fiduciary relationship” and that it “suffices for liability that there was a breach of fiduciary duty” (at [451]). When this case went up on appeal to the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">How Weng Fan and others v Sengkang Town Council and other appeals </span>[2023] 1 SLR 707, the Court of Appeal held at [410] that the finding that no fiduciary duties are owed disposes of the claims of dishonest assistance and knowing receipt. I therefore turn to the law on when fiduciary duties arise.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(2) Fiduciary duties</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">206 The learned authors of <span class="font-italic">Singapore Trusts Law </span>divided fiduciaries into “status-based” and “fact-based” fiduciaries (<span class="font-italic">Singapore Trusts Law </span>at paras 15-12–15-13). Status-based fiduciaries owe fiduciary duties because of their status, such as that of a trustee, director or solicitor, and such status confers a strong but rebuttable presumption that fiduciary duties are owed. Fact-based fiduciaries are fiduciaries who owe fiduciary duties because the circumstances and relationship between the parties justify the imposition of such duties. Similarly, the learned contributors to <span class="font-italic">Halsbury’s Laws of Singapore</span> vol 9(3) and 9(4) (LexisNexis, 2021) (“<span class="font-italic">Halsbury’s Laws of Singapore</span>”) set out at paras 110.196–110.209 various relationships recognised in case law as fiduciary relationships, as well as relationships presumed not to be fiduciary relationships. The learned contributors to <span class="font-italic">Halsbury’s Laws of Singapore </span>also set out at para 110.190 factors that contribute to a finding of a fiduciary relationship despite the absence of a recognised fiduciary relationship (such as a trustee-beneficiary relationship), while recognising that the “notion of a fiduciary relationship is very fluid” and that the “law has not developed a single touchstone by which to judge when and whether a fiduciary relationship is constituted but employs a number of criteria”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">207 This approach adopted by commentators reflects the Court of Appeal’s holding in <span class="font-italic">Turf Club Auto Emporium Pte Ltd and others v Yeo </span><span class="font-italic">Boong Hua and others and another appeal</span> [2018] 2 SLR 655. The Court of Appeal stated at [43] that:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">43 While there are settled categories of fiduciary relationships – such as the relationship of a trustee-beneficiary, director-company, solicitor-client, between partners – it does not mean that all such relationships <span class="font-italic">are</span> invariably fiduciary relationships. In these relationships, there is a strong, but rebuttable, presumption that fiduciary duties are owed. Equally, the categories of fiduciary relationships are not closed or limited only to the settled categories. Fiduciary duties may be owed even if the relationship between the parties is not one of the settled categories, provided that the circumstances justify the imposition of such duties (see <span class="font-italic">Snell’s Equity</span> at paras 7-004–7-005). For instance, parties in a joint venture may or may not share a fiduciary relationship, depending on the circumstances of their relationship (see John Glower, <span class="font-italic">Commercial Equity</span> – <span class="font-italic">Fiduciary Relationships</span> (Butterworths, 1995) at paras 3.90–3.96 and <span class="font-italic">Snell’s Equity</span> at para 7-006). Therefore, contrary to the approaches adopted by the parties (in particular the Respondents), whether the parties are in a fiduciary relationship depends, ultimately, on the nature of their relationship and is not simply a question of whether their relationship can be shoe-horned into one of the settled categories (<span class="font-italic">eg</span>, a partnership) or into a non-settled category (<span class="font-italic">eg</span>, a joint venture or quasi-partnership).</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis in original]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">208 In other words, there are certain categories of relationships, such as director-company and solicitor-client, in which fiduciary duties would be strongly presumed to arise. However, even outside these categories of relationships, fiduciary duties may be owed, if the circumstances justify the imposition of such duties.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">209 The learned contributors to <span class="font-italic">Halsbury’s Laws of Singapore</span>, at para 110.208, noted that an employer-employee relationship is not presumed to be fiduciary in nature. In this regard, the High Court in <span class="font-italic">Angliss</span> noted that fiduciary duties may nonetheless arise between an employee and his employer in certain circumstances. The learned Judge summarised the law at [29] as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">29 … An employee may owe fiduciary duties to his employer when he is placed in a position where he must act solely in the interests of his employer to the exclusion of other interests, including his own: <span class="font-italic">Clearlab</span><span class="font-italic"> SG Pte Ltd v Ting Chong Chai and others </span>[2015] 1 SLR 163 (“<span class="font-italic">Clearlab</span>”) at [272]. In that case, at [275], the High Court endorsed, as “[a] rough and ready guide”, three factors first identified by Wilson J (dissenting) in <span class="font-italic">Frame v Smith</span> [1987] 2 SCR 99 (“<span class="font-italic">Frame v Smith</span>”) at [60], and cited by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Susilawati</span><span class="font-italic"> v American Express Bank Ltd</span> [2009] 2 SLR(R) 737 (“<span class="font-italic">Susilawati</span>”) at [41]:</div><div class="txt-body text-justify">(a)   the fiduciary has scope for the exercise of some discretion or power;</div><div class="txt-body text-justify">(b)   the fiduciary can unilaterally exercise that power or discretion so as to affect the beneficiary’s legal or practical interests;</div><div class="txt-body text-justify">(c)   the beneficiary is peculiarly vulnerable to, or at the mercy of, the fiduciary holding the discretion or power.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">210 At [33]–[35], the court in <span class="font-italic">Angliss</span> elaborated on the concept of vulnerability as found in factor (c) above. The court took pains to emphasise that this concept of vulnerability is targeted not at <span class="font-italic">any</span> kind of vulnerability, but at a particular type of vulnerability which “arises from the inability of the beneficiary (despite his or her best efforts) to prevent the injurious exercise of the power or discretion combined with the grave inadequacy or absence of other legal or practical remedies to redress the wrongful exercise of the discretion or power” (<span class="font-italic">Angliss </span>at [33], citing <span class="font-italic">Frame v Smith </span>[1987] 2 SCR 99 at [63]). Furthermore, a critical feature of fiduciary relationships is that “the fiduciary undertakes or agrees to act for or on behalf of or in the interests of another person in the exercise of a power or discretion which will affect the interests of that other person in a legal or practical sense”, such that the relationship “gives the fiduciary a special opportunity to exercise the power or discretion to the detriment of that other person who is accordingly vulnerable to abuse by the fiduciary of his position” (<span class="font-italic">Angliss </span>at [35], citing <span class="font-italic">Susilawati</span><span class="font-italic"> v American Express Bank Ltd</span> [2009] 2 SLR(R) 737 at [41], which in turn cited <span class="font-italic">Hospital Products Ltd v United States Surgical Corp</span> (1984) 55 ALR 417 at 454). </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Analysis and findings</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">211 I am unable to agree with the plaintiffs that Mr Cheong owed fiduciary duties to Swift Maids for the reasons that follow.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">212  First, as a preliminary point, I note that Mr Cheong is the general manager of Swift Maids Pte Ltd.

This is clear from his employment contract at cl 8.2, which required Mr Cheong to “observe the rules and regulations of [Swift Maids Pte Ltd] and comply with the orders and instructions given by [his] superior or any other duly authorized persons”. This contractual position is borne out by the evidence, where it is obvious that Mr Cheong’s authority to make decisions was limited to transactions with employers, FDWs and suppliers dealing with Swift Maids, on matters such as fees payable to or payable by Swift Maids.

</div> Swift Maids was, on the facts, in a position to prevent the injurious exercise of Mr Cheong’s power or discretion. In this regard, I note the case of <span class="font-italic">Nagase Singapore Pte Ltd v Ching Kai Huat and others</span> [2007] 3 SLR(R) 265 (“<span class="font-italic">Nagase</span>”), where the court observed at [29] that “mere authority to negotiate contracts on behalf of the company or to authorise the payment of invoices would not itself give rise to fiduciary obligations on the part of the officers of the company entrusted with such authority”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">214 Third, Mr Cheong’s power to authorise payments was consistently circumscribed by the finance department at Swift Maids, which reported to Mr Loh as director of Swift Maids. Importantly, Mr Loh, as director, exercised supervisory powers over Mr Cheong, and could, and in fact did, bring Mr Cheong to task for any abuses by Mr Cheong. An example is the Pixelate invoices. Swift Maids’ finance department had suspicions about the Pixelate invoices and brought them to Mr Loh’s attention.

</div> Moreover, while Mr Loh took the position that Mr Cheong as general manager had “the authority to tell the finance department, ‘I’m going to withdraw 10,000 for petty cash’”, if Mr Cheong had requested a larger amount, such as $30,000, then this would be a red flag that Mr Loh would question.

</div> I note that the court in <span class="font-italic">Angliss </span>had considered a similar argument that an employee’s access to confidential information placed the employer in a particular position of vulnerability, which purportedly justified the imposition of fiduciary duties on the employee (<span class="font-italic">Angliss </span>at [33]). The court there<span class="font-italic"> </span>did not agree. It held at [36] that the vulnerability that stems from the access of an employee to confidential information does not arise from the abuse of a fiduciary’s power that has been entrusted to the employee, but instead from the abuse of confidential information. Such vulnerability may be protected by the duty of confidence in equity, and by a confidentiality clause in contract. The admonition of the court at [36] in <span class="font-italic">Angliss</span>, citing <span class="font-italic">Nagase</span> at [26], which in turn cited <span class="font-italic">Nottingham University v Fishel</span> [2000] IRLR 471 at [85]–[97], bears repeating here: “care must be taken not automatically to equate the duties of good faith and loyalty, or trust and confidence, with fiduciary obligations”. As observed by the Canadian Supreme Court in <span class="font-italic">Canadian Aero Service Ltd v O’Malley</span> (1973) 40 DLR (3d) 371 at 381, which was cited by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Smile Inc</span> at [54], the duty owed by employees “to their employer, unless enlarged by contract, consisted only of respect for trade secrets and for confidentiality of customer lists”, which is unlike the “larger, more exacting duty” of a fiduciary. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">217 Having considered the evidence, it is my judgment that Mr Cheong did not stand in the position of a fiduciary <span class="font-italic">vis-à-vis</span> Swift Maids. Mr Cheong did not have the ability to <span class="font-italic">unilaterally </span>exercise power or discretion to affect Swift Maids’ legal or practical interests. Swift Maids had the power and ability – through the checks exercised by the directors and the finance department – to prevent the injurious abuse of Mr Cheong’s power or discretion. In this case, the plaintiffs’ remedies for any allegedly wrongful exercise of discretion or power by Mr Cheong may be found in other non-fiduciary duties owed by Mr Cheong to Swift Maids and should lie there. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">218 Accordingly, I find the plaintiffs’ claim that Recruitbee Employment, Ms Toh, Ms Aung and Recruitbee Helpers dishonestly assisted Mr Cheong’s breaches of fiduciary duties owed to Swift Maids

Whether or not in each case an adverse inference should be drawn depends on all the evidence adduced and the circumstances of the case. There is no fixed and immutable rule of law for drawing such inference. Where, as was the case here, the trial judge is of the view that the plaintiffs themselves had not made out their claim to the requisite standard, then no drawing of an adverse inference against the defendants is necessary. The drawing of an adverse inference, at least in civil cases, should not be used as a mechanism to shore up glaring deficiencies in the opposite party’s case, which on its own is unable to meet up to the requisite burden of proof. Rather, the procedure exists in order to render the case of the party against whom the inference is drawn weaker and thus less credible of belief.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">221 The Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Sudha Natrajan </span>stated at [20]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">20 The drawing of an adverse inference must therefore in the final analysis depend on the circumstances of each case, and it is not the position that in every situation in which a party fails to call a witness or give evidence, an adverse inference must be drawn against that party: see Ratanlal Ranchhoddas &amp; Dhirajlal Keshavlal Thakore, <span class="font-italic">Ratanlal</span><span class="font-italic"> &amp; Dhirajlal’s The Law of Evidence</span> (Wadhwa and Company Nagpur, 22nd Ed, 2006) at 1238. With specific regard to absent witnesses, broad principles governing the drawing of an adverse inference were set out in <span class="font-italic">Wisniewski v Central Manchester Health Authority</span> [1998] PIQR P324 (“<span class="font-italic">Wisniewski</span>”) and these principles were later endorsed by this court in <span class="font-italic">Thio</span><span class="font-italic"> Keng Poon v Thio Syn Pyn</span> [2010] 3 SLR 143 at [43]. They may be summarised as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(a)   In certain circumstances the court may be entitled to draw adverse inferences from the absence or silence of a witness who might be expected to have material evidence to give on an issue in the matter before it.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(b)   If the court is willing to draw such inferences, these may go to strengthen the evidence adduced on that issue by the other party or to weaken the evidence, if any, adduced by the party who might reasonably have been expected to call the witness.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(c)   There must, however, have been some evidence, even if weak, which was adduced by the party seeking to draw the inference, on the issue in question, before the court would be entitled to draw the desired inference: in other words, there must be a case to answer on that issue which is then strengthened by the drawing of the inference.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(d)   If the reason for the witness’s absence or silence can be explained to the satisfaction of the court, then no adverse inference may be drawn. If, on the other hand, a reasonable and credible explanation is given, even if it is not wholly satisfactory, the potentially detrimental effect of his/her absence or silence may be reduced or annulled.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">222 The plaintiffs’ argument appears to be that adverse inferences should be drawn due to the defendants’ failure to disclose their text messages with the other key persons involved in this suit and to call certain witnesses to testify. I am unable to agree with the plaintiffs. As the Court of Appeal stated in <span class="font-italic">Tribune Investments</span> at [50], where “the trial judge is of the view that the plaintiffs themselves had not made out their claim to the requisite standard, then no drawing of an adverse inference against the defendants is necessary”. Similarly, the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Sudha Natrajan </span>at [20(c)] stated that “there must be a case to answer on that issue which is then strengthened by the drawing of the inference”.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">223 In the present case, I find that save for their claims against Mr Cheong for breach of contract, the plaintiffs have failed to make out all their other claims to the requisite standard. There is no basis for the court to draw adverse inferences to bridge the gaps in the plaintiffs’ case by speculating what the evidence may be. Further, I am not satisfied that the plaintiffs are entirely accurate in their submission that there was “a conspicuous lack of discovered correspondence around the material time when Recruitbee Employment was being set up”,

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">Accordingly, I decline to draw any adverse inferences against the defendants.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">224 For completeness, I refer to the case of <span class="font-italic">Chan Pik Sun </span><span class="font-italic">v Wan Hoe Keet and others</span> [2023] SGHC 96 (“<span class="font-italic">Chan Pik Sun</span>”), which is a case cited by the plaintiffs in their submissions. One of the claims in <span class="font-italic">Chan Pik Sun</span> was, like the present suit, a claim in conspiracy. The plaintiff in <span class="font-italic">Chan Pik Sun </span>was a victim in a Ponzi scheme (<span class="font-italic">Chan Pik Sun </span>at [2]–[3]). She sued, amongst other persons, three earlier participants in the Ponzi scheme – Ken, Sally and Sebastian (<span class="font-italic">Chan Pik Sun </span>at [7]). Ken, Sally and Sebastian claimed that they had lost the messages they once had in their mobile phones when they changed their mobile phones (<span class="font-italic">Chan Pik Sun </span>at [158]). The learned Judge, at [159], agreed with the plaintiff that it was unusual for all the defendants to have changed their mobile phones without retaining the messages, and that it was too much of a coincidence for this loss of the messages to have occurred in the year after the Ponzi scheme’s collapse. The learned Judge found that it was more likely that one or more of the defendants deliberately did not keep the messages from the time they were involved in the Ponzi scheme. The plaintiff contended that the deleted messages would have shown that the defendants were conspirators, and the plaintiff invited the court to draw that inference (see [160]). The learned Judge, however, declined to draw an adverse inference and explained at [167]–[168] as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">167 In the present case, if I were to put to one side the issue of the missing messages, I would find that on the rest of the evidence Sandra has failed to prove the conspiracy she alleges. In the words of <span class="font-italic">Tribune Investment</span>, she has “not made out [her] claim to the requisite standard”, and her case, “on its own is unable to meet up to the requisite burden of proof”. In the circumstances, no drawing of an adverse inference against Ken, Sally, and Sebastian is necessary.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">168 If, however, Sandra’s case on the rest of the evidence does provide a foundation for the drawing of an adverse inference in relation to the missing messages, whether to draw such an inference – and what inference – still depends on the circumstances. As the court put it in <span class="font-italic">Sudha Natrajan v The Bank of East Asia Ltd</span> [2017] 1 SLR 141 at [23]: “s 116(g) does not afford the court the opportunity to speculate as to what the evidence may be without some basis for the drawing of the inference which the opposing party seeks to persuade the court to draw. That is, the court must put its mind to the manner in which the evidence that is not produced is said to be unfavourable when drawing the adverse inference under s 116(g).”  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">It is clear from <span class="font-italic">Chan Pik Sun </span>that an adverse inference cannot be drawn to assist the plaintiffs if the evidence adduced by them does not provide a foundation for the drawing of the adverse inference. In that case, the learned Judge declined to draw an adverse inference even though the circumstances under which the phone messages were lost were found to be unusual.   <span class="font-italic"> </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"> </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Remedies </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">225 The plaintiffs have succeeded in proving Mr Cheong’s breaches of contract. I must therefore consider the appropriate remedies to award.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">226 The Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Grains and Industrial Products Trading Pte Ltd v Bank of India and another </span>[2016] 3 SLR 1308 at [117] made the following observations on awarding damages: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">117 … It is well established that a plaintiff can only be awarded substantial damages if such damages have been proved; and that a court should award only nominal damages if adequate evidence of damages has not been properly adduced (see [<span class="font-italic">Lee Chee Wei v Tan </span><span class="font-italic">Hor Peow Victor</span> [2007] 3 SLR(R) 537] at [65]). We are of the view that this position is not to be lightly displaced by ordering a further assessment of damages in circumstances where the questions of liability and the quantification of damages have not been bifurcated at the trial because, otherwise, it would give a plaintiff a second bite at the proverbial cherry.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">227 In relation to proving damages, the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Biofuel Industries Pte Ltd v V8 Environmental Pte Ltd and another appeal</span> [2018] 2 SLR 199 at [41] held that a plaintiff must prove both the fact of damage and its amount. A plaintiff who fails to prove either the fact of damage or the quantum of its loss may be awarded nominal damages (at [44]). I have found at [45] above that Mr Cheong, through his involvement in the setting up and operations of Recruitbee Employment whilst employed by Swift Maids Pte Ltd, had breached his contractual duties owed to Swift Maids Pte Ltd. I have also found at [128] above that Mr Cheong was in breach of his contractual duties by virtue of his involvement in the Pixelate transactions. The plaintiffs have, however, not proved the loss or damages that they allegedly suffered as a result of Mr Cheong’s breaches of his employment contract and the quantum of damages, if any. In particular, aside from failing in the other causes of action against the defendants, it cannot be inferred from the evidence that Swift Maids would necessarily have secured the placements of the FDWs which were secured by Recruitbee. There is no evidence to show that Recruitbee’s business volume was causally linked to Swift Maids. Significantly, there is no evidence that Swift Maids’ business was re-directed or diverted to Recruitbee, or that Swift Maids suffered any loss due to any such re-direction or diversion. Further, no evidence has been adduced of the loss, if any at all, arising from the Pixelate transactions (see [129]–[130] above). Given that the plaintiffs have established neither the fact of damage nor the amount of damage, only nominal damages may be awarded to the plaintiffs. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">228 I mention for completeness that the plaintiffs have prayed for the remedies of an account of profits

</div> in their claims against Mr Cheong. The traditional remedy for a breach of contractual duties is that of contractual damages, which compensates the plaintiff for his or her loss: see <span class="font-italic">The Law of Contract in Singapore</span> at para 23.054. As noted by the learned contributors, while an account of profits for breach of contract is available in principle, it “remains to be seen … what facts <span class="font-italic">will </span>be sufficient” [emphasis in original] to warrant such a remedy: <span class="font-italic">The Law of Contract in Singapore </span>at para 23.064. Given that I have not been addressed on this issue nor referred to any authority, I find no basis to order an account of profits for Mr Cheong’s breaches of his employment contract. With respect to equitable compensation, there are also no submissions on why it is an appropriate remedy. As I have found that Mr Cheong did not owe fiduciary duties to Swift Maids, I similarly find no basis to order equitable compensation for Mr Cheong’s breaches of his employment contract.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">229 In the present suit, I award to the plaintiffs nominal damages of $1,000 for Mr Cheong’s involvement in the setting up and operations of Recruitbee Employment, and a further $1,000 for his involvement in the Pixelate transactions, in breach of his employment contract. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">230 This judgment is rendered based on the case as pleaded by the plaintiffs and what they can prove. It was apparent at trial that this suit was fuelled by a sense of betrayal and indignation, and the hard feelings were made more acute because the principal characters in this dispute had shared relationships outside of business and work. Mr Cheong had acted behind the back of his employer and breached his employment contract when he involved himself in the setting up and business of Recruitbee Employment while he was still under the employ of Swift Maids. The evidence, however, does not support a finding that he misused or disclosed the Confidential Information. The evidence also does not support a finding that Mr Cheong, either on his own or with the other defendants, acted to target and injure the plaintiffs’ business interests through unlawful means. Further, there is a lack of evidence to show what losses the plaintiffs suffered as a result of Mr Cheong’s breaches of contract. The court must decide based on the evidence placed before it, and it is at this fundamental hurdle that the plaintiffs have fallen short.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">231 In conclusion, I order Mr Cheong to pay to the first plaintiff the sum of $1,000 in nominal damages for his involvement in the setting up and operations of Recruitbee Employment, in breach of his employment contract with the first plaintiff.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">232 I order Mr Cheong to pay to the first plaintiff the sum of $1,000 in nominal damages for his involvement in the Pixelate transactions, in breach of his employment contract with the first plaintiff.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">233 I dismiss the plaintiffs’ claim against Mr Cheong for breach of fiduciary duties.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">234 I dismiss the plaintiffs’ claim against Mr Cheong for breach of confidence.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">235 I dismiss the plaintiffs’ claims against Mr Cheong for the wrongful transport claims and misappropriation of the payment of $8,190 to Ms Suliyani.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">236 I dismiss the plaintiffs’ claim against the defendants that is based on the tort of unlawful means conspiracy.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">237 I dismiss the plaintiffs’ claim against the second to fifth defendants for dishonest assistance.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">238 I will hear the parties on costs.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"></div><table class="table table-sm table-borderless"><tbody><tr><td><div class="txt-body text-left">Teh Hwee Hwee<br/>Judge of the High Court</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-left"></div></td></tr></tbody></table><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Noel John Geno-Oehlers and Chua Su Ann (Characterist LLC) for the plaintiffs;</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">The first defendant in person;</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">The second defendant absent and unrepresented;</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">The third defendant in person;</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Wong Jieh (Circular Law Chambers LLP) for the fourth defendant;</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">The fifth defendant absent and unrepresented. </div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
