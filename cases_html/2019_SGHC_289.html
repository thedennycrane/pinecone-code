In any event, RV1 alleged that the Waiver was a sham and a transaction at undervalue (or no value) which can be set aside by the Liquidators.

There was no explanation as to why RV1 did not, in the one month after becoming aware of the Waiver documents and DOT and before serving the Amended Writ on ICS, inform the court of these documents, which were material facts that could potentially have an adverse impact on RV1’s case. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 RV1’s counsel (Mr Chan) merely stated that they had not properly advised their client because they were unsure whether the Waiver documents were genuine. However, Mr Chan agreed that the weight to be given to such documents would have been for the court’s determination and did not affect RV1’s duty to disclose. Hence, that RV1 may have alleged that the Waiver was a sham or an undervalue transaction did not change the fact that the Waiver documents and DOT were material and should have been placed before the court. Even if ICS did not complain about RV1’s breach of continuing obligation of full and frank disclosure until three days before the hearing of SUM 383, this was irrelevant to RV1’s duty to make full and frank disclosure. Further, I failed to appreciate Mr Chan’s argument that ICS did not come to court with clean hands because it had concealed the existence of the Dakar proceedings and Dakar Default Judgment until after the latter was obtained.

First, Mr Chan asserted that the Sulphur Contracts were deemed to be performed when the goods were loaded at the port of loading – but none of the ports of loading were Singapore.

</div> Second, the Incoterms merely state that the seller must provide the goods and the commercial invoice <span class="font-italic">in conformity with the contract of sale</span>. The Incoterms do not support the contention that the Six Invoices are the Sulphur Contracts or that the issuing thereof was an essential step taken in Singapore resulting in the Sulphur Contracts. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) The place of issue of the Six Invoices did not necessarily bear a correlation to the place where the Sulphur Contracts were formed.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 Next, that the Six Invoices (and other documents) may have been issued in English is neutral, given that Singapore is hardly the only country having English as its principal language of commerce and given that English is the <span class="font-italic">lingua franca</span> of international business (<span class="font-italic">Pacific Recreation Pte Ltd v S Y Technology Inc and another appeal</span> [2008] 2 SLR(R) 491 (“<span class="font-italic">Pacific Recreation</span>”) at [38]). Finally, Mr Chan submitted that Senegal was not the place where the contract was made – but this is irrelevant to the analysis. RV1 must show a positive case that the contract was made in Singapore or made as a result of an essential step taken in Singapore. Even if the Sulphur Contracts were not made in Senegal, it did not therefore mean that they were made in Singapore and nowhere else. As Mr Chan asserted, the negotiations leading to the Sulphur Contracts could have been in Hong Kong (see [29] above).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">O 11 r 1(d)(iii)</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 Next, RV1 submitted that the Sulphur Contracts were by its terms, or by implication, governed by Singapore law. The Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Pacific Recreation</span> (at [36]) set out a three-stage test in determining the governing law of a contract. The first stage is to examine the contract to see if it states expressly what the governing law should be. In the absence of an express provision, the second stage is to see whether the intention of the parties as to the governing law can be inferred from the circumstances. If this cannot be done, the third stage is to determine with which system of law the contract has its most close and real connection. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 I am not satisfied that RV1 has shown a good arguable case in this regard. There was no written contract and hence no express terms of the governing law of the Sulphur Contracts. RV1 has also not been able to show me that the parties’ intent that Singapore law would be the governing law could be inferred from the circumstances, or that the system of law the Sulphur Contracts had its closest and most real connection was Singapore law. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 First, that Affert is a Singapore entity did not therefore point to the parties’ intent for Singapore law to be the governing law of the Sulphur Contracts, as the counterparty, ICS, is based in Senegal. Second, that English was the medium of the Six Invoices (and other documents) was inconclusive and neutral. Third, as for the bills of lading, Mr Chan agreed that there was no evidence that they were endorsed in Singapore or were all given to Affert in Singapore to be transmitted to ICS.

</div> Even if some of the bills of lading endorsed by the banks were sent by Affert to ICS, and hence showed that Affert had taken steps to ensure that the cargo was released to ICS, this did not alter my finding.

The DOT was signed by Syam in Singapore on Affert’s behalf, even if ICS and Transfert signed the DOT in Senegal and Dubai respectively.

</div> RV1 thus asserted that the parties to the DOT would not have intended Singapore law to govern the DOT if they had not also intended the Sulphur Contracts to be governed by Singapore law. In my view, it would be inappropriate to draw such an inference. The DOT was not part of the Sulphur Contracts and was executed <span class="font-italic">two to three years after</span> the Sulphur Contracts. The DOT related only to the Transfert cargo (whereas the Sulphur Contracts related to other cargoes as well) and was executed by Transfert, in addition to Affert and ICS, to govern their rights and obligations on the outstanding sums owing under the Sulphur Contracts long after the goods had been delivered. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 The ADA, STA and Side Letter, which RV1 sought to rely on to point to Singapore law as the governing law of the Sulphur Contracts, do not support RV1’s case.

</div> The Acquisition Documents were executed one to two years after the Sulphur Contracts and pertained to Indorama’s acquisition of shares in ICS, and which is not the subject matter of RV1’s claim in the Suit. In addition, the STA is expressly stated to be governed by Senegalese law with a jurisdiction clause in favour of the Senegal courts, and the ADA is expressly stated to be governed by English law with disputes to be resolved by arbitration with the seat of arbitration in London. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 As such, I could not infer from the circumstances the intention of the parties as to the governing law. Moving on to the third stage of the test in <span class="font-italic">Pacific Recreation</span>, I was of the view that, on balance, the law with the closest and most real connection to the Sulphur Contracts was Senegalese law. First, ICS had attested that the pre-contractual discussions or negotiations were between representatives of ICS (based in Senegal) and the Archean Group (based in India), and RV1 has not shown how Affert was involved in the negotiations. Second, the place of discharge of the cargo was Senegal and the cargo was delivered in Senegal. As for place of payment, Mr Chan agreed that all the partial payments made thus far of US$5,291,000 under the Six Invoices/Sulphur Contracts were to Affert’s account in Hong Kong.

</div> Hence, I find that Senegal bore a closer and more real connection to the Sulphur Contracts than Singapore. Even if the invoices were issued by Affert in Singapore, that is neither here nor there as they were issued after the contracts were formed, and Affert, being the seller of the sulphur had only one place of business (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, Singapore). Ultimately, the proper law of the contract must be ascertainable at the time the contract came into existence. As the court stated in <span class="font-italic">Pacific Recreation</span> at [48], the third stage aims to consider, on balance, which law has the most connection with the contract and the circumstances surrounding the <span class="font-italic">inception</span> of that contract.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 Finally, Mr Chan argued that O 11 r 1(<span class="font-italic">d</span>)(iii) is fulfilled as the key issue is whether the Waiver should be set aside, and the law on setting aside the Waiver is Singapore law pursuant to the Liquidators’ powers under the Companies Act (Cap 50, 2006 Rev Ed) (“Companies Act”) and/or Bankruptcy Act (Cap 20, 2009 Rev Ed) (“Bankruptcy Act”).

</div> This misses the point. The application to set aside the Waiver as an undervalue transaction is the Liquidators’ sole preserve.

The parties’ arguments centred on whether there was any obligation to be performed in Singapore for there to be a breach committed in Singapore.

</div> ICS argued that as the previous partial payments were made by ICS to Affert’s bank account with the Bank of India in Hong Kong, this clearly demonstrated that the parties had in their course of dealings agreed or intended for ICS’s payment obligations to be performed in Hong Kong.

Where no place of payment is provided by the contract, the court looks at whether a term can be implied from the circumstances and course of dealing between the parties. If not, the rule that the debtor must seek out his creditor at the creditor’s place of business and pay him there would apply (see, <span class="font-italic">eg</span>, <span class="font-italic">The Eider</span> [1893] P 119 at 129; <span class="font-italic">Bell &amp; Co v Antwerp, London and Brazil Line</span> [1891] 1 QB 103 (“<span class="font-italic">Bell &amp; Co</span>”) at 106–107;<span class="font-italic"> </span><span class="font-italic">Komaia Deccof and Co SA and others v Perusahaan Pertambangan Minyik dan Gas Bumi Negara</span> [1982] HKCA 253 (“<span class="font-italic">Komaia Deccof</span>”) at [9] and [12]).

However, it could not be said that the circumstances or course of dealings showed that ICS’s payment obligation for the ICS Debt was Hong Kong instead of Singapore, or that Affert was only entitled to be paid in Hong Kong in respect of the ICS Debt. This is even if, as Mr Lim submitted, Affert would, at the material time, seem to have no other employees besides Syam and Vandana Bounsle (“Vandana”) and that Affert’s affairs were conducted by representatives of the Archean Group.

The contract between the parties did not expressly provide where the plaintiff would be paid. The English Court of Appeal held that from the contract, the implication was that the plaintiff would be paid at Newcastle where he generally carried on business and the plaintiff had a right to be paid there. This was even though the plaintiff had spent some time in Spain to superintend the construction of the docks. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 In <span class="font-italic">Drexel v Drexel</span> [1916] 1 Ch 251 (“<span class="font-italic">Drexel</span>”), the plaintiff wife and defendant husband were Americans who married in America and then went to reside in England where their children were educated. Subsequently the parties separated, and while they still lived in England, the defendant was connected with a banking business in America and paid short visits to America. They executed a deed of separation (prepared by American lawyers), signed by the plaintiff in England and the defendant in America, where the husband agreed to pay the wife an allowance by monthly instalments. At the time the plaintiff issued a writ against the defendant to enforce the deed, the latter was domiciled in France. The court held that the allowance was payable to her wherever she might be living and that she had a right to be paid in England if she so desired. This was even though there was an arrangement for payment to be made to the wife on an American bank and even if the American payments had gone on for years. The court (at 260) stated that what it had to consider was “not what was done, but what the plaintiff had a right to have done under the terms of the agreement”. Whilst <span class="font-italic">Drexel</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>pertains to payment of maintenance, the authority and general proposition (at [41] above) are no less applicable to a contract of services or goods as in the present case. The payment in <span class="font-italic">Drexel </span>was nevertheless premised on a contract (the deed of separation) and pertains to where a person is legally entitled to be paid. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 In <span class="font-italic">Komaia Deccof</span>, the plaintiffs had received payments in New York from the defendant. The High Court (in <span class="font-italic">Komala Deccof &amp; Co SA and others v Perusahaan Pertambangan Minyik dan Gas Bumi Negara (Pertamina)</span> [1981] HKCFI 89 at [13] and [15]) found ample evidence for a set practice of payment to the second plaintiff in New York, and settlements between the defendant and the first and second plaintiffs were that payments were wholly or mainly outside Hong Kong. The Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Komaia Deccof</span> held at [14], that the “receipt and acceptance of money in country A is not necessarily inconsistent with an obligation to pay in country B”, and found that the plaintiffs had a place of business in Hong Kong and were entitled to be paid there.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 ICS cited a number of cases, but they essentially turn on the facts. For instance, in <span class="font-italic">Comber v Leyland and Bullins</span> [1898] AC 524, the defendant (who carried on business in Brazil) was to hold the moneys for the plaintiffs in Brazil and to turn it to bank bills to remit to the plaintiffs. The House of Lords held (at 530–531 and 534) that the defendant’s obligation was to be performed in Brazil, that his obligation ceased when he sent the bank bills from Brazil and that there was no obligation incumbent on him until the bank bills reached the plaintiffs in England. The relevant documents appeared to expressly provide, as regards the place of performance of the contract, that putting bank bills named in the post in the foreign country was to be the performance of the contract. Hence all that the defendant had to do was done in Brazil, and as such, the plaintiffs’ application to serve the writ out of jurisdiction under the equivalent of O 11 r 1(<span class="font-italic">e</span>) of the ROC failed. In <span class="font-italic">Cuban Atlantic Sugar Sales Corporation v Compania De Vapores San Elefterio Limitada</span> [1960] 1 QB 187, the English Court of Appeal found (at 193–195) that the contract could be performed in the UK or elsewhere, that until the nomination of a port had been made, it could not be said that there was a contract to be performed within the UK, and that there was no breach within the UK because the time of nomination never arrived. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 As such, I find that RV1 has made out a good arguable case under O 11 r 1(<span class="font-italic">e</span>) of the ROC.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Effect of the Waiver</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 I go on to consider the Waiver, which is ICS’s defence to the ICS Debt, to determine if RV1’s claim has a sufficient degree of merit.

In reply, ICS submitted that it had provided good consideration to Affert, and there was no requirement for mutual promises to be made between the promisor and promisee and no requirement for there to be a request to pay a third party.

</div> Whilst Affert’s 7 October 2014 Letter was addressed to ICS, it is unclear that Affert negotiated <span class="font-italic">with ICS</span> for the Waiver. Affert’s 7 October 2014 Letter addressed to ICS came about in negotiations between Syam (of Affert) and Munish Jindal (of Indorama) (see Affert’s 1 October 2014 Email), and was sent by Syam to Munish Jindal and not to ICS. It is not apparent that ICS had a mutual agreement with Affert in relation to the Waiver or what counter-promise <span class="font-italic">ICS</span> made <span class="font-italic">to Affert</span>, even if there was consideration that flowed to another party and not to Affert. Further, whilst the DOT was signed by ICS and Affert (and Transfert), this was not the Waiver (it being executed some six months after the Waiver documents), and hence could not be relied on by ICS to show any counter-promise on its part for the Waiver.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 Even if there was no issue as to the legal validity of the Waiver, there is force to RV1’s assertion that the Waiver was a sham. RV1 had referred to Vandana’s answers to a questionnaire in examination of judgment debtor proceedings initiated by Solvadis against Affert, wherein Vandana (as director of Affert) confirmed that the ICS Debt was due and payable by ICS (“Vandana’s affidavit”). Vandana’s affidavit was affirmed on 26 October 2015, more than a year after the Waiver documents, and seven months after the DOT was executed.

</div> Vandana’s evidence would cast doubt on the Waiver documents. In this regard, it is pertinent to note that ICS did not, in its affidavit in reply, address RV1’s assertion above or Vandana’s affidavit, but merely stated that it disagreed with “RV1’s totally baseless and quite incredible accusations … that ICS was “acting in concert” with Affert’s former directors ([Syam] and [Vandana]) in matters concerning the Waiver.”

The Liquidators have appealed against the Dakar Default Judgment and the matter is currently before the Dakar Court of Appeal.

ICS had left the summons with the Public Prosecutor’s Office of Senegal (“Senegal PP”), which the Senegal PP was to forward to the Senegal Ministry of Justice which would in turn forward it to the Senegal Ministry of Foreign Affairs (“MFA”) which would then forward it to the Singapore MFA for the purposes of effecting service on Affert in Singapore. Mr Houda, ICS’s expert, opined that ICS’s service on the Senegal PP constituted proper service on Affert, whereas RV1’s Senegalese lawyer, Mr Kebe, stated that service of the summons would be satisfied only when the Singapore MFA serves the summons on Affert. Whilst I do not make a determination on the matter, there is merit in Mr Kebe’s view as the Senegal PP may never forward the summons onwards. Indeed, both Mr Chan and Mr Lim were unable to inform me where the summons currently is or whether it has even reached the Singapore MFA.

Additionally, the Waiver set out in Affert’s 7 October 2014 Letter had Affert’s letterhead with its Singapore address, and hence it was likely signed in Singapore. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) The DOT referred to a Settlement Agreement dated 7 May 2014, entered into among ICS, Affert and Transfert (see further at [65] below), which expressly stated that it would be governed by Singapore law and subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Singapore courts.<span style="color: rgba(0,176,240,1)"> </span></div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) The DOT and Waiver documents were entered into by Affert’s directors without any consideration to Affert and amounted to a breach of their duties as directors of a Singapore company.

RV1 asserted that the governing law is Singapore law whereas ICS asserted it is Senegalese law. In this regard, there was no express choice of law in relation to the Waiver, and thus the court looks at whether the intention of the parties as to the governing law can be inferred from the circumstances. If not, the court determines which system of law the Waiver has its closest and most real connection. I find that the law governing the Waiver is Singapore law and not Senegalese law. Based on the circumstances, the intention of the parties must have been for the governing law of the Waiver to be Singapore law, and even if that was not the case, I would have found that the system of law the Waiver had its closest and most real connection with is Singapore law.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 The Waiver documents themselves point towards Singapore law, and not Senegalese law, as the governing law. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Affert’s 1 October 2014 Email was sent by Syam from his Singapore email account to Indorama’s Munish Jindal – Indorama is incorporated in the Netherlands.

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> The Letter was written on Affert’s letterhead bearing Affert’s Singapore address. Again, ICS was not in the picture. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) The Waiver is <span class="font-italic">given by and emanated from</span> Affert, and related to Affert’s act of waiving the ICS Debt owed to it. It cannot be seriously suggested that Affert (a company incorporated in Singapore, and was the one giving the waiver in relation to the ICS Debt that was owed to it) would have intended the Waiver to be governed by Senegalese law. It was more likely that the intention was for the Waiver to be governed by Singapore law. In any event, the Waiver documents came about from Affert’s communication with Indorama (not ICS) and even Affert’s 7 October 2014 Letter was sent to Indorama. Indeed, ICS did not execute the Waiver documents.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 Next, I turn to the DOT, executed by Transfert, Affert and ICS. The DOT, which explicitly referred to the Waiver and a Settlement Agreement (also between Transfert, Affert and ICS) (“SA”), was relied on by ICS to support the validity of the Waiver, and is thus closely connected to the Waiver documents. The SA was executed on 7 May 2014, whereby Affert and ICS jointly agreed to pay Transfert for a batch of sulphur (which formed one of the Six Invoices). The purport of the DOT was to render full and final settlement of all claims among Transfert, Affert and ICS in connection with the SA. Essentially the DOT terminated the SA, and also reiterated that “Affert had confirmed in [Affert’s 7 October 2014 Letter] to ICS that they have no further claim on ICS for any amounts whatsoever.” Whilst the DOT was executed after the Waiver documents, the SA preceded the Waiver documents. The SA stated Singapore law as the governing law with the SA subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Singapore courts. The governing law of the DOT was also expressly stated to be Singapore law and any disputes arising from the DOT was to be resolved by arbitration seated in Singapore and under the SIAC Rules. Whilst Syam was purported to be based in Hong Kong, he signed the DOT in Singapore. Given the inter-relation among the Waiver documents with the DOT and SA, the latter two being expressly governed by Singapore law, it was more likely than not that the Waiver was also intended to be similarly governed by Singapore law.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 As for the Acquisition Documents, they did not support ICS’s position that the Waiver was intended to be governed by Senegalese law or had its closest and most real connection with Senegal. Whilst the STA was expressly stated to be governed by Senegalese law, the ADA was expressly stated to be governed by English law with disputes to be resolved by arbitration unde the LCIA Rules with the seat of arbitration in London. The Side Letter did not state an express governing law or jurisdiction clause, but explicitly referred to the ADA (which is governed by English law). Hence, even if the Waiver was part of the overall consideration of the Acquisition as Mr Lim asserted, the fact is that not <span class="font-italic">all</span> of the Acquisition Documents point to Senegalese law as the governing law. Pertinently, both Affert (who had given the Waiver documents) and ICS were not parties to the Acquisition Documents. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 As such, I find that the governing law of the Waiver was intended to be Singapore law, alternatively it had its closest and most real connection with Singapore law. As ICS’s defence is that the Waiver had extinguished the ICS Debt, the law of the Waiver is a significant factor in favour of Singapore.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">OS 544 – Liquidators’ application to set aside Waiver</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 The Liquidators have applied by OS 544 to set aside the Waiver as an undervalue transaction and filed an application in Senegal to set aside the Dakar Default Judgment. It is not disputed that the Liquidators’ application to set aside the Waiver as an undervalue transaction is exclusive to them, subject to the Singapore court’s jurisdiction and governed by Singapore law. The effect of the Waiver as ICS’s defence in the Suit is a crucial issue and closely related to the Liquidators’ application to set aside the Waiver. This must also be seen in the light of RV1’s claim that the Waiver is a sham transaction. As such, the Singapore court’s decision in relation to the Waiver in OS 544 would potentially have a material bearing on ICS’s defence in the Suit. Hence, that there are proceedings in relation to the setting aside of the Waiver which can only be brought in Singapore, is another factor in support of Singapore as the forum for the trial of the dispute in relation to the ICS Debt. This is coupled with my finding that the law which the Waiver has its closest and most real connection with is Singapore law. Whilst OS 544 has been stayed pending the final determination of the Senegelese proceedings, this did not make a difference to my analysis as the Liquidators have appealed against the stay order.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Place of breach of Sulphur Contracts </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 I had earlier found that ICS’s payment obligation to Affert for the ICS Debt was in Singapore. Given that RV1’s claim against ICS is for the failure to pay the ICS Debt resulting in a breach of the Sulphur Contracts, the breach of the Sulphur Contracts occurring in Singapore would be a connecting factor that tilts the balance in favour of Singapore as the proper forum for the trial of the dispute. This was a factor that was considered to be relevant in <span class="font-italic">Zoom Communications</span>. That said, this factor is not as strong as the factors pertaining to the law of the Waiver and the proceedings brought by the Liquidators to set aside the Waiver (as discussed above), given that ICS does not seem to be disputing the existence or validity of the ICS Debt but essentially claiming that the debt had been extinguished by the Waiver. Nevertheless taking the dispute as a whole – the place of breach of the Sulphur Contracts, coupled with the law governing the Waiver and whether the Waiver was an undervalue transaction that could have an impact on ICS’s defence to the ICS Debt – would significantly tilt the balance in favour of Singapore. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Dakar proceedings and Dakar Default Judgment</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 ICS submitted that the Dakar proceedings have progressed to an advanced stage and the Senegalese courts have assumed jurisdiction of the dispute on the Waiver with the Liquidators having appealed against the Dakar Default Judgment. It also submitted that there were common facts and issues in the Suit and the Dakar proceedings and a risk of conflicting decisions if they were heard in two separate jurisdictions. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">71 Where there appears to be related or parallel proceedings, the factors to be considered would include the degree to which the respective proceedings have advanced, the degree of overlap of issues and parties, and the risk of conflicting judgments (<span class="font-italic">Virsagi Management (S) Pte Ltd v Welltech Construction Pte Ltd and another appeal</span> [2013] 4 SLR 1097 (“<span class="font-italic">Virsagi Management</span>”) at [39]–[40]). Whilst ICS may have obtained the Dakar Default Judgment which pertained to a common issue in the Suit (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the Waiver), I find that this was not a factor that weighed significantly in favour of Senegal being the more appropriate forum. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">72 First, I am not convinced that the proceedings in the Dakar courts are at such an advanced stage to tilt the balance towards Senegal. The Dakar Default Judgment was obtained <span class="font-italic">in default of appearance</span>, and it is not disputed that neither Affert, the Liquidators nor RV1 was actually notified of the summons. Thus, they could not have challenged the merits of the case in the first instance at the Dakar courts until the Liquidators filed an appeal in June 2019 against the Dakar Default Judgment. Whilst the parties to the Senegalese proceedings have filed submissions in the Senegalese court, the court has yet to render a decision and in any case, there is a further avenue of appeal.

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">73 In <span class="font-italic">Virsagi Management</span>, the Court of Appeal stated (at [39]) that the advanced stage of proceedings may be disregarded if the proceedings had been deliberately advanced at the instance of the party seeking to rely on this as a factor, and little or no weight will be given to the fact that there are foreign proceedings if they are commenced for strategic reasons to bolster the case of a clearly more appropriate forum elsewhere. There is merit in Mr Chan’s submissions as to the <span class="font-italic">bona fides</span> of ICS in applying for the stay application, and I find that the Dakar proceedings were commenced and advanced to bolster ICS’s case of a more appropriate forum in Senegal. The Dakar proceedings were commenced shortly after the Amended Writ was served on ICS and ICS entered appearance. The summons and Dakar proceedings were never brought to the attention of Affert, the Liquidators or RV1, until after the Dakar Default Judgment was obtained. This is in contrast to RV1 having been informed <span class="font-italic">directly</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>of the Waiver and DOT when ICS’s Senegalese lawyers corresponded <span class="font-italic">with RV1</span> on ICS’s debt due to Affert (via ICS’s 10 October 2018 Letter), and of the Dakar Default Judgment by ICS’s Singapore lawyers (see [14] above). Even when ICS filed SUM 383 to set aside the Amended Writ and service of it, it did not mention nor disclose the Dakar proceedings in the supporting affidavit despite ICS’s basis for SUM 383 being that the Singapore court had no jurisdiction and alternatively that Singapore was not the proper forum for the dispute. This is given that the validity of the Waiver was a central argument in ICS’s claim in SUM 383, as seen from its extensive elaboration of the Waiver and the background to it when it filed the supporting affidavit for SUM 383. Coupled with ICS’s assertion that service on the Senegal PP alone constituted proper service on Affert, I could not but infer that ICS was attempting to conceal the Senegalese proceedings from Affert, RV1 or the Liquidators until it obtained the Dakar Default Judgment.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">74 Further, I am of the view that whatever the decision of the Dakar appellate court may be, this will not lead to a significant risk of conflicting judgments. The parties do not dispute the validity of the Sulphur Contracts, the ICS Debt or that the Waiver was given by RV1. The dispute in the Suit centres on the validity of the Waiver<span class="font-italic"> </span>and its legal effect. Whilst the validity of the Waiver is also the issue in the Dakar proceedings, Mr Lim has stated that ICS is not merely relying on the Waiver as a defence to the ICS Debt in the Suit, but intends to raise other defences. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">75 Moreover, that the Singapore and Dakar courts may arrive at different results in relation to the validity or effect of the Waiver must also be considered in the light that the Singapore courts may apply Singapore law to the Waiver (as opposed to the Dakar courts applying Senegalese law) in the substantive hearing of the dispute pertaining to the ICS Debt, and the potential outcome of the Liquidators’ application to set aside the Waiver as an undervalue transaction in OS 544. As such, the fact that there were proceedings in Senegal is not a factor that weighs significantly in favour of Senegal being the more appropriate forum.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Other factors</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">76 Next, I consider the factors below to be neutral or evenly balanced.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Parties’ place of incorporation, place of transaction and performance of Sulphur Contracts</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">77 I find that the place of transaction and<span class="font-italic"> </span>the performance of the Sulphur Contracts are neutral factors. Whether or not Affert played a substantial role in the procurement of the Sulphur Contracts (which ICS asserted that it did not) or that the law with the most connection to the Sulphur Contracts was Senegalese law was neutral. There was no dispute as to the validity of the Sulphur Contracts or that they were performed or that the ICS Debt would have been due but for the Waiver defence. Mr Lim also agreed that the place of discharge of the cargo, being Senegal, was a neutral factor.

</div> Likewise that the Six Invoices bore Affert’s Singapore address is neutral.

Even if ICS intends to call witnesses who negotiated the Acquisition and Waiver and who were involved in the sulphur transactions, these witnesses were not all based in Senegal. Whilst ICS intends to call Neeraj Gupta (a director of ICS) and Diallo who are based in Senegal, it also intends to call Manish Mundra (a director of ICS), Munish Jindal and one Anil Kumar who are all based in Nigeria.

</div>
</div>
</div> In either case, any suit on the Six Invoices would now be time-barred in Senegal. To rely on the time-bar factor, the plaintiff must show that it did not act unreasonably in failing to commence proceedings within time in the alternative forum, such as by issuing a protective writ there (<span class="font-italic">The Jian He</span> [1999] 3 SLR(R) 432 at [33], and <span class="font-italic">Vinmar Overseas (Singapore) Pte Ltd v PTT International Trading Pte Ltd</span> [2018] 2 SLR 1271 at [141]). Whilst those cases involved a foreign jurisdiction agreement, the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">MAN</span><span class="font-italic"> Diesel </span>at [162]<span class="font-italic"> </span>has applied this principle in the context of leave applications where no such agreement exists.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">83 The Six Invoices were issued between May 2012 and June 2013. Having issued the Waiver in October 2014, Affert would not have been expected to commence proceedings in relation to payments under the Sulphur Contracts. It was only when Affert had placed itself in voluntary winding up on 8 February 2017 that its then liquidators FKT, presumably not knowing about the Waiver, sent a letter of demand to ICS for the ICS Debt. At that date, the Six Invoices had not expired on the five-year limitation period in Senegal, although it would have expired if the limitation period was two years.

</div> Nevertheless, FKT did not commence any defensive proceedings in Senegal (despite having seen fit to send a letter of demand to ICS), and no reasons were provided for this.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">84 When Affert was compulsorily wound up on 18 September 2017, the Liquidators sent a letter of demand to ICS on 26 September 2017 to recover the ICS Debt. By then, the Liquidators knew of the Six Invoices and the ICS Debt, but they did not commence any defensive proceedings in Senegal or explain why it did not do so. This is even on the basis that if the longer five-year limitation period in Senegal applied, the time bar would have yet to be engaged in relation to at least three of the Six Invoices.

</div> The Liquidators, being the original plaintiff in the Suit, has not explained how it had acted reasonably in this regard. That RV1 subsequently became the assignee of the ICS Debt did not change the analysis. It was incumbent on RV1 to conduct due diligence before it entered into the Deed of Assignment with Affert/the Liquidators and weigh the possible risks of taking the assignment. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">85 As such, RV1 cannot rely on the unavailability of Senegal (as the alternative forum to pursue the dispute) to tilt the balance to Singapore.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Conclusion on forum conveniens and leave for service out of jurisdiction</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">86 In the round, the law governing the Waiver, that the Liquidators of Affert (being under compulsory liquidation) have applied to set aside the Waiver as an undervalue transaction, and the place of the breach of the Sulphur Contracts, would point towards Singapore as the proper forum for the trial of the dispute of the Six Invoices and ICS Debt. I did not find the Dakar proceedings to tilt the balance to Senegal, and other factors were neutral or balanced. As ICS’s main defence is that the Waiver had extinguished the ICS Debt, the proper law of the Waiver would be a material consideration. Having found Singapore to be the more appropriate forum, ICS’s challenge on the basis that Singapore is <span class="font-italic">forum non conveniens</span> would fail.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">87 Hence, I find RV1’s claim came within the scope of O 11 r 1(<span class="font-italic">e</span>) of the ROC, that its claim has a sufficient degree of merit and that Singapore is the <span class="font-italic">forum conveniens</span>. I thus exercise my discretion to grant RV1 leave to serve the Amended Writ out of jurisdiction, even though I found that RV1 had not disclosed the Waiver documents and DOT to the court after obtaining the Leave Order when it should have done so. That said, I turn to whether a case management stay should be granted.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Case management stay</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">88 A claimant has the right to choose its cause of action and to sue the party it wishes to sue in whichever forum it wishes. This fundamental right is subject to other higher-order concerns that warrants its derogation. Further, for case management concerns to be relevant at all, there must be the existence or a real risk of overlapping issues (<span class="font-italic">Rex International Holding Ltd and another v Gulf Hibiscus Ltd </span>[2019] SGCA 56 (“<span class="font-italic">Rex International</span>”) at [9] and [11]). Pursuant to s 18 of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act (Cap 322, 2007 Rev Ed) read with para 9 of the First Schedule, and also under the inherent jurisdiction of the court, the court has the full discretion to stay any proceedings before it (<span class="font-italic">Chan Chin Cheung v Chan Fatt Cheung</span><span class="font-italic"> and others</span> [2010] 1 SLR 1192 at [47]). The underlying concern is the need to ensure the efficient and fair resolution of the dispute (<span class="font-italic">BNP Paribas Wealth Management v Jacob Agam and another </span>[2017] 3 SLR 27 (“<span class="font-italic">BNP Paribas</span>”) at [35]). The factors that may be considered by the court in the exercise of its discretion have been set out in various cases (see <span class="font-italic">BNP Paribas</span> at [34]) which bears no repeating.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">89 I had found that the Dakar proceedings are not at such an advanced stage. Further, the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Rex International</span> (at [11]) stated that the overlapping issues that would attract a case management stay is one where the proper ventilation of the issues depended on the resolution of the issues in the other forum, which I do not find to be the case here. Whilst there was some overlap in the Singapore and Dakar proceedings on the issue of the validity of the Waiver, I had found that there would not be a significant risk of conflicting judgments. In any event, the application to set aside the Waiver as an undervalue transaction (an issue that may affect the Waiver and ICS’s defence in the dispute) can only be brought by the Liquidators in the Singapore courts. As for the principle of international comity, this works both ways, especially given that I have found Singapore to be the proper forum to hear the dispute (see <span class="font-italic">BNP Paribas </span>at [53] and [54]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">90 Finally, the Suit was commenced and the Amended Writ served on ICS, even before ICS commenced the Senegalese proceedings which led to the Dakar Default Judgment. I had found that the Dakar proceedings (which were not brought to the attention of Affert, the Liquidators or RV1 at the material time) were brought and advanced to bolster ICS’s case of a more appropriate forum in Senegal. The <span class="font-italic">bona fides</span> of ICS’s stay application would be a relevant consideration in the exercise of my discretion whether to grant a case management stay.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">91 For the reasons above, I would not exercise my discretion to grant a case management stay. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">92 In conclusion, RV1’s appeal in RA 179 is allowed.
