<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       This was an appeal by the plaintiff/appellant,
                    Nalini D/O Ramachandran Mrs. Saseedaran Nair (“the Wife”) against
                    the decision of the District Judge on 12 November 2009 dismissing the
                    Wife’s application and allowing the application of the
                    defendant/respondent, Saseedaran Nair S/O Krishnan (“the
                    Husband”). Both applications related to a consent order made on
                    22 January 2008. I dismissed the Wife’s appeal but varied the
                    District Judge’s order.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Background</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The parties’ matrimonial home was a
                    Housing and Development Board (“HDB”) flat in Bukit Batok East
                    Avenue 3 (“the Property”). The Wife’s appeal related
                    essentially to the Property although she also sought to vary the terms
                    concerning the two children’s maintenance before me.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       The parties were married on 14 March 1990
                    and their marriage was dissolved on 27 February 2007. On 22 January
                    2008, they settled all ancillary matters at mediation before a district judge
                    and a consent order was made accordingly (“the consent order”). A
                    certificate making the interim judgment final was granted on 9 March 2008.
                    Under the consent order, the parties had joint custody of the two children aged
                    11 and 13, with care and control given to the Wife and reasonable access given
                    to the Husband every weekend. The Husband agreed to pay the Wife a nominal $1
                    per month as her maintenance and $300 per month for each of the two children.
                    The following orders were also made by consent:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">5.    [The Property] shall be sold in the open market
                            within 4 months from the date hereof, and after reimbursement of the
                            outstanding HDB mortgage loan, and the parties’ respective CPF
                            accounts of such monies utilised by the parties for the purchase of the
                            said flat together with accrued interest, and the incidental expenses
                            and costs of the sale, the net proceeds, if any, shall be divided in the
                            proportion of 60% to the [Wife] and 40% to the [Husband].</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">6.    The [Wife] shall have the option to purchase the
                            [Husband’s] rights title and interest in the Property within the
                            aforesaid 4 months period by payment to the [Husband] of such amounts as
                            he would have been entitled to (including reimbursement to his
                            CPF’s account of such monies, with accrued interest, utilised by
                            him in the purchase of the Property) had the Property been sold in the
                            open market in accordance with Order 5 above.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">7.    Liberty to apply.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       In or around September 2007, the Husband sought
                    medical attention for his visual problems. Subsequently, on 13 February
                    2008 (<em>i.e</em>. after the consent order was made), it
                    was confirmed that he was suffering from Leber Hereditary Optic Neuropathy, a
                    condition which left him with very poor vision in his eyes.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       He was covered under the Home Protection
                    Insurance Scheme (“HPIS”) established by the Central Provident
                    Fund Board (“CPF Board”) pursuant to section 29 of the
                    Central Provident Fund Act (Cap 36, 2001 Rev Ed) (“CPF
                    Act”). The HPIS provided that on his death or incapacity, his liability
                    to repay his housing loan shall be discharged by the CPF. Therefore, on
                    15 July 2008, he applied to the CPF Board for a payout due to his
                    disability. On 16 December 2008, he was certified to be legally blind. On
                    26 December 2008, pursuant to the HPIS, the CPF Board paid a sum of money
                    to the HDB to discharge the outstanding housing loan on the Property. Various
                    amounts were stated in the documents but the amount paid to the HDB was later
                    confirmed to be $165,922.60 (“the HPIS payout”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       Subsequently, the Wife decided against buying
                    over the Husband’s share in the Property. In November 2008, the Wife asked
                    that the Property be sold in the open market. The Husband informed her that he
                    might lose his eyesight and proposed that she transfer her title in the Property
                    to him upon him reimbursing her CPF money used for the purchase of the Property
                    together with accrued interest. Negotiations then took place between the
                    parties. In February 2009, the Husband spoke to the Wife and told her that the
                    CPF Board had paid the outstanding loan on the Property to the HDB under the
                    HPIS. He then proposed that $20,000 be paid by him to the Wife in addition to
                    what he had offered her earlier. After asking for time to consider the proposal,
                    the Wife did not revert to the Husband.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       On 18 June 2009, the Wife filed an
                    application for her to have sole conduct of the sale of the Property, for the
                    Husband to vacate it within one month and for the Registrar of the Subordinate
                    Courts to be conferred the power to execute all documents in respect of the sale
                    of the Property on the Husband’s behalf should he fail or refuse to do so.
                    On 10 September 2009, the Husband applied for increased access to the two
                    children and variation to the consent order pertaining to the sale of the
                    Property. One of his prayers was for an order enabling him to buy over the
                    Wife’s share in the Property upon him refunding the Wife’s CPF money
                    used for the Property together with accrued interest and paying her $20,000. In
                    the alternative, the Husband asked for the following order:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The [Wife] to transfer all her right, interest and title to the flat to
                        the [Husband] upon the [Husband] refunding the [Wife’s] CPF moneys
                        with accrued interest to the [Wife’s] CPF account. The [Husband] shall
                        pay a sum being 60% of the net value of the flat to the [Wife] which net
                        value shall be calculated by deducting from the price of the flat fixed at
                        $460,000.00, both parties’ CPF monies as at date of transfer of the
                        flat together with accrued interest and after deducting the [HPIS payout]
                        and the sum of $43,000 being the cash payment made by the [Husband] towards
                        the purchase of the flat. The [Husband] shall bear the costs of the
                        transfer. The transfer of the flat to be completed within six (6) weeks from
                        the date of this Order of Court.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">He also prayed for an order declaring him to be solely entitled to the
                    HPIS payout.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       After hearing both applications together, the
                    District Judge dismissed the Wife’s application and varied the consent
                    order to give the Husband more liberal access to the two children. In respect of
                    the Property, she ordered that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The [Wife] shall transfer her rights, title and interest to the flat to
                        the [Husband] upon the [Husband] refunding the [Wife’s] CPF monies
                        with accrued interest to the [Wife’s] CPF account and also payment by
                        the [Husband] to the [Wife] of a sum equivalent to 60% of the value of the
                        flat after deducting both parties’ CPF monies used for the flat as at
                        the date of transfer together with accrued interest and after deducting [the
                        HPIS payout]. The value of the flat shall be based on the valuation done by
                        the Housing Development Board. The transfer to be done within three (3)
                        months from the date of the HDB valuation.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The District Judge made no order as to costs in respect of both
                    applications.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       Dissatisfied with the District Judge’s
                    decision, the Wife filed the present appeal.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The issues and the arguments</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     There were two main issues on appeal:</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(a)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">whether it was right to order a variation of the
                            consent order; and</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(b)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">if so, whether the varied orders were just and
                            equitable.</div>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     The Wife contended that the consent order
                    should not have been varied because there was no material change in the
                    circumstances of either party since the time the consent order was made.
                    Further, the Wife contended that the varied order was unjust and inequitable as
                    it accorded the benefit of the HPIS payout entirely to the Husband. The Husband
                    contended that there were material changes in circumstances consequential to his
                    blindness and that the orders were just and equitable because the HPIS payout
                    was intended to compensate him for his blindness and therefore did not fall
                    within the ambit of matrimonial assets.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Whether it was right to order a variation of the consent order </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     Section 112(4) of the Women’s
                    Charter (Cap 353, 2009 Rev Ed) (“the Charter”) provides
                    that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">This court may, at any time it thinks fit, extend, vary, revoke, or
                        discharge any order made under this section, and may vary any term or
                        condition upon or subject to which any such order has been made.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     Both parties accepted that s 112(4)
                    leaves the court with the discretion to vary the consent order and the court may
                    vary the terms of a consent order in the event that there was material change in
                    circumstances. In my view, this is correct. It is true that an order of division
                    is usually a one-off order and, subject to appeal, is not of a continuing nature
                    as to permit variation (Leong Wai Kum, <em>Principles of Family
                        Law in Singapore</em>, Butterworths Asia 1997 Ed at page 910; cited in
                        <em>Lee Kok Yong v Lee Guek Hua (alias Li Yuehua)</em>
                    [2007] SGHC 26 at [16]). However, this does not mean that the court
                    cannot vary an order where it is appropriate to do so, as is the case here where
                    the Property has not been sold or otherwise dealt with yet. In a District Court
                    decision, <em>CT v CU</em> [2004] SGDC 164, the
                    District Judge held that parties would be able to apply to the court for a
                    variation of a court order under s 112(4) of the Charter at least in those
                    situations where the court order was unworkable or did not provide for a
                    particular situation or contingency which had subsequently arisen. I
                    agree.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     A consent order for division of matrimonial
                    assets should not be as easily revised as an order made without incorporating
                    the spouses’ prior agreement (see Leong Wai Kum, <em>Elements of Family Law in Singapore</em>, LexisNexis 2007 Ed at p
                    585; see also <em>Lee Min Jai v Chua Cheow Koon</em> [2005]
                    1 SLR(R) 548 (which dealt with the setting aside of a consent order
                    relating to matrimonial assets (“<em>Lee Min
                        Jai</em>”) at [5]). From the wording of s 112(4), the
                    court retains the power to interfere on just and equitable grounds (<em>Lee Min Jai</em> at [6]). I also observe that, as a matter of
                    comparison, while s 119 of the Charter provides that the court may vary
                    agreements for maintenance where there has been a material change in the
                    circumstances, the court is not so limited under s 112(4). Likewise,
                    s 118 of the Charter provides specific situations in which the court has
                    the power to vary orders for maintenance at any time, one of which is where
                    there has been material change in the circumstances. The circumstances giving
                    rise to the court’s decision to vary an order under section 112(4),
                    being a more broadly framed provision, could therefore include a situation as
                    envisaged by s 118 or s 119, i.e. where there has been material change
                    in the circumstances after the order was made.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     The Wife contended that there was no material
                    change in the circumstances. This was because even though the Husband was
                    certified to be legally blind subsequently, he had already been suffering acute
                    vision loss prior to the making of the consent order. Furthermore, given the
                    Husband’s condition, it was only a matter of time before an application
                    was made to the CPF Board for a payout to discharge the outstanding mortgage
                    loan under the HPIS. Based on the terms of the Husband’s HPIS policy, the
                    mortgage would be fully discharged as a result. Therefore, his visual impairment
                    and its consequential impact had already been taken into consideration when
                    entering the consent order and was not a development occurring after the consent
                    order.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     The Husband contended that the material change
                    in circumstances arose from three events, namely (a) his blindness; (b) the
                    consequent HPIS payout; and (c) the total discharge of the outstanding mortgage
                    loan. He explained that he depended on the rental proceeds from the Property to
                    pay for his expenses as he was unable to work due to his blindness. He submitted
                    that at the time the consent order was entered, he was not yet considered to be
                    ‘legally blind’ and neither he nor the Wife envisaged that he would
                    be entitled to a claim under the HPIS and that the CPF Board would approve full
                    payout of the assured sum under the HPIS.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">My decision</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     I agreed with the District Judge’s
                    decision to vary the consent order and was satisfied that there was material
                    change in the circumstances after the consent order was made. Although the
                    Husband had experienced visual loss prior to the consent order, it was uncertain
                    at that time that there would be a payout by the CPF Board under the HPIS. A
                    variation of the consent order to allow the Husband to purchase the Wife’s
                    share in the Property would not prejudice the interest of the Wife, given that
                    she still retains the benefit of 60% of the value of the Property. This was
                    unlike a case where a variation may affect the proportionate division of
                    assets.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Whether the varied orders were just and equitable</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     The contention here was whether the District
                    Judge erred in ordering the Wife to transfer her rights, interest and title to
                    the Property to the Husband upon the Husband refunding the Wife’s CPF
                    monies with accrued interest to the Wife’s CPF account and also payment by
                    the Husband to the Wife of a sum equivalent to 60% of the value of the Property
                    after deducting both parties’ CPF monies used for the Property as at the
                    date of transfer together with accrued interest and <em>after
                        deducting the HPIS payout</em>. In other words, the HPIS payout would
                    be deducted from the value of the Property which would then be apportioned
                    between both parties. Effectively therefore, the Husband would receive the
                    benefit of the HPIS payout to the exclusion of the Wife.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     The Husband contended that the HPIS payout was
                    not a matrimonial asset and that it had to be attributed to him and not to both
                    parties. This was because he received the HPIS payout on the ground of his total
                    and permanent physical disability after the divorce was granted and the flat
                    ordered to be sold. He further contended that such a payout, being one to
                    compensate him for his misfortune of losing his sight, could not be considered a
                    matrimonial asset even if the marriage between him and his Wife subsisted at the
                    date of the payout.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     The Wife contended that the District Judge
                    failed to consider that the purpose of a HPIS policy is quite unlike that of a
                    personal insurance policy. The HPIS is intended to insure CPF members and their
                    families against loss of their home should the members become physically and/or
                    mentally incapacitated or pass away before their housing loans are fully paid up
                    and not, as alleged by the Husband, intended to compensate for disabilities. She
                    contended that s 29 of the CPF Act made it clear that the HPIS payout was
                    specifically directed towards the discharge of the mortgage over the Property
                    because it provided that “on the death or incapacity of a member of the
                    [HPIS] at any time during the period in which the member is insured under the
                    [HPIS], <em>his liability to repay his housing loan …
                        shall be discharged by the Board in accordance with the [HPIS]</em>
                    [emphasis added]”. She submitted that by assigning the benefit of the
                    HPIS payout to the Husband solely, the District Judge’s order was
                    inconsistent with the intent of the scheme and therefore not just and
                    equitable.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     The HPIS was introduced by legislation. To
                    understand its intended purpose, I refer to the Second Reading of the Central
                    Provident Fund (Amendment) Bill (Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official
                    Report (6 March 1981) vols 40 at cols 323-324), where the then Minister for
                    Communications and Minister for Labour, Mr Ong Teng Cheong, stated the
                    following:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… the Bill seeks to amend the Central Provident Fund Act to empower
                        the Central Provident Fund Board to operate a Home Protection Insurance
                        Scheme so that the outstanding loans on flats purchased by members under the
                        various approved housing schemes of HDB, JTC, HUDC and Mindef will be paid
                        in the event that the members die or are permanently incapacitated from ever
                        working again…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">A study by the CPF Board in 1979 of HDB housing loan borrowers indicated
                        that 56,200 borrowers did not have sufficient CPF savings to pay off their
                        outstanding loans if required to do so. Should such members die or become
                        permanently incapacitated from working again, <em>they or
                            their families may lose their homes</em> if the repayment of the
                        loan cannot be met. The risk is especially real if members die or are
                        incapacitated early in their working life when their CPF savings are
                        small.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     It is evident that the HPIS is meant to
                    benefit <em>both</em> the incapacitated CPF member and his
                    family. In establishing the HPIS, the Legislature was clearly concerned with the
                    problem of families losing their homes when the breadwinner of the family (the
                    insured) became unable to repay the housing loan. The mischief that the HPIS was
                    intended to address was therefore not the insured’s general financial
                    concerns resulting from some future disability but the prospect of the insured
                    and his dependants losing their home should the insured meet with some
                    misfortune. A distinction must therefore be drawn between the HPIS and an
                    ordinary insurance policy where the payout is made to the insured who has
                    control over the use of the money. The HPIS is a mortgage-reducing policy and
                    the payout therefore diminishes with time as the housing loan is progressively
                    repaid by the insured. The HPIS is specifically targeted at protecting the
                    family home and any payout thereunder goes towards discharging the outstanding
                    housing loan only.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     The HPIS payout therefore pertained to the
                    Property and was not intended to be a personal benefit for the Husband although
                    the premium was paid by the Husband. The same would have applied if it had been
                    the Wife (who was similarly insured under the HPIS) who met with some misfortune
                    rendering her unable to repay the housing loan. Since the Wife has a claim to
                    60% of the value of the Property, the HPIS payout should not be deducted in
                    calculating the net value of the Property for distribution between the parties.
                    I therefore varied the District Judge’s order only to this
                extent.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Variation of maintenance order for children</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     Both parties share joint custody of their two
                    children, with the Wife having care and control. In accordance with the consent
                    order, the Husband is currently paying maintenance of $300.00 per month for each
                    of the two children. In the appeal before me, the Wife applied for a variation
                    of the maintenance order to one for a lump sum of $30,000 to be paid by the
                    Husband from the sale proceeds of the Property. The Wife contended that given
                    the Husband’s condition, it was questionable if he would be able to
                    continue paying monthly maintenance. She accepted that she did not make such an
                    application to the District Judge but argued that the court has inherent
                    jurisdiction under s 112 of the Charter to make such an order at any time.
                    This, she said, would allow the parties to have a “final break”
                    and leave her with sufficient funds to purchase a flat for the children and
                    herself and to provide for the children’s needs. The Husband objected to
                    this surprise “unfair” application sprung by the Wife at the
                    appeal.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     I saw no reason to vary the maintenance order
                    in this manner. There was no indication that the Husband was unable or unwilling
                    to carry out his obligations to maintain his children as agreed under the
                    consent order. Further, the Wife’s application was predicated upon the
                    Property being sold and that both parties would be receiving their share of the
                    proceeds of sale. However, if the Husband is able to comply with the District
                    Judge’s order (at <a href="#p1_8">[8]</a> above), there
                    will not even be a sale of the Property. To impose upon him, in the unfortunate
                    circumstances that he is already in, an additional amount of $30,000 as lump sum
                    maintenance for the children might be too much of a burden for him to
                    bear.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     For the reasons above, I dismissed the
                    Wife’s appeal against the variation of the consent order with the District
                    Judge’s order varied to the extent that the HPIS payout is not to be
                    deducted in calculating the net value of the Property for distribution between
                    the parties. I made no order as to costs for the appeal as the Wife succeeded on
                    the HPIS payout issue although she failed in the rest of her
                appeal.</p>
