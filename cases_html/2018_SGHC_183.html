She showed him the OTP for the Property and asked him whether there were any problems with it. He advised her that the preamble stating that the balance 4% deposit was to be released to the Vendors was unusual.

</div> Leong claimed that he had further drawn her attention to Clause 11 because it was also unusual, but Zhang denied that he had done so. This was one of the central disputes between the parties. Clause 11 of the OTP reads:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The Purchaser has notice and knowledge of the road lines affecting the Property … and … shall not annul the sale and purchase herein nor shall any abatement or compensation be allowed in respect thereof. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">6 Thereafter, Zhang took out what was described as a “blurry” map which was attached to the OTP (“the blurry document”) and showed it to Leong. Leong told her he did not know what the document was because it was blurry. Zhang asked Leong what she should do and he suggested that she could check with the CrimsonLogic service bureau (“CrimsonLogic”), which was where most of the property searches were conducted.

</div> On 19 July 2007, Leong sent Zhang another letter explaining that since she had not completed the transaction on 21 March 2007, the Vendors were entitled to re-sell the Property after giving her 21 days’ notice. This letter also emphasised that this point had been explained to Zhang earlier via tele-conversations.

To a considerable extent, the litigation history would also shed light on Zhang’s mindset and motivations in proceeding with the present claim, which was commenced shortly before it became time-barred. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">20 The Vendors commenced Originating Summons (“OS”) No 1639 of 2007 against Zhang on 6 November 2007, seeking to expunge the caveat lodged in favour of Zhang (“the First Caveat”). The court granted the relief sought by the Vendors on 29 November 2007 and directed Zhang to seek legal advice and commence action against the Vendors, if she believed necessary, within two months. Instead of complying with the directions, Zhang lodged another caveat on the Property on 4 December 2007 (“the Second Caveat”). This led to the Vendors taking up OS No 2 of 2008 on 2 January 2008 to expunge the Second Caveat, and the court ordered Zhang to expunge this caveat on 10 January 2008. The hearing of OS No 1639 of 2007 eventually proceeded in July 2012 and the court’s grounds of decision is reported at <span class="font-italic">Koh</span><span class="font-italic"> Kim Seng and another v Zhang Run-Zi</span> [2013] SGHC 79. Consequently, Zhang filed Summons No 72 of 2013 in OS No 1639 of 2007 to set aside the following orders: (a) order to expunge the First Caveat and the order to pay costs to the Vendors on an indemnity basis, and (b) the order to expunge the Second Caveat in OS 2 of 2008. The claims were dismissed and the appeal was also dismissed on 23 September 2013. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">21 Zhang brought a suit in Magistrate’s Court (“MC”) Suit No 2619 of 2008 against the Vendors claiming the return of the deposit sum on the basis that she was not told the Property was affected by road lines. This suit was struck out. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">22 Subsequently, Zhang commenced Suit No 2 of 2013 against the Vendors for misrepresentation and breach of contract, and this was struck out by the court on the basis of issue estoppel. The decision is reported at <span class="font-italic">Zhang Run </span><span class="font-italic">Zi v Koh Kim Seng and another</span> [2015] SGHC 175. Zhang’s appeal was dismissed by the Court of Appeal. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">23 Zhang was represented in a number of her prior actions and applications, albeit by different law firms. She commenced the present suit on 21 January 2013 as a litigant-in-person, less than three weeks after she filed Suit No 2 of 2013.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The parties’ cases  </span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The plaintiff’s case</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 The main thrust of Zhang’s submissions was that the Defendant, as her solicitor in the sale and purchase of the Property, had failed to advise her on various issues, which led her to suffer losses. Zhang pleaded that the Defendant had breached its contractual duty, its tortious duty, its fiduciary duties, as well as its statutory duties under the Legal Profession (Professional Conduct) Rules.

She alleged that Leong did not look through the entire OTP on 5 January 2007, and only pointed out the unusual term in the preamble of the OTP stating that the deposit to be paid was to be released to the Vendors forthwith. In response, Zhang showed Leong the blurry document, and Leong said he was not sure of its contents.

At that point, she could not give any instructions as to whether to purchase the Property because she was unable to obtain a loan and had insufficient cash. She did not think that the Defendant had ceased representing her, since Leong only stated in the letter to the Vendors’ solicitors that they should communicate with her directly. There was no clear indication of cessation of representation, which would have been especially important in the light of the fact that she had already been in direct communication with the Vendor’s solicitors.

She sought Leong’s help in translating the letter into English and Leong did so (see [12] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>). The Defendant had then advised her that the Vendors would be entitled to “accept [her] repudiation and forfeit the deposit paid” and that they “[might] thereafter resell the Property” and if “there [was] a shortfall from the subsequent sale, the Vendor [would] be entitled to claim the difference” from her.

She informed him that she was still considering her position and instructed Leong to inform the Vendors’ solicitors that he had obtained no instructions from her and that they were to deal directly with her.

</div> Zhang paid no heed to this. As a result, the Vendors commenced OS No 1639 of 2007 to expunge the First Caveat (see [20] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">My decision  </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 I have set out the case background, the litigation history and the parties’ respective cases in some detail given that the dispute dates back to January 2007 and numerous factual allegations were made by both Zhang and Leong. To complicate matters further, Zhang commenced this action in January 2013 when it was on the verge of becoming time-barred, and the trial commenced only in March 2018. It was inevitable that memories would have faded and discrepancies would emerge in the parties’ recollection of the events, particularly in areas where no corroborative documentary evidence was in existence.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 The main issue at trial was whether the Defendant had acted with the standard of care required in representing Zhang in the purchase of the Property. It was not disputed that the Defendant did enter into a solicitor-client relationship with Zhang, though the exact commencement and duration of this relationship was disputed. Both parties agreed that the standard of care is that expected of a reasonably competent and diligent conveyancing solicitor (<span class="font-italic">Su Ah Tee and others v </span><span class="font-italic">Allister Lim and Thrumurgan (sued as a firm) and another (William Cheng and others, third parties)</span> [2014] SGHC 159 (“<span class="font-italic">Su Ah Tee</span>”) at [70]).

</div> Her position was that the Defendant had voluntarily assumed responsibility towards her in the purchase of the Property because Leong had looked at the OTP and given her some advice. She relied on <span class="font-italic">Spandeck</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>(<span class="font-italic">supra</span> [27]), where the court held at [81] that where a person “voluntarily assumes responsibility” for his acts or omissions towards another, and the other relies on it, it is only fair and just that the law should hold the first person liable for negligence. In the present case, Zhang submitted that since Leong had given her some advice since 5 January 2007, the Defendant had voluntarily assumed responsibility, and therefore, its duty of care towards her in relation to the purchase of the Property started from 5 January 2007.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 On the facts, I found that Zhang showed Leong the OTP for the Property during the meeting on 5 January 2007 and Leong did give her some advice out of goodwill on the clauses in the OTP. Nevertheless, Zhang expressly told Leong during the meeting that she wanted to appoint him to act for her only for the purchase of the Jalan Jurong Kechil property, and not for the Property. In response, Leong told her to appoint a solicitor to represent her in the purchase of the Property as soon as possible. To my mind, this version of events was the only logical explanation considering that the Defendant had taken on full responsibilities as a law firm in relation to the Jalan Jurong Kechil property after the 5 January 2007 meeting, but not in relation to the Property. Zhang testified that she had also left everything in relation to the Jalan Jurong Kechil property for the Defendant to handle,

</div> in contrast to the multiple searches and inquiries on the Property she had conducted on her own. She expended all this effort by herself, as the Defendant had only been appointed to act for her in relation to the purchase of one of the two properties. In all probability, her decisions were driven primarily by both cost and financing considerations. The Defendant was not unwilling or unable to act for her in relation to both property purchases had she so instructed. Alternatively, she could have appointed two sets of lawyers to act for her in respect of the two transactions, as advised by Leong. In the circumstances, Leong did not voluntarily assume responsibility as Zhang’s solicitor in relation to the purchase of the Property from the time they met on 5 January 2007, and the duty of care set out in <span class="font-italic">Spandeck</span> did not arise then.

</div> Leong had nothing to act on until he was provided with all the relevant documents and until he was appointed on 24 January 2007. The decision of <span class="font-italic">Su Ah Tee </span>(at [50]–[57]) was relevant to the present facts. The question of the timing of retainer in relation to a property purchase also arose in that case, and the High Court held that the retainer only arose after the plaintiff handed the option to purchase (with the correct purchaser stated) and the correct cheque to the solicitor despite prior communications between them regarding the property purchase. It was only necessary for the solicitor to read and act on the documents relating to the sale and purchase of the property after receiving the relevant documents from the plaintiff (at [55]). In the present case, the Defendant was appointed to act and given the relevant documents only on 24 January 2007, and its duty to Zhang in relation to the purchase of the Property arose only from that day. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Advice in relation to Clause 11</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 Zhang’s evidence was that the Defendant had at no time advised her on Clause 11 of the OTP. On the other hand, Leong’s version was that he had explained to Zhang the effect of Clause 11 on 5 January 2007, that she would not be able to get a refund of the 4% deposit given to exercise the OTP in the event that the Property was affected by road reserves. On 24 January 2007, the day of the exercise of the OTP, he warned her again that she would not get a refund of the deposit if she discovered problems with the Property.

Nevertheless, I preferred and accepted Leong’s evidence that he had advised her on the effect of Clause 11. Zhang had herself affirmed in two affidavits for MC Suit No 2619 of 2008 and for OS No 1639 of 2007 respectively that Leong had informed her that “there was an agreement in the contract which stated that after payment of 4% of the deposit, [she] would not be able to get a refund if [she found] any problems with the [P]roperty”.

On 24 January 2007, Leong warned Zhang again that she would not get back the deposit if she were to find any problems with the Property later, and he asked her about the road line plan of the Property. Although there was no road line plan in the documents obtained by Zhang, Zhang nevertheless instructed Leong to exercise the OTP. Based on Zhang’s confidence in her own searches, she had made a deliberate and conscious decision to proceed with the OTP despite Leong’s warnings of the potential risks. Having regard to the fact that the Defendant was appointed to act only about two hours to the expiry of the OTP, it was not negligent for the Defendant to have exercised the OTP on 24 January 2007 on Zhang’s instructions even though it had not itself conducted complete searches on the Property. Zhang was given adequate warning. The Defendant acted with the standard of care expected of a reasonably competent and diligent solicitor having regard to the circumstances that it was in.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 The Defendant tried to rely on <span class="font-italic">Yeo Yoke </span><span class="font-italic">Mui</span> (at [21]) for the proposition that if a client had already made up his mind to purchase a property, then eleventh hour advice or explanation of the road reserves given to him would not be of any real assistance to him and would therefore be unnecessary. However, it would appear that this case, cited out of context, was of limited assistance to the Defendant. The real purport of the statement by the Court of the Appeal was to emphasise that any such advice should have been given to the client much earlier, and not left to the eleventh hour. In that case, the Court of Appeal found the solicitor negligent because he had failed to advise on the road reserves even though he had about seven weeks to examine the option to purchase and make searches on the property. The factual circumstances were different from those in the present case, where the Defendant, through no fault of its own, only had about two hours from the time of appointment to the expiry of the OTP to conduct the relevant searches. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 I should clarify that the mere fact of the Defendant having little time to respond and advise did not necessarily mean that it would be held to a lower standard of care. Nevertheless, I found that the Defendant had not fallen short of its standard of care. I accepted Leong’s evidence that after obtaining the outcomes of property searches on 1 February 2007, he had called Zhang immediately and informed her of the road reserves affecting the Property. He specifically explained that the Property might be compulsorily acquired by the government in the future and that she might not be able to obtain financing, as the value of the Property would be affected by the road reserves.

But even if Zhang’s version of events was accepted, it would not have meant that the Defendant had failed to meet the requisite standard of care. Zhang had stated that “[her] lawyer informed [her] that the Property had been marked in the Road Line Plan as ‘Land Required As Road Reserve’” and that this had a “material impact on the value of the Property”. From this, it would have been clear that Zhang had appreciated the materiality and effect of the road reserves. This would have been consistent with Leong having advised her about the problem with the Property on 1 February 2007. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">71 Zhang’s accusation of wrongdoing by the Defendant in dating the letter sent on 1 February 2007 (informing her about the road line plan) as 25 January 2007 did not advance her case.

I saw nothing sinister in this.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">72 At this juncture, I note a peculiar incongruity in Zhang’s claims.

This was not related to the Defendant’s alleged negligence at all. Her vehement and unrelenting emphasis on this belief seemed to suggest that it was the Vendors’ misrepresentation as she saw it that led her to exercise the OTP and not the Defendant’s negligence. Perhaps this incongruity was lost on her; it appeared that her primary objective was to find any means of redress for the perceived wrongdoings that she felt had been unjustly inflicted upon her.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Timeline of purchase and the ability of the Vendors to sell to a third party</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">73 Zhang claimed that Leong did not advise her at any time on the timeline for the purchase.

Secondly, on the 21 days’ notice period, Zhang’s case was that the Defendant had not advised her on the period at all.

This could only mean that she was fully aware that the date of completion was 21 March 2007.

</div> Although the record of what transpired was not ideal because no contemporaneous attendance notes of the tele-conversations were made by the Defendant, I ultimately accepted Leong’s evidence that he did advise Zhang on the notice through telephone communications on or around 15 March 2007. The letter sent by the Defendant to Zhang on 19 July 2007 made reference to their previous telephone conversations in which Leong had verbally advised her of the notice period (see [56] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>), and there was no allegation by Zhang that the advice was rendered <span class="font-italic">ex post facto</span> at that time. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">76 Regarding the third allegation, the Defendant disputed Zhang’s evidence that Leong had told her that the Vendors would not be able to sell off the Property without her consent. Zhang claimed that Leong led her to labour under the impression that if she did not complete by 21 March 2007, she would merely need to pay interest (see [37] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>), and as a result, she liquidated her Shanghai property in order to raise sufficient cash to complete the purchase of the Property. Leong, on the other hand, testified that all he had told her was that with a caveat lodged, she would be notified if the Vendors tried to deal with the Property.

</div> It was not wholly implausible that Zhang might have read too much into this explanation and formed her own conclusion that she had an enforceable interest in the Property once a caveat was lodged.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">77 I found that Leong’s evidence was more consistent and credible. It could not be the case that Zhang was labouring under a genuine misunderstanding that in every situation, the Vendors had to obtain her consent to sell the Property to a third party, because the Defendant had by letter dated 9 February 2007 informed her of the consequences in the event of her repudiation (see [12] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>). It was clearly stated that the Vendors could sell the Property to a third party, and it was not disputed by Zhang in the course of the trial that she did understand this. This meant that there were circumstances where the Vendors did not have to obtain her consent to sell the Property to a third party. Moreover, Zhang’s claim that Leong was still advising her in June or July 2007 after finding out that the Vendors intended to sell the Property to a third party that they could not do so without her consent (see [38] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) was illogical, for Leong had clearly advised her to remove the First Caveat lodged against the Property on the basis that she had no further interest in the Property during that same period of time. Therefore, I found Leong’s evidence to be more believable.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">78 What Zhang was possibly seeking to achieve at that time was to wait for the valuation report and use it to renegotiate for a lower purchase price with the Vendors. She was in any event also buying time to consolidate her funds in order to complete the sale and purchase of the Property. Zhang testified that she had told Leong that she wanted to complete the transaction, but she would get the valuation report and consolidate her funds first before completing.

</div> She did not explain why she seemed to have been rather lackadaisical in her efforts to obtain the valuation report, which was ready only after the completion date. The evidence showed Zhang had always evinced an intention to continue with the purchase, even after finding out about the road reserves affecting the Property. She testified that despite the road reserves, she was prepared to complete the transaction if the valuation was not too big a difference.

She had also told Leong that since she had no instructions yet for him to proceed to completion, she would communicate directly with the Vendors. Therefore, Leong told her that he would discharge himself and tell the Vendors’ solicitors to communicate directly with her. In the course of dealings between Zhang and the Defendant, it was not disputed that there was no continued retainer and that they dealt with each other on a transactional basis. On the facts, I found that the Defendant had discharged itself on 16 March 2007. The Defendant was acting for her in relation to the intended purchase of the Property for less than two months altogether, from 24 January to 16 March 2007. It would, however, have been ideal for the Defendant to have sent a formal discharge letter to Zhang to avoid any disputes arising. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">82 Zhang alleged that the Defendant’s behaviour in discharging himself four days prior to the completion date was negligent and returning the OTP to the Vendors was to wash its hands clean of the entire transaction (see [41] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>). In the circumstances, where the client had no instructions for the solicitor, wished to communicate with the Vendors directly and was aware of what she needed to do to complete the purchase before the completion date, I found that it was not negligent for the Defendant to have discharged itself. The returning of the original OTP to the Vendors was not a negligent act, and it did not mean that Zhang no longer wanted to continue with the purchase. This was buttressed by the fact that the Vendors still sent her the 21 days’ notice after the original OTP was returned.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The statutory amendment and the sale of the Shanghai property </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">83 It was not disputed that Zhang took steps to sell her Shanghai property only after 16 March 2007.

Going by Zhang’s account, she would have known of the statutory amendment prior to the lapse of the 21 days’ notice period, and taken it into consideration in her financing decisions. According to her, she found out about the statutory amendment through the valuation report dated 23 March 2007 (at [34] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>). On the stand, she insisted that she only received the valuation report in April 2007, which was different from the date of the report and from her own affidavit affirmed on 12 April 2011 for MC Suit No 2619 of 2008, in which she stated that she received the report on 23 March 2007.

</div> The critical question however was this: given the drastic difference between the low valuation of $580,000 and the purchase price of $1,020,000, why would Zhang still have wanted to go ahead with the purchase of the Property? I did not accept her assertion that she was only following the Defendant’s advice that she ought to do so in order to avoid litigation. After all, if she had indeed been cheated by the Vendors as she maintained, there should have been no fear of litigation and she could have resisted any claims if she had genuinely believed that the merits were in her favour.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">87 Zhang conceded that she was prepared to go ahead with the purchase if there was not too big a difference in the valuation. In this regard, she claimed that she intended to renegotiate the purchase price with the Vendors after receiving the valuation report and consolidating her funds, reasoning somewhat curiously that since they had cheated her, they might be persuaded to close the deal at a lower price “once their conscience [hit] them”.

</div> I found it difficult to follow the logic of her strained arguments. First, it made no sense whatsoever that she would still be prepared to negotiate with the Vendors in the light of her alleged mistrust of them and her insistence that they had cheated her and been guilty of misrepresentation. Next, I could see no reason why the Vendors might be prepared to negotiate with her and lower the price, or why they might possibly feel compelled to do so from a guilty conscience simply because she had accused them of fraudulent conduct. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">88 I found that Zhang’s actions after she received news of the statutory amendment and in spite of the low valuation were in fact more consistent with another explanation she alluded to. It will be recalled that she had sought to invest in property transactions at a time when, by her own account, the property market was at a trough. She made the bold commitment to pay the option fees for not one, but two landed property purchases at around the same time. She knew that she was short of cash and would require mortgage loans. In order to complete both purchases, she would need to liquidate her Shanghai property, as she was not able to obtain sufficient loan financing to support both purchases. She remained intent on wanting to purchase both properties, and this was a strikingly peculiar decision given the low bank valuation relative to the sale price of the Property and her claims that the Vendors had cheated her by misrepresenting to her about the road line plan. I found that her conduct was only explicable on the basis that she was extremely eager to purchase the Property and upon receiving news of the statutory amendment, she felt confident that she would eventually be adequately compensated at market rates by the government should the land be subsequently subject to compulsory acquisition. Having committed to the purchase when the market was at a trough, she must have reasoned that at some future point in time, the market would recover and she might possibly stand to profit as a result even if the scenario was one involving compulsory acquisition. The low valuation only became material in presenting another challenge for her when it came to obtaining loan financing.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">89 Notably, in the termination letter dated 9 February 2007, Zhang herself had noted that the property market for downtown Singapore had been “rising steadily”. She consequently claimed for the appreciation in the value of the Property due to the “buoyant property market” in 2007. It could be inferred that Zhang had hoped to capitalise on market movements and was banking on the prospect of future gain. This became an even more attractive prospect once the news of the statutory amendment was made known on or about 14 February 2007, well before the completion date. Even on her account, assuming she had indeed known of the statutory amendment only on 23 March 2007, this was before the expiry of the 21 days’ notice period. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">90 By 16 March 2007, Zhang had not given any instructions to Leong to complete the purchase and he informed the Vendors’ solicitors accordingly to deal directly with her. There was no reason why Leong would have unilaterally done so without first securing her agreement or acquiescence. Zhang’s failure to instruct him was allegedly because she was still waiting for a valuation report on the Property. She was managing her property affairs on her own by then and was making decisions on her own. Why Zhang had left it until rather late to obtain the valuation report or to sell her Shanghai property was not explained. What was clear was that her inability and failure to complete the purchase of the Property was a direct consequence of her not having sufficient funds both on the completion date of 21 March 2007 and on 16 April 2007 when the 21 days’ notice period was up. As for how she would source for financing, this was not within the scope of the Defendant’s retainer. The Defendant owed her no corresponding duty to advise her on her financial decisions.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Zhang’s credibility </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">91 Zhang was intent on buying the Property. She paid the 1% option fee without seeking any legal advice, and exercised the OTP without any regard to the likely valuation price of the Property or her prospects of obtaining two bank loans. She was satisfied with her own searches with CrimsonLogic and her enquiries with the URA. Swept along by her own exuberance and hoping to catch the anticipatory wave of a “buoyant property market”, she had badly miscalculated or overestimated her ability to obtain financing for her intended simultaneous purchases of two properties. I accepted the Defendant’s submission that Zhang had sufficient time to take steps to complete the purchase, but failed to do so. Selling her Shanghai property was in all likelihood a last resort, when she had convinced herself that all she had to do was pay an interest penalty for late completion and that the Vendors would continue with the sale to her, and chosen to disregard the Defendant’s advice on the implications of the 21 days’ notice. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">92 To sum up, I found that Zhang’s assertions were lacking in credibility. She changed her positions as and when it suited her purpose, readily disavowing significant components of the affidavits she had filed in previous proceedings. She claimed that her previous affidavits were not accurate because of her poor command of English,

</div> In my view, these were feeble excuses to gloss over the fact that there were obvious inconsistencies and contradictions in her case, as I have highlighted above. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">93 Zhang sought to portray herself as an unfortunate victim of others’ misdeeds and manipulations.

Her claim against the Defendant was a contrived afterthought, conceived <span class="font-italic">ex post facto</span> only after she had exhausted her attempts to seek recourse against the Vendors. This was the irresistible inference to be drawn from the undisputed fact that Zhang had no apparent quarrel with Leong’s conduct or professionalism all along. According to Zhang, it was only during the trial of OS No 1639 of 2007, which had proceeded to hearing in July 2012, that she came to realise that Leong had purportedly made “a lot of mistakes”.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">95 I accepted that Leong’s conduct of the matter in the circumstances did not fall short of the required standard of care and competence, but I would also note that many of the claims put forward regarding the advice he had rendered over telephone communications were not supported by documentary evidence such as attendance notes. To cite one instance, there was no documentary evidence that Leong had advised Zhang about the 21 days’ notice period on 15 March 2007 through a telephone conversation. The lack of contemporaneous notes did not <span class="font-italic">ipso facto</span> deprive a solicitor’s testimony of all credibility (<span class="font-italic">Law Society of Singapore v Tan </span><span class="font-italic">Phuay Khiang</span> [2007] 3 SLR(R) 477 at [83]), and on the facts of this case, I found that in all the circumstances, Leong was credible and the Defendant’s version of events ought to be believed. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">96 Nevertheless, contemporaneous attendance notes of advice rendered over oral conversations would have very much assisted the Defendant in cementing its defence, especially because Leong had verbally advised Zhang in light of her alleged poor command of English in the course of their interactions. Solicitors should be mindful of the importance of keeping accurate and contemporaneous attendance notes, and exercise prudence in confirming advice and clarifying instructions in writing. Where a solicitor fails to do so, the court may disbelieve his account in favour of the client’s or draw an adverse inference against him (<span class="font-italic">Lie </span><span class="font-italic">Hendri Rusli v Wong Tan &amp; Molly Lim (a firm)</span> [2004] 4 SLR(R) 594 at [63]–[64]). </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Costs</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">97 The Defendant sought costs of $130,000 on a standard basis to the date of the offer to settle (“OTS”) served on Zhang on 27 July 2016, and costs of $220,000 on an indemnity basis after the service of the OTS based on Order 22A, rule 9(3) of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2014 Rev Ed), and disbursements of $5,836.63. In seeking such high costs, the Defendant highlighted the numerous pre-trial conferences (“PTC”) (26 before the OTS was served, including some where the Defendant attended on watching briefs, and 17 after the OTS was served) and the high volume of email correspondences between the parties. The Defendant also pointed out that there were wasted costs because the matter was originally fixed for trial in April 2017, and that was vacated five days before it was scheduled to commence on an application by Zhang, as she was admitted to a hospital. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">98 On the other hand, Zhang claimed that she had accepted the OTS served by the Defendant. However, the evidence showed that in the communications between Zhang and the Defendant on the OTS, she counter-proposed terms on the settlement sum and the issue of costs. I did not accept that the OTS had been accepted. The evidence clearly revealed that negotiations as to the terms of the OTS continued and although Zhang wrote a letter to the Defendant purportedly agreeing to the settlement sum proposed by the Defendant, there was ultimately no agreement on the issue of costs and no valid acceptance of any OTS conforming with Order 22A, rule 6(1) of the Rules of Court. Zhang submitted that costs should not be on an indemnity basis after the OTS was served because she had made counter offers to the Defendant which it had rejected, and she had wanted to mediate the matter but the Defendant refused. With regard to the PTCs prior to the service of the OTS, Zhang claimed that most of them were in relation to interlocutory matters, and the costs for these matters had already been awarded. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">99 No doubt there were numerous PTCs and a high volume of correspondence exchanged, but the fact remained that the legal issues in the present case were not complicated, even though the factual background was highly contested. The trial was not lengthy; it was heard and concluded within four days. The Defendant was right to ask for costs on a standard basis before the service of the OTS and on an indemnity basis after the service of the OTS, but the quantum sought in relation to both costs components was excessive in my view. A reasonable quantum would be $80,000 in respect of the pre-OTS costs, and $120,000 for the post-OTS costs, given that this had to be assessed on an indemnity basis, taking into account the necessary preparation for trial.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">100 Zhang’s insistence on proceeding with this claim was fuelled by her stubborn and unshakeable belief that she had been cheated and wronged by the Vendors, and that Leong should eventually be held accountable to her. To quote her own words: “I can’t let it go”.

</div> When she failed to obtain any recourse against the Vendors, she subsequently turned her attention to the Defendant as a last resort. Regrettably, her objectivity was completely obscured by her obdurate refusal to accept that she was solely responsible for her own predicament.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">101 I found that Zhang’s claim was clearly unsustainable on the facts. She had failed to show that the Defendant had breached its duties as the law firm representing her in respect of her intended purchase of the Property.
