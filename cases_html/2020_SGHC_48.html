Their case was that Mubin was running a drug trafficking business and Lokman was assisting him. They alleged that Mubin received the two bundles from Mohd Zaini bin Zainutdin (“Zaini”) and Mohd Noor bin Ismail (“Noor”) in the week prior to Lokman’s arrest and stored them at the KPT Unit.

</div> What was unclear was the specific date on which these two particular bundles of diamorphine were supplied. I deal with each date in turn.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(1) 7 September 2015: the Marina Bay Sands (“MBS”) delivery</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 All parties accept that a delivery occurred on 7 September 2015. In summary, at around 12.18am, Zaini and Noor entered Singapore and called Mubin at around 12.24am. Two more telephone calls were made at 12.50am and 12.51am to inform Mubin that they had reached MBS. Mubin rode pillion on Lokman’s motorcycle to meet them at MBS. At MBS, Mubin got off Lokman’s motorcycle and boarded Zaini’s car as Zaini drove out of the MBS carpark. Mubin sat in the rear passenger seat, while Zaini was in the driver’s seat and Noor was in the front passenger seat. Two bundles wrapped in black tape were passed to Mubin in the car. On the way to the KPT Unit, Lokman’s motorcycle ran out of petrol and he was stranded near Kallang Stadium. Zaini, Noor, and Mubin retrieved a container from the KPT carpark and went to purchase petrol for Lokman. After passing the petrol to Lokman, the three then went back to the KPT Unit while Lokman went to refuel at a petrol station. Zaini, Noor, and Mubin then consumed “ice” in the KPT Unit, after which they were joined by Lokman. Zaini, Noor, and Mubin then went to eat at Geylang Serai, and Lokman left the KPT Unit soon after to meet up with them.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 The dispute arises as to the nature and quantity of the drugs that were in the two bundles supplied in the car that night. Zaini recounted that he delivered two 25g bundles of “ice” and passed the bundles to Mubin in the car on the way from MBS to KPT. Noor’s evidence was that he heard Zaini tell Mubin that there were “two <span class="font-italic">batu</span>” which had been placed on the rear seat, but admitted that he did not know for a fact what drugs were delivered. As I will explain below at [45], <span class="font-italic">“batu</span>” is the<span class="font-italic"> </span>street name for a pound of heroin, which is equivalent to approximately 440g to 450g. Mubin contended, instead, that he received two 25g bundles of “ice”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 In Lokman’s contemporaneous statement recorded on 9 September 2015, which he later sought to renege, Lokman was asked at Question 17, “When did you collect the two bundles of heroin?” Lokman replied, “On Monday, 7th September 2015”. At Question 19, he was asked, “Who instructed you to collect the two bundles of heroin?” He replied, “My brother Mubin instructed me on Monday night to collect the heroin from one male Malaysian and pass it to Edy.” In his statement recorded on 16 September 2015, however, Lokman said he only dropped Mubin off at the entrance of MBS on 7 September 2015.

</div> There, Zaini took the bag back and passed it to Mubin. This statement was admitted into evidence under s 147(4) and s 147(5) of the Evidence Act and marked P299. Noor also said in the same statement that $5,000 was handed to Zaini by Mubin on 5 September 2015. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Lokman claimed that he did not see any bundles but saw Noor carrying a bag. On his account, he did not receive anything from Zaini or Noor. They went up the elevator to the KPT Unit first and he only went up after. When he entered, he saw them talking to each other and smoking “ice”. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) Mubin claimed that he only received 25g of “ice” from Zaini on this occasion, in the form of a small black bundle. Zaini passed him this bundle and then they smoked “ice” together. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 In my judgment, the evidence was clear on the following facts. First, arrangements were made for Zaini to deliver two bundles to Mubin. Second, two bundles were delivered to Mubin. Although the testimonies were inconsistent on whether the bundles were first given to Lokman, it was clear that Lokman was not the final recipient of the drugs. Even if Lokman had taken the bundles, as in Zaini’s account, Lokman eventually handed them to Mubin in the KPT Unit. Furthermore, the inconsistencies could be explained by the inaccuracy of human recollection arising from the passage of time.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 Mubin’s account that he only received a single 25g bundle of “ice” on this occasion is clearly contradicted by the evidence of Zaini and Noor. At no point in any other person’s evidence was the possibility of only one bundle being delivered raised. The consistent evidence was that two bundles were given to Mubin, either through Lokman or directly. Therefore, I concluded that Zaini and Noor delivered two bundles to Mubin on 5 September 2015.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(3) 1 September 2015</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 ICA records showed that Zaini and Noor entered Singapore on 1 September 2015 at 7.40am.

</div> The pattern of calls surrounding each delivery showed clearly that it was only Mubin who dealt directly with Zaini and Noor. There was no basis for concluding that Lokman ordered the bundles and had them delivered by Zaini and Noor. Mubin himself did not assert that any bundles were delivered to Lokman nor did he contest the fact that he received deliveries from Zaini and Noor on 1, 5 and 7 September 2015. His claim was only that he had received methamphetamine, and the bundles of diamorphine were not his. It was clear that of the two brothers, Mubin was the recipient. It was also clear that he received at least two bundles of diamorphine.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Conclusion on the supply of diamorphine</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 There were three occasions on which drugs were supplied in this case. Taking into account that the trial was four years after the fact, truthful witnesses could be expected to experience some difficulty in recollecting details. On the evidence at hand, I found it beyond a reasonable doubt that the bundles containing A1E1A and A1F1A were supplied on 5 September 2015. Zaini identified the bundles as typical of shipments originating from him, was clear about the delivery occasion, and there was no other source of supply alleged or any facts raising a suspicion otherwise. Further, the only conclusion to be drawn from the facts surrounding the supply of the diamorphine was that, consistent with Lokman’s case, Mubin dealt with Zaini and made the arrangements for the drug supply and delivery. While Mr Goswami put his case to Lokman that he was running his own drug trafficking operation from the KPT Unit, this was simply an assertion without any explanation as to his processes or methods, and without any evidence to suggest that it was true. Conversely, the evidence indicated that Lokman was working under Mubin’s instruction as his errand boy. I turn to this part of the evidence now. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The instructions for the delivery of diamorphine on 8 September 2015</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Lokman’s testimony about 8 September 2015</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 Lokman maintained throughout the investigations and the trial that he was acting on Mubin’s instructions when he went to the KPT Unit to pick up the drugs. At trial, the gist of his account was as follows. On the afternoon of 8 September 2015, he received a call from Mubin asking him to return to the Holland Close Flat. When he did so, he received instructions from Mubin to retrieve the drugs from the KPT Unit, specifically, two bundles of heroin and any other drugs that remained.

This delivery was sufficiently important for them to attempt to arrange delivery multiple times.

They sought each other out when Lokman was uncontactable, and again when Lokman became contactable. In his conversation with Lokman, Edy also referenced Mubin’s concern regarding Lokman’s safety. Based on Edy’s account of his conversation with Mubin, it appeared that Mubin knew that Edy was supposed to receive a delivery from Lokman.

</div> He interpreted “<span class="font-italic">habis</span>” to mean “extreme”, while “<span class="font-italic">batu</span>” meant “stone”, referring to Lokman as “hard-headed”. There were several issues with such an interpretation. First, as Mubin acknowledged in cross-examination, the phrase for “hard-headed” was “<span class="font-italic">kepala batu</span>”.

</div> He did not explain why the use of “<span class="font-italic">batu</span>” on its own here would carry the same meaning. Second, that interpretation did not fit the context. Prior to S/N 13, Mubin was castigating Lokman for not following instructions. Just after, Lokman said he did not know what to do, and Mubin replied, “You deliver.” Given the overall context in which this exchange took place, I find that “<span class="font-italic">batu</span>”, which is the street name for a pound of heroin, referred to the planned delivery to Edy. ASP Yang Rongluan gave evidence that “<span class="font-italic">batu</span>” is often used as a term of measurement for heroin, referring to approximately 440g to 450g of heroin.

There was no mention at all of food in the telephone conversations. Instead, it was plain from the conversations that Mubin had given Lokman instructions to make a delivery to Edy and then return to where Mubin was staying, which was the Holland Close Flat. He was clearly furious that Lokman had not been punctual and had thereby missed his delivery of a pound of heroin to Edy. According to Mubin, Lokman was always tardy and Mubin wanted to scold Lokman for being ill-disciplined.

Lokman contested the voluntariness of the statement under s 258(3) of the CPC. An ancillary hearing was held on the issue of admissibility. Lokman argued that he suffered physical injury because of the arrest, he had been experiencing the after-effects of consuming drugs before the arrest, and he was pestered and pressured into giving the statement. In Mr Muzzamil’s submission, this amounted to oppression under s 258(3) of the CPC.

Further, there was no evidence that Lokman was suffering from withdrawal symptoms to such an extent that the statement should not be admitted. Indeed, the surrounding evidence of the recorded telephone calls (which I have dealt with above), the statement itself, and the testimony of other witnesses indicated that Lokman was lucid. Therefore, I found that the voluntariness of the statement was proved beyond a reasonable doubt and admitted the statement. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 There were inconsistencies between the contemporaneous statement and Lokman’s evidence at trial but these did not detract from the credibility of his evidence. First, his contemporaneous statement that he had collected the bundles on 7 September 2015 was contrary to his evidence at trial. However, his evidence at trial was supported by Zaini and Noor, whose accounts I believed. Second, there were also inconsistencies in relation to whether he knew that the bundles were under the sofa when Mubin gave him instructions to retrieve them. In my view, whether he knew the bundles were there was not significant; the important issue was whether he had been given directions about them and had acted on those directions. Third, there were inconsistencies in relation to whether it was him or Mubin who unwrapped another bundle which had been wrapped in black tape. This was in relation to drugs that were not part of the subject matter of the charge. Fourth, there were inconsistencies in relation to whether he had personally delivered drugs to Edy prior to 8 September 2015 or had simply driven Mubin to meet with Edy for Mubin to make the delivery. Again, this was in relation to drugs that were not part of the subject matter of the charge.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 Further inconsistencies within Lokman’s evidence were raised, which I deal with briefly:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) In Lokman’s statement marked P128, he claimed that Mubin’s instructions had been given while they were both at the Holland Close Flat.

</div> While it was accepted that the call logs of Lokman’s and Mubin’s known phone numbers did not reflect a call from Mubin to Lokman at around 1pm on 8 September 2015, the evidence indicated that Mubin used several phones. It also appeared from their telephone conversation the night of Lokman’s arrest that Mubin had given Lokman the instruction sometime before the evening. Mubin, after castigating Lokman about punctuality earlier in the conversation, stated, "I’m telling you that if you had done it during the day, there won’t be any problems you know”.

</div>
</div> Based on his admissions and the evidence, I found that Lokman had the intention to deliver one of the bundles of drugs to Edy and the other to Mubin when he was found in possession of the bundles. In so far as the case concerned Lokman’s intended act of delivery to Edy, it was clear that this would fall within the definition of trafficking in s 2 of the MDA. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Alteration of charge and new charge</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 After closing submissions were received, I asked parties to submit on the case of <span class="font-italic">Ramesh a/l Perumal v Public Prosecutor and another appeal</span> [2019] 1 SLR 1003 (“<span class="font-italic">Ramesh</span>”) in relation to the bundle of drugs intended for return to Mubin. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 In <span class="font-italic">Ramesh</span>, one of the accused persons, Chander, had passed the drugs in question to the co-accused, Ramesh. The Court of Appeal accepted that, as a matter of fact, Ramesh only intended to return the drugs to Chander: <span class="font-italic">Ramesh</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [87]. Having analysed s 2 of the MDA which defines the word “traffic”, the Court of Appeal held that the act of returning drugs to the person who entrusted them with the accused in the first place was not trafficking. The judgment in <span class="font-italic">Ramesh</span> was handed down after the Prosecution’s case had closed. The Court of Appeal’s holding at [110] was pertinent: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[I]n our judgment, <span class="font-weight-bold">a person who returns drugs to the person who originally deposited those drugs with him would not ordinarily come within the definition of “trafficking”. It follows that a person who holds a quantity of drugs with no intention of parting with them other than to return them to the person who originally deposited those drugs with him does not come within the definition of possession of those drugs “for the purpose of trafficking”</span>. There is a fundamental difference in character between this type of possession and possession with a view to <span class="font-italic">passing the drugs onwards</span> to a third party. In the former situation, the returning of the drugs to a person who already was in possession of them to begin with cannot form part of the process of disseminating those drugs in a particular direction – <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, from a source of supply towards the recipients to whom the drugs are to be supplied – because the act of returning the drugs runs counter to that very direction. On the other hand, in the latter situation, the intended transfer of the drugs to a third party is presumptively part of the process of moving the drugs along a chain in which they will eventually be distributed to their final consumer.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis in original in italics; emphasis added in bold]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">This was elaborated at [114]: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">In the vast majority of cases, it can reasonably be assumed that the movement of drugs from one person to another, anywhere along the supply or distribution chain, was done to facilitate the movement of drugs towards their ultimate consumers. <span class="font-weight-bold">It is clear, however, that this assumption does not hold true in the case of a person who merely holds the drugs as “bailee” with a view to returning them to the “bailor” who entrusted him with the drugs in the first place. Such a person cannot, </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">without more</span><span class="font-weight-bold">, be liable for trafficking because the act of returning the drugs is not </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">part of</span><span class="font-weight-bold"> the process of supply or distribution of drugs</span>.[emphasis in original in italics; emphasis added in bold]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 The issue was the act of return, which the Prosecution had put to the accused persons as the factual premise for Lokman’s act of trafficking. The Prosecution submitted that <span class="font-italic">Ramesh</span> did not apply for two key reasons, which I deal with in turn. First, they argued that there was no “entrustment” in the present case, as Mubin did not have physical possession and did not physically pass the drugs to Lokman, such that Lokman could be treated as a “bailee”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">71 In my view, physical possession was not critical to the concept of bailment as the Court of Appeal had defined it in <span class="font-italic">Ramesh</span>. The concept of possession in the context of drug offences was set out in <span class="font-italic">Tan Ah Tee and another v Public Prosecutor</span> [1979-1980] SLR(R) 311 at [25], where the Court of Appeal adopted Lord Pearce’s approach in the case of <span class="font-italic">Warner v Metropolitan Police Commissioner</span> [1969] 2 AC 256 (“<span class="font-italic">Warner</span>”). The following excerpt from Lord Pearce’s judgment is most relevant to the present case (<span class="font-italic">Warner</span> at 305):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">For the same reason <span class="font-italic">I do not think that possession was intended to be limited by legal technicalities to one of two alternatives, namely, either to mere physical possession or to mere legal possession. Both are forbidden. </span>A man may not lawfully own the drugs of which his servant or his bailee has physical possession or control. Nor may he lawfully have physical possession or control as servant or bailee of drugs which are owned by others. By physical possession or control I include things in his pocket, in his car, in his room and so forth. That seems to me to accord with the general popular wide meaning of the word “possession” and to be in accordance with the intention of the Act. [emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">72 In this case, Mubin had purchased the drugs from Zaini. Given the illegal subject matter, he did not have a legal right to ownership (see <span class="font-italic">R v Maginnis</span> [1987] 2 WLR 765 at 771 per Lord Keith of Kinkel). Possession, as described by Lord Pearce in <span class="font-italic">Warner</span>, however, includes possession of items within one’s control. Mubin had left the drugs in premises leased by him, to which he had access and control, either personally or through Lokman. This was sufficient to establish possession. He subsequently gave instructions to Lokman to retrieve them. Lokman’s retrieval commenced the act of bailment as defined in this context. There was no onward distribution of the drugs in this act. In <span class="font-italic">Ramesh</span>, the Court of Appeal made clear in framing the issue at [100] that they were dealing with an accused who took custody of the drugs with the intention to return them to the person who initially entrusted him with the drugs. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">73 <span class="font-italic">Moad Fadzir bin Mustaffa v Public Prosecutor and other appeals</span> [2019] SGCA 73 (“<span class="font-italic">Fadzir</span>”) is a case in point. An argument used by the Prosecution was that Moad Fadzir, the bailee, was in physical possession of the drugs all along, while Zuraimy, the bailor, had not had sole physical possession and therefore could not have “deposited” the drugs with Fadzir, and further, that Moad Fadzir was the one who had <span class="font-italic">first</span> received possession from an unknown male Indian, before he passed the drugs to Zuraimy, meaning that when Fadzir returned the drugs to Zuraimy, the overall direction of drugs was towards the end-consumer: at [79].The Court of Appeal, in rejecting the Prosecution’s arguments, cautioned against “an overly restrictive view of the concept of ‘bailment’” (<span class="font-italic">Fadzir </span>at [80]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">74 The Prosecution’s second objection was that Lokman’s involvement in Mubin’s business went further than mere safekeeping; he assisted Mubin with the drug trafficking operations in so far as his actions were part of a larger scheme of operations that facilitated Mubin’s business. As such, Lokman was not safekeeping the bundle but bringing the bundle back to Mubin for the purpose of onward distribution by Mubin.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">75 The difficulty with the Prosecution's argument on these additional factors in the present case is that these did not change the nature of the act. Rather, they pointed to involvement not consonant with the offence for which Lokman was charged. The case put to the accused persons had a much simpler factual premise. The submission relied on a different characterisation of the offending act. While I recognised that a charge could be preferred for intentional aiding or for conspiracy in an appropriate case, I was of the view that it was not appropriate to frame such a fundamentally different charge against Lokman at such a late stage in the proceedings. Neither did the Prosecution seek to do so. Cross-examination of the accused persons and the taking of evidence had been conducted on the basis of the instruction to send a bundle of drugs to Edy and to return the other bundle to Mubin, with each characterised as an act of trafficking. Notwithstanding Lokman conceded to being Mubin’s errand boy as part of the general context, he had not been given an opportunity to explain his state of mind in respect of his role in Mubin’s wider dealings.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">76 In my judgment, therefore, the charge against Lokman for possession for the purpose of trafficking was made out in respect of the bundle intended for Edy, but not in respect of the other bundle intended for Mubin. I exercised my powers under s 128(1) of the CPC to alter the charge against Lokman and to frame a new charge. The altered charge read as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">That you, <span class="font-weight-bold">LOKMAN BIN ABDUL RAHMAN</span>, </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">on 8 September 2015, at or about 10.30pm, at the ground floor lift lobby of the South Tower at Katong Park Towers, 114A Arthur Road, Singapore, did traffic in a controlled drug, <span class="font-italic">to wit</span>, by having in your possession one of the following bundles for the purpose of trafficking to one “Edy”: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(1) <span class="font-weight-bold">1 bundle of powdery/granular substance weighing not less than 456.8 grams, which was analysed and found to contain not less than 19.88 grams of diamorphine</span>, a Class ‘A’ controlled drug listed in the First Schedule to the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2008 Rev Ed) (“MDA”); or</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(2) <span class="font-weight-bold">1 bundle of powdery/granular substance weighing not less than 456.8 grams, which was analysed and found to contain not less than 19.40 grams of diamorphine</span>, a Class ‘A’ controlled drug listed in the First Schedule to the MDA;</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">without authorisation under the MDA or the Regulations made thereunder, and you have thereby committed an offence under section 5(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) read with section 5(2) and punishable under section 33(1) of the MDA, or you may alternatively be liable to be punished under section 33B of the MDA. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">77 As for the other bundle intended to be returned to Mubin, I decided that the most appropriate charge was under s 8(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the MDA, to mirror Ramesh’s charge in <span class="font-italic">Ramesh</span>. Mr Muzzamil also submitted that this should be the course of action.  Therefore, the second charge against Lokman was framed as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">That you, <span class="font-weight-bold">LOKMAN BIN ABDUL RAHMAN</span>,</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">on 8 September 2015, at or about 10.30pm, at the ground floor lift lobby of the South Tower at Katong Park Towers, 114A Arthur Road, Singapore, did have in your possession one of the following bundles of controlled drugs: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(1) <span class="font-weight-bold">1 bundle of powdery/granular substance weighing not less than 456.8 grams, which was analysed and found to contain not less than 19.88 grams of diamorphine</span>, a Class ‘A’ controlled drug listed in the First Schedule to the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2008 Rev Ed) (“MDA”); or </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(2) <span class="font-weight-bold">1 bundle of powdery/granular substance weighing not less than 456.8 grams, which was analysed and found to contain not less than 19.40 grams of diamorphine</span>, a Class ‘A’ controlled drug listed in the First Schedule to the MDA;</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">with the intention of returning possession of the said bundle to one Mohamed Mubin bin Abdul Rahman (bearing Singaporean NRIC No. S[xxxxxxxx]), without authorisation under the MDA or the Regulations made thereunder, and you have thereby committed an offence under section 8(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the MDA,</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">and further, that you, before the commission of the said offence, were on 27 December 1999 convicted in Subordinate Court 17, <span class="font-italic">vide</span> DAC 35584/1999, for an offence of possession of a controlled drug, <span class="font-italic">to wit</span>, diamorphine, under section 8(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 1998 Rev Ed), and were sentenced to 15 months’ imprisonment, which conviction and punishment have not been set aside to date, and you shall now be liable to enhanced punishment under section 33(1) of the MDA.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">78 The charges were read and explained to Lokman on 6 February 2020: s 128(2) of the CPC. He claimed trial to the charges and confirmed that he was ready to proceed on the altered and new charges: s 129(1) of the CPC. Mr Muzzamil confirmed that he was not seeking to adduce any new evidence or to recall any witness: s 131 of the CPC. As I was of the view that proceeding immediately would not prejudice either the Prosecution or the Defence (s 129(3) of the CPC), I proceeded accordingly.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">79 The elements of the two charges were proved beyond a reasonable doubt. Lokman was in possession of both bundles and knew that they contained diamorphine. As for the bundle he was intending to deliver to Edy, his possession of that bundle amounted to possession for the purpose of trafficking as defined in s 2 of the MDA. As for the second charge, he was in possession of the second bundle with knowledge of its content. Therefore, I found Lokman guilty and convicted him on both charges. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Mubin</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Effect of finding on the central factual issue on Mubin</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">80 My earlier findings meant that the Prosecution’s assertions against Mubin on the charge were proven beyond a reasonable doubt. In particular, I found that:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Mubin gave instructions to Lokman to retrieve the bundles and to deliver one bundle to Edy and return the other bundle to himself at the Holland Close Flat; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Mubin knew that the bundles contained diamorphine and he intended for Lokman to take possession of the bundles for the purpose of passing one to Edy and the other to himself.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Mubin’s lies</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">81 In addition, it is clear from earlier parts of these grounds of decision that I did not think Mubin a creditworthy witness. The Prosecution argued that three of Mubin’s lies, in particular, were corroborative of his guilt. The conditions to be met for a lie to be corroborative of guilt were set out in <span class="font-italic">R v Lucas (Ruth)</span> [1981] 1 QB 720, which were adopted in <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v Yeo Choon Poh</span> [1993] 3 SLR(R) 302 at [33] and re-stated in <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v Ilechukwu Uchechukwu Chukwudi</span> [2015] SGCA 33 at [60] as follows: first, the lie must be deliberate; second, the lie must relate to a material issue; third, the motive for the lie must be a realisation of guilt and fear of the truth; and fourth, the statement must be shown to be a lie by independent evidence. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Not knowing Zaini and Noor</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">82 Mubin lied in his statement of 20 October 2015 when he stated at first that he did not know Zaini and Noor.

</div> This explanation was not cogent when seen in context. The denial was recorded in the statement dated 20 October 2015, after Mubin had been served the charges in respect of the two bundles of diamorphine. Further, it did not make sense that he would deny knowing Zaini and Noor because of his “ice” transactions, when he openly admitted in the same statement that the drugs found on him, including methamphetamine, were for his own consumption.

</div> In my assessment, he was attempting to set up a façade of being an “ice” consumer only, and therefore it became necessary to distance himself from his diamorphine suppliers. His motive was a realisation of guilt and a fear that his knowing the supplier of the diamorphine bundles would belie his bare denial in relation to the drugs found on Lokman.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Not a regular at the KPT Unit</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">84 Mubin also lied about the regularity of his visits to the KPT Unit.

</div> The connection with the KPT Unit was material, because the diamorphine was stored there.

In his statement dated 20 October 2015, however, Mubin stated, “I have so many phones. I can’t remember if I have given these phones to Lokman”.

</div> Taken together with Lokman’s own evidence that he was given L-HP1 by Mubin, I found that Mubin’s claim was a lie. Again, Mubin knew the purpose for which L-HP1 was used, and he lied to distance himself from the delivery to Edy. His motive in lying was to shore up his defence that he knew nothing about Lokman’s drug dealing.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">86 I therefore agreed with the Prosecution that these lies were corroborative of Mubin’s guilt.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Alteration of charge and new charge</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">87 The Prosecution submitted that the charge against Mubin could remain the same, despite the amendment of the charge against Lokman. In the absence of any precedent tendered, I was of the view that the more appropriate approach was to amend Mubin’s charge as well. This was because the amendment of Lokman’s charges meant that there was no act of trafficking that Mubin had abetted in respect of the bundle to be returned to him. In contrast, the import of <span class="font-italic">Ramesh</span> is that Mubin was the primary offender of trafficking in respect of that bundle, the act of trafficking being the act of passing the bundle to Lokman. Therefore, I amended the charge against Mubin under s 128(1) of the CPC to refer only to one of the bundles which was intended to be delivered to Edy, as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">That you, <span class="font-weight-bold">MOHAMED MUBIN BIN ABDUL RAHMAN</span>, </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">on or about 8 September 2015, in Singapore, did abet by instigating one Lokman bin Abdul Rahman (bearing Singaporean NRIC No.: S[xxxxxxxx]) to traffic in a controlled drug, <span class="font-italic">to wit</span>, by giving instructions to the said Lokman bin Abdul Rahman in relation to the delivery of one of the following bundles to one “Edy”: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(1) <span class="font-weight-bold">1 bundle of powdery/granular substance weighing not less than 456.8 grams, which was analysed and found to contain not less than 19.88 grams of diamorphine</span>, a Class ‘A’ controlled drug listed in the First Schedule to the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2008 Rev Ed) (“MDA”); or</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(2) <span class="font-weight-bold">1 bundle of powdery/granular substance weighing not less than 456.8 grams, which was analysed and found to contain not less than 19.40 grams of diamorphine</span>, a Class ‘A’ controlled drug listed in the First Schedule to the MDA;</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">and in consequence of your abetment, on 8 September 2015, at or about 10.30pm, at the ground floor lift lobby of the South Tower at Katong Park Towers, 114A Arthur Road, Singapore, the said Lokman bin Abdul Rahman did have in his possession one of the above bundles of controlled drugs for the purpose of trafficking to the said “Edy”, without authorisation under the MDA or the Regulations made thereunder, and you have thereby committed an offence under section 5(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) read with section 5(2) and section 12 and punishable under section 33(1) of the MDA, or you may alternatively be liable to be punished under section 33B of the MDA. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">88 In respect of the other bundle, Mr Goswami submitted, and I agreed, that the appropriate charge was that of trafficking under s 5(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the MDA. The Court of Appeal held in <span class="font-italic">Ramesh</span> that the act of putting the “bailee” in possession of the drugs would be considered trafficking as the “bailor” would have moved the drugs to another party, a new link in the chain of supply: <span class="font-italic">Ramesh</span> at [124]–[125]. Further, while the Court of Appeal suggested that the “bailor” may be able to argue that he was not trafficking by showing that the movement of drugs to the “bailee” was not intended to facilitate onward dissemination of drugs<span class="font-italic"> </span>(see <span class="font-italic">Ramesh</span> at [125]), no such defence was raised by Mubin in this case (who maintained throughout that he only consumed “ice”, not heroin). Mubin was the one who had possession of the drugs prior to Lokman’s retrieval of the drugs from the KPT Unit (see [72] above). In the present case, Mubin then put Lokman in possession of the bundles by directing him to retrieve the bundles from the KPT Unit. This act of putting Lokman in possession amounted to “giving”, which is an act of trafficking under s 2 of the MDA. A fresh charge was therefore preferred as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">That you, <span class="font-weight-bold">MOHAMED MUBIN BIN ABDUL RAHMAN</span>,</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">on or about 8 September 2015, in Singapore, did traffic in a Class ‘A’ controlled drug listed in the First Schedule to the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2008 Rev Ed) (“MDA”) without authorisation under the MDA or the Regulations made thereunder, <span class="font-italic">to wit</span>, by giving to Lokman bin Abdul Rahman (bearing Singaporean NRIC No. S[xxxxxxxx]) one of the following bundles of controlled drugs belonging to you at 114A Arthur Road, Katong Park Towers, #08-06, Singapore, which you intended for the said Lokman bin Abdul Rahman to return to you:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(1) <span class="font-weight-bold">1 bundle of powdery/granular substance weighing not less than 456.8 grams, which was analysed and found to contain not less than 19.88 grams of diamorphine</span>, a Class ‘A’ controlled drug listed in the First Schedule to the MDA; or </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(2) <span class="font-weight-bold">1 bundle of powdery/granular substance weighing not less than 456.8 grams, which was analysed and found to contain not less than 19.40 grams of diamorphine</span>, a Class ‘A’ controlled drug listed in the First Schedule to the MDA;</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">and you have thereby committed an offence under section 5(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the MDA and punishable under section 33(1) of the MDA, or you may alternatively be liable to be punished under section 33B of the MDA.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">89 These charges were read and explained to Mubin at the hearing on 6 February 2020. He claimed trial to both charges and stated that he was ready to proceed on those charges: s 129(1) of the CPC. Mr Goswami confirmed on Mubin’s behalf that he was not going to recall any witnesses or adduce any new evidence: s 131 of the CPC. I considered that proceeding with the trial would not prejudice the accused’s defence or the Prosecution’s conduct of the case, and so proceeded. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">90 I found that the elements of both charges were made out beyond a reasonable doubt and convicted Mubin accordingly. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Sentences</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Sentence for Lokman</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">91 Regarding the first charge against Lokman, I found that he met the requirement under s 33B(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the MDA as he acted as a courier. Although he put the bundles into their respective bags, that was merely an act that facilitated delivery: see <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v Abdul Haleem bin Abdul Karim</span> [2013] 3 SLR 734 at [55]; <span class="font-italic">Zainudin bin Mohamed v Public Prosecutor</span> [2018] 1 SLR 449 at [83]. In this respect, the focus of the inquiry was “on the accused’s acts in relation to the <span class="font-italic">particular consignment</span> of drugs which form the subject matter of the charge against him” [emphasis in original omitted; emphasis  added in italics]: <span class="font-italic">Zamri bin Mohd Tahir v Public Prosecutor</span> [2019] 1 SLR 724 at [15]. The fact that there was a dispute as to whether Lokman or Mubin had unwrapped another unrelated bundle for distribution was not relevant to the inquiry. In addition, the Prosecution issued a CSA under s 33B(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the MDA. As such, s 33B(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the MDA applied and I exercised my discretion to impose a sentence of life imprisonment. As Lokman was above 50 years of age, caning was not imposed. In respect of the second charge, the amount of drugs involved, at not less than 19.40g of diamorphine, was significantly above the capital threshold. Further, Lokman had antecedents for drugs, specifically, drug possession. This called for the enhanced punishment with a mandatory minimum of two years’ imprisonment under s 33(1) of the MDA. The Prosecution submitted that a term of eight years’ imprisonment was appropriate and I so ordered. Both imprisonment terms were ordered to run concurrently from 10 September 2015, Lokman’s first date of remand.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Sentence for Mubin</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">92 In respect of both charges on which Mubin was convicted, the prescribed punishment under s 33(1) read with the Second Schedule to the MDA is death. The alternative sentencing regime in s 33B of the MDA did not apply to Mubin. Having ordered and given instructions for the drugs to be delivered to Edy and returned to himself for the purpose of onward trafficking, Mubin was not merely a courier. No CSA under s 33B(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) was granted by the Prosecution, nor did any question that he was of unsound mind arise. </div><div class="txt-body text-left"></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">93 I therefore pronounced the mandatory sentence of death on Mubin.</div><div class="Judg-Sign text-left">Valerie Thean  <br/>Judge</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">April Phang and Soh Weiqi (Attorney-General’s Chambers) for the Prosecution;<br/>Mohamed Muzammil bin Mohamed (Muzammil &amp; Company) and Lam Wai Seng (Lam WS &amp; Co) for the first accused;<br/>Ram Goswami (Ram Goswami) and Cheng Kim Kuan (K K Cheng &amp; Co) for the second accused.<br/></div><div class="Judg-Quote-List text-justify"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
