He alleged that the Lawyers were guilty of conduct unbefitting of an advocate and solicitor because of the manner in which they had conducted the proceedings in that suit. Review Committee No 035 of 2017 (“the Review Committee”) was constituted to examine his complaint. In due course, the Review Committee informed the applicant that there was no support for his complaint and directed that it be dismissed. Dissatisfied with the Review Committee’s decision, the applicant filed the present Originating Summons No 675 of 2017 (“OS 675/2017”), an <span class="font-italic">ex parte </span>application for leave to commence judicial review proceedings in respect of that decision. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 During a Pre-Trial Conference (“PTC”) for OS 675/2017, the Law Society, which had originally listed itself as a respondent to the action, indicated that it had taken steps to remove itself as a party. However, it did not remove the Notice of Appointment of its own solicitors (“the Notice of Appointment”) from the record. When the applicant objected to this, Assistant Registrar James Elisha Lee (“AR Lee”) stated that he was not minded to direct the removal of the Notice of Appointment from the record. The applicant then filed Registrar’s Appeal No 232 of 2017 (“RA 232/2017”), ostensibly appealing against AR Lee’s direction. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">3 OS 675/2017 and RA 232/2017 came before me on 18 September 2017. After hearing the parties, I made no order on RA 232/2017 as I was of the view that AR Lee’s direction was not a judicial decision that could be appealed against. I dismissed OS 675/2017 and denied the applicant leave to commence judicial review proceedings because I did not consider that he had made out a <span class="font-italic">prima facie </span>case of reasonable suspicion in favour of granting the remedies he sought. The applicant has filed an appeal against my decision to dismiss OS 675/2017 and I now set out the full grounds for my decision. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Background facts and procedural history </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">4 The Lawyers were acting for the plaintiff in Suit No 1083 of 2012, Innovez ID Pte Ltd (“Innovez”), a construction and renovation company. The applicant was acting for the defendant in that suit, Mr Wong Yoke Shin (“Mr Wong”), who was purportedly Innovez’s project manager responsible for securing its contracts. The suit was commenced against Mr Wong, <span class="font-italic">inter alia, </span>for a breach of his warranty that the costs and expenses for a project at 86 Jalan Pemimpin Singapore 577237 (“the Pemimpin Project”) would be about $900,000. Relying on this, Innovez accepted the Pemimpin Project at a contract price of $1,507,000. However, Innovez alleged that Mr Wong caused or allowed the actual costs and expenses of the Pemimpin Project to escalate to $1,936,453.86. Innovez therefore claimed that it had suffered a loss of more than $400,000. Mr Wong, on the other hand, insisted that the Pemimpin Project was profit-generating. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">5 At the hearing of a discovery application in early 2014, the applicant argued that certain documents disclosed by Innovez supported Mr Wong’s position that Innovez had not made a loss on the Pemimpin Project. In order to determine the profitability of the Pemimpin Project, Innovez filed an application for an account to be taken in respect of the Pemimpin Project, pursuant to O 43 r 1 of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2014 Rev Ed) (“the Rules of Court”). This application was heard by Assistant Registrar Wong Baochen (“AR Wong”) over six days in 2015. During the taking of accounts, Innovez took the position that the Pemimpin Project was its only ongoing project at the material time, while Mr Wong strenuously denied that this was the case. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">6 AR Wong delivered her grounds of decision for the application on 7 July 2016 and made certain findings on the cost and expenses of the Pemimpin Project. She noted that the taking of accounts “presented significant difficulties” because the issue of liability had not been determined yet. She was therefore careful not to make findings that would circumscribe the proceedings before the trial judge.

</div> In particular, she reiterated that there was “no real evidence” with regard to some of the “broader issues” before her and hence “no findings of fact” that could be made as to (a) whether Innovez had more than one project at the material time; instead, this was a “finding of fact that [could] be canvassed and determined at trial” and (b) whether Innovez had withheld or was still withholding documents from Mr Wong and the court, such as evidence of its income and expenditure, which again was a matter that could be “canvassed at trial”. She opined that these broader issues were in any event not directly relevant to the taking of accounts; rather, the trial judge should have latitude to hear the evidence and make the appropriate findings at trial.

The applicant then made an application on behalf of Mr Wong to request for further arguments to be heard, asserting that the taking of accounts had proceeded on the erroneous basis that Innovez only had one project at that time. In fact, the applicant contended, Innovez had withheld certain documents such as invoices and there were “much more bank deposits and other work than declared”. Hoo JC heard the further arguments on 27 December 2016 but did not change her decision. The applicant filed an application for leave to appeal to the Court of Appeal. This was dismissed by Hoo JC on 23 January 2017. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">8     On 14 February 2017, Innovez, through its director Mr Tang Wai Chong Eldee (“Mr Tang”), lodged a complaint with the Law Society against the applicant for “threatening criminal action against Innovez and its representatives, including wrongfully accusing Mr Tang of committing perjury”.

</div> Mr Tang alleged that throughout the application for taking of accounts and the corresponding appeal before Hoo JC, the applicant had made “numerous personal attacks” on various parties, including allegations that the Lawyers were “misleading the court”. Innovez pointed out that AR Wong had, in her Notes of Evidence for the taking of accounts, noted the “numerous statements [made in the applicant’s written submissions] that were essentially personal attacks on various members on [Innovez’s] side” and that “there [was] clearly no need for personal attacks in Court documents. Such professional discourtesy should not be encouraged or even condoned”.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">9 It was in this context that the applicant filed his complaint to the Law Society on 2 May 2017 against the Lawyers. His main grievance was that Innovez had “lied that [it] had only one project or work during the period [from] December 2010 to December 2012”. This was first stated by Mr Tang in his affidavit of evidence-in-chief for the suit, and “perpetuated” by Innovez’s auditor, Mr Kelvin Thio, in his Report of Investigation on the suit. The Lawyers further referred to this during the cross examination of Mr Wong, in their written and reply submissions and in the correspondence between the parties and with the court. The applicant alleged that the Lawyers were fully aware that Innovez was engaged in other projects during the material period. In fact, the applicant claimed, Innovez had deliberately withheld or concealed a substantial portion of their invoices, payment vouchers and bank deposits which would have shown that it had been conducting other projects or work.

His affidavit in support of the application substantially repeated his complaint to the Law Society as set out at [9] and [10] above. In addition, he took issue with the fact that the Review Committee rendered its decision only seven days from the date of its inception (even though the supporting evidence he submitted constituted about 500 pages) and thereafter made the “simplistic pronouncement” that “the information and documents provided by the [applicant] [did] not provide any support for any of the complaints”. He further claimed that the Review Committee did not exercise its powers under s 85(7) of the Legal Profession Act (Cap 161, 2009 Rev Ed) (“the Act”) to call the applicant or the Lawyers to answer any inquiry or furnish any record. He thus grounded his judicial review application on the basis that the decision of the Review Committee was “so outrageous in its defiance of logic or of the accepted moral standards that no sensible person who had applied his mind to the question to be decided could have arrived at it”. This was the test applied in the English House of Lords decision of <span class="font-italic">Council </span><span class="font-italic">of Civil Service Unions v Minister for the Civil Service </span>[1984] 3 WLR 1174 at 1196.<span class="font-italic"> </span>The applicant alleged that there was “clear evidence” that Innovez had lied that it had only one project during the material period and there was “sufficient evidence” that the Lawyers had full knowledge of this fact.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">13 Although OS 675/2017 was filed as an <span class="font-italic">ex parte </span>application, on 21 June 2017, the Law Society filed the Notice of Appointment, listing itself as a respondent in the action, with KSCGP Juris LLP as its solicitor on record. The applicant objected to this through various letters to court and to the Law Society. At a PTC before AR Lee on 24 July 2017, counsel for the Law Society, Mr P Padman (“Mr Padman”) indicated that his instructions were to “remain in the action”. However, AR Lee expressed the view that the addition of the Law Society at that point in time was an “irregularity”. AR Lee then directed that the title in the action was to be amended to remove the Law Society as a party. At the following PTC before AR Lee on 14 August 2017, Mr Padman indicated that he had filed a request to withdraw the Law Society from the action. The applicant contended that if that was the case, the Notice of Appointment should similarly be removed from the record. Mr Padman indicated that he had no instructions to remove the Notice of Appointment and that the Law Society would be seeking leave for its solicitors to attend the hearing of OS 675/2017 on a watching brief. AR Lee stated that he was “not minded” to direct that the Notice of Appointment be removed. On 28 August 2017, the applicant filed RA 232/2017, ostensibly appealing against AR Lee’s direction that he was not minded to order the removal of the Notice of Appointment.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">RA 232/2017 </span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The parties’ arguments</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">14 In the applicant’s affidavit in support of RA 232/2017, he alleged that because OS 675/2017 was an<span class="font-italic"> </span><span class="font-italic">ex parte </span>application, it was “completely illegal” for any other party to be part of the proceedings.

In an earlier, unrelated case, the applicant had lodged a complaint against another senior lawyer. The circumstances in that case were comparable to those in the present one. The review committee in that case had also directed the Council to dismiss the applicant’s complaint. Dissatisfied with the review committee’s decision, the applicant similarly filed an <span class="font-italic">ex parte </span>originating summons for leave to bring judicial review proceedings to challenge the review committee’s decision. Counsel for the Law Society, WongPartnership LLP (“WongPartnership”), filed a notice of appointment of solicitors in the action. At a PTC before AR Lee, the applicant orally applied for AR Lee to direct WongPartnership to withdraw that notice, contending that the Law Society was not entitled to be present or to be heard in an <span class="font-italic">ex parte </span>application. WongPartnership resisted the application. AR Lee declined to make the direction sought by the applicant as he was of the view that the matter should be decided by the judge hearing the originating summons. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">17 The applicant appealed against that direction, which came before Woo Bih Li J. In his Grounds of Decision (reported at <span class="font-italic">Na</span><span class="font-italic">lpon Zero Geraldo Mario v Law Society of Singapore </span>[2017] SGHC 206), Woo J indicated (at [28]) that he informed the parties that AR Lee had not rendered a judicial decision and that there was consequently no need for the applicant file an appeal therefrom. Nonetheless, he continued to hear the applicant’s objection to the notice of appointment filed by WongPartnership. In the end, Woo J was of the view (at [29]) that although the Law Society was not entitled to be heard on an <span class="font-italic">ex parte </span>application, it could be heard on an opposed <span class="font-italic">ex parte </span>basis, and thus allowed WongPartnership to attend at the hearing of the leave application. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">18 I saw no reason to differ from the reasoning adopted by Woo J. I was similarly of the view that AR Lee’s direction in the present case was essentially an administrative, rather than a judicial, decision and should not have been appealable. Consequently, I made no order on RA 232/2016. I proceeded with the hearing of OS 675/2017 on an <span class="font-italic">ex parte</span> basis, as the Law Society had already withdrawn itself from the action. However, I allowed counsel for the Law Society to continue in attendance on a watching brief as I was satisfied that it had an interest in the proceedings, and the applicant did not show that the Law Society’s attendance would cause prejudice to him. For avoidance of doubt, I did not invite the Law Society to participate in the hearing of OS 675/2017.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">OS 675/2017</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">19 I turn then to consider the main application, which was for leave to commence judicial review proceedings in respect of the decision of the Review Committee. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Legal principles</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">20 For leave to be granted under O 53 r 1 of the Rules of Court, the following three requirements must be satisfied: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) the matter complained of must be susceptible to judicial review; </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) the plaintiff must have a sufficient interest or standing in the matter; and </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) the material before the court must disclose an arguable case or <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> case of reasonable suspicion in favour of granting the public law remedies sought by the plaintiff.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">See <span class="font-italic">Jeyaretnam</span><span class="font-italic"> Kenneth Andrew v Attorney-General </span>[2014] 1 SLR 345 at [5] and <span class="font-italic">Axis Law Corp v Intellectual Property Office of Singapore </span>[2016] 4 SLR 554 at [55]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">21 Only limb (c), that is, whether the applicant had established an arguable or <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> case of reasonable suspicion in favour of granting leave, was an issue in the present case. It is clear that judicial review is limited to the decision-making <span class="font-italic">process</span> and does not extend to a review of the <span class="font-italic">merits</span> of the decision itself. Findings of fact are also not within the purview of such a review: <span class="font-italic">Chee </span><span class="font-italic">Siok Chin and others v Minister for Home Affairs and another </span>[2006] 1 SLR(R) 582<span class="font-italic"> </span>(“<span class="font-italic">Chee </span><span class="font-italic">Siok Chin</span>”) at [93].

An in-depth examination is inappropriate and the court is not permitted to resolve conflicting factual evidence and arguments in order to decide whether to grant or refuse leave: see <span class="font-italic">Chai </span><span class="font-italic">Chwan </span>at [32]. Instead, an application for leave is simply a means of filtering out groundless or hopeless cases at an early stage; its aim is to prevent a wasteful use of judicial time and to protect public bodies from harassment that may arise: <span class="font-italic">Public Service Commission v Lai Swee Lin Linda </span>[2001] 1 SLR(R) 133 at [23]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">22 The applicant’s ground for judicial review is irrationality or <span class="font-italic">Wednesbury </span>unreasonableness.

In other words, the decision had to be “so outrageously defiant of “logic” and “propriety” that it can be plainly seen that no reasonable person would or could come to that decision”: see <span class="font-italic">Chee </span><span class="font-italic">Siok Chin </span>at [94].

It could not seriously be disputed that the decision of the Review Committee was brief. The only ground given for directing a dismissal of the applicant’s complaint was that “the information and documents provided by the [applicant] [did] not provide any support for any of the complaints”. Nonetheless, in my judgment, the high threshold of <span class="font-italic">Wednesbury </span>unreasonableness had not been crossed.

</div>
</div> There were several issues with this argument. First, it was not the role of the Review Committee to carry out a <span class="font-italic">detailed</span> examination of the underlying facts; otherwise, it would essentially be descending into the fray and making a finding of fact which was solely within the remit of the trial judge after he or she had heard the witnesses and reviewed the evidence adduced at trial. Given that this was the case, I did not consider that there were good grounds for the applicant’s intimation that the Review Committee had failed to give due consideration to his complaint.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 Second, the fact that the applicant evidently disagreed with the outcome of the Review Committee’s decision did not <span class="font-italic">ipso facto </span>mean that the Review Committee’s decision was <span class="font-italic">Wednesbury </span>unreasonable. As explained in <span class="font-italic">Chee </span><span class="font-italic">Siok Chin </span>at [95] (see [22] above), reasonableness in arriving at a determination does not mean that there should be a single inevitable approach or determination in any given matter. In any event, there were in my view reasonable grounds in support of the Review Committee’s decision. This was because no finding had yet been made on the key factual contention of whether Innovez had only one project at the material time, which was the subject of three of the applicant’s six complaints against the Lawyers. AR Wong herself declined to make a finding on it, preferring to leave this matter to the trial judge (see [6] above). Without a conclusive finding on this key factual premise, there was no basis for concluding that the Lawyers had attempted to mislead the court or to contrive facts in this regard during the taking of accounts. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 At the hearing of OS 675/2017, the applicant went through the supporting documents in detail in an attempt to prove that the Lawyers had indeed misled the court.

</div>
</div> But as explained at [21] above, it was not my role, in the determination of the leave application on a <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> level, to conduct an in-depth examination of the documents in order to resolve conflicting factual evidence, much less make a ruling in his favour before the matter proceeded to trial. I should add that the applicant is not left without recourse – he is at liberty to pursue his client’s substantive case before the trial judge, who may well find in his client’s favour, if indeed there is (as he claimed) clear supporting documentation that supports that position. If, after the determination by the trial judge, the applicant remained of the view that the Lawyers had deliberately misled the court, it would be open to him to bring further proceedings against the Lawyers. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 I turn then to consider a separate point not expressly raised in the applicant’s affidavit supporting the leave application, that is, whether the apparent failure of the Review Committee to <span class="font-italic">give reason</span><span class="font-italic">s</span> for its decision rendered it <span class="font-italic">Wednesbury</span> unreasonable. This was presumably the underlying premise of the applicant’s complaint about the “simplistic pronouncement” in the Review Committee’s letter that the documents he provided did not support his complaint. The argument was ostensibly that in its brief grounds, the Review Committee had failed to explain <span class="font-italic">why </span>the documents and information provided did not support his complaint. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 The immediate difficulty with such a contention is that there remains no general <span class="font-italic">common law </span>duty to give reasons for administrative decisions in Singapore, unless a decision appears to be aberrant or involves matters of special importance to the applicant such as personal liberty: see <span class="font-italic">Manjit</span><span class="font-italic"> Singh s/o Kirpal Singh and another v Attorney-General </span>[2013] 2 SLR 844 at [85] and<span class="font-italic"> </span><span class="font-italic">Manjit Singh (CA) </span>at [10]. The Court of Appeal had, in so holding, followed the English House of Lords decision of <span class="font-italic">Regina v Secretary of State for the Home Department, ex parte </span><span class="font-italic">Doody</span> [1994] 1 AC 531. Neither of the two exceptional circumstances existed on the facts of the present application. If at all, it was <span class="font-italic">the Lawyers</span>, rather than the applicant himself, who were more likely to be affected by any decision of the Review Committee. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 The Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Manjit</span><span class="font-italic"> Singh (CA)</span> acknowledged at [13] however that whether there is a requirement to furnish reasons is “dependent on the <span class="font-italic">operative</span> <span class="font-italic">statutory context</span> and factual matrix of each case” [emphasis added]. In the present case, there is a good arguable case that s 85(8)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the Act itself imposes a duty on the Review Committee to provide reasons. Section 85(8)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) states that if the Review Committee is unanimously of the opinion that the complaint is for example, lacking in substance, it shall direct the Council to dismiss the matter and “<span class="font-italic">give</span><span class="font-italic"> the reasons</span> for the dismissal” [emphasis added]. But in my assessment, the Review Committee’s statement that the information and documents provided no support for the applicant’s complaint was <span class="font-italic">itself </span>a<span class="font-italic"> </span>reason for the dismissal of his complaint. The natural inference from its statement was that it had reviewed the documents submitted by the applicant and reasoned that they provided no support for his complaints, possibly on the basis that no findings of fact had been made on a critical issue. While the Review Committee’s reason for dismissing the complaint was admittedly very brief, an assertion that <span class="font-italic">more extensive or better </span>reasons should have been given is not a recognised ground for review.    </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 For completeness, I should add that the fact that the Review Committee had not required the applicant or the Lawyers to answer any inquiry or furnish any record under s 85(7) of the Act could not be the basis for asserting that its decision was <span class="font-italic">Wednesbury </span>unreasonable, as the applicant suggested (see [12] above). Parliament had clearly vested the discretion to take such further steps in the Review Committee, as evident from the use of the word “may” in that provision. In other words, the Review Committee could choose to do so when it considered the inquiry or furnishing of records “relevant for the purpose of the review”. But there was no <span class="font-italic">obligation </span>on the Review Committee to call for the answers to inquiries or the furnishing of records; the applicant conceded as much during the hearing.
