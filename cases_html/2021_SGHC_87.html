In the first section of the email, Ms Kwa explained why Mr Lee had signed six different wills over 15 months. Ms Kwa explained that much of the discussion between her and Mr Lee regarding the six wills was in relation to three issues. First, where Dr LWL was to live. Second, how Mr Lee’s estate was to be divided (whether equally or unequally between the three beneficiaries). Third, how to divide the property at 38 Oxley Road (“the Oxley property”) in the most practical manner.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">8 In the second section of the 4 June 2015 Email, Ms Kwa then listed three points on the Oxley property. First, that all six wills provided for the Oxley property to be given to Mr LHL. Second, that Dr LWL’s right to stay at the Oxley property changed between the First and Fourth Wills. In the Fifth and Sixth Wills, Dr LWL had a right to stay at the Oxley property subject to Mr LHL’s consent, and Mr Lee had instructed Ms Kwa to insert a specific paragraph that stipulated that Dr LWL had no life interest in the Oxley property. Third, that a clause providing for the Oxley property to be demolished either upon Mr Lee’s passing or after Dr LWL had moved out, whichever was later (“the Demolition Clause”), was removed in the Fifth and Sixth Wills.

In <span class="font-italic">Iskandar </span>at [21], the Court of Appeal referred to the summary set out in <span class="font-italic">Deepak Sharma</span> <span class="font-italic">v Law Society of Singapore </span>[2016] 4 SLR 192 (“<span class="font-italic">Deepak </span><span class="font-italic">Sharma</span>”) at [28]–[32], as follows: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) When a complaint is made, the Council shall refer the complaint to the Chairman of the Inquiry Panel (“the Chairman”): see ss 85(1) and 85(1A). The Chairman shall constitute a Review Committee to review the complaint and the Review Committee may direct the Council to dismiss the matter if it considers that the complaint is frivolous, vexatious, misconceived or lacking in substance or, in any other case, may refer the complaint back to the Chairman: see ss 85(6) and 85(8). </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) If the complaint is referred back to the Chairman, the Chairman shall constitute an Inquiry Committee to inquire into the complaint or information: see s 85(10). The Inquiry Committee shall report its findings and recommendations to the Council and the Council shall consider the report and then determine whether: (i) a formal investigation is not necessary; (ii) no cause of sufficient gravity exists for a formal investigation but the solicitor should be given a warning, reprimanded, ordered to comply with remedial measures or ordered to pay a penalty; (iii) there should be a formal investigation by a DT; or (iv) the matter should be referred back to the Inquiry Committee for reconsideration or a further report: see ss 86(1), 86(7) and 87(1). Importantly, the Inquiry Committee in general makes recommendations to the Council and it is the Council that decides whether to accept those recommendations or not: see s 86(7) and 87(2). One exception to this is where the Inquiry Committee finds that the complaint is frivolous or vexatious, in which case it may make an adverse costs order against the complainant: see s 85(19). Such an order may be reviewed by a judge on the complainant’s application and such a judge may affirm, vary or set aside that order or make other orders as to costs as may be just: see ss 85(19A), 85(19B) and 85(19C). Curiously, it is not clear if the powers of such a judge are confined to matters of costs or whether they extend to directing that the Inquiry Committee’s determination that the complaint is frivolous or vexatious be reconsidered by that or some other Inquiry Committee.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) The matter ordinarily does not proceed to the next stage unless the Council determines that a formal investigation is necessary, in which case it shall apply to the Chief Justice to appoint a DT to hear and investigate the matter: see s 89(1). The DT will record its findings in relation to the facts and determine whether: (i) no cause of sufficient gravity for disciplinary action exists; (ii) while no cause of sufficient gravity for disciplinary action exists, the solicitor should be reprimanded, ordered to comply with remedial measures or ordered to pay a penalty; or (iii) cause of sufficient gravity for disciplinary action exists: see s 93(1). </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) Where the DT determines that cause of sufficient gravity for disciplinary action exists, the Law Society shall make an application for an order that the solicitor be struck off the roll, suspended, ordered to pay a penalty or censured. This application is heard by the Court of Three Judges: see ss 98(1) and 98(7).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 In the present case, the executors’ application seeks a review of the findings at step (b) of the process. The executors argue that, in addition to the Second Complaint, the Council ought to have sent the First, Third and Fourth complaints onwards to a formal investigation by a DT. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Role of the Inquiry Committee </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 In order to consider the executors’ arguments, the statutory duty of an IC must be understood. The statutory duty of the IC is to determine whether there is a <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> case of an ethical breach or misconduct of sufficient gravity that warrants formal investigation and consideration by a DT. Further, the IC may decline to make a recommendation that the matter be referred to a DT where, even if taken at face value, the matter would not raise sufficiently grave concerns as to warrant formal investigation: <span class="font-italic">Loh</span><span class="font-italic"> Der Ming Andrew v Law Society of Singapore </span>[2018] 3 SLR 837 (“<span class="font-italic">Andrew </span><span class="font-italic">Loh</span>”) at [68]. The Court of Appeal has explained in <span class="font-italic">Subbiah Pilla</span><span class="font-italic">i v Wong Meng Meng and others </span>[2001] 2 SLR(R) 556 (“<span class="font-italic">Subbiah Pillai</span>”) that the assessment conducted by the IC is “essentially a screening exercise”, and the function of the IC is “to eliminate frivolous complaints and to ensure that only complaints which have been <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> established will proceed to be heard formally”: at [59] and [32] respectively.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 The IC’s screening is to deal with two main issues, both of which are engaged in this application. First, to determine whether the matter is potentially of sufficient gravity. And second, to assess, on such a matter, whether a <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> case exists. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 For present purposes, it is useful to understand more fully the <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> standard that is the standard pertinent to the IC’s consideration. Under s 82A of the LPA, which is the analogous provision to s 96 for disciplinary proceedings against Legal Service Officers and non-practising solicitors, the Chief Justice may grant leave for an investigation to be made into the complaint of misconduct and appoint a DT where the Chief Justice is of the opinion that the applicant has made out a “<span class="font-italic">prima facie </span>case” for an investigation into his complaint: s 82A(6). In<span class="font-italic"> Re </span><span class="font-italic">Nalpon Zero Geraldo Mario </span>[2012] 3 SLR 440 (“<span class="font-italic">Re </span><span class="font-italic">Nalpon</span>”) at [27]–[29], Chan Sek Keong CJ held that the meaning of “<span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> case” in s 82A(6) of the LPA should be given the same meaning as in criminal proceedings because the standard of proof in criminal proceedings is proof beyond reasonable doubt. In the context of criminal proceedings, the consideration of whether a <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> case has been established occurs at the close of the Prosecution’s case<span class="font-italic">, before the judge hears the </span><span class="font-italic">Defence’s case</span>. At this point, there must be evidence, which is “not inherently incredible”, supporting every element of the offence: see s 230(<span class="font-italic">j</span>) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 2012 Rev Ed). Whilst there is cross-examination and testing by the Defence during the presentation of the Prosecution’s case, this goes towards determining whether the evidence is “inherently incredible”. As such, when a judge finds that there is a <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> case, the judge will not have heard the other side’s case. This is important as it means that the court will not have begun to engage in a substantial fact-finding exercise. Rather, the court will have determined that the Prosecution’s case theory is established based on the evidence before it, assuming that the evidence is not “inherently incredible”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 Sundaresh Menon CJ further elaborated on the meaning of “inherently incredible” in <span class="font-italic">Re </span><span class="font-italic">Parti Liyani</span> [2020] 5 SLR 1080 at [27], again in the context of an investigation into misconduct under s 82A(6) of the LPA:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">27 In other words, the question is whether the evidence, if accepted by the court, would be sufficient to prove every element of the offence in question, either directly as a primary fact, or inferentially as a secondary fact (<span class="font-italic">Re </span><span class="font-italic">Nalpon</span> at [22]–[24]). However, this does not mean that the court must, at this stage, unquestioningly accept all evidence proffered and instead may find that the evidence <span class="font-italic">is discredited or wholly unreliable</span>. Further, the court may not draw an inference from primary facts unless it is reasonable to do so (see [<span class="font-italic">Re </span><span class="font-italic">Salwant Singh s/o Amer Singh </span>[2019] 5 SLR 1037]<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [34]–[44]; <span class="font-italic">Re </span><span class="font-italic">Nalpon</span> at [25]). </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 The IC, therefore, considers the credibility and reliability of the evidence, and ensures that every aspect of the charge is supported by evidence that is not inherently incredible. The tasks of weighing up all the facts and coming to specific factual findings, on the other hand, are intended by statute to be placed upon the shoulders of the DT. The nature of the inquiry conducted by the IC, therefore, does not call for the IC to deal with substantial issues of fact and to make a definitive decision on those facts in contest.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Role of the Council </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 The IC, after its deliberations, submits a report to the Council, which considers the report and makes a determination.

Here, the court should be slow to disturb or interfere with the findings of fact by the IC unless it can be shown that supporting evidence was lacking, there was some misunderstanding of the evidence, or there are other exceptional circumstances to justify the court doing so.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 Both the supervisory and appellate jurisdiction are engaged in this review of the IC’s decisions on the First, Third and Fourth Complaints.

</div>
</div>
</div> In this context, I note that Tan Yock Lin’s text was published in 1998, and the author in the footnote for the paragraph cited a 1987 case, <span class="font-italic">Re </span><span class="font-italic">An Advocate and Solicitor </span>[1987] 2 MLJ 21 (“<span class="font-italic">Re An Advocate</span>”), which had discussed the issue “obliquely but inconclusively”. Both concerned earlier versions of the section in discussion.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 In the light of the two interpretations a plain reading of the text of s 87 of the LPA allows, I use the three-step framework structured by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Tan Cheng Bock v Attorney-General</span> [2017] 2 SLR 850 (“<span class="font-italic">Tan Cheng Bock</span>”) at [37] and [54(c)] as a guide to interpreting s 87: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) First, the possible interpretations of the provision must be ascertained, with regard to the text of the provision and the context of the provision within the statute as a whole. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Second, the legislative purpose or object of the statute must be ascertained. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Finally, the possible interpretations of the text should be compared against the purposes or objects of the statute, and the interpretation that furthers the purpose of the statute is to be preferred.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">(a) Possible interpretations </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 In the first step of ascertaining the possible interpretations of s 87, I am guided by the ordinary words of the provision, and endeavour to give significance to every word in the enactment: see <span class="font-italic">Tan Cheng Bock</span> at [38].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 The plain text of s 87 is able to support both interpretations put forth by the parties. Subsection (2), on its face, circumscribes subsection (1). The executors argue that this means that wherever the IC has recommended a formal investigation, the Council’s power is limited to making the same determination. As I have noted at [40] above, the Law Society argues that such an interpretation would render ss 87(1)(<span class="font-italic">d</span>), 87(1A) and 87(2) meaningless. However, this is incorrect because s 87(1)(<span class="font-italic">d</span>) may be used in all other circumstances; it is not rendered otiose on the executors’ interpretation of the section because it is only where the IC recommends a formal investigation that the Council is prevented from exercising the power under s 87(1)(<span class="font-italic">d</span>). Nevertheless, as the Law Society also points out, there appears to be nothing in the section that disallows the Council from referring the matter back to the IC under subsection (1)(<span class="font-italic">d</span>) prior to dealing with the matter under subsection (2); indeed, subsection (2) itself refers to the fact that an IC’s report could be “read with any … further report”, implying that the Council’s power to refer the matter back to the IC for reconsideration or a further report under subsection (1)(<span class="font-italic">d</span>) is not circumscribed. On the Law Society’s approach, the Council would be at liberty to pose queries to the IC even where an initial recommendation for a formal investigation is made. In such circumstances, it would then only be mandatory to send the matter to a DT where the IC, in its subsequent report, makes a recommendation for a formal investigation. In this context, the use of the word “any” is equivocal. It could suggest that there are situations where there could be no further report or response. This would occur wherever the Council chooses to act on the strength of the first report. The lacuna in the section is this: whilst making mandatory the Council’s duty to exercise its power to determine that there should be a formal investigation by a DT under subsection (1)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) wherever the IC recommends thus, it does not make clear whether the Council has the power to refer the matter back to the IC under subsection (1)(<span class="font-italic">d</span>) before this duty arises.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 Coming to the context of the section within its larger statutory framework, the executors point out that the scheme of the relevant LPA sections is to advance cases onward toward formal investigation. As summarised by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Iskandar</span> at [24]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Second, under ss 96 and 97, a dissatisfied <span class="font-italic">complainant</span> can apply to a Judge to advance the complaint to the next stage of proceedings while under ss 95 and 97, a dissatisfied <span class="font-italic">solicitor</span> can apply to a Judge to review the decision to impose a sanction on him where that sanction falls short of referring the proceedings to the next stage. Third, if the committee or tribunal refers the complaint to the next stage, a solicitor has no recourse and cannot prevent that from happening. <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">While this might appear to suggest a legislative preference for the complaint being advanced in the event of any doubt</span>, it would be wrong to view this as prejudicial to the solicitor in some way because this ultimately concerns a matter of public interest and the [Court of Three Judges (“C3J”)] retains full power to set aside the Disciplinary Tribunal’s determination and give further directions where appropriate. <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">A determination by any tribunal or committee, other than the C3J, is therefore not final and the solicitor retains the right to challenge all allegations against him before the C3J.</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis in original in italics; emphasis added in bold italics]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 The purpose of an IC, therefore, is to act as a screening device, as the Court of Appeal mentioned in <span class="font-italic">Subbiah Pillai</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>(see [25] above). Within this context, however, neither party’s reading detracts from the IC’s purpose. While permitting the Council to pose queries to the IC would take time, the Council is in any event bound by the timelines set out in subsection (1A), and the contours of its supervision must take reference from the IC’s role. Further, as the Law Society envisages, there are circumstances where there would be good reason for the Council to refer a complaint back to the IC:

It was inserted as subsection (1A) of s 88:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(1A) If the Inquiry Committee in its report recommends <span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">—</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) that there should be a formal investigation, then the Council shall determine accordingly under subsection (1) of this section; or </div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) that a formal investigation by a Disciplinary Committee is not necessary, the Council may, if it disagrees with the recommendation, request the Chief Justice to appoint a Disciplinary Committee.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 Subsection (1A)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) thereby puts a positive obligation upon the Council to “determine accordingly” wherever the IC has recommended a formal investigation, whereas subsection (1A)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) permitted the Council to disagree where the IC had recommended that a formal investigation was not necessary. The courts in <span class="font-italic">Law Society of Singapore v Chia Shih Ching James </span>[1983–1984] SLR(R) 596 (“<span class="font-italic">James Chia</span>”) at [16] and <span class="font-italic">R</span><span class="font-italic">e An Advocate </span>at 31–32 recognised that the Council no longer possessed the power to review and disagree with a recommendation of the IC that there should be a formal investigation; it was now required by the section to determine that there should be a formal investigation. The latter authority was the authority relied upon by Tan Yock Lin in his 1998 text: Tan Yock Lin at p 854. While neither case dealt specifically with the Council’s power to use subsection 1(<span class="font-italic">d</span>) prior to acting under subsection (1A)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>), subsection (1A)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) contained a clear direction as to what the Council was obliged to do once a recommendation for a formal investigation was made by the IC. With the clear direction given by subsection (1A)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>), neither of the options set out in subsection (1)(<span class="font-italic">d</span>) – referring the matter back to the IC or adjourning the matter for consideration – would have been appropriate. <span class="font-italic">Subsection (1A), in circumscribing the power of the Council </span><span class="font-italic">prescribed in subsection (1), further did not contain the words “read with any response or further report”</span>.

In 1993, the Legal Profession (Amendment) Act 1993 (Act 41 of 1993) amended the 1990 LPA. The main amendments included the addition of the phrase “reconsideration or a further report” into subsection (1)(<span class="font-italic">d</span>), and the addition of a new subsection (2A) which allowed the Council to prefer further charges or refer possible criminal offences to the police for investigation. In the Legal Profession Act (Cap 161, 2001 Rev Ed) (“the 2001 LPA”), subsection (2A) became subsection (3), and subsection (3) became subsection (4). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 The Legal Profession (Amendment) Act 2008 (Act 19 of 2008) then introduced several amendments (“the 2008 amendments”).

The phrase “read with any response or further report submitted under subsection (1A)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>)” was added to s 87(2) at the same time.

These include:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(e) Where the Law Society Council has determined under section 87(1)(<span class="font-italic">d</span>) of the Legal Profession Act that a matter be referred back to an Inquiry Committee for reconsideration or a further report, the Inquiry Committee should submit its response or further report within four weeks, and the Law Society Council should make a determination under section 87(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>), (<span class="font-italic">b</span>) or (<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the Legal Profession Act <span class="font-italic">within one month of the receipt of the response or further report</span>.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 The function of subsection (1A) was, therefore, to provide a stipulated timeline in cases where the Council has referred a matter back to the IC, in view of the Committee’s concern for expedition. This militates against an interpretation that the Council was given fresh powers by the addition of the phrase “read with any response or further report submitted under subsection (1A)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>)” to subsection (2). Rather, in the light of the fact that subsection (1A) was procedural in nature, the phrase “read with any response or further report submitted under subsection (1A)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>)” must have been an ancillary amendment designed to harmonise the language of subsections (2) and (3) with the addition of subsection (1A). This is why subsection (2) does not make clear that, in situations where the IC has recommended a formal investigation, the Council still has the power to refer the matter back to the IC for a further report, and instead merely provides for the situation where the Council has already done so (by providing that the IC’s report should be read with any response or further report <span class="font-italic">submitted</span> under subsection (1A)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>)). This suggests that the draftsman envisaged that there would remain situations where no further report could be requested by the Council. This position is supported by the Explanatory Statement in the Legal Profession (Amendment) Bill (Bill No 16/2008), which states that the “amendments to section 87(2) and (3) … are <span class="font-italic">consequential</span>” [emphasis added] to the addition of s 87(1A). </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">(c) Interpretation consonant with legislative purpose</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 In the light of the legislative history of the section and the specific purpose of the 2008 amendments, I conclude that the executors are correct in their interpretation of the section. The section was specifically amended in 1979 to circumscribe the Council’s power under subsection (1), by the insertion of what is now subsection (2). At the time of the insertion, the words of the new subsection (2) limited the Council’s use of subsection (1)(<span class="font-italic">d</span>) whenever an IC had recommended a formal investigation. When the subsection was further amended in 2008, the draftsman, by stating in subsection (2) that the IC’s report should be “read with <span class="font-italic">any</span> response or further report” [emphasis added], then provided for situations where there would be no further report, either if the Council agreed with the IC’s findings on its first report, or if the IC recommended a formal investigation in its first report. The circumstances surrounding the amendment of this section indicate that the addition of the phrase “read with any response or further report” was a harmonising amendment to accommodate the timelines for such further reports <span class="font-italic">in circumstances </span><span class="font-italic">where the Council had the power to refer the matter back to the IC for a further report</span>, and not one which was intended to enable the Council to refer the matter back to the IC using subsection (1)(<span class="font-italic">d</span>) where previously it was not able to do so. To read the section in this manner is consistent with the role of the IC to act as a screening device to ensure that complaints which have been <span class="font-italic">prima facie </span>established will proceed to be formally investigated by a DT (see [25] above), and sharpens the emphasis on the DT being the fact-finding tribunal. As highlighted by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Iskandar</span> at [24], the solicitor is not prejudiced by the complaint being advanced to the next stage in this manner because the Court of Three Judges retains full power to set aside the DT’s determination.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 In this case, the Council, therefore, had an obligation to accept the IC’s recommendation in the First IC Report that there should be a formal investigation by a DT in respect of the First Complaint. In my judgment, it was procedurally defective on the Council’s part to refer the matter back to the IC, and the Council was consequently not able to accept and adopt the IC’s findings in the Second IC Report. The charge as framed by the IC in the First IC Report should be dealt with in a formal investigation by a DT following the procedure envisaged by the LPA.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The substantive issue</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 In any event, even if the Council had the power to pose queries and seek a further report from the IC, I am of the view that on these particular facts, the Council ought not to have accepted the findings of the IC in the Second IC Report.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Facts relevant to the substantive issue</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 In the First IC Report, the IC had found a <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> case of an ethical breach, and noted that since Mr Lee has passed on, the only basis on which the complaint could be assessed was the documents and the responses provided by Ms Kwa to the IC.

</div>
</div> With regards to the first issue, the IC noted that Ms Kwa was unable to respond in a direct manner, and that she could not precisely recall what Mr Lee had said to her, but she was sure that he had wanted to make sure that the wills were invalidated so as to avoid confusion over which document was his last and final will, and did not prescribe a specific method.

</div>
</div> As such, this was of little use to the IC. Instead, the IC noted that the 21 December 2011 File Note handwritten by Ms Kwa stated the First Will had been torn up, and observed that even if this meant that Mr Lee had instructed Ms Kwa to tear up the First Will, it did not mean this instruction necessarily extended to the Second to Sixth Wills. However, the IC then looked at the various occasions where Ms Kwa had used the words “destroy” or “tore up” with regard to the wills.

</div> Ms Kwa explained that she used the word “destroy” in a colloquial manner to explain the impact of revocation of a will to lay persons. The IC noted that the executors are English-educated and would have understood terms such as “revocation”, “invalidate” and “supersede”, and as such the colloquial use of the word “destroy” was unnecessary. Nonetheless, the IC accepted that Ms Kwa had used the word “destroy” informally.

</div>
</div> Further, the IC also reconsidered the 21 December 2011 File Note where Ms Kwa had said she “tore up” Mr Lee’s First Will. The IC noted that it appeared that Ms Kwa had forgotten why her note had said that the First Will was torn up due to the passage of time, and thus declined to infer that Mr Lee had instructed Ms Kwa to physically destroy the First Will.

</div> Finally, the IC found that even if the First Will had been torn up or physically destroyed, it would have been necessary for Ms Kwa to have copies of Mr Lee’s other wills as she regularly needed to refer to them when he asked her about their contents.

</div> In summation, the IC stated that there was not enough documentary evidence to demonstrate that Mr Lee had expressly intended for all his prior wills to be physically destroyed or torn up by Ms Kwa, or to demonstrate that Mr Lee had expressly instructed Ms Kwa to revoke his prior wills by means of physical destruction.

The Council’s first question asked whether there was any difference between physical destruction and invalidation of a will. The second question asked whether there would be any wrongdoing by a solicitor who complied with the intention to revoke but did not destroy the will as he wished to maintain a file copy. Implicit in the second question is a solicitor’s duty to keep proper records (and the particular client’s frequent reference to those records in the present case).

</div> Whether Mr Lee had given such an instruction and whether this remained his instruction throughout the preparation of the six wills were factual issues. As the IC had initially concluded that there was a <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> case on these issues, their statutory role was not to make a finding on this factual issue, but merely to channel it to the proper fact-finding body: the DT: see [29] above, and on a related note, <span class="font-italic">Tan Ng </span><span class="font-italic">Kuang and another v Law Society of Singapore </span>[2020] SGHC 127, at [7]–[9] and [17].

Counsel agreed at the hearing that the applicable rule is r 12 of the 2010 version of the PCR, the Legal Profession (Professional Conduct) Rules (GN No S 156/1998, 2010 Rev Ed) (“the 2010 PCR”). Rule 12 was a broad rule that required an advocate and solicitor to “use all reasonably available legal means consistent with the agreement pursuant to which he is retained to advance his client’s interest”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 In line with the wider context of r 12, at the time of the alleged breaches, the keeping of good records was a matter of prudent practice.

Specifically, the court observed that proceedings against a solicitor could be thwarted if they had kept such records and notes, and that these notes and records could be of “real assistance in clarifying matters and corroborating a solicitor’s testimony in the event of a dispute over what has transpired” (at [63]). Therefore, the issue was not one of technical observance but of a holistic assessment of the solicitor’s conduct and his ability to explain his conduct. In <span class="font-italic">Lie </span><span class="font-italic">Hendri Rusli</span> the High Court explained at [63] that “all that can fairly be said of the absence of contemporaneous notes is that the solicitor may find himself handicapped when the credibility of his evidence is assessed”. The High Court in <span class="font-italic">Law Society of Singapore v </span><span class="font-italic">Tan Phuay Khiang</span> [2007] 3 SLR(R) 477 at [83] dealt with the issue in similar terms.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Whether r 12 of the 2010 PCR was breached</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 I take in turn the contentions regarding each communication. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">71 The first was a call on 29 November 2013, mentioned in an email dated 30 November 2013 in which Ms Kwa recounted that she had called Mr Lee the day before.

</div>
</div> The second possibility is that there was a call, with no record taken. Would this be a breach of Ms Kwa’s duty to advance her client’s interest under r 12 of the 2010 PCR? It is pertinent to note that the subject of the conversation was to be how to deal with the escalation of value of the Oxley property in the event that it was de-gazetted and redeveloped. After the weekend following these emails, however, the subject of the conversation appeared to have been overtaken by events. On Tuesday, 17 December 2013, Ms Kwa was informed by Mrs Lee Suet Fern, Mr LHY’s wife, and Ms Wong Lin Hoe  from Mr Lee’s office (“Ms Wong”) that a new will revoking all previous wills had been signed by Mr Lee.

</div>
</div> As she was told by Mrs Lee Suet Fern that the new will went back to Mr Lee’s 2011 will, Ms Kwa would have realised that the conversation on the potential escalation of the price of the Oxley property was no longer relevant. The issue pertained to the deletion of the Demolition Clause and the anticipated redevelopment of the Oxley property, which featured in the Fifth and Sixth Wills in 2012 but not the First and Second Wills in 2011. Further, there was an instruction on 17 December 2013 from Mr Lee to Ms Wong to inform Ms Kwa that the contents of the Final Will reflected “the agreement between the siblings”.

</div> Her client at this point in time was Mr Lee, and by 17 December 2013, there was no further interest of his to pursue at that point in relation to the call, if it had taken place.

Further, while the 4 June 2015 Email did not mention the contents of the 30 November 2013 email from Ms Kwa to Mr Lee, this omission did not, in the IC’s opinion, seem relevant as there was no dispute on the veracity and/or completeness of the Sixth Will.

The Final Will contained changes regarding the shares allocated to each beneficiary and the demolition of the Oxley property. The emails of 30 November 2013 and 12 December 2013 reflected Mr Lee’s concerns about both these issues. However, Ms Kwa did not describe or attach these emails. In addition, Ms Kwa stated that after Mr Lee had signed his Sixth Will, “he did not instruct [her] to change his Will”. This representation was not correct, as the November and December 2013 Emails show instructions from Mr Lee to Ms Kwa regarding changes to his Sixth Will: the 12 December email suggests the addition of a codicil to change the shares given to each child, and the 13 December email mentions another codicil regarding carpets in the Oxley property. In fact, the IC had stated as much, noting that the 12 and 13 December 2013 emails suggested that Mr Lee had instructed Ms Kwa to prepare a codicil to the Sixth Will.

The 22 June 2015 Email made a representation that was not true, and omitted to answer fully the specific question that was repeated. The issue is whether these emails should be characterised as false and misleading, and the executors submit that they should be so characterised. As the executors point out, the IC contradicts itself in its First IC Report by stating that the “emails dated 12 and 13 December 2013 suggests [<span class="font-italic">sic</span>] that [Mr Lee] had instructed [Ms Kwa] to prepare a codicil to the 6th Will”, and then concluding that Ms Kwa’s statements were not false or misleading.

</div>
</div> These contentions require consideration of three issues before any inferences as to Ms Kwa’s deliberate intention or negligence may be made. First, in the 22 June Email, sent to answer a specific request on the background to the Final Will dated 17 December 2013, Ms Kwa was able to produce email chains from Mrs Lee Suet Fern dated 16 December 2013, which were sent only three days after the last of the 13 December 2013 emails. It is then possible, the executors argue, to draw an inference that Ms Kwa would have gone through her emails thoroughly from that time period regarding that subject, and should have come across the 30 November and 12 and 13 December 2013 emails. Second, both requests and emails were sent after Mr Lee’s passing in 2015. By this time, there was an ongoing public discussion regarding his wishes in relation to the Oxley property and she would have been aware of the significance of all of his wishes in relation to the equal shares of the beneficiaries and the Oxley property. Lastly, the executors point to the fact that while Ms Kwa could have corrected any misimpression at any time after 22 June 2015, she only disclosed these emails when requested, and almost four years later, in March 2019.
                   <sup><button class="btn btn-link superscript-btn" data-target="#fn-c11bd8dd-de55-4572-9efd-1201e37cfb20" data-toggle="modal" type="button">69</button></sup>

</div>
</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">90 To complete the picture, I would add that the IC’s implicit assumption that Ms Kwa did not intend to make any false and misleading statement is also a plausible one. I frame it as an implicit assumption, because the IC, on the one hand, acknowledged in its analysis that Ms Kwa’s statement was not correct, and yet, on the other hand, rested their conclusion on the fact that no codicil to the Sixth Will was in fact drafted by Ms Kwa.

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> It appears that they drew the inference that she had inadvertently forgotten about the instructions from Mr Lee, it became unnecessary for her to act on the email, and his Sixth Will had been superseded. Premised on this, the IC concluded that there was insufficient evidence, in their words, “even at a <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> level”, to find that Ms Kwa’s 22 June 2015 Email was false and misleading. This conclusion made it unnecessary for the IC to consider whether any ethical duty was breached. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">91 There is thus a range of possibilities as to what inference should properly be drawn. What is relevant here is that the task of the IC would not have been to make the inference as to Ms Kwa’s intention, but to assess <span class="font-italic">whether</span> there was a <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> case that ought to have been tested by a tribunal of fact to consider whether such an inference should be made. This is because the particular inferences to be drawn in this case would require a consideration of Ms Kwa’s defence and her explanation on cross-examination. The task of drawing such inferences would fall on a DT during a formal investigation, where cross-examination would be crucial to the assessment of whether Ms Kwa’s omissions and misstatement were deliberate, negligent or inadvertent. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">92 A further point is that on the issue of negligence, the standard of professionalism expected in the particular circumstances, in the light of the specific queries posed and then repeated, must also be established by a DT. Negligence could, in appropriate circumstances, amount to an ethical breach, and the factual backdrop is of paramount importance in this assessment: see <span class="font-italic">Lie </span><span class="font-italic">Hendri Rusli</span> at [42]. The executors have relied upon rr 2 and 12 of the 2010 PCR. Law Society argued in passing at the hearing that r 12 is engaged in the context of advancing a client’s interest and the executors were not Ms Kwa’s clients. They did not elaborate on this argument or the relationship between Ms Kwa and the executors in their further submissions, nor did they deal with r 2 of the 2010 PCR, which the executors also relied upon. The specific duty must be considered in the context of the professional standard to be expected. <span class="font-italic">Udeh</span><span class="font-italic"> Kumar</span>’s statements were in the context of his duty to the court under r 56 of the PCR. <span class="font-italic">Chiong</span><span class="font-italic"> Chin May Selena’</span>s<span class="font-italic"> </span>her statements were to her client. In this context, two points are relevant. First, the finding of the IC on the Second Complaint was that Ms Kwa owed duties to the estate of Mr Lee and his executors; and amongst these duties, a duty of confidentiality. Second, the misleading statements were made in the circumstances of the possible breach of this duty of confidentiality. The standard of due care applicable to these circumstances should be considered by the same DT charged with formally investigating the Second Complaint. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">93 I therefore hold that a <span class="font-italic">prima </span><span class="font-italic">facie</span> case on a matter of sufficient gravity for formal investigation is established for the Fourth Complaint. The charge should rest on s 83(2)(<span class="font-italic">h</span>) of the LPA. For the avoidance of doubt, I add that the DT is not bound by my assessment of the evidence before me. Their consideration of the matter will be <span class="font-italic">de novo</span>, and the heads of complaint may be appropriately reframed: <span class="font-italic">Andrew </span><span class="font-italic">Loh</span> at [174].</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">94 I grant an order directing the Law Society to apply to the Chief Justice for the appointment of a DT in relation to the First and Fourth Complaints. The charge for the First Complaint should be as framed by the IC in the First IC Report. The charge for the Fourth Complaint should rest on s 83(2)(<span class="font-italic">h</span>) of the LPA. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">95 The executors have been substantially successful. The Law Society was discharging its regulatory function in its defence of the application; in the usual case, costs would not be ordered against it: see <span class="font-italic">Law Society of Singapore v Top Ten Entertainment Pte Ltd</span> [2011] 2 SLR 1279 at [24]; <span class="font-italic">CBB v Law Society of Singapore </span>[2021] 3 SLR 513 at [15]–[18]. Parties are at liberty to write in within two weeks if they require an order on costs or any consequential directions.</div><table class="table table-sm table-borderless"><tbody><tr><td><div class="txt-body text-left">Valerie Thean<br/>Judge of the High Court</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-left"></div></td></tr></tbody></table><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Abraham Vergis SC and Asiyah binte Ahmad Arif (Providence Law Asia LLC) for the plaintiffs;</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">P Padman (KSCGP Juris LLP) for the defendant;</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Lim Gerui and Sam Yi Ting (Drew &amp; Napier LLC) for non-party (watching brief)</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
