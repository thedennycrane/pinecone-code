</div> To this, Goldbell contended that it had already paid $156,387.34 earlier and that any claim for variation works should be set off against the sums earlier paid. Range, without substantially disputing whether Goldbell had indeed previously paid $156,387.34, argued that Goldbell should have raised this contention earlier in its payment response. Having failed to do so, Goldbell was not allowed to now rely on such a contention. Ultimately, the adjudicator found in favor of Goldbell, and determined that $156,387.34 had been paid earlier.

</div> The SOP Act, it was submitted, only allowed for loss and expense claims to be claimed where they related to the value of construction works done. Liquidated damages, being more in the nature of compensatory damages for breach of contract, were not strictly payment claims<span class="font-italic"> for construction work</span><span class="font-italic"> done</span>. As such, they were not claimable under the SOP Act. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">14 This argument was fundamentally misconceived. Liquidated damages were never meant to be part of any contractor’s payment claim. Liquidated damages are claimed by <span class="font-italic">employers </span>who would be expected to articulate their entitlement in a payment response. The adjudicator’s jurisdiction to consider liquidated damages therefore flows from the fact that these were listed in an employer’s payment response: s 17(3)(<span class="font-italic">d)</span> of the SOP Act. Here, the liquidated damages were clearly described in Goldbell’s payment response.

</div> The adjudicator had therefore, been well within his jurisdiction to take the liquidated damages into account. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">15 Range pressed the point. It cited <span class="font-italic">Coordinated Construction Co Pty Ltd v J M Hargreaves (NSW) Pty Ltd </span>[2005] NSWCA 228 at [42] (“<span class="font-italic">Coordinated Construction</span>”). This case stood for the proposition that a payment claim must relate to the carrying out of construction work. Therefore, a payment claim could not include sums which were “of their nature damages for breach”.

</div>
</div> On application of this rule, liquidated damages were not the proper subject of a payment claim and therefore should not have been considered by the adjudicator. But again, my previous difficulty with Range’s arguments persisted. Liquidated damages were never part of payment claims in the first place. And so the rule in <span class="font-italic">Coordinated Construction</span> (which determined what could or could not be validly claimed under a <span class="font-italic">payment claim</span>) was simply not applicable to liquidated damages at all. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">16 Even if I accepted that the rule in <span class="font-italic">Coordinated Construction </span>was applicable, I found Range’s argument unpersuasive. Indeed, <span class="font-italic">Coordinated Construction </span>served to damage rather than bolster Range’s arguments. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">17 There, the subcontractor claimed “delay damages” for delays owing to the contractor’s acts (<span class="font-italic">eg</span><span class="font-italic">, “</span>architectural design changes which impacted on contract programme”: <span class="font-italic">Coordinated Construction </span>at [8]). The adjudicator held in favour of the subcontractor, and the contractor sought to set aside the award. The contractor argued that delay damages should not have been part of the payment claim since they were not sums claimed for carrying out construction work. Accordingly, the adjudicator should not have considered these delay damages in his adjudication. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">18 The learned judge accepted that there was a distinction between payments claims for construction work (which would be part of the adjudicator’s jurisdiction) and claims for damages for breach (which would not): <span class="font-italic">Coordinated Construction </span>at [41]. But he went on to find that delay damages were “not of their nature damages for breach but rather [were] additional amounts which may become due and payable under the contract” (<span class="font-italic">Coordinated Construction </span>at [42]). Indeed, the learned judge was of the view that “any requirement … that the progress payment must be for construction work carried out or for related goods and services supplied should not be given a narrow construction or effect”, given that the contract expressly contemplated delay damages being included in the progress payments: <span class="font-italic">Coordinated Construction </span>at [40]. To that end, his reasoning was fortified by s 9(a) of New South Wales’ equivalent of the SOP Act (“NSW SOP Act”), which stated that the progress payment was “to be … calculated in accordance with the terms of the contract”: <span class="font-italic">Coordinated Construction </span>at [29] and [40]. Accordingly, the adjudicator’s determination was upheld.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">19 Singapore’s SOP Act too, provides that progress payments are to be “calculated in accordance with the terms of the contract”: s 6(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the SOP Act.

Much as how the subcontractor in <span class="font-italic">Coordinated Construction </span>was entitled to claim for delay damages in its payment claim, Goldbell too was entitled to set off the payment claim against its claim for liquidated damages. I therefore found that the adjudicator was within his jurisdiction to consider liquidated damages in assessing the adjudged sum. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">20 Range had another arrow in its quiver. It referred to the recent 2018 SOP Act amendments. Quoting parliamentary debates, Range argued that the pre-amendment regime saw many “complex claims … [involving] complicated prolongation costs, damages, losses or expenses when applying for adjudication”.

</div> On that reading, liquidated damages were not intended to be claimable and the adjudicator had exceeded his jurisdiction in considering matters that were not the proper subject of a payment claim. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">21 Range’s case was again, misguided. The “complicated prolongation costs, damages, losses or expenses” mentioned in the parliamentary debates did not refer to liquidated damages. Instead, they referred to the <span class="font-italic">contractor</span>’s damage claims for the <span class="font-italic">employer</span>’s actions. An employer may for example, have failed to acquire the appropriate permits to allow the contractor to begin work. Alternatively, the employer may have made a fundamental change in architectural design (as what happened in <span class="font-italic">Coordinated Construction</span>). These may cause the contractor to incur further costs. The contractor’s claims for these sorts of losses – sometimes referred to as “loss and expense claims” – were the true targets of the recently introduced s 17(2A) in the SOP Act (see also <span class="font-italic">Atkin’s Court Forms Singapore</span><span class="font-italic"> – Construction Contracts</span> vol 59 (LexisNexis, 2007) at para 103) As such, I did not consider the introduction of s 17(2A) of the SOP Act to be any signal of parliamentary disapproval of adjudicators considering liquidated damage claims under the SOP regime.  Accordingly, I dismissed this argument as well. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">No jurisdiction to designate a completion date</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">22 Range then argued that the adjudicator had acted in excess of his jurisdiction when designating a completion date. Here, “completion date” referred to the date when the HO Certificate ought to have been issued. Range                                                                                                                      argued that determining a completion date was a “complex inquiry with many moving parts” – an endeavour that the adjudicator should never have adopted.

</div> In the alternative, it argued that the adjudicator’s jurisdiction was limited by the parties’ wishes. The parties had expressly clarified and agreed that the adjudicator was not required to identify a completion date. The adjudicator should accordingly have restrained from doing so.

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>  I rejected these arguments for three reasons. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">23 First, the adjudicator’s actions were fully in keeping with the jurisdictional parameters set out by the SOP Act. An adjudicator’s jurisdiction under the SOP Act regime is found in s 17 of the SOP Act. Nowhere does it suggest that an adjudicator’s jurisdiction is limited by the complexity of the inquiry or shackled to the wishes of the parties. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 Second, the payment claims and payment responses inadvertently called on the adjudicator to identify a completion date. Range’s payment claim made reference to the first half of the retention sum. As discussed earlier (see [3]), determining Range’s entitlement to this may well have required the identification of a completion date. Similarly, Goldbell’s payment response cross-claimed for liquidated damages. That too involved identifying a completion date. Being envisaged in the payment claim and the payment response, the identification of a completion date would naturally have been within the adjudicator’s jurisdiction. Indeed, ss 17(3)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) and 17(3)(<span class="font-italic">d</span>) of the SOP Act explicitly provide that the adjudicator shall have regard to the payment claim and the payment response. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 Third, even if the adjudicator was bound by what the parties had agreed to, I find that Range had mischaracterized the adjudicator’s statements. The adjudicator never “acknowledged this constraint on his jurisdiction”.

</div> In that regard, Goldbell had acted well within the parameters of the given assignment.

</div> The adjudicator had therefore considered Range’s pleadings when he acknowledged its position. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 More importantly, I found that there were multiple possible explanations for the absence of any explicit reference to Range’s arguments. None of these explanations were particularly more compelling than the rest, much less capable of raising a “clear and virtually inescapable” inference. To illustrate, Range contended that its arguments about the TOP were a “key plank” in its case. The failure to reference such an important part of its pleadings in the AD raised an inference that the adjudicator had failed to consider it at all.

</div> But this may well be explained by the fact that the adjudicator simply did not share Range’s views on the importance of the TOP. Whether such a view is erroneous or not, is not the subject of this application. But it certainly provides an alternative explanation for the failure to make reference to Range’s “key” arguments – the adjudicator did not find them to be very “key” at all. This was not mere speculation. It was fairly apparent that the adjudicator placed emphasis on other matters instead (the 17 November Email for example,

</div> The adjudicator, in other words, “failed” to consider the “proper context” of the 17 November Email because Range never attempted to explain in the first place.

The jurisdictional objection was that Goldbell had not raised the partial payment in its payment response and neither was it brought up in response to anything that Range had raised. As such, Goldbell could not have relied on the partial payment in setting off the variation order claims, and neither could the adjudicator have taken heed of it. Crucially, Range was not contesting “the merits of Goldbell’s arguments or the [a]djudicator’s preference thereof”.

It referred to the adjudicator’s “general practice throughout his Adjudication Determination”.

</div> In that context, the failure to mention the jurisdictional objection – a deviation from the established structure of the AD – was supposedly evidence that he had overlooked it. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 I disagreed. It was not at all clear that this was necessarily the prevailing manner in which the AD had been organized. For example, when determining the sub-issue of whether the HO Certificate ought to have been issued, the adjudicator simply listed ten “relevant facts” and stated his findings.

</div> When determining whether the second half of the retention sum ought to have been released, his analysis weaved together references to Range’s case, the primary materials (<span class="font-italic">ie</span><span class="font-italic">, </span>the contractual provisions) and other evidence such as the “list of outstanding defects” that Goldbell produced.

</div> These go to show that there was simply no <span class="font-italic">consistent</span> structure that organized the AD. Range’s argument, which was founded on this fundamental premise, accordingly collapsed. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 Even if I accepted that the adjudicator failed to consider the jurisdictional objection altogether, I found that there had been simply no prejudice occasioned. Indeed, it is not the duty of the court to comb an AD pedantically, trawling for procedural defects and setting aside determinations on inconsequential technical breaches of natural justice: <span class="font-italic">Soh </span><span class="font-italic">Beng Tee &amp; Co Pte Ltd v Fairmount Development Pte Ltd </span>[2007] 3 SLR(R) 86 at [65].
