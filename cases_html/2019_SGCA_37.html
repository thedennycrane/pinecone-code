The amendment brought about two significant changes to the legal framework governing the sentencing of certain groups of those convicted of drug trafficking. First, it conferred upon a court the discretion to sentence an offender convicted of a drug trafficking offence that would ordinarily attract the imposition of the mandatory death penalty, to life imprisonment instead <span class="font-italic">if</span> the offender’s involvement in the offence was merely as a courier, as described in s 33B(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>), <span class="font-italic">and</span> the Public Prosecutor (“PP”) had issued a certificate of substantive assistance under s 33B(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) in respect of the offender. Second, it made it mandatory for the court to sentence an offender convicted of such an offence to life imprisonment <span class="font-italic">if</span> the offender’s involvement in the offence was merely as a courier, as described in s 33B(3)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>), <span class="font-italic">and</span> the offender was suffering from an abnormality of mind within the meaning of s 33B(3)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 The appellant in these appeals, Nagaenthran a/l K Dharmalingam, had been charged under s 7 of the MDA with importing not less than 42.72g of diamorphine on 22 April 2009. He was convicted after trial and his conviction was upheld by this court on appeal: see <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v Nagaenthran a/l K Dharmalingam </span>[2011] 2 SLR 830 (“<span class="font-italic">Nagaenthran (Trial)</span>”); <span class="font-italic">Nagaenthran a/l K Dharmalingam v Public Prosecutor </span>[2011] 4 SLR 1156 (“<span class="font-italic">Nagaenthran (</span><span class="font-italic">CA)</span>”). This was before the introduction of s 33B. The appellant was therefore sentenced to the mandatory death penalty which was applicable at the time. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">3 In <span class="font-italic">Prabagaran a/l Srivijayan v Public Prosecutor and other matters </span>[2017] 1 SLR 173 (“<span class="font-italic">Prabagaran</span>”), a motion was filed by the appellant, among other applicants, challenging the constitutionality of various subsections of s 33B. We noted there, at [8], that execution of the mandatory death sentence that had been imposed on the appellant had been stayed in view of the fact that the Government was, at the time of the appellant’s conviction and initial appeal, undertaking a review of the mandatory death penalty in relation to drug offences. That review eventually led to the enactment of the Amendment Act. Alongside the introduction of s 33B, the Amendment Act also provided a transitional framework for persons who had been convicted and sentenced to death under the MDA as it stood prior to the amendment, and had their appeal dismissed, to be resentenced under s 33B. The appellant accordingly filed Criminal Motion No 16 of 2015 (“CM 16”) on 24 February 2015, seeking to be re-sentenced to life imprisonment under s 33B(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) read with s 33B(3) of the MDA. It was common ground that the appellant met the requirements under s 33B(3)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) in that he was found to be a mere courier. The matter was heard before a High Court judge (“the Judge”) who dismissed CM 16 however, on the basis that the appellant was not suffering from an abnormality of mind within the meaning of s 33B(3)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>): see <span class="font-italic">Nagaenthran a/l K Dharmalingam v Public Prosecutor </span>[2017] SGHC 222 (“<span class="font-italic">Nagaenthran (</span><span class="font-italic">Criminal Motion)</span>”). Criminal Appeal No 50 of 2017 (“CCA 50”) is the appellant’s appeal against the dismissal of CM 16. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">4 Separately, on 10 December 2014, the PP had informed the court and the appellant’s counsel at the time that he would not be issuing a certificate of substantive assistance under s 33B(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the MDA in respect of the appellant (“the non-certification decision”). On 27 March 2015, the appellant filed Originating Summons No 272 of 2015 (“OS 272”) seeking leave to commence judicial review proceedings against the PP’s non-certification decision. This too was dismissed by the judge: see <span class="font-italic">Nagaenthran a/l K Dharmalingam v Attorney-General </span>[2018] SGHC 112 (“<span class="font-italic">Nagaenthran (</span><span class="font-italic">Judicial Review)</span>”). Civil Appeal No 98 of 2018 (“CA 98”) is the appellant’s appeal against the dismissal of OS 272. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Facts</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The appellant’s conviction</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">5 We do not propose to restate all the facts relating to the appellant’s conviction. Much of this has been set out in <span class="font-italic">Nagaenthran (</span><span class="font-italic">CA) </span>at [5]–[15] (reproduced in <span class="font-italic">Nagaenthran (</span><span class="font-italic">Criminal Motion) </span>at [9]). Very briefly, after officers from the Central Narcotics Bureau (“CNB”) apprehended the appellant on 22 April 2009 as he was entering Singapore from Malaysia at the Woodlands Checkpoint, the appellant stated quite unequivocally in his contemporaneous statements to the CNB officers that the bundle that was found strapped to his thigh contained heroin. When asked why the bundle had been strapped to his thigh, the appellant answered that a friend, who he called “King”, had done this so that no one else would find it. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">6 At trial however, the appellant denied having knowledge of the contents of the bundle. He claimed instead that King had only told him that the bundle contained “company spares” or “company product”: see <span class="font-italic">Nagaenthran (Trial)</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [10]. The appellant also advanced another assertion in his defence – that he had delivered the bundle under duress with King having put him under pressure. According to this version of the appellant’s case, King had slapped and punched the appellant when the latter tried to resist King’s attempts to strap the bundle onto his thigh. King had allegedly also threatened to kill the appellant’s girlfriend if he did not do as he was told and bring the bundle into Singapore: <span class="font-italic">Nagaenthran (Trial)</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [10]. Notably, however, these allegations were not in the contemporaneous statement he made after he was first arrested on 22 April 2009.     </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">7 At the conclusion of the trial, on 22 November 2010, the appellant was found guilty and accordingly sentenced to death. The trial Judge made a number of findings including the following: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The appellant’s contemporaneous statements to the CNB officers had been provided voluntarily and recorded accurately: <span class="font-italic">Nagaenthran (Trial)</span> at [33].</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The appellant’s allegations that King had assaulted him and threatened to kill his girlfriend if he did not deliver the drugs into Singapore were fabricated. He therefore failed to establish the defence of duress: <span class="font-italic">Nagaenthran (Trial)</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [18]–[19].</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) The appellant had actual knowledge of the contents of the bundle he had been tasked with delivering, namely, that it contained diamorphine: <span class="font-italic">Nagaenthran (Trial)</span> at [33]. This finding was based largely on the appellant’s contemporaneous statement to the CNB officers, where he had stated unequivocally that the bundle strapped to his thigh contained heroin.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">8 On appeal, we affirmed all of the aforementioned findings: see <span class="font-italic">Nagaenthran (</span><span class="font-italic">CA) </span>at [18]–[19]. The mandatory death sentence was therefore upheld.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The appellant files CM 16 </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">9 After his conviction, while awaiting execution of his sentence, the appellant was referred in March 2013 to Dr Kenneth Koh of the Institute of Mental Health for a forensic psychiatric evaluation. This was for the purpose of assessing the appellant’s suitability for resentencing under s 33B(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) read with s 33B(3) of the MDA.  In his report dated 11 April 2013, Dr Koh noted the appellant’s account that King had assaulted him and threatened to kill his girlfriend if he did not deliver the bundle of drugs into Singapore. Dr Koh took the view that the appellant “had no mental illness at the time of the offence” and was “not clinically mentally retarded”. Dr Koh also acknowledged that the appellant’s “borderline range of intelligence” might have caused him to be more susceptible than a person of normal intelligence to over-estimating the reality of King’s alleged threat to kill his girlfriend. That said, Dr Koh concluded that the appellant’s borderline range of intelligence “would not have diminished his ability to appreciate that the package that was taped to his thigh would most likely have contained drugs and that bringing this to Singapore was illegal”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">10 The appellant was subsequently referred to a psychiatrist in private practice, Dr Ung Eng Khean, for a psychiatric assessment in support of the appellant’s re-sentencing application in CM 16. Dr Ung assessed the appellant on 19 April and 19 July 2016. In his report of 22 August 2016, Dr Ung noted the appellant’s claim that he had lied to Dr Koh when the latter had assessed him in March 2013. The appellant’s account to Dr Ung was that he had agreed to deliver the drugs for King, whom he referred to as his “boss”, because he was desperate for money and felt compelled to obey King out of a mixture of loyalty, awe, fear and gratitude. The appellant did not mention that King had threatened to kill his girlfriend.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">11 In the light of Dr Ung’s 22 August 2016 report, Dr Koh referred the appellant to Dr Patricia Yap, principal clinical psychologist at the Institute of Mental Health, for a neuropsychological assessment to explore whether the appellant could have been suffering from Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (“ADHD”). Dr Yap assessed the appellant between November 2016 and January 2017, and issued a report dated 1 February 2017. What is relevant for the present purposes is the appellant’s account to Dr Yap of the reasons for his offending. This took the form of his claim that he was a member of a gang, and that he had volunteered to transport the drugs on behalf of a fellow gang member who was reluctant to do so, and that he had done so out of a misguided sense of gang loyalty and gratitude to his “boss”. He stressed that he had not been coerced into delivering the drugs; he had acted voluntarily. The appellant also recounted that he had reason to believe that the package he was tasked to carry contained drugs, and that he had known, at the time, of the death penalty for drug trafficking in Singapore. Nonetheless, although he did not know the specific quantity of drugs that would attract the death penalty, he did not think that the amount of drugs he was carrying was sufficient to attract it. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">12 Based on Dr Yap’s 1 February 2017 report, as well as Dr Ung’s 22 August 2016 report, Dr Koh himself prepared a report dated 7 February 2017, in which he concluded, among other things, that “[the appellant’s] borderline intelligence and concurrent cognitive deficits may have contributed toward his misdirected loyalty and poor assessment of the risks in agreeing to carry out the offence”.      </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Procedural history in relation to CA 98</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">13 The full procedural history relevant to CA 98 was set out by the Judge in <span class="font-italic">Nagaenthran (</span><span class="font-italic">Judicial Review) </span>at [10]–[28]. For the present purposes, it is only necessary to highlight a few points.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">14 After the amendments to the MDA came into effect on 1 January 2013, the appellant provided information to the PP, on 26 February 2013, by way of a voluntary statement for the purposes of allowing the PP to make a determination under s 33B(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the MDA as to whether the appellant had substantively assisted the CNB in disrupting drug trafficking activities within or outside Singapore (“the first set of information”): <span class="font-italic">Nagaenthran (</span><span class="font-italic">Judicial Review) </span>at [12]. It was common ground that the first set of information was not materially different to the information that the appellant had provided to the CNB officers in his contemporaneous statements at the time of his arrest in 2009.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">15 On 22 July 2013, Attorney-General Steven Chong Horng Siong (“AG Chong”), who was the PP at the time, considered the first set of information, additional information pertaining to operational matters, and the views of the CNB to determine whether, based on the first set of information, the appellant had substantively assisted the CNB in disrupting drug trafficking activities within or outside Singapore. AG Chong determined that the appellant had <span class="font-italic">not</span> substantively assisted the CNB in disrupting drug trafficking activities within or outside Singapore. The appellant was duly informed of the non-certification decision in August 2013: <span class="font-italic">Nagaenthran (</span><span class="font-italic">Judicial Review) </span>at [13]. For the avoidance of doubt, we digress to explain that the non-certification decision that was the subject of OS 272 was made after the appellant furnished a second set of information in November 2013.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">16 On separate occasions in November 2013, March 2015 and September 2015, the appellant provided the second, third and fourth sets of information respectively, each of which, we are given to understand, contained some new information not previously contained in the other. These sets of information were separately considered, together with additional information pertaining to operational matters, and the views of the CNB in relation to whether, based on the relevant set of information, the appellant had substantively assisted the CNB in disrupting drug trafficking activities within or outside Singapore. None of these sets of information, however, gave rise to the outcome the appellant sought, which was the issuance of a certificate of substantive assistance pursuant to s 33B(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the MDA.   </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Issues to be determined    </span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">CCA 50</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">17 The Judge found that the appellant was not suffering from an abnormality of mind within the meaning of s 33B(3)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the MDA (see [3] above). The issues that arise in CCA 50 correspond with the three cumulative requirements that the appellant would have to satisfy in order to be able to rely on the defence under s 33B(3)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>), namely:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) whether the appellant was suffering from an abnormality of mind;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) if he was, whether the abnormality of mind: (i) arose from a condition of arrested or retarded development of mind; (ii) arose from any inherent causes; or (iii) was induced by disease or injury; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) if (a) and (b) are answered affirmatively, whether the abnormality of mind substantially impaired his mental responsibility for his acts and omissions in relation to his offence.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">CA 98</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">18 In CA 98, the appellant pursues his application for leave to commence judicial review proceedings against the PP’s non-certification decision on the grounds that: (i) the PP did not take into account relevant considerations in arriving at his non-certification decision, and (ii) the PP arrived at his non-certification decision in the absence of a necessary precedent fact. First, however, the appellant had to show that s 33B(4) of the MDA did not preclude judicial review of the PP’s non-certification decision under s 33B(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) on those grounds. Accordingly, the issues in CA 98 were as follows:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) First, whether s 33B(4) of the MDA precluded judicial review of the PP’s non-certification decision under s 33B(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) on grounds other than bad faith or malice.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Second, and only if the answer to (a) is in the negative, whether the appellant has made out a <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> case of reasonable suspicion that the PP, in arriving at his non-certification decision: (i) failed to take into account relevant considerations; and (ii) acted in the absence of a necessary precedent fact.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">CCA 50</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">19 We first deal with CCA 50. Section 33B(3)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the MDA makes it mandatory for a court to sentence an offender convicted on a capital drug charge to life imprisonment where the offender can demonstrate that he suffered from an illness of the mind as described in the provision.

It appears to us to be wide enough to cover the mind’s activities in all its aspects, not only the perception of physical acts and matters, and the ability to form a<span class="font-italic"> </span>rational judgment as to whether an act is right or wrong, but also the ability to exercise the will power to control physical acts in accordance with that rational judgment.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 It is evident from that formulation that the nature of the inquiry as to whether there is an abnormality of mind is, necessarily, fact-sensitive and predicated on what the reasonable man would term as abnormal in all the circumstances. This, in turn, is typically analysed in terms of three aspects of the mind’s activities: the capacity to understand events, judge the rightness or wrongness of one’s actions, and exercise self-control: see Stanley Yeo, Neil Morgan, and Chan Wing Cheong, <span class="font-italic">Criminal Law in Malaysia and Singapore </span>(LexisNexis, 3rd Ed, 2018) at para 27.13. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 The respondent submits that an abnormality of mind in this context is established <span class="font-italic">only</span> if an offender is able to show that the abnormality in question falls within one of the aforementioned three aspects of the mind’s activities, namely<span class="font-italic">,</span> the capacity to understand events, judge the rightness or wrongness of one’s actions, and exercise self-control. In our judgment, however, that is not the correct reading of that passage in <span class="font-italic">Byrne</span>. Instead, we consider that Lord Parker’s formulation of an abnormality of mind is intended to be sufficiently wide to encompass “the mind’s activities <span class="font-italic">in all its aspects</span>”. Of course, these would include and to a large extent, consist of the mind’s capacity to understand events, judge right from wrong, and exercise self-control. However, we do not consider that these indicia are exhaustive of the mind’s activities in <span class="font-italic">all</span> its aspects. These will undoubtedly be helpful to guide and focus the inquiry on answering the critical question of whether the abnormality of mind in question had substantially impaired the offender’s mental responsibility for his acts and omissions in relation to his offence. And they are likely to be the most relevant and oft-used tools because they lead quite neatly to that critical question. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 In short, the offender’s capacity to understand events, judge right from wrong and exercise self-control will inevitably be quite accurate proxies of the extent of an offender’s ability to exercise his will power to control his physical acts. That is not to say, however, that there can be no other indicia or aspects of the mind’s activities that might have a bearing on the ultimate question of whether the offender’s mental responsibility for his acts was substantially impaired. In our judgment, an offender may, as a matter of principle, succeed in bringing himself within s 33B(3)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the MDA even if he were unable to pigeonhole the abnormality of mind he relies upon into one of the aforementioned three aspects of the mind’s activities in Lord Parker’s formulation, provided, he can show that his mental responsibility for his acts was substantially impaired as a result of this.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 We take this opportunity to emphasise two further points on the analysis under the first limb of s 33B(3)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>). The first is that past cases will have little precedential value when it comes to establishing whether a particular medical condition is an abnormality of mind within the meaning of the first limb. This, we think, must be the case, because it is for the court as the trier of fact to ascertain, on the totality of the specific facts before it, whether the offender was labouring under such an abnormality of mind. The judge as trier of fact might very well find assistance in the medical evidence. We stress, however, that the question is ultimately one for the finder of fact to answer, having regard to all the surrounding circumstances of the offender’s conduct and his offence. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 This segues into the second point, which is that the opinion of a medical professional on whether a particular condition is an abnormality of mind, whilst oftentimes useful, is not necessarily dispositive of the <span class="font-italic">legal</span> inquiry into whether an abnormality of mind has been established under the first limb. This is self-evident, but worth repeating nonetheless. It is trite that the verdict as to abnormality of mind must be founded on <span class="font-italic">all</span> the evidence, which evidence <span class="font-italic">includes</span> medical opinion: <span class="font-italic">Sek Kim Wah v Public Prosecutor </span>[1987] SLR(R) 371 (“<span class="font-italic">Sek Kim Wah</span>”) at [33]. In <span class="font-italic">Chua Jimmy</span> at [28], this Court adopted the approach in the Privy Council case of <span class="font-italic">David Augustus Walton v The Queen </span>[1978] AC 788 (“<span class="font-italic">Walton</span>”), in which Lord Keith stated at 793:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[U]pon an issue of diminished responsibility the jury are entitled and indeed bound to consider not only the medical evidence but evidence upon the whole facts and circumstances of the case. These include the nature of the killing, the conduct of the defendant before, at the time of and after it and any history of mental abnormality … what the jury are essentially seeking to ascertain is whether at the time of the killing the defendant was suffering from a state of mind bordering on but not amounting to insanity. That task is to be approached in a broad common sense way.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 The surrounding circumstances of the case, which include the nature of the killing, the conduct of the accused before, at the time of and after the offence, and any history of mental abnormality, may lead to the rejection of the medical evidence on whether the accused suffered from an abnormality of mind. Thus, in <span class="font-italic">Walton</span>, although the Prosecution did not lead medical evidence to challenge the medical evidence led by the accused, the Privy Council decided that the jury were entitled to conclude, as they did, that the defence of diminished responsibility had not been made out. Amongst other reasons, their Lordships considered the evidence as to the conduct of the accused before, during and after the killing, including a number of conflicting statements about it made by him to the police and to the psychiatrist who interviewed him after the offence (at 794). Further, the medical evidence may also be cast in doubt or rejected entirely where the factual basis upon which the medical opinion is premised is rejected at trial: see <span class="font-italic">R v Morgan, Ex parte Attorney-General </span>[1987] 2 Qd R 627 at 646, referring to <span class="font-italic">R v Wallace </span>[1982] Qd R 265.  This approach to the treatment of the medical evidence is plainly sensible because in the final analysis, whether an abnormality of mind has been established depends on whether, having regard to all the facts of a given case, the accused person’s state of mind was so different from that of ordinary human beings that the reasonable man would term it abnormal. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The second limb</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 In respect of the second limb of the three-limb test under s 33B(3)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>), it might at first blush seem from the text of that provision that the words in parenthesis, from which the second limb of the test emanates, are meant to be extensive rather than restrictive. Those words are “(whether arising from a condition of arrested or retarded development of mind or any inherent causes or induced by disease or injury)”. But, as we concluded in <span class="font-italic">Iskandar</span>, the words in parenthesis (there, in the context of Exception 7), ought to be read in a <span class="font-italic">restrictive</span> sense rather than an <span class="font-italic">extensive</span> one. In particular, we noted (at [85]) that at the second reading of the English Homicide Bill, which introduced the abnormality of mind defence under s 2(1) of the English Homicide Act 1957 (Cap 11) (the English equivalent of Exception 7), the Home Secretary stressed that the defence was only intended to cover those grave forms of abnormality of mind that might substantially impair responsibility, and was not intended to provide a defence to persons who were merely hot-tempered, or who, while otherwise normal, might commit murder in a sudden excess of rage or jealousy. Indeed, in the Queensland Court of Criminal Appeal decision of <span class="font-italic">R v Whitworth</span> [1989] 1 Qd R 437, Derrington J described the purpose behind the second limb as follows (see <span class="font-italic">Iskandar </span>at [87]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The purpose of the reference by the legislation to these specific causes of the relevant abnormality of mind is to exclude other sources, such as intoxication, degeneration of control due to lack of self-discipline, simple transient, extravagant loss of control due to temper, jealousy, attitudes derived from upbringing and so on. The feature which has most exercised the attention of the courts on this subject is <span class="font-italic">the necessity to avoid the extension of the defence to the occasion where there is an abnormality of mind to the required degree and producing the required impairment, but where it is due only to personal characteristics which are not outside the control of the accused and which do not come within the nominated causes</span>. … [emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 We recognise that what was said in <span class="font-italic">Iskandar </span>concerning the rationale for treating the second limb as restrictive rather than extensive was said in the context of the defence of diminished responsibility to murder. But in our judgment, that applies with equal force in the context of s 33B(3)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the MDA. We are satisfied that Parliament did not intend for s 33B(3)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) to apply to offenders suffering from transient or even self-induced illnesses that have no firm basis in an established psychiatric condition that arose from an arrested or retarded development of mind, any inherent root cause, or was induced by disease or injury. We note in this regard that in introducing s 33B(3)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the MDA, the Minister for Law, Mr K Shanmugam, in <span class="font-italic">Singapore Parliamentary Debates</span>, <span class="font-italic">Official Report </span>(14 November 2012) vol 89 stated that “[i]t [was] not our intention to extend this to those who do not suffer from a recognised and proven psychiatric condition.” The Minister further elaborated:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">On the second exception on diminished responsibility, some Members spoke on this.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The law in this area has recently been set out by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Ong Pang Siew v.

The plain words of s 33B(3)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the MDA require that the offender’s abnormality of mind be of such an extent as to have substantially impaired his mental responsibility for his acts or omissions in relation to the offence. As we have said in <span class="font-italic">Ong Pang Siew</span> (at [64]), what in fact amounts to a substantial impairment of mental responsibility is largely a question of commonsense to be decided by the trial judge as the finder of fact. It is especially the case in this context that while medical evidence would be important in determining the presence and/or extent of impairment, whether an accused’s mental responsibility was substantially impaired is ultimately a question of fact that is to be decided by the court based on all the evidence before it: <span class="font-italic">Zailani bin Ahmad </span><span class="font-italic">v Public Prosecutor </span>[2005] 1 SLR(R) 356 (at [52]), cited in <span class="font-italic">Ong Pang Siew</span> (at [64]). Substantial impairment in this context does not require total impairment; but nor would trivial or minimal impairment suffice. What is required is an impairment of the mental state that is real and material but which need not rise to the level of amounting to the defence of unsoundness of mind under s 84 of the Penal Code: see <span class="font-italic">Juminem</span> at [30]. Further, the requirement of substantial impairment does not entail that the offender’s abnormality of mind must be the <span class="font-italic">cause</span> of his offending. Instead, the question is whether the abnormality of mind had an <span class="font-italic">influence </span>on the offender’s actions: <span class="font-italic">Phua Han Chuan Jeffery v Public Prosecutor </span>[2016] 3 SLR 706 at [16].</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Our decision</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 Leaving aside the first and second limbs of s 33B(3)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>), which would also have to be established for the appellant to succeed in CCA 50, as we indicated to counsel for the appellant, Mr Eugene Thuraisingam, in the course of the oral arguments, it was plain to us that the appellant would face insurmountable difficulties in establishing the third limb, given the evidence in this case. Specifically, we were unable to accept, even if we were to assume in his favour, that the appellant suffered from an abnormality of mind within the meaning of s 33B(3)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>), this had the effect of substantially impairing his mental responsibility for his acts.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 The Judge, in fact, found that the appellant had not established the third limb, making the same assumptions in his favour in respect of the first two limbs: <span class="font-italic">Nagaenthran (</span><span class="font-italic">Criminal Motion) </span>at [87]. It is evident that the Judge (at [88]) was particularly troubled by the fact that the appellant had, at various points in time, provided vastly different and irreconcilable accounts of why he had committed the offence:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">88 The [appellant] has, at various points in time from his arrest till now, furnished vastly distinct accounts of why he had committed the offence:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(a) When the [appellant] was first arrested, he admitted in his contemporaneous statement that he knew that the Bundle contained heroin which he was delivering for King. He also stated that he had to deliver the heroin as he owed King money and was promised another RM500 after delivery.

The [appellant] then claimed that he had made the delivery under duress – King had assaulted him and threatened to kill his girlfriend unless he made the delivery (see [9] above). The [appellant] repeated this account to Dr Koh when he was examined in [<span class="font-italic">sic</span>] on 14 and 21 March 2013. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(c) When the [appellant] was examined by Dr Ung on 19 April and 19 July 2016, he claimed that he had lied to Dr Koh. He had agreed to deliver the heroin for King because he was desperate for money, having owed a loanshark money. He was also motivated to obey King by a mixture of loyalty, awe, fear and gratitude. While he claimed that King possessed a gun, he omitted any mention of any threat to his girlfriend. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(d) When the [appellant] was examined by Dr Yap in the period from November 2016 to January 2017, he claimed that he belonged to a gang and had volunteered to deliver the Bundle on behalf of a fellow gang member who was reluctant to do so. He explained that he did so out of his loyalty to the gang and his gratitude to his gang leader, who had provided him with emotional and financial support. He emphasised that he was not coerced into performing the delivery. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 In <span class="font-italic">Nagaenthran (</span><span class="font-italic">CA) </span>at [33], we upheld the Judge’s finding that the defence of duress was not established. We also agree with the Judge’s rejection of the appellant’s alternative account (see <span class="font-italic">Nagaenthran (</span><span class="font-italic">Criminal Motion) </span>at [91]), namely, that he had transported the bundle out of a misguided sense of gang loyalty. This account has all the marks of being an afterthought, since it only emerged in late 2016. Consequently, the Judge was left, in his own words, with “no factual basis on which to make any … finding of substantial impairment”: <span class="font-italic">Nagaenthran (</span><span class="font-italic">Criminal Motion) </span>at [87].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 In our judgment, the appellant’s vacillation between various accounts of why he had committed the offence – from being in desperate need of money, to being coerced under duress by King (an account that we flatly rejected in <span class="font-italic">Nagaenthran (</span><span class="font-italic">CA)</span>), to acting out of a misguided sense of gang loyalty – did not aid his case at all. Most importantly, the subsequent accounts contradicted the original account of the reason for his offending which he had provided in his contemporaneous statement to the CNB officers.

It was corroborated by the fact that the drugs were subsequently found to be diamorphine, the street name of which is heroin. It was also against the appellant’s interest and there is no reason to think it was not true. Furthermore, in his submissions, Mr Thuraisingam accepted that the appellant was neither labouring under a threat from King nor acting out of a misguided sense of loyalty to his gang. In other words, he proceeded on what was the original account of the reason for the appellant’s offending – that the appellant had committed the offence because he needed money. Mr Thuraisingam nonetheless submitted that the appellant’s mental responsibility for his acts in relation to the offence was substantially impaired. To that end, Mr Thuraisingam submitted that this was so because the appellant’s internal rationality and <span class="font-italic">ability to assess the </span><span class="font-italic">relevant risks</span> appropriately were impaired. Mr Thuraisingam relied on the following aspects of the expert evidence in support of his thesis:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) First, Dr Koh, in his 7 February 2017 report (at [12] above), had concluded, among other things, that “[the appellant’s] borderline intelligence and concurrent cognitive deficits may have contributed toward his misdirected loyalty and poor assessment of the risks in agreeing to carry out the offence”. Dr Koh had also testified that the appellant would have been impaired in his internal rationality and more specifically, his ability to appropriately assess the risks of his actions, thereby causing him to focus on his immediate needs at the expense of considering the future consequences of his actions:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Q Now, when you say that his executive functioning skills were impaired, that is also an abnormality of the mind, correct?</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">A Yes.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Q And you have agreed that this abnormality of the mind affects decision-making, correct?</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">A It is---it is part of decision-making.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Q Yes.

There was a total preoccupation with the short and immediate term with little regard of the long-term consequences of his action.”  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 In our judgment, Mr Thuraisingam’s submission on this point must fail. We begin with the narrative provided by the appellant in his contemporaneous statement to the CNB officers at the time he was first arrested.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 The Judge held from that account (see [37] above) that the appellant’s mental responsibility for his offence could not have been substantially impaired. This was because the appellant clearly understood the nature of his acts and did not lose his sense of judgment of the rightness or wrongness of what he was doing. We agree. To begin with, the appellant was unequivocal in identifying the contents of the bundle as diamorphine or heroin. It was also evident that he knew that it was unlawful for him to be transporting the drugs. That was why he candidly admitted concealing the bundle by strapping it to his left thigh and then attempting to conceal this under the large pair of trousers he wore; he said that this was done for his own safety so that no one would find the bundle. Most pertinently, despite knowing the unlawfulness of his acts, he nonetheless undertook the criminal endeavour so as to enable him to pay off some part of his debt to King and receive a further sum of $500 from King after the delivery. This evidenced a deliberate, purposeful and calculated decision on the part of the appellant in the hope that the endeavour would pay off, despite the obvious risks that the appellant himself had appreciated. The appellant had considered the risks, balanced it against the reward he had hoped he would get, and decided to take the chance. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 Mr Thuraisingam eventually conceded that this was a case of a poor assessment of the risks on the appellant’s part. But, as the Minister stated in <span class="font-italic">Singapore Parliamentary Debates</span>, <span class="font-italic">Official Reports </span>(14 November 2012) vol 89 ([31] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>), “[g]enuine cases of mental disability are recognised [under s 33B(3)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the MDA], while, errors of judgment will not afford a defence.” To put it quite bluntly, this was the working of a criminal mind, weighing the risks and countervailing benefits associated with the criminal conduct in question. The appellant in the end took a calculated risk which, contrary to his expectations, materialised. Even if we accepted that his ability to <span class="font-italic">assess risk</span> was impaired, on no basis could this amount to an impairment of his <span class="font-italic">mental responsibility</span> for his acts. He fully knew and intended to act as he did. His alleged deficiency in assessing risks might have made him more prone to engage in risky behaviour; that, however, does not in any way diminish his culpability.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 We therefore dismiss the appeal in CCA 50. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">CA 98 </span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Whether s 33B(4) ousts the supervisory jurisdiction of the courts other than on grounds of bad faith, malice and unconstitutionality</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 We turn to CA 98. The first issue centres on the respondent’s contention that the court’s general power of judicial review has been excluded, or at least, confined, by s 33B(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) read with s 33B(4) of the MDA. The respondent submits that these provisions have the effect of ousting the court’s power of judicial review, over the PP’s determination under s 33B(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) as to whether an offender had substantively assisted the CNB in disrupting drug trafficking activities save and except on the grounds of bad faith or malice, which are the grounds expressly provided for under s 33B(4). The respondent also accepts that, in line with what we have held in <span class="font-italic">Muhammad Ridzuan bin Mohd Ali v </span><span class="font-italic">Attorney-General </span>[2015] 5 SLR 1222 (“<span class="font-italic">Ridzuan</span>”) (at [35]), s 33B(4) does not preclude challenging the PP’s determination under s 33B(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) where that determination contravenes constitutional protections and rights (for example, where a discriminatory determination is made that results in an offender being deprived of his right to equality under the law and the equal protection of the law under Article 12 of the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore (1985 Rev Ed, 1999 Reprint) (“the Singapore Constitution”)). In short, the respondent’s position is that aside from the grounds of bad faith, malice and unconstitutionality, the supervisory jurisdiction of the courts over the PP’s determination under s 33B(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the MDA is excluded by s 33B(4). The relevance of this can be seen in the fact that the crux of the appellant’s case does not rest on allegations of malice or bad faith on the part of the PP. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 We begin by noting that, until the decision of the High Court in <span class="font-italic">Nagaenthran (Judicial Review)</span>, the question of whether s 33B(4) of the MDA had the effect of ousting all grounds of judicial review except bad faith, malice and unconstitutionality had been left open by the courts: see <span class="font-italic">Ridzuan</span> (at [76]); <span class="font-italic">Prabagaran </span>(at [98]); and <span class="font-italic">Abdul Kahar bin Othman v Public Prosecutor</span> [2018] 2 SLR 1394 (at [57]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 Ouster clauses (also variously known as privative, preclusive, finality or exclusion clauses) are statutory provisions which <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> prohibit judicial review of the exercise of the discretionary powers to which they relate: <span class="font-italic">Per Ah Seng Robin </span><span class="font-italic">and another v Housing and Development Board and another </span>[2016] 1 SLR 1020 (“<span class="font-italic">Robin Per</span>”) at [63], citing Mark Elliot <span class="font-italic">et al</span>, <span class="font-italic">Beatson, Matthews and Elliott’s Administrative Law: Text and Materials </span>(Oxford University Press, 4th Ed, 2011) at para 15.6.1. Such clauses may be worded differently, but properly construed, their broad import is clear: they seek to oust the court’s jurisdiction to exercise the power of judicial review: <span class="font-italic">Robin Per </span>at [63], citing Matthew Groves &amp; H P Lee, <span class="font-italic">Australian Administrative Law: Fundamentals, Principles and Doctrines </span>(Cambridge University Press, 2007) at p 346.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 In a constitutional system of governance such as Singapore’s, the courts are ordinarily vested with the power to adjudicate upon all disputes. As we observed in <span class="font-italic">Tan Seet Eng v Attorney-General</span><span class="font-italic"> and another matter </span>[2016] 1 SLR 779 (“<span class="font-italic">Tan Seet Eng</span>”) at [47], judicial review forms a part of this power to adjudicate, and concerns that area of law where the courts review the legality of government actions:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… In the normal course of events, all controversies, whether of fact or of law, are resolved by the courts. This work is done in accordance with the applicable rules of adjectival and substantive law, and it is the function of the courts to determine what the facts are and also to apply the relevant rules of substantive law to those facts. Judicial review concerns an area of law in which the courts review the lawfulness of acts undertaken by other branches of the government.     </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 It is crucial here to differentiate between clauses that oust or exclude the court’s jurisdiction or authority to act in a matter, and clauses that immunise parties from suit or liability. Parliament may from time to time enact statutory immunity clauses, some of which have been considered by our courts. In <span class="font-italic">South East Enterprises (Singapore) Pte Ltd v Hean Nerng Holdings Pte Ltd </span>[2013] 2 SLR 908, we had occasion to consider s 68(2) of the Subordinate Courts Act (Cap 321, 1999 Rev Ed), the precursor to the current s 68(2) of the State Courts Act (Cap 321, 2007 Rev Ed). In essence, s 68(2) of the Subordinate Courts Act provided that no officer of a subordinate court charged with the duty of executing any mandatory process of the subordinate court shall be sued for the execution of his duty unless he knowingly acted in excess of the authority conferred upon him by the mandatory process. We held in that case (at [56]) that s 68(2) of the Subordinate Courts Act had the effect of protecting a bailiff from excessive seizure claims unless the bailiff had knowingly acted in excess of his authority. Separately, in <span class="font-italic">Estate of Lee Rui Feng Dominique Sarron, deceased v Najib Hanuk bin Muhammad Jalal</span><span class="font-italic"> and others </span>[2016] 4 SLR 438 (“<span class="font-italic">Dominique Sarron Lee</span>”), the High Court considered s 14(1) of the Government Proceedings Act (Cap 121, 1985 Rev Ed), and held (at [41]–[42]) that it had the effect of protecting a member of the Singapore Armed Forces (“SAF”) from liability in tort for causing death or personal injury to another member of the SAF where certain conditions were fulfilled. However, even where those conditions were fulfilled, the wrongdoing member would not be exempted from liability in tort where his act or omission was not connected with the execution of his duties as a member of the SAF.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 Like ouster clauses, immunity clauses may be worded differently. Unlike ouster clauses however, they do not exclude the courts’ jurisdiction or authority to act in a matter. This is apparent from both s 68(2) of the Subordinate Courts Act and s 14(1) of the Government Proceedings Act, both of which only protect an identified class of persons from suit under certain conditions. Nothing in those provisions purports to exclude the jurisdiction of the courts to deal with any class of matters.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 In <span class="font-italic">Rosli bin Dahlan v Tan Sri Abdul Gani bin Patail</span><span class="font-italic"> &amp; Ors </span>[2014] 11 MLJ 481 (“<span class="font-italic">Rosli bin Dahlan</span>”), the Kuala Lumpur High Court had to consider whether prosecutors enjoyed absolute immunity from suit in relation to the exercise of their functions (see [78]). The Court noted (at [88], citing <span class="font-italic">Henry v British Columbia (Attorney General)</span> [2012] BCJ No 1965, 2012 BCSC 1401 at [20]) that there are policy reasons why Parliament would want to confer upon prosecutors a broad immunity from suit in relation to the discharge of their functions. First, such immunity encourages public trust in the fairness and impartiality of those who act and exercise discretion in bringing and conducting criminal prosecutions. Second, the threat of personal liability for tortious conduct would have a chilling effect on the prosecutor’s exercise of discretion. Third, to permit civil suits against prosecutors would invite a flood of litigation that would deflect a prosecutor’s energies from the discharge of his public duties; and it would open the door to unmeritorious claims that might have the effect of threatening prosecutorial independence. As against these considerations are concerns that private individuals ought not to be denied a remedy where they have been, for example, maliciously prosecuted. In the result, a balance is struck where prosecutors do enjoy a broad immunity from suit in respect of the carrying out of their functions, but this is not absolute (at [95]). The Court then went on to consider statutory immunity clauses in various other pieces of legislation, and concluded (at [106]) that “whenever the Legislature provided for statutory immunity from legal proceedings for public officers, it has always come with a rider, and that rider was the requirement of good faith in the exercise of that public officer’s powers or discretion. The shield was never an absolute one.”</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 It follows from this brief review that statutory immunity clauses share certain characteristics. First, they are exceptional in that they preclude claims being brought against certain classes of persons under prescribed conditions where ordinarily, such persons might otherwise be subject to some liability. Second, statutory immunity clauses commonly seek to protect persons carrying out public functions. It is on account of the responsibilities that burden the exercise of such public functions and the desire not to hinder their discharge that such immunity clauses are commonly justified. Thus, as was noted in <span class="font-italic">Rosli bin Dahlan</span> (see [49] above), immunity from suit may be justified in order to safeguard the ability of prosecutors to exercise their prosecutorial discretion independently without fear of liability. Similarly, in the context of s 14(1) of the Government Proceedings Act (see [47] above), the High Court in <span class="font-italic">Dominique </span><span class="font-italic">Sarron Lee </span>observed (at [51]) that the immunity granted to members of the SAF was justified by the need to ensure that they would not be burdened by the prospect of legal action when training, and ultimately to safeguard the effectiveness of the SAF’s training as well as its operations. Third, and as a corollary to this, such immunity generally would not extend to the misuse or abuse of the public function in question; nor would the immunity typically apply where its beneficiary exceeded the proper ambit of the functions of his office. Thus, it was held that prosecutorial immunity would not extend to protect against claims for malicious, deliberate or injurious wrongdoing:<span class="font-italic"> </span><span class="font-italic">Rosli bin Dahlan</span> at [98]; similarly, a bailiff’s immunity against excessive seizure claims would not apply where the bailiff <span class="font-italic">knowingly</span> acted in excess of his authority; and a member of the SAF would not be exempted from liability in tort for causing death or personal injury to another member where his act or omission was not connected with the execution of his duties as a member of the SAF.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 In that light, we turn to consider the true nature and interpretation of s 33B(4). The respondent contends that it is an ouster clause. We disagree. On its face, s 33B(4) does not purport to exclude the jurisdiction of the courts to supervise the legality of the PP’s determination under s 33B(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the MDA. What it does do, is to immunise the PP from suit save on the stated grounds. In other words, an offender who is aggrieved by the PP’s determination that he had not provided substantive assistance to the CNB in disrupting drug trafficking activities cannot take the PP to task by way of proceedings in court except where he can establish that the PP’s determination in that respect was made in bad faith, with malice or perhaps unconstitutionally. We note here that these exceptions to the immunity granted under s 33B(4) are consistent with our earlier observations, that the immunities granted to persons exercising a public function do not typically extend to protecting them from liability for abusing or exceeding the functions of their office. Further, in our judgment, nothing in s 33B(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) excludes the usual grounds of judicial review, such as illegality, irrationality and procedural impropriety (see <span class="font-italic">Tan Seet Eng </span>at [62]), on the basis of which the court may examine the <span class="font-italic">legality</span> of the PP’s determination, as opposed to its <span class="font-italic">merits</span>. We elaborate.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Distinguishing the inquiries and conditions under s 33B(2)</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 We begin by observing that as far as s 33B(2) and s 33B(4) are concerned, one should distinguish between, on the one hand, the <span class="font-italic">conditions</span> that must be cumulatively fulfilled under s 33B(2) for the court’s sentencing discretion to be engaged under s 33B(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>), and on the other, the <span class="font-italic">inquiries</span> that must be undertaken to determine whether those conditions have been established. It is useful here to set out the relevant portions of s 33B of the MDA in full:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Discretion of court not to impose sentence of death in certain circumstances</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">33B.</span>—(1) Where a person commits or attempts to commit an offence under section 5(1) or 7, being an offence punishable with death under the sixth column of the Second Schedule, and he is convicted thereof, the court —</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) may, if the person satisfies the requirements of subsection (2), instead of imposing the death penalty, sentence the person to imprisonment for life and, if the person is sentenced to life imprisonment, he shall also be sentenced to caning of not less than 15 strokes; …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(2) The requirements referred to in subsection (1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) are as follows: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) the person convicted proves, on a balance of probabilities, that his involvement in the offence under section 5(1) or 7 was restricted —</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(i) to transporting, sending or delivering a controlled drug;</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(ii) to offering to transport, send or deliver a controlled drug;</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(iii) to doing or offering to do any act preparatory to or for the purpose of his transporting, sending or delivering a controlled drug; or</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(iv) to any combination of activities in sub-paragraphs (i), (ii) and (iii); and </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) the Public Prosecutor certifies to any court that, in his determination, the person has substantively assisted the Central Narcotics Bureau in disrupting drug trafficking activities within or outside Singapore.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(4) The determination of whether or not any person has substantively assisted the Central Narcotics Bureau in disrupting drug trafficking activities shall be at the sole discretion of the Public Prosecutor and no action or proceeding shall lie against the Public Prosecutor in relation to any such determination unless it is proved to the court that the determination was done in bad faith or with malice.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 The starting point is s 33B(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>), which provides that the court “<span class="font-italic">may</span>” sentence an offender convicted of a capital drug offence to life imprisonment instead, provided that the specified conditions in s 33B(2) are met. By virtue of s 33B(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) therefore, the court is given the sentencing discretion to impose a sentence of life imprisonment where the conditions under subsection (2) are met.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 Section 33B(2) of the MDA, in turn, specifies the two conditions that must be met before the court’s sentencing discretion under s 33B(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) is engaged. The first of these, which is found in s 33B(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>), is a finding of fact that the offender in question was, essentially, a courier. The second of these, which is found in s 33B(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>), is the <span class="font-italic">existence</span> of a certificate of substantive assistance issued by the PP. As far as the sentencing court is concerned, its discretion under s 33B(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) to sentence an offender to life imprisonment <span class="font-italic">in lieu</span> of the death penalty is only engaged when <span class="font-italic">both</span> of the aforementioned <span class="font-italic">conditions</span> are met.   </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 The two <span class="font-italic">conditions</span> that we have referred to above must be distinguished from the specific <span class="font-italic">inquiry</span> that is to be carried out in order to determine whether each of those conditions has been met in any given case. Under s 33B(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>), while the relevant <span class="font-italic">condition</span> is a finding that the offender in question merely acted as a courier, that condition depends on an <span class="font-italic">inquiry</span> as to whether the offender’s actions were confined to any of the acts under s 33B(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)(i)–(iv). Under s 33B(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>), while the <span class="font-italic">condition</span> is the existence of the certificate of substantive assistance issued by the PP, the <span class="font-italic">inquiry</span> in question is that which leads to a determination by the PP that the offender had provided substantive assistance to the CNB in disrupting drug trafficking activities within or outside Singapore. There are two aspects to this: first, that the offender had provided substantive assistance to the CNB; <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">and </span>second that such assistance resulted in the specified outcome, namely, the disruption of drug trafficking activities whether here or elsewhere.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 Seen in this light, we are satisfied that on a true construction of the provision, s 33B(4) is directed to the <span class="font-italic">inquiry</span> (meaning the process by which the PP arrives at his decision) rather than the question underlying the fulfilment of the condition under s 33B(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) (meaning the question whether the offender had in fact substantively assisted the CNB and whether this had resulted in disrupting drug trafficking activities). We say the question <span class="font-italic">underlying </span>the fulfilment of the condition because the actual condition in question is the <span class="font-italic">existence</span> of the certificate of substantive assistance issued by the PP. Under s 33B(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>), the PP will issue the certificate of substantive assistance in respect of an offender where, <span class="font-italic">in the PP’s determination</span>, that offender has substantively assisted the CNB in disrupting drug trafficking activities. Section 33B(4) makes specific reference to the <span class="font-italic">PP’s determination</span> as to whether the offender in question had substantively assisted the CNB in disrupting drug trafficking activities. And in relation to this determination, there are two key aspects to s 33B(4): (i) it shall be made solely by the PP; and (ii) no action or proceeding shall lie against the PP in respect of any such determination unless it is proved to the court that the determination was done in bad faith or with malice.        </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 The reason s 33B(4) provides for both these aspects becomes evident when one considers the nature of the <span class="font-italic">inquiry</span> that is implicated under s 33B(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>). As we have already noted, this is the inquiry into whether the offender had provided substantive assistance to the CNB in disrupting drug trafficking activities within or outside Singapore. It will be appreciated immediately that there is a stark difference between the nature of this inquiry and that under s 33B(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>). While the court is entirely capable of answering the inquiry as to whether the offender’s actions were confined to any of the acts specified in s 33B(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)(i)–(iv), which is a narrow question of fact suitable for judicial determination, the same cannot be said of the court’s ability to answer the inquiry embedded in s 33B(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>). The obstacle here is not simply an issue of having to safeguard from disclosure confidential information and otherwise inadmissible evidence including intelligence and other operational details of the CNB, which might jeopardise the CNB’s effectiveness if published, although that, in itself, is no doubt a very significant concern: see <span class="font-italic">Ridzuan</span> (at [66]), <span class="font-italic">Prabagaran</span> (at [52]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 Equally important is the fact that at least the second part of the inquiry under s 33B(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) (namely, whether the offender’s assistance had the specified outcome in terms of disrupting drug trafficking activities within or outside Singapore) contemplates an assessment of these activities that transcends the disruption of particular and individual operations and instead, entails a wide ranging assessment that goes beyond our geographic boundaries, would likely require the consideration of at least some materials that do not meet the definition of admissible evidence, and that would likely entail the weighing of considerations and trade-offs that are outside our institutional competence, which, in the final analysis, is directed to the resolution of particular controversies. In essence, the courts are simply ill-equipped and ill-placed to undertake such an inquiry. At that level of abstraction, there are no manageable judicial standards against which a court would be able to make an appropriate assessment. It is, to put it simply, an inquiry that a court is not in a position to properly answer. As we observed in <span class="font-italic">Prabagaran </span>(at [67]), “the inquiry as to whether there has been disruption to the drug trade within and/or outside Singapore is an operational one that is dependent on CNB’s … intelligence and wider considerations, which may not be appropriate <span class="font-italic">or even possible to determine in court</span>” [emphasis added].</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The nature of the judicial function</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 It is apposite here to restate the nature of the judicial function, and from there to examine why the merits of PP’s determination under s 33B(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the MDA is not one that is capable of being adjudicated upon by a court of law. The judicial function “is premised on the existence of a controversy either between a State and one or more of its subjects, or between two or more subjects of a State…[and which] entails the courts making a finding on the facts as they stand, applying the relevant law to those facts and determining the rights and obligations of the parties concerned for the purposes of governing their relationship for the future”: <span class="font-italic">Mohammad Faizal bin Sabtu v Public Prosecutor </span>[2012] 4 SLR 947 (“<span class="font-italic">Faizal</span>”) (at [27]). What follows from this is that, at its core, the judicial process requires clear legal standards against which facts can be analysed and found, and rights and obligations be ascertained. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 Once this is appreciated, it will become apparent that there exist issues of such a nature that render them unamenable to being resolved through the judicial process, because of a lack of manageable judicial standards against which a court would be able to arrive at a decision. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 In a somewhat different context, a similar point was noted by Lord Wilberforce (with whom the rest of their Lordships agreed) in the decision of the House of Lords in <span class="font-italic">Buttes Gas and Oil Co v Hammer </span>[1982] AC 888 (“<span class="font-italic">Buttes Gas</span>”). That dispute arose out of contested rights to oil concessions off the coast of Abu Musa, an island in the Arabian Gulf. At the time, Buttes Gas and Oil Co had obtained the right to exploit the oil deposits there by virtue of a decree dated December 1969 of the Ruler of Sharjah, an Arab emirate. Occidental Petroleum Corporation on the other hand, had obtained its concessions from Umm al Qaiwain, a neighbouring emirate, in November 1969. The Ruler of Sharjah’s decree extended the emirate’s territorial sea from 3 to 12 miles, thus impinging upon part of Occidental’s concessions. Occidental’s Dr Armand Hammer subsequently alleged publicly that Buttes Gas had conspired with the Ruler of Sharjah to fraudulently backdate the decree so as to undermine Occidental’s rights to its concessions. In response, Buttes Gas initiated proceedings alleging slander. In defence, Dr Hammer pleaded justification, and further counterclaimed for damages on the basis of the alleged conspiracy between Buttes Gas and the Ruler of Sharjah. In support of its justification defence as well as its counterclaim in conspiracy, Occidental pleaded the same facts, namely, that the Ruler of Sharjah and others, whom Occidental could not then particularise, had wrongfully and fraudulently conspired to cheat and defraud Occidental, and further or alternatively, to cause and procure Her Majesty’s Government and others to act unlawfully to the injury of Occidental. Buttes Gas responded by applying to strike out the aforementioned parts of Occidental’s pleadings relating to the justification defence as well as the conspiracy counterclaim on the ground that the pleaded matters were acts of state and hence, non-justiciable.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 The House of Lords had to consider several issues, including whether the Court of Appeal was correct in refusing Buttes Gas’s striking out application. In holding that the issues raised in Occidental’s pleadings were incapable of being entertained by the court, Lord Wilberforce started out by framing “the essential question” in terms of whether there exists a general principle of law that the courts will not adjudicate upon the transactions of foreign sovereign states (at 931). Pertinently, Lord Wilberforce stated that “it seems desirable to consider this principle, if existing, not as a variety of ‘act of state’ but one for judicial restraint or abstention”. He opined (at 932) that the principle has long existed in English law, and was not a principle of discretion but a principle of law “inherent in the very nature of the judicial process”. In his view, if Occidental’s justification defence and counterclaim in conspiracy as pleaded were to be heard by the court, the court would have to deal with issues that would include whether Occidental had acquired, in November 1969, a vested right to explore the seabed at a location within 12 miles from the coast of Abu Musa, an issue which itself would turn on the question of which state had sovereignty over Abu Musa in the first place. And if Occidental did acquire such a right, the court would then have to consider whether Occidental had subsequently been deprived of its right by the actions of sovereigns such as the Ruler of Sharjah, and inquire into the Ruler’s motives for backdating the decree, if proved (at 937). In the final analysis, Lord Wilberforce stated (at 938) that:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[these issues] have only to be stated to compel the conclusion that these are not issues upon which a municipal court can pass. <span class="font-italic">Leaving aside all possibility of embarrassment in our foreign relations … </span>there are—to follow the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals—<span class="font-italic">no judicial or manageable standards by which to </span><span class="font-italic">judge these issues, or to adopt another phrase …, the court would be in a judicial no-man’s land</span>: the court would be asked to review transactions in which four sovereign states were involved, which they had brought to a precarious settlement, after diplomacy and the use of force, and to say that at least part of these were “unlawful” under international law. [emphasis added]           </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 Subsequently, the UK Supreme Court in <span class="font-italic">Shergill</span><span class="font-italic"> v Khaira</span> [2014] 3 WLR 1 noted (at [40], <span class="font-italic">per </span>Lord Neuberger, Lord Sumption and Lord Hodge (with whom Lord Mance and Lord Clarke agreed)) that Lord Wilberforce’s reference to judicial and manageable standards by which issues are judged was derived from the decision of the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals in the United States litigation between the same parties on substantially the same issues. That in turn was based on the celebrated decision of the United States Supreme Court in <span class="font-italic">Underhill v Hernandez </span>(1897) 168 US 250 concerning the act of state doctrine. But the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals regarded the issues as non-justiciable not because judges in municipal courts were incapable of determining questions of international law. Rather, as the Supreme Court bluntly observed, the issues raised in <span class="font-italic">Buttes Gas</span> “w[ere] non-justiciable because [they were] political”. To begin with, the court would be “trespass[ing] on the proper province of the executive, as the organ of the state charged with the conduct of foreign relations”. This was a concern rooted in the doctrine of the separation of powers. But the Supreme Court went on to note that the entire dispute arose out of the way in which four sovereign states had settled the issue of international law “by a mixture of diplomacy, political pressure and force in a manner adverse to the interests of Occidental Petroleum”. Occidental’s case in court would involve the court “assessing decisions and acts of sovereign states which [unlike those of private parties] had not been governed by law but by power politics”. This concern proceeds from an even more fundamental premise that goes beyond any doctrine of “self-imposed judicial restraint” (see Thio Li-ann, <span class="font-italic">A Treatise on Singapore Constitutional Law </span>(Academy Publishing, 2012) (“<span class="font-italic">Thio Li-ann</span>”) at para 10.219) and extends to taking due regard of the inherent limitations of litigation and the judicial process. We accept that the facts presented in <span class="font-italic">Buttes Gas </span>were far removed from those in the present case but, in our judgment, the underlying principle is equally applicable.      </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 Indeed, similar concerns with the lack of manageable judicial standards featured in the much more closely analogous context of assessing the value of police intelligence to police operations. In <span class="font-italic">Carnduff v Rock </span>[2001] 1 WLR 1786 (“<span class="font-italic">Carnduff</span>”), a registered police informer brought an action against a police inspector and his chief constable to recover payment for information provided to the police. He claimed that specific information and assistance he had provided had resulted in the arrest and prosecution of certain persons involved in the illegal drugs trade. The Court of Appeal struck out the claim (Waller LJ dissenting), holding that a fair trial of the issues arising from the pleadings would necessarily require the police to disclose sensitive information that ought in the public interest to remain confidential to the police. While confidentiality concerns were the principal reason underlying the Court of Appeal’s decision, Laws LJ in his judgment was also palpably perturbed by the futility of having the court assess the value to police operations of the intelligence the informant had provided (at [33]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">If the disputes which they generate were to be resolved fairly by reference to the relevant evidence … the court would be required to examine in detail the operational methods of the police as they related to the particular investigation in question; to look into the detailed circumstances of the plaintiff’s discussions with police officers; <span class="font-italic">to conduct a close perusal of such information as the plaintiff provided, to assess its quality; to compare that information with other relevant information in the hands of the police, very possibly including material coming from or relating to other informers, and so also to assess and contrast the degree of trust reposed by the police in one informer rather than another; and to make judgments about the information’s </span><span class="font-italic">usefulness</span>, and not only the use in fact made of it (and thus, <span class="font-italic">notionally at least, to put itself in the shoes of a competent police force so as to decide what such a force would or should have done</span>). [emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 We would observe that, the question in <span class="font-italic">Carnduff </span>related to the relationship between specific information and its value to a <span class="font-italic">specific</span> police operation. The problem is greatly exacerbated where the question is whether an offender had provided substantive assistance in disrupting drug trafficking activities <span class="font-italic">in general,</span> <span class="font-italic">whether in or outside Singapore</span>: see further our observations at [58] above. This<span class="font-italic"> </span>raises issues that simply cannot be resolved by a court of law using the methods, tools or standards that are properly at its disposal. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 Our view that the inquiry under s 33B(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the MDA is not one a court is capable of addressing, at least in part because of the operational facets that are implicated, is supported by the relevant legislative debates. In response to concerns raised that there should be greater judicial discretion in the application of the death penalty, the Minister for Law stated (see <span class="font-italic">Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report </span>(14 November 2012) vol 89:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Next, on the issue of who decides cooperation and by what criteria.

The real point is this. Just imagine the scenario. In a case, the defendant argues that he rendered substantial assistance – it is CNB’s fault for not dismantling some organisation overseas, it is something which CNB did or did not do, what intelligence agencies and officers did and did not do. And you put the officers on the stand and cross-examine them on their methods, their sources, their thinking. Ask yourself whether that is the best way of dealing with this question. Is that helpful?</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis in original; emphasis added in bold italics]</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Our judgment</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 In our judgment, the effect of s 33B(4) is to vest the responsibility for making the relevant inquiry under s 33B(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) in the PP and then to immunise the PP from suit in respect of such a determination save as narrowly excepted. Further, we consider that it was entirely logical for Parliament to proceed in this way. This is because Parliament intended the inquiry under s 33B(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) to be determined solely by the PP and not by the court, in light of the fact that the inquiry in question is not one that can be appropriately undertaken by the court for all the reasons we have already rehearsed, and which are rehearsed also in the legislative debates that we have excerpted in the previous paragraph. And as for the wide, though not absolute, immunity granted to the PP in respect of his determination, this too is entirely logical because without this, an aggrieved offender might be tempted to bring suit against the PP challenging his determination that the offender had not substantively assisted the CNB in disrupting drug trafficking activities, and thereby attempt to force the court into the unviable position of having to determine an issue that it is inherently not capable of determining. At the same time, the bad faith, malice and unconstitutionality exceptions to the immunity granted by s 33B(4) serve to safeguard against abuse and ensures that the PP “operate[s] the system with integrity”: <span class="font-italic">Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report </span>(14 November 2012) vol 89. Moreover, these are questions directed not at the merits of the PP’s determination, but at the limited question of the propriety of the PP’s conduct and this would typically give rise to the sort of issue that the court would be well-placed to address.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 It becomes evident when seen in this light, that the provisions in question before us do not in any way oust the court’s power of judicial review over the legality of executive actions, including those of the PP. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 Before turning to the disposal of the merits of the appeal, we make some further observations. First, we had opined in <span class="font-italic">Ridzuan</span> (at [72]) that it would be unsatisfactory if the PP’s determination under s 33B(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) was indeed unreviewable by the courts even if, for the sake of argument, it could be shown that, although not constituting bad faith or malice, the PP had, for example, disregarded relevant considerations and/or failed to take relevant considerations into account:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Before we move away from this issue of bad faith, we need to address the proposition made by the Appellant that where the PP has taken into account irrelevant considerations and has instead failed to take into account relevant considerations, that would constitute bad faith. On the authorities that we have just alluded to, this proposition is erroneous. <span class="font-italic">However, does it mean that where it has been shown that the PP has disregarded relevant considerations and/or failed to take relevant consideration into account, the aggrieved drug trafficker is </span><span class="font-italic">without remedy?</span> We would first observe that such a situation does not arise in the present case. The relevant considerations taken into account by the PP have been set out at [60] and [64] above and nothing was advanced by or on behalf of the Appellant to suggest that this was in any way erroneous. Having said that, <span class="font-italic">if such a situation were to arise in a case and it is substantiated that relevant considerations were disregarded or irrelevant considerations were considered by the PP in coming to his decision, intuitively it seems inconceivable that the aggrieved person would be left without a remedy and that the decision of the PP should nevertheless stand</span>. … [emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 These observations seem especially compelling where the determination in question may have a bearing on the life of an accused person. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">71 Secondly, the respondent submitted that this was ultimately a matter of construing the legislative intent underlying any provision said to have that effect. We do not need to reach a final decision on this because of the view we have taken on the true construction, purport and effect of s 33B(4), but we observe that the court’s power of judicial review, which is a core aspect of the judicial power and function, would not ordinarily be capable of being excluded by ordinary legislation such as the MDA. This follows inevitably from Singapore’s system of constitutional governance, where the Singapore Constitution is the supreme law of the land, as stated in Article 4:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">This Constitution is the supreme law of the Republic of Singapore and any law enacted by the Legislature after the commencement of this Constitution which is inconsistent with this Constitution shall, to the extent of the inconsistency, be void.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">72 As Chan Sek Keong CJ noted in <span class="font-italic">Faizal</span> ([59] <span class="font-italic">supra</span> at [15]), “Art 4 reinforces the principle that the Singapore parliament may not enact a law, and the Singapore government may not do an act, which is inconsistent with the principle of the separation of powers to the extent to which that principle is embodied in the Singapore Constitution”. The separation of powers, in turn, is embodied in the Singapore Constitution by virtue of Article 23 (which vests the executive authority in the President and the Cabinet), Article 38 (which vests the legislative power in the President and Parliament) and Article 93 (which vests the judicial power in a system of courts). Article 93 provides as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The judicial power of Singapore shall be vested in a Supreme Court and in such subordinate courts as may be provided by any written law for the time being in force.                                                                                                                                                                     </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">73 We have referenced (at [59] above) Chan CJ’s holding in <span class="font-italic">Faizal</span> (at [27]), that “the judicial function is premised on the existence of a controversy either between a State and one or more of its subjects, or between two or more subjects of a State…[and which] entails the courts making a finding on the facts as they stand, applying the relevant law to those facts and determining the rights and obligations of the parties concerned for the purposes of governing their relationship for the future”. It follows from the nature of the judicial function, as well as the fact that the State’s judicial power is vested in the Supreme Court under Article 93 of the Singapore Constitution, that “there will (or should) be few, if any, legal disputes between the State and the people from which the judicial power is excluded”: <span class="font-italic">Yong Vui Kong v Attorney-General </span>[2011] 2 SLR 1189 at [31]. In particular, any society that prides itself in being governed by the rule of law, as our society does, must hold steadfastly to the principle that “[a]ll power has legal limits and the rule of law demands that the courts should be able to examine the exercise of discretionary power”: <span class="font-italic">Chng Suan Tze v Minister for Home Affairs</span><span class="font-italic"> and others and other appeals</span> [1988] 2 SLR(R) 525 (“<span class="font-italic">Chng Suan Tze</span>”) at [86]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">74 The point is not purely theoretical. In the course of the arguments, we invited counsel for the respondent to clarify whether he maintained that the court would be powerless to act if it could be shown that the PP had considered matters that were irrelevant. His response that he did maintain that position, was simply untenable, as we told him. If the respondent’s submission on the effect of s 33B(4) were accepted, then to the extent that this ousted the court’s power of judicial review, s 33B(4) would be constitutionally suspect for being in violation of Article 93 of the Singapore Constitution as well as the principle of the separation of powers: see <span class="font-italic">Thio Li-ann</span> at para 10.218; and Chan Sek Keong, “Judicial Review – From Angst to Empathy: A Lecture to Singapore Management University Second Year Law Students” (2010) 22 SAcLJ 469 at para 19. That said, the point really is moot, since we have already held that s 33B(4) of the MDA does not have this effect of ousting the power of the courts to review the <span class="font-italic">legality</span> as opposed to the <span class="font-italic">merits </span>of the PP’s determination under s 33B(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>). </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Whether leave for judicial review ought to be granted</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">75 Having held that s 33B(4) of the MDA does not preclude judicial review of the PP’s non-certification decision under s 33B(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) on any of the usual grounds of judicial review (see [51] above), it remains for us to consider the appellant’s case on its merits. At its core, the appellant seeks leave to commence judicial review of the PP’s non-certification decision on two grounds:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) first, that there is a <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> case of reasonable suspicion that the PP failed to take into account relevant considerations in coming to his non-certification decision; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) second, that there is a <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> case of reasonable suspicion that the PP’s non-certification decision was made in the absence of a precedent fact.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">76 As the Judge correctly noted, the requirement at the leave stage is for the appellant to adduce material that discloses an arguable or <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> case of reasonable suspicion in favour of granting the remedies the appellant seeks. This is, undoubtedly, “a very low threshold”: <span class="font-italic">Chan Hiang Leng Colin and others v Minister for Information and the Arts </span>[1996] 1 SLR(R) 294 at [22]. Nonetheless, the leave requirement to commence judicial review is intended to serve as a means of filtering out groundless or hopeless cases at an early stage, so as to prevent wastage of judicial time and to protect public bodies from harassment (whether intentional or otherwise) that might arise from a need to delay implementing decisions, where the legality of such decisions is being challenged: <span class="font-italic">Public Service Commission v Lai Swee Lin Linda </span>[2001] 1 SLR(R) 133 at [23]. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Failure to take into account relevant considerations</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">77 It is common ground that the information the appellant had provided to the CNB in his contemporaneous statements in 2009 was the same as the first set of information (see [14] above). The appellant submits that due to the time-sensitive nature of the information he had given to the CNB in 2009, the information had become stale by the time the PP considered it in 2013. On this basis, it was submitted that he was prejudiced because he could not conceivably have been in a position to render substantive assistance to the CNB in 2013. The appellant submits, therefore, that when AG Chong was considering, in 2013 (see [15] above), whether the appellant had rendered substantive assistance, he ought to have considered the effect of the appellant’s information, as provided in his contemporaneous statements to the CNB shortly after his arrest, on the disruption of drug trafficking activities at the material time (meaning, in 2009); it was submitted that there was no evidence that AG Chong considered the appellant’s information in that manner.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">78 In our judgment, the appellant’s case on this point fails. To begin with, it is apparent that the appellant’s entire case on appeal hinges on the allegation that there is a lack of evidence showing that the PP had taken into account the relevant considerations in arriving at his non-certification decision. But this approach reverses the burden of proof and cannot suffice for a party who has to satisfy its burden of adducing evidence to show a <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> case of reasonable suspicion that what the party alleges is right. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">79 Next, it may be noted that when the Amendment Act introduced the transitional framework for persons who had been convicted and sentenced to death under the previous version of the MDA, to be resentenced in accordance with s 33B, no obligation was imposed on the PP to consider retrospectively the effect of the information provided by such offenders on the disruption of drug trafficking activities. In any event, we were prepared to take the appellant’s case at its highest and proceed on the basis that the PP ought to have considered the information provided by the appellant in 2009 and its effect on the disruption of drug trafficking operations then. Even so, however, the appellant fails because he has not adduced a shred of evidence to support his case that there is a <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> case of reasonable suspicion that the PP had failed to consider the effect of the appellant’s information provided in his contemporaneous statements on the disruption of drug trafficking activities at that time. On the contrary, the respondent deposed to the following in the affidavit dated 30 October 2017 that was filed on his behalf:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">6.

The following (collectively, “the first set of material”) was subsequently submitted to the then-PP, Attorney-General Steven Chong Horng Siong (“AG Chong”), for his consideration:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"> (a) the first set of information;</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"> (b) information pertaining to operational matters; and</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(c) the views of the CNB in relation to whether, based on the first set of information, the [appellant] had substantively assisted the CNB in disrupting drug trafficking activities within or outside Singapore.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">8.

This, in our judgment, is a complete statement unto itself, not limited in time, that is capable of encapsulating the fact that the PP had indeed considered the effect of the appellant’s information on the disruption of drug trafficking activities shortly after the time of his arrest in 2009. The appellant has not adduced any evidence to show why this was not the case. We therefore hold that the appellant has not made out a <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> case of reasonable suspicion that the PP had not taken into account relevant considerations in arriving at his non-certification decision.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">81 It is not necessary for us to consider how the PP subsequently dealt with the second, third and fourth sets of information. This is because the appellant’s case on appeal is that the PP had failed to take into account the effect of the information, provided by the appellant to the CNB in his contemporaneous statements, on the disruption of drug trafficking activities in 2009. That information, as was common ground, is the same as the first set of information. The subsequent sets of information were all different from the first set of information, and thus, could not have been acted upon by the CNB in 2009.   </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Absence of precedent fact</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">82 We turn to the appellant’s next ground. The precedent fact principle of review applies where the relevant legislation envisages that the exercise of an executive power depends upon the establishment of an objective precedent fact.<span class="font-italic"> </span>If this principle of review applies, then it is for the court, if there be a challenge by way of judicial review, to decide whether the precedent requirement has been satisfied: see <span class="font-italic">R v Secretary of State for the Home Department, ex p Khawaja </span>[1984] AC 74 at 108–109, <span class="font-italic">per </span>Lord Scarman, cited in <span class="font-italic">Chng Suan Tze</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>(at [110]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">83 <span class="font-italic">Chng Suan Tze</span> in relevant part held as follows: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The court’s function in judicial review depends on whether a precedent fact is involved. Where there is none, the scope of review is limited to <span class="font-italic">Wednesbury </span>principles (see <span class="font-italic">Associated Provincial Picture Houses Limited v Wednesbury Corporation </span>[1948] 1 KB 223); where, however, a precedent fact issue arises, the scope of review extends to deciding whether the evidence justifies the decision (at [108]).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Whether the exercise of a particular executive power is subject to any precedent fact depends on the construction of the legislation that creates that power. An executive power may be subject to the requirement that it be exercised based on objective facts, but Parliament could also entrust all the relevant decisions to some other decision-maker. If this was the case, then the scope of judicial review would be limited to <span class="font-italic">Wednesbury</span> principles (at [108]).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) The President’s discretion under s 8(1) and the Minister’s discretion under s 10 of the Internal Security Act (Cap 143, 1985 Rev Ed) fell outside the precedent fact category, as s 8(1) provided that it was for the President to be satisfied that detention was necessary in order to prevent a detainee from acting prejudicially to national security, and s 10 gave the Minister the power to make revocation orders where the public interest so necessitated (at [117]).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) Apart from the construction of the words used, which stress that the relevant determinations of facts were reposed in the executive, Parliament could not have intended for the courts to decide on the evidence whether a detainee was <span class="font-italic">likely</span> to act in a manner prejudicial to Singapore’s national security; the judicial process is unsuitable for reaching such decisions (at [118]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">84 In our judgment, the appellant’s case on this point must fail as well. This is because the PP’s role in respect of s 33B(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) is to make a <span class="font-italic">determination</span>; that determination is not a matter of the exercise of executive discretion. Once the PP determines that an offender has provided substantive assistance that has disrupted drug trafficking activities within the meaning of s 33B(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>), then the PP is bound to issue the appropriate certificate: see <span class="font-italic">Prabagaran</span> at [65]. But what the PP has the discretion to decide is as to the sort of inquiries he should make and the sort of information he should consider in coming to that determination. In that sense, this is simply <span class="font-italic">not</span> a situation involving the exercise of an executive discretion that requires a precedent fact to be established in the first place.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">85 The crucial words of s 33B(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the MDA are as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… the Public Prosecutor certifies to any court that, <span class="font-italic">in his determination</span>, the person <span class="font-italic">has substantively assisted the Central Narcotics Bureau</span> in disrupting drug trafficking activities within or outside Singapore [emphasis added].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">86 The words “in his determination” in s 33B(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) are important. They demonstrate that Parliament had intended for the PP to be the decision-maker in answering the question of whether an offender has substantively assisted the CNB in disrupting drug-trafficking activities. This view is further confirmed by s 33B(4), which provides that the PP’s determination under s 33B(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) shall be at the sole discretion of the PP (at [56] above). As we have stated above (at [84]), that discretion pertains to the PP’s decision as to the sorts of inquiries and information he would need in coming to his determination under s 33B(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>). Finally, we note, though the point was not directly taken by the appellant, that Parliament’s decision to entrust the PP with discretion over such matters and with the power to make the determination in question does not violate Article 93 of the Singapore Constitution. This is because of the lack of manageable judicial standards in assessing whether the substantive assistance provided by an offender to the CNB can be said to have disrupted drug trafficking activities locally and/or overseas, as a result of which, that determination under s 33B(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) would not constitute something that can properly be considered to be the exercise of a core judicial function to begin with. </div><div class="txt-body text-left"></div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">87 In the circumstances, we dismiss both CCA 50 and CA 98.</div><div class="Judg-Sign text-left">Sundaresh Menon        Andrew Phang Boon Leong     Judith Prakash<br/>Chief Justice         Judge of Appeal       Judge of Appeal</div><div class="Judg-Sign text-left">Chao Hick Tin                    Belinda Ang Saw Ean<br/>Senior Judge                    Judge </div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right"></div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Eugene Singarajah Thuraisingam, Suang Wijaya and Johannes Hadi (Eugene Thuraisingam LLP) for the appellant in both appeals;<br/>Wong Woon Kwong and Tan Wee Hao (Attorney-General’s Chambers) for the respondent in CCA 50 of 2017;<br/>Francis Ng SC, Randeep Singh Koonar, Elaine Liew, Senthilkumaran Sabapathy and Andre Chong (Attorney-General’s Chambers) for the respondent in CA 98 of 2018. </div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>

had been apprehended in 2009, as he was entering Singapore from Malaysia, with
a bundle of diamorphine strapped to his thigh. When questioned by officers from
the Central Narcotics Bureau (“CNB”), the appellant admitted to knowing that
the bundle contained diamorphine, and explained at the time that a friend known
only as “King” had strapped the bundle to his thigh so that no one would find
it. The appellant’s contemporaneous statements were duly recorded by the CNB
officers. </font></span></p>
<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt; text-align: justify;"><span style="color: windowtext; font-size: 11pt;"><font face="Arial"> </font></span></p>

however, the appellant denied having knowledge of the contents of the bundle
and raised, for the first time, the defence that he had been threatened to
deliver the bundle of drugs for King. The trial judge rejected these defences,
finding that the appellant’s contemporaneous statements were voluntarily
provided and accurately recorded. The trial judge accordingly convicted the
appellant and sentenced him to the mandatory death penalty at the time. </font></span></p>
<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt; text-align: justify;"><span style="color: windowtext; font-size: 11pt;"><font face="Arial"> </font></span></p>
<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt; text-align: justify;"><span style="color: windowtext; font-size: 11pt;"><font face="Arial">4 <span style="mso-tab-count: 1;">         </span>After the
appellant’s conviction and sentence were upheld on appeal, the execution of the
appellant’s sentence was stayed in view of the fact that Parliament was
undertaking a review of the mandatory death penalty in relation to drug
offences at the material time. The appellant then applied to be re-sentenced
under the new sentencing regime introduced by Parliament, seeking to show,
towards that end, that he was suffering from an abnormality of mind that
substantially impaired his mental responsibility for his acts at the time of
his offending conduct. He provided conflicting accounts of the reasons for his
offending however, in the various psychological and psychiatric reports
tendered for the purposes of the re-sentencing application. The High Court
Judge (“the Judge”) accordingly found that the most credible account of why he
offended was that which was contained in the contemporaneous statements he had
provided to the CNB officers at the time of his arrest in 2009. The appellant
had stated in those statements that he knew the bundle he was delivering
contained drugs, but that he was doing so because he needed money. On that
basis, the Judge found that the appellant clearly understood the nature of what
he was doing and his judgment as to what was right or wrong was not impaired.
The Judge therefore dismissed the appellant’s application to be re-sentenced,
finding that the appellant was not suffering from an abnormality of mind that
substantially impaired his mental responsibility for his offence. In the first
appeal, the appellant appeals against the Judge’s decision to dismiss his
re-sentencing application. </font></span></p>

the Public Prosecutor (“PP”) had informed the appellant that he would not be
issuing a certificate of substantive assistance under s 33B(2)(<em>b</em>) of the
Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2008 Rev Ed) (“MDA”) in the appellant’s favour.
The appellant sought leave from the High Court to commence judicial review
proceedings against the PP’s non-certification decision. In the second appeal,
the appellant appeals against the Judge’s dismissal of his leave application. </font></span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt; text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: windowtext; font-size: 11pt;"><font face="Arial"> </font></span></strong></p>
<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt; text-align: justify;"><span style="color: windowtext; font-size: 11pt;"><font face="Arial">6 <span style="mso-tab-count: 1;">         </span>In the first
appeal, the court began by observing that the Judge was particularly troubled
by the fact that the appellant had, at various points in time, provided vastly
different and irreconcilable accounts of why he had committed the offence (at [<strong>35</strong>]).
The court took the view that the appellant’s vacillation between various
accounts of why he had offended did not aid his case at all, and that they all
contradicted the original account of the reason for his offending – that which
was provided in his contemporaneous statements to the CNB officers (at [<strong>37</strong>]).
There was no reason to doubt the veracity of that account, as the statements
were found to have been accurately recorded and given voluntarily (at [<strong>38</strong>]).
On that account, the appellant’s mental responsibility for his offence could
not have been substantially impaired, because he clearly understood the nature
of his acts and did not lose his sense of judgment of the rightness or
wrongness of what he was doing. He was unequivocal in identifying the contents
of the bundle as diamorphine and took steps to conceal the bundle, as he knew
that it was unlawful for him to transport drugs. Yet, he undertook the criminal
endeavour for money (at [<strong>40</strong>]). In the court’s judgment, the appellant
took a calculated risk which, contrary to his expectations, materialised. In
the circumstances, even if his ability to assess the risk was impaired, on no
basis could this amount to an impairment of his mental responsibility for his
acts (at [<strong>41</strong>]). The court, accordingly, dismissed the first appeal (at [<strong>42</strong>]).
</font></span></p>
<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt; text-align: justify;"><span style="color: windowtext; font-size: 11pt;"><font face="Arial"> </font></span></p>
<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt; text-align: justify;"><span style="color: windowtext; font-size: 11pt;"><font face="Arial">7 <span style="mso-tab-count: 1;">         </span>In the second
appeal, the court began by considering the preliminary issue of whether s
33B(4) of the MDA had the effect of ousting the court’s power to review the
PP’s non-certification decision. The court began with the observation that in a
constitutional system of governance such as Singapore’s, the courts are
ordinarily vested with the power to adjudicate upon all disputes; judicial
review forms a part of this power to adjudicate and concerns that area of law
where the courts review the legality of government actions (at [<strong>46</strong>]).
The court found that s 33B(4) was not an ouster clause, as it did not purport
to exclude the jurisdiction of the courts to supervise the legality of the PP’s
non-certification decision; it only immunised the PP from suit save on certain
exceptions as stated in s 33B(4) (at [<strong>51</strong>]). The court noted that the
inquiry whether an offender had substantively assisted the CNB in disrupting
drug trafficking activities within or outside Singapore entailed a wide ranging
assessment going beyond the institutional competence of the courts, which was
ultimately directed to the resolution of particular controversies (at [<strong>58</strong>]).
In that light, it was entirely logical for Parliament to vest in the PP the
responsibility for determining whether an offender had rendered substantive
assistance to the CNB in disrupting drug trafficking activities and then to
immunise the PP, save on excepted grounds, in respect of that determination.
Without s 33B(4), an aggrieved offender might be tempted to bring suit against
the PP challenging his determination, and thereby force the court into the
unviable position of having to determine an issue that the court is inherently
not capable of determining; yet, at the same time, the exceptions to the
immunity granted by s 33B(4) serve to safeguard against abuse (at [<strong>67</strong>]).
</font></span></p>
<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt; text-align: justify;"><span style="color: windowtext; font-size: 11pt;"><font face="Arial"> </font></span></p>
<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt; text-align: justify;"><span style="color: windowtext; font-size: 11pt;"><font face="Arial">8 <span style="mso-tab-count: 1;">         </span>Having found
that s 33B(4) did not oust the jurisdiction of the courts to review the PP’s
non-certification decision, the court proceeded to determine the merits of the
appeal. The court dismissed the second appeal on both grounds of review brought
by the appellant. As to the first ground, the court was of the view that the
appellant had not adduced a shred of evidence to show that the PP had failed to
consider the effect of the appellant’s information provided in his
contemporaneous statements on the disruption of drug trafficking activities at
that time (at [<strong>79</strong>]). As to the second ground, the court took the view
that the PP’s determination of whether an offender had rendered substantive
assistance to the CNB in disrupting drug trafficking activities both within and
outside Singapore was simply not a determination involving the exercise of an
executive discretion that required a precedent fact to be established (at [<strong>84</strong>]),
which meant that the appellant could not impugn the PP’s non-certification
decision on the ground that the decision was reached in the absence of a
precedent fact being established. </font></span></p>
