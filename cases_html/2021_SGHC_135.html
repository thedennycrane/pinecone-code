After the Prosecution closed its case on 4 March 2020, the Defence made further representations. On 6 April 2020, the charge was amended from s 300(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) to s 300(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the Penal Code, which read as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">That you, DARYATI, on the 7th day of June 2016, at or about 8.32 p.m., at 50C Lorong H Telok Kurau, Singapore, committed murder by causing the death of one Seow Kim Choo, female, 59 years old, <span class="font-italic">to wit</span>, by slashing and stabbing the said Seow Kim Choo multiple times in the head, including the face, scalp and neck, with the intention of causing bodily injury to the said Seow Kim Choo, and the bodily injury intended to be inflicted is sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death, and you have thereby committed an offence under Section 300(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) and punishable under Section 302(2) of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2  A further forensic report specifically to address the requirements of s 300(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) and an Agreed Statement of Facts (“ASOF”) were admitted. The accused confirmed that she did not challenge the Prosecution’s evidence on her mental state. On the basis of the evidence tendered and the accused’s admissions, I convicted the accused on the amended charge. While the Prosecution indicated that it would not seek the death sentence, an adjournment for mitigation and sentencing at a later date was sought by defence counsel and acceded to. At the adjourned hearing on 21 September 2020, defence counsel informed that the accused wished to rely on the defence of diminished responsibility.

The accused was prepared to attack and kill the deceased if she refused to comply with her demands.

She then instructed Don Hayati to watch over Mr Ong and to wait for her command to switch off the CCTV camera and lights.

He called out to the deceased but did not receive a response. He then tried to open the door but found that it was locked, and then, worried that the deceased had fainted, he took a flashlight and screwdriver to open the door. He tried to peer into the toilet by looking through the gap between the floor and the bottom of the door, and when he saw there was blood on the floor, he used the screwdriver to open the toilet door from the outside.

He then fended her off with his hands and the long knife dropped onto the floor. He then went to check on the deceased. Whilst he was doing so, the accused grabbed the long knife from the floor and stabbed him on the neck again. Eventually, Mr Ong overpowered the accused and dragged her out of the toilet towards the stairwell. When they reached the area near the pool table outside the master bedroom, Mr Ong shouted Rowena’s name and called out for help. Don Hayati came up the stairs from the first floor, but upon seeing them, she screamed and ran off.

After Rowena gave him the cable ties, he tied the accused’s hands and brought the accused to the main gate of the house. Three passers-by helped to watch over her while Mr Ong went back to the master bedroom toilet to check on the deceased. At about 8.48pm, Rowena called for an ambulance, and a message was forwarded to the police.

At the oral response, I clarified and defence counsel agreed, that <span class="font-italic">it is only the second element </span>of diminished responsibility, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the root cause of the abnormality of mind, that is largely a matter for expert evidence: see <span class="font-italic">Iskandar </span>at [80]. For the first element, whilst medical opinion is useful in proving that there was an abnormality of mind, it will not be dispositive. A verdict that there is an abnormality of mind must be founded on all the evidence available, including medical opinion and the circumstances of the case: <span class="font-italic">Nagaenthran</span> at [28] and [29]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 The three limbs are related, nonetheless. In the present case the Defence relied upon the depressive disorder as the cause of the abnormality of mind and the reason for impairment of mental responsibility. The Prosecution, on its part, submitted that there was neither any abnormality of mind nor, in the light of the medical evidence, any disease, and was therefore of the view that there was no impairment of mental responsibility. Whether the accused had a persistent depressive disorder with intermittent depressive episodes was therefore fundamental to all three issues in this particular case, and I deal with this issue before analysing the three specific limbs.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Did the accused have a persistent depressive disorder with intermittent major depressive episodes? </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 Dr Tan’s evidence and Dr Sarkar’s evidence were at odds as to whether the accused had a depressive disorder. Dr Sarkar was of the view that the accused did not exhibit the symptoms required for the disorder, while Dr Tan’s conclusion was to the contrary. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 A fundamental concern was that Dr Tan’s analysis lacked factual substratum. <span class="font-italic">Anita </span><span class="font-italic">Damu v Public Prosecutor</span> [2020] 3 SLR 825 at [30] makes it clear that the expert opinion should have a proven factual basis. At [31]–[32] Sundaresh Menon CJ stressed that in evaluating expert opinion, the court’s task is to scrutinise the <span class="font-italic">underlying facts</span> that form the basis of such an opinion:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">31 … since the court is ultimately tasked with evaluating the expert opinion, the premise on which the expert’s conclusions are drawn must necessarily be before the court so as to allow the court to ascertain whether the expert’s conclusions are properly founded …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">32 In the context of psychiatric evidence, where there is a substantial dispute over the truth of an accused person’s account of the events, which has been conveyed to the psychiatrist, the basis rule would generally require that the accused person testify before the court as to the relevant factual basis. Only then can the psychiatrist’s opinion be properly assessed. …</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 Dr Tan’s report was based on the accused’s self-reported symptoms to him during the interview. There were no independent facts corroborating the symptoms that Dr Tan’s report relied upon, being depressed mood, loss of appetite and weight and suicidal thoughts. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 I start with depressed mood, which is a key symptom for DSM-5 depressive disorders.

There was planning undertaken in respect of the concealment of various knives and a hammer around the home at locations that could come in useful. On 7 June 2016, the material date, she exhibited quickness of thought in how she began and continued the attack on the deceased in the wardrobe area and the toilet.

</div> Dr Sarkar opined that there was no loss of impulse control because the accused knew she knew she was stabbing the deceased; it was just the number of times that she did not remember. She did not have amnesia regarding the incident as she could describe in detail the sequence of events and was exercising judgment as events unfolded.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 At trial, the accused’s contention was that she had no intention to kill and could not control her hands. Dr Sarkar’s perspective on this aspect of her evidence is dealt with at [57]–[58] above. In my view, her contentions at trial were not substantiated. From the context it was clear that in the lead up to the offence, the accused was prepared to kill if she had to do so in order to execute her plan to escape with her passport and money. She had planted many knives around the house to ensure that she could execute her plan. When the deceased put up a struggle, the accused, in keeping with her earlier plans, inflicted the various wounds and took quick action to achieve her objective. Her capacity to form, act and carry out her intention was dealt with at [54]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 In the light of the evidence, I found that the Prosecution had proved beyond reasonable doubt that the accused did cause and intend to cause the bodily injuries suffered by the deceased in this case. I therefore convicted the accused of the charge as framed under s 300(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the Penal Code.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Sentence</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 Section 302(2) of the Penal Code afforded a discretion to impose a term of life imprisonment or death for the accused. The Court of Appeal considered the issue of the discretionary death penalty in <span class="font-italic">Chan Lie San v Public Prosecutor </span>[2019] 2 SLR 439 (“<span class="font-italic">Chan Lie San</span>”). The death penalty is warranted where the actions of the offender outrage the feelings of the community, and this would be the case where these actions exhibit viciousness or a blatant disregard for human life: see <span class="font-italic">Chan Lie San</span> at [84]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 The Prosecution did not seek the death penalty. I was of the view that the particular and unique circumstances of the case did not outrage the feelings of the community. The accused was young (it was disputed whether she was 21 or 23 at the time of the offence) and had not an extensive experience outside of her village prior to her departure, save in the protected environments of a prawn factory and then a training centre. She had felt compelled by familial financial strain and filial duty to her parents to leave Indonesia. It was not disputed that she had been a victim of rape by her elder brother as a teenager in Indonesia; in Singapore she experienced bouts of sadness, loneliness and homesickness. The specific nature of the incident did not reflect a cold and calculated killing, but rather, intense panic and distress in executing her plan to return home. I therefore exercised my discretion to impose a term of life imprisonment. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 The life term was backdated to the date she was first remanded, 9 June 2016.
