<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       The plaintiffs and defendants were at all
                    material times directors of PPL Shipyard Pte Ltd (“PPLS”) except
                    for Anthony Sabastian Aurol (“Aurol”) who was purportedly removed
                    as a director on 8 June 2010. The shareholders of PPLS were Sembcorp Marine
                    Ltd (“SCM”) on the one hand and PPL Holdings Pte Ltd
                    (“PPLH”) and E-Interface Holdings Ltd
                    (“E-Interface”) on the other hand. E-Interface is a wholly-owned
                    subsidiary of PPLH. The plaintiffs were nominated as directors of PPLS by SCM
                    and the defendants were nominated as directors of PPLS by PPLH.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       As a result of a dispute between the
                    shareholders concerning the beneficial ownership of some shares in PPLS, various
                    board resolutions were proposed at various board meetings convened by or at the
                    instance of one or more of the SCM nominated directors. The PPLH nominated
                    directors however declined to attend these board meetings. Under Art 98 of
                    PPLS’articles of association, at least one PPLH nominated director must be
                    present to constitute a quorum for a board meeting. Consequently, there was no
                    quorum at these board meetings. Notwithstanding the absence of a quorum, the SCM
                    nominated directors proceeded to pass resolutions at these board meetings. They
                    then filed the present application for a declaration to validate the resolutions
                    under s 392 of the Companies Act (Cap 50, 2006 Rev Ed). The
                    primary reliefs sought under the application, as amended, were as
                    follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">1.    A declaration that
                            the resolution at the board meeting held on 11 May 2010 appointing
                            WongPartnership to advise and act for [PPLS] is
                            valid.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">2.    Further or in the
                            alternative, a declaration that the resolution at the board meeting held
                            on 3 June 2010 confirming the appointment of WongPartnership to
                            advise and act for [PPLS] is
                            valid.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">3.    A declaration that the
                            resolutions at the board meeting held on 3 June 2010 that [PPLS]
                            instruct WongPartnership to:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(a)    investigate the allegations made by [SCM] in a
                                letter dated 10 May 2010 and addressed to the board of
                                directors of [PPLS] (“Allegations”);</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(b)    advise [PPLS] how it should respond to the
                                Allegations;</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(c)    provide general advice on any issue relating
                                to the dispute between its shareholders; and</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(d)    provide general advice on any issue relating
                                to the continued operations of [PPLS] –</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">are valid.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">4.    A declaration that
                            the resolution at the board meeting held on 14 June 2010 appointing
                            WongPartnership to enter an appearance on behalf of [PPLS] and accept
                            service on behalf of [PPLS] of any documents served in the action in
                            Suit No 351 of 2010/H (“the Suit”) in the High Court of
                            the Republic of Singapore is
                            valid.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">5.    A declaration that the
                            resolutions at the board meeting held on 21 June 2010 are valid,
                            namely:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(a)    That
                                WongPartnership’s appointment be expanded such that they
                                may:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-3">i. do all such things arising from or related to the Suit to
                                protect the interests of [PPLS]; and</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-3">ii. provide advice to [PPLS] on how it should respond to the
                                allegations made against it in the Suit.</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(b)    That, as an interim measure and pending
                                contrary suggestions from WongPartnership, the Chairman of [PPLS] or
                                any other person nominated by the Chairman of [PPLS] is hereby
                                authorised by [PPLS] to provide instructions to and receive advice
                                from WongPartnership on the Suit. Douglas Tan may comment on or add
                                to the instructions provided to WongPartnership. However, where the
                                instructions of Douglas Tan conflict with those of the Chairman of
                                [PPLS] or the Chairman of [PPLS’] nominee, the instructions of
                                the Chairman of [PPLS] or the Chairman of [PPLS’] nominee will
                                prevail.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       The application was resisted by the PPLH
                    nominated directors who were the defendants. After hearing arguments, I made no
                    order on prayer 1. I granted an order in terms of prayers 2, 3(c) and (d), 4 and
                    5. I dismissed prayers 3(a) and (b). I also ordered the defendants to pay costs
                    of $5,000 to the plaintiffs.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       The defendants have appealed against my decision
                    to grant an order in terms of prayers 2, 3(c) and (d), 4 and 5 and to order
                    costs to be paid by them.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Background</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       PPLH is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Baker
                    Technology Ltd (“Baker Tech”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       On 16 April 2010, Yangzijiang Shipbuilding
                    (Holdings) Ltd (“Yangzijiang”) issued a binding letter of offer to
                    Baker Tech to acquire the entire issued and paid-up share capital of PPLH. In
                    its disclosure to the market on 17 April 2010, Yangzijiang stated that the
                    purchase consideration was arrived at by taking into account, <em>inter alia</em>, a certain net book value of PPLS for the financial
                    year 2009. The offer was accepted by Baker Tech.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       Following the acceptance of the offer by Baker
                    Tech, SCM sent a letter of complaint to the board of PPLS. The complaint alleged
                    that two of the defendants, Aurol and Benety Chang (“Chang”) had
                    breached their duty to PPLS by disclosing confidential information of PPLS to
                    Yangzijiang, <em>ie</em>, the book value of PPLS for the
                    financial year 2009. Aurol and Chang had access to this information from at
                    least 31 March 2010 when all directors of PPLS were given a copy of the
                    draft audited accounts. Such information was not supposed to be made public
                    until PPLS’ annual returns were filed with the Accounting and Corporate
                    Regulatory Authority (“ACRA”) on 19 April 2010.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       According to Tang Kin Fei
                    (“Tang”), the chairman of the board of directors of PPLS, the SCM
                    complaint made serious allegations against Aurol and Chang. Yangzijiang was a
                    potential competitor of PPLS. He thought it was in the best interest of PPLS to
                    deal with the allegations immediately and had a discussion with the other
                    plaintiffs thereon. Thereafter, one of them, Don Lee Fook Kang, sent an email to
                    all directors of PPLS on 10 May 2010 to convene a board meeting at 11.00am
                    the next day at SCM’s office to appoint a law firm to advise PPLS on the
                    SCM complaint.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       At 11.00am of 11 May 2010, Tang arrived for
                    the board meeting. He was handed letters from Wee, Tay &amp; Lim acting for the
                    defendants and from Straits Law Practice acting for PPLH. The Wee, Tay &amp; Lim
                    letter objected to the meeting as inadequate notice was given and a list of
                    possible lawyers had not been circulated before the board meeting. The Straits
                    Law Practice letter stated that Aurol had not committed any breach of
                    confidentiality and even if there was, it was <em>de
                        minimis</em>. It also stated that PPLS should not expend time, effort
                    and money on the matter. The plaintiffs waited for about 30 minutes and then
                    proceeded with the meeting in the absence of the defendants. They resolved that
                    WongPartnership be appointed to advise and act for PPLS in respect of the SCM
                    complaint. This is the subject of prayer 1 of the amended
                application.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     Subsequently, WongPartnership themselves
                    suggested to Wee, Tay &amp; Lim that another board meeting be convened to
                    discuss and decide on the matter about the appointment of a law firm to advise
                    PPLS.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     Another board meeting was then convened on
                    3 June 2010. However, by a letter dated 31 May 2010, the defendants
                    requested for confirmation that the 3rd June 2010 meeting would be
                    conducted in accordance with a shareholders’ agreement dated 9 April
                    2001 between SCM and PPLH. In particular, the defendants wanted confirmation
                    that the PPLH nominated directors would have three votes and the SCM nominated
                    directors would have three votes (only). This was the initial position when the
                    shareholders’ agreement was entered into because at that time, only three
                    directors were to be appointed by each side. However, as a result of certain
                    developments, the number of SCM nominated directors in PPLS had in fact
                    increased from three to six before 31 May 2010. At the time of the
                    increase, there was no agreement as to whether the six SCM nominated directors
                    would be able to out-vote the three PPLH nominated directors or not. Apparently,
                    subsequent decisions continued to be made unanimously.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     The plaintiffs’ solicitors then replied
                    on 1 June 2010 to say that under Art 98 of PPLS’ articles of
                    association, the SCM nominated directors were not confined to only three votes.
                    The defendants then wrote on 2 June 2010 to state that they would not
                    attend the 3 June 2010 meeting although the plaintiffs say they did not
                    receive this letter until after that meeting was held. At the 3 June 2010
                    meeting, the plaintiffs confirmed the appointment of WongPartnership as
                    solicitors of PPLS and resolved that they be instructed to investigate the
                    allegations made in the SCM complaint, advise PPLS how to respond to the
                    allegations, provide general advice relating to a suit (<em>ie</em>, Suit 351 of 2010) between PPLS’ shareholders and
                    provide general advice relating to the continued operations of PPLS. These are
                    the subject of prayers 2 and 3 of the amended application.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     Thereafter, the plaintiffs wrote to Aurol on
                    8 June 2010 requiring him to vacate his office as a director of PPLS
                    pursuant to Art 90(g) of the articles of association. The plaintiffs were
                    of the view that as he had admitted in a letter dated 12 May 2010 to
                    disclosing PPLS’ 2009 financial accounts to Yangzijiang on 13 April
                    2010 before the accounts were filed on 19 April 2010, he had breached his
                    duty of confidentiality.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     In the meantime, Suit 351 of 2010 was
                    commenced on 15 May 2010 by SCM against PPLH and E-Interface. The suit
                    arose as a result of the sale by Baker Tech of its shares in PPLH to
                    Yangzijiang. In it, SCM alleged that the sale of Baker Tech’s shares in
                    PPLH was a breach, <em>inter alia</em>, of an implied term
                    that neither party would, without offering its shares (in PPLS) to the other,
                    act in any manner which would cause the other to end up being a
                    “partner” with a party owned or controlled by someone else other
                    than the principals of the parties to the shareholders’ agreement. SCM
                    claimed various reliefs including a right to acquire the remaining shares held
                    by PPLH and E-Interface in PPLS based on a certain formula. In turn, PPLH and
                    E-Interface made a counterclaim against SCM as well as PPLs for various reliefs
                    which I need not elaborate on.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     Notwithstanding the resolutions passed at the
                    3 June 2010 meeting, the plaintiffs thought it better to hold another
                    directors’ meeting to expressly appoint WongPartnership to represent PPLS
                    in the suit. A board meeting was therefore called by Tan Cheng Tat on
                    10 June 2010 for 14 June 2010 for this purpose. Thereafter, Wee, Tay
                    &amp; Lim proposed a circular board resolution which would limit
                    WongPartnership’s authority in respect of the suit but the plaintiffs
                    preferred wider authority to be given in such a resolution.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     However, there was no agreement and the board
                    meeting of 14 June 2010 proceeded again in the absence of the remaining
                    PPLH nominated directors and Aurol. At that meeting, it was resolved that
                    WongPartnership was appointed to enter an appearance on behalf of PPLS in the
                    suit and to accept all documents served in the suit on behalf of PPLS. This is
                    the subject of prayer 4 of the amended application. All other issues relating to
                    WongPartnership’s mandate were deferred to another board meeting to be
                    held on 21 June 2010.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     After 14 June 2010, the plaintiffs caused
                    an agenda to be issued for the meeting on 21 June 2010. The agenda included
                    an item to give wide authority to WongPartnership in relation to the suit to
                    protect PPLS’ interests and an item on the authorisation of the chairman
                    or any other person nominated by the chairman to give instructions to
                    WongPartnership in the suit and to receive advice from them.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     On 18 June 2010, Straits Law Practice
                    (acting for PPLH) sent a telefax to the solicitors for the plaintiffs stating
                    that they had no issue with WongPartnership advising and representing PPLS in
                    the suit. They suggested that instructions to WongPartnership should be on the
                    basis of unanimous instructions but were unable to propose a resolution in the
                    absence of unanimity.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     As a way forward, the plaintiffs then
                    suggested that Douglas Tan, a PPLH nominated director who did not sit on the
                    board of PPLH, be allowed to comment or add to the instructions given by the
                    chairman or his nominee as an interim measure pending any contrary suggestion
                    from WongPartnership. However, this suggestion was not accepted.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     Accordingly, the board meeting of 21 June
                    2010 proceeded again without the attendance of the remaining directors nominated
                    by PPLH or Aurol. The resolutions set out in prayer 5 of the amended application
                    were passed at this meeting.</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     Mr George Lim SC, counsel for the
                    defendants, relied on <em>Thio Keng Poon v Thio Syn Pyn and
                        others and another appeal</em> [2010] 3 SLR 143
                        (“<em>Thio Keng Poon</em>”). In that
                    case, Art 88(c) of the articles of association of a company provided that
                    the office of director would <em>ipso facto</em> be vacated
                    if the director had been requested to vacate office by all the other directors
                    and they pass a resolution that he has been so requested. There, the other
                    directors passed a resolution to remove one of the directors from office even
                    though there was no prior request to him to resign. The Court of Appeal held
                    that the irregularity was a substantive one and could not be cured under
                    s 392(2) of the Companies Act.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     Mr Lim submitted that the absence of a
                    quorum in the board meetings of PPLS was likewise a substantive irregularity and
                    could not be cured under s 392(2).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     In my view, the short answer to that
                    contention was that the absence of a quorum in a board meeting is specifically
                    provided under s 392(1) to be a procedural irregularity. <em>Thio Keng Poon</em> was not a case involving the absence of a quorum
                    at a board meeting.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     Mr Lim also relied on a few other
                    cases.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     In <em>Re Goodwealth Trading
                        Pte Ltd</em> [1991] 2 MLJ 314 (“<em>Goodwealth</em>”), the articles of association of the company
                    provided for two directors to attend to constitute a quorum for a board meeting.
                    As a result of disputes, one director declined to attend various board meetings.
                    Subsequently, the non-attending director filed a petition to wind up the company
                    on the just and equitable ground. The other director purported to appoint
                    solicitors at a board meeting, which the petitioner did not attend, to oppose
                    the petition. At the hearing of the petition, a preliminary objection was taken
                    that the appointment of the solicitors was not valid. Yong Pung How CJ
                    referred to the conduct of the petitioner in not attending board meetings as a
                    defensive tactic and said at p 317:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... No doubt without intending to do so, Mr Ng Kai Ming
                        for the company and Mr Patrick Wee for Chua lent some force to Miss
                        Chia’ s contention with an almost identical argument; this was that
                        the absence of a quorum at the invalid board meeting on 25 October
                        1989, at which PK Wong &amp; Advani were appointed, was a mere procedural
                        irregularity which was cured by s 392(2) of the Companies Act which
                        provides:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">A proceeding under this Act is not invalidated by reason of any
                            procedural irregularity unless the Court is of the opinion that the
                            irregularity has caused or may cause substantial injustice that cannot
                            be remedied by any order of the Court and by order declares the
                            proceeding to be invalid.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Apart from the section, no authority was cited to me in support of this
                        contention. In my opinion, on a proper construction, s 392(2) is limited in
                        scope. An irregularity is not cured if<b><em> `the Court is of
                            the opinion that the irregularity has caused or may cause substantial
                            injustice that cannot be remedied by any order of the Court’.
                            Thus, the provision is clearly applicable to save the proceedings at a
                            meeting where the lack of a quorum is of little or no consequence, and
                            no shareholder’s interests are prejudiced by any decision taken at
                            the meeting. But the provision equally cannot be applicable in a case
                            such as this, in which it will result in disputed decisions being taken
                            by one of only two shareholder groups in a company to the exclusion and
                            possible disadvantage of the remaining shareholder. In my judgment,
                            therefore, the board meeting on 25 October 1989 and the proceedings
                            of the meeting were invalid. Having come to this view, I ruled that the
                            appointment of PK Wong &amp; Advani was also invalid. The firm of
                            solicitors had not been appointed by the company and therefore had no
                            locus standi in the proceedings. ..</em></b>.</p>

                        (“<em>Sum Hong Kum</em>”), Art 51 of
                    the articles of association of a company provided for a quorum of three members
                    for annual general meetings. The plaintiff who was a director and shareholder,
                    attended an annual general meeting (“AGM”) but left when an
                    attendance sheet was presented to him for his signature which he refused to
                    sign. In his absence, a resolution was passed that he had retired in accordance
                    with the articles of association.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     Following the AGM, there was a (second) board
                    meeting at which it was resolved, in the absence of the plaintiff, that his
                    remuneration should cease and his privilege in respect of a car would be
                    withdrawn.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     Warren Khoo J concluded that the
                    plaintiff’s initial presence at the AGM was not sufficient to constitute a
                    quorum and he had to be present when the resolution was to be passed. He said at
                    [13]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... Article 51 is in the nature of a deadlock provision which one often
                        finds in articles of small companies which are essentially
                        quasi-partnerships where it is intended that all shareholders have a say in
                        the affairs of the company and each shall have a sort of veto. A shareholder
                        who does not wish to have any business transacted can simply abstain from
                        attending a meeting. This was the defensive strategy, as Yong Pung How J (as
                        he then was) called it, which was adopted by one of the shareholders in
                            <em>Re Goodwealth Trading Pte Ltd</em> [1990]
                        2 SLR(R) 691. There is nothing wrong about it. It is what the
                        parties by contract have agreed. The result of such a deadlock is the
                        winding up of the company. There is nothing wrong with that, too, for the
                        same reason.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     Khoo J also interpreted the relevant
                    article on board meetings, <em>ie</em>, Art 87, to
                    mean that the plaintiff had to be present to constitute a proper quorum for a
                    board meeting.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     Accordingly, Khoo J concluded that there
                    was no valid quorum for the AGM and for the subsequent board meeting. He
                    declined to validate the resolutions passed at these meetings. He said at
                    [35]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Applying the propositions to the facts of the case, I still come to the
                        view that the procedural irregularity in this case, <em>ie</em> in proceeding with the general meeting and the second
                        directors' meeting in the absence of the plaintiff constituted a procedural
                        irregularity as defined in s 392(1) and that this procedural irregularity
                        resulted in substantial injustice to the plaintiff. The irregularity
                        deprived him of his right under the deadlock provisions of the articles to
                        prevent any decision from being taken by the company without his agreement.
                        This defect is a substantial defect which cannot be cured by s 392. On the
                        other hand, the plaintiff can come to the court to ask the court to declare
                        invalid the meetings mentioned above which took place without his
                        participation.</p>

                    there had to be a nexus between an irregularity and the alleged substantial

                        Heven Holdings Pty Ltd</em> (1992) 7 ASCR 85 which endorsed and
                    elaborated on <em>Re Pembury Pty Ltd</em> (1991) 9 ACLC
                    937, the Court of Appeal noted that “it is the procedural irregularity
                    that must have caused the injustice, not the resolutions
                    themselves.”</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     Relying on the above three cases, Mr Lim
                    submitted that the very fact that the defendants were deprived of the defensive
                    tactic that they were entitled to adopt meant that the court did not have any
                    power under s 392(2) to validate resolutions or that there would
                    necessarily be substantial injustice which would never be cured under
                    s 392(2), unless the resolutions were passed inadvertently without
                    knowledge of a lack of quorum.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     Mr Thio Shen Yi SC, counsel for the
                    plaintiffs referred to <em>The Oriental Insurance Co Ltd v
                        Reliance National Asia Re Pte Ltd</em> [2008] 3 SLR(R) 121
                        (“<em>Oriental Insurance</em>”) for
                    observations by the Court of Appeal on the meaning of “substantial
                    injustice” in the context of s 392(6)(<em>c</em>) Companies Act. There, the Court of Appeal reiterated, at
                    [106], that the determination of substantial injustice under s 392 involved
                    a “holistic weighing and balancing of the various interests of all the
                    relevant parties”. That observation is helpful for the purpose of
                    considering “substantial injustice” in the context of
                    s 392(2) although <em>Oriental Insurance</em> did not
                    involve a provision on a quorum which might result in a deadlock.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     I did not agree with Mr Lim’s
                    submission (in <a href="#p1_34">[34]</a> above). First, the
                    principle that the procedural irregularity must have caused the injustice and
                    not the resolutions themselves did not mean that the substance of the
                    resolutions was to be totally disregarded. The absence of a quorum was, by
                    statute, only a procedural irregularity. What the principle means is that both
                    the procedural irregularity and the substance of the resolutions must be
                    considered as part of the holistic approach mentioned in <em>Oriental Insurance</em>, and not only the substance of the
                    resolutions themselves.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     On the other hand, [35] of Khoo J’s
                    judgment in <em>Sum Hong Kum</em> did appear to support
                    Mr Lim’s contention. Khoo J appeared to have been influenced by
                    Yong CJ’s judgment in <em>Goodwealth</em> but while
                    it is true that Yong CJ did refer to a defensive tactic adopted by those
                    who wanted to create a deadlock, it is important to bear in mind that
                    Yong CJ did not suggest that the absence of a quorum in such a situation
                    would necessarily preclude a court from validating resolutions passed at
                    meetings without such a quorum. Indeed, Yong CJ went on to consider whether
                    there was substantial injustice and on the facts he found there was. It seemed
                    to me that Khoo J had extended what Yong CJ had said.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     Aside from comparing the terms of
                    s 392(2) with s 392(3) which refers to accidental conduct, it seemed
                    to me that if Mr Lim was right, the efficacy of s 392(2) would be
                    substantially reduced. Mr Lim’s submission would mean that
                    s 392(2) would apply only if the party proceeding with a meeting did so
                    inadvertently, <em>ie</em>, without realising that there
                    was no quorum. As it turned out, in <em>Thio Keng
                    Poon</em>, the Court of Appeal had already said at [58] that s 392(2)
                    is not confined to cases where the non-compliance was due to inadvertence. With
                    respect, I agree with that conclusion.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     I was of the view that the starting point
                    should be that where there is a provision which allows one party to engage in
                    the defensive tactic mentioned above, he is, <em>prima
                        facie</em>, entitled to do so. Where there is a deadlock in the sense
                    that no quorum can be formed for a board meeting, I was of the view that to
                    allow one party to push ahead with his agenda in the absence of the other party
                    was <em>prima facie</em> an injustice which was substantial
                    because he was denying the other party the right to stop the proposing party
                    from proceeding with his agenda, a right which the parties had agreed to
                    beforehand.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     It would then be for the proposing party to
                    persuade the court why the resolutions should nevertheless be validated or not
                    invalidated bearing in mind the holistic approach mentioned in <em>Oriental Insurance</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     Prayer 1 was in respect of a resolution passed
                    at a board meeting which was convened at very short notice, a point which the
                    plaintiffs acknowledged. In any event, its substance was covered by the
                    resolution in prayer 2. Accordingly, I declined to make any order on
                    prayer 1.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     The resolutions in prayers 2, 3(c) and (d), 4
                    and 5(a) were all neutral and in the interest of PPLS as PPLS had to be
                    represented in the suit. Indeed, the defendants themselves appeared to be in
                    agreement in principle with those resolutions. As for prayer 5(b), it was
                    practical to identify someone from whom WongPartnership could receive
                    instructions. The interim measure (mentioned in prayer 5(b)) also provided for
                    the other side, represented by Douglas Tan, to comment or add to instructions
                    from the nominated person. That provision would help to balance the scales.
                    Furthermore, if WongPartnership were to act in a manner which suggested a lack
                    of independence, it would be open to the SCM nominated directors or PPLH to
                    bring that to the attention of the court. In my view, the small risk of
                    WongPartnership acting in such a manner was preferable to a situation where
                    there was uncertainty as to who could give instructions to them or where a
                    deadlock in instructions could easily arise.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     Therefore, I validated prayers 2, 3(c) and
                    (d), 4 and 5.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     I considered the resolution under prayer 3(b)
                    to be connected with that under prayer 3(a) which was not neutral. The PPLH
                    nominated directors knew that if they attended the relevant board meeting, the
                    SCM nominated directors were likely to purport to out-vote them and hence the
                    PPLH nominated directors adopted the defensive tactic of not turning up for the
                    meeting. In so doing, they knew there would be no quorum but that was the effect
                    of the relevant article of association.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     Much was made by SCM and the plaintiffs about
                    the disclosure of PPLS’ 2009 financial accounts to Yangzijiang on
                    13 April 2010. It was suggested that Yangzijiang was a potential competitor
                    and having PPLS’ confidential information leaked to Yangzijiang would
                    clearly be detrimental to PPLS in any circumstance. Yet, there was no
                    elaboration on the likely damage to PPLS. Furthermore, as mentioned above,
                    Yangzijiang would in any event have been able to obtain that information a few
                    days later after PPLS’ annual returns were filed with ACRA on
                    19 April 2010. There was no evidence to suggest that the disclosure to
                    Yangzijiang a few days earlier was in fact damaging to PPLS. The resolutions
                    under prayers 3(a) and (b) appeared one-sided because they assumed that the
                    proposed investigation was truly in the interest of PPLS and not for a
                    collateral purpose of trying to find fault with certain persons at the
                    instigation of a shareholder who was unhappy with Yangzijiang’s intended
                    purchase. The true motive for the investigation had itself not yet been
                    established.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     In any event, it was for the plaintiffs to
                    persuade me that I should validate prayers 3(a) and (b). I was not persuaded
                    that I ought to do so in the circumstances. In dismissing those prayers, I had
                    intended to invalidate the resolutions thereunder.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     As the defendants failed in their primary
                    contention as advanced by Mr Lim (see <a href="#p1_24">[24]</a> and <a href="#p1_34">[34]</a> above), I
                    ordered them to pay costs of $5,000 to the plaintiffs.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     For completeness, I would add that the
                    omission by the plaintiffs to adjourn some of the board meetings in question in
                    the absence of a quorum, as was required by PPLS’ articles, did not affect
                    my conclusion on the power of the court to act under s 392(2) or whether
                    there was or might be substantial injustice. The disputes in the amended
                    application arose from the absence of a quorum and the plaintiffs accepted that
                    there was no quorum.</p>
