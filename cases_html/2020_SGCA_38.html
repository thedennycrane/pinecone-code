All the parties were agreeable to proceeding in this manner. The appellant’s counsel had returned recently from abroad and was still subject to a 14-day Stay Home Notice on the date of hearing of this appeal. The appellant, who was in Malaysia and subject to the country’s Movement Control Order, applied to join in the video-conference and was allowed by this court to do so on the condition that he was to have no speaking rights.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 The sole issue in this appeal concerned the following legal question: does a bankrupt in Malaysia have to obtain the sanction of the Director General of Insolvency (“the DGI”), who is the equivalent of Singapore’s Official Assignee (“the OA”), before<span class="font-italic"> </span>he commences legal proceedings in Singapore which are based on claims that are vested in the DGI? </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">3 Section 38(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the Insolvency Act 1967 (Act 360 w.e.f 31 December 1988) (M’sia) (“the Malaysian Insolvency Act”) stipulates that a bankrupt in Malaysia shall be incompetent to maintain any action without the “previous sanction”<span class="font-italic"> </span>of the DGI, other than an action for damages in respect of an injury to his person. In this case, it is not disputed that the plaintiff/appellant obtained the DGI’s sanction only after he commenced the present action, Suit No 965 of 2018 (“Suit 965/2018”). Accordingly, in the striking out application taken out by the defendants/respondents before the Assistant Registrar (“the AR”), the main issue was whether the DGI’s sanction which was granted after the commencement of Suit 965/2018 cured the appellant’s failure to comply with s 38(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the Malaysian Insolvency Act.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">4 The AR held that the appellant’s failure to obtain the DGI’s prior sanction before commencement of the action could not be cured by the DGI’s sanction granted after commencement of the action. Accordingly, the AR struck out Suit 965/2018 on the ground that it was legally unsustainable as the appellant had no legal standing<span class="font-italic"> </span>to commence Suit 965/2018 at the time of commencement. The appellant appealed to the High Court judge (“the Judge”). The Judge affirmed the AR’s decision in her oral judgment delivered on 29 July 2019. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">5 Before us, the appellant advanced a new argument. His submission was that the DGI’s prior sanction was in fact not required before commencement of the action because the appellant’s claims had vested in the DGI. According to the appellant, the requirement of prior sanction applies only in respect of claims which do not vest in the DGI.

</div> This ought not to be the relevant question as it was not necessary for the appellant to seek the DGI’s prior sanction in the first place.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">6 In the circumstances, the appellant submitted that the only irregularity in the present case was that he could not have commenced Suit 965/2018 in his own name but had to sue in the DGI’s name. He argued that this was a mere procedural irregularity and was curable by amending the name of the plaintiff under O 20 r 5(1) of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2014 Rev Ed) (“Rules of Court”).

The AR found that the effect of ss 151(1) and 152(2) of the Singapore Bankruptcy Act was that the Singapore courts recognise the DGI’s interest in the property of a person who has been made bankrupt in Malaysia. The appellant’s claims against the respondents had vested in in the DGI when he was adjudged a bankrupt in Malaysia and the appellant, without having obtained the DGI’s prior sanction, did not have the legal standing<span class="font-italic"> </span>to commence Suit 965/2018. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 The AR rejected the appellant’s argument that the DGI’s sanction could be obtained after the event.

The Judge rejected this argument as the appellant’s pleaded loss of reputation and mental distress were referable to the respondents’ alleged breach of contract and negligence. Following <span class="font-italic">Thomas </span><span class="font-italic">Loh </span>at [14], the appellant’s claims were not personal injury claims as they did not relate to pain felt by the appellant in respect of his body, mind or character and without immediate reference to his rights of property.

Whether the sanction obtained by the appellant from the DGI had retrospective effect was to be determined by Malaysian law. In this regard, the Judge accepted the expert opinion of Mr S Murthi (“Mr Murthi”), an advocate and solicitor of the High Court of Malaysia. The respondents’ expert stated unequivocally in the final paragraph of his legal opinion that “a sanction under s 38(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the Malaysian Insolvency Act 1967 given to the undischarged bankrupt by the DGI after the commencement of a legal action by the bankrupt does not have a retrospective effect to validate the initial originating process commenced without the prior sanction of the DGI”. The Judge also noted that Mr Murthi’s evidence was backed up by Malaysian case law. In contrast, there was no expert evidence adduced by the appellant to rebut Mr Murthi’s opinion.

The Judge held that even if there was such a time-bar, it would not be a basis for excusing the appellant’s lack of legal standing. From the appellant’s statement of claim, much of the impugned conduct took place in 2013 and yet the appellant only commenced Suit 965/2018 on 1 October 2018. In the intervening period, he chose to pursue various complaints and actions against a number of parties, including filing complaints against the respondents with the Law Society of Singapore in 2014. If the appellant’s claims in Suit 965/2018 were indeed time-barred, the appellant was the author of his own misfortune.

</div> Since the appellant’s claims in contract and tort against the respondents vested in the DGI, the appellant did not have to seek the prior sanction of the DGI. The issue of whether sanction could be granted retrospectively was thus irrelevant. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 As the striking out application and the appeal therefrom had proceeded on the wrong question, the appellant claimed that he was prejudiced in that he was denied the opportunity to cure the relevant defect in his pleadings, this defect being the commencing of Suit 965/2018 in his own name rather than in the DGI’s name. This defect could have been cured by allowing the appellant to amend his pleadings under O 20 r 5(1) of the Rules of Court, which states as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Subject to Order 15, Rules 6, 6A, 7 and 8 and this Rule, the Court may at any stage of the proceedings allow the plaintiff to amend his writ, or any party to amend his pleading, on such terms as to costs or otherwise as may be just and in such manner (if any) as it may direct. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 In response, the respondents pointed out that the fact that the appellant commenced Suit 965/2018 in his own name and not in the DGI’s name was only one of the defects in Suit 965/2018.

</div> However, before us, counsel for the respondents, Mr Christopher Anand s/o Daniel, clarified that the governing provision which the respondents were relying on was instead s 38(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the Malaysian Insolvency Act. As for the appellant, his counsel, Mr Paul Fitzgerald, accepted that it was s 38(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the Malaysian Insolvency Act which governed the “substantive bankruptcy” of the appellant, rather than s 131(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the Singapore Bankruptcy Act.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 To recapitulate, s 152(1) of the Singapore Bankruptcy Act provides that the Singapore and Malaysian governments shall recognise the respective official assignees in each country. It is not disputed that the relevant declaration referred to in s 152(1) of the Singapore Bankruptcy Act was made by the Minister of Law and duly notified in the Gazette (see Reciprocal Recognition of Official Assignees (GN No S 106/1950)). In our view, it would be inconsistent with the legislative framework for the Singapore courts to recognise the office of the DGI in Malaysia and yet permit a bankrupt in Malaysia to commence an action in Singapore without the DGI’s sanction, if the bankrupt is required to obtain the DGI’s sanction as a matter of Malaysian law. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 It follows from the above that the starting point to examine the appellant’s new argument ought to be s 38(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the Malaysian Insolvency Act followed by any relevant case law in Malaysia that can assist in the interpretation of that provision. For the purpose of this analysis, this court’s decision in <span class="font-italic">Thomas </span><span class="font-italic">Loh </span>would be useful in so far as s 131(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the Singapore Bankruptcy Act is in similar terms as s 38(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the Malaysian Insolvency Act. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Whether or not s 38(1)(a) of the Malaysian Insolvency Act applies to claims which are vested in the DGI</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 We set out s 38(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the Malaysian Insolvency Act again for easy reference:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Duties and disabilities of bankrupt</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">38. </span>(1) Where a bankrupt has not obtained his discharge —</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) the bankrupt shall be incompetent to maintain any action (other than an action for damages in respect of an injury to his person) without the previous sanction of the Director General of Insolvency;</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 In our judgment, the appellant’s new argument was untenable as it clearly contradicted s 38(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the Malaysian Insolvency Act. The appellant did not attempt to show how his new argument was supported by the text of this provision or by Malaysian case law. Section 38(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) certainly does not state that a bankrupt in Malaysia is not required to seek the DGI’s prior sanction if his claims are vested in the DGI. Instead, it states in clear terms that so long as the action is not one for “damages in respect of an injury to his person”, a bankrupt is required to obtain the “previous sanction” of the DGI before he commences “any action”. Clearly, “previous sanction” is completely different from sanction that is obtained only after the event, that is, after commencement of action has taken place. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 The appellant’s argument was also unsustainable in the light of the decision of the Federal Court of Malaysia in <span class="font-italic">Akira Sales &amp; Services (M) </span><span class="font-italic">Sdn Bhd v Nadiah Zee bt Abdullah and another appeal </span>[2018] 2 MLJ 537 (“<span class="font-italic">Akira Sales</span>”). In that case, a five-judge court stated at [20] and [21]: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[20] Sanction is not required to challenge an order in bankruptcy.

Subsequent sanction, which is not previous sanction, could not change the fact that the undischarged bankrupt was not competent to institute, maintain or defend the action at the material time. But previous sanction is not always required. Not everything vests in the DGI. Where not vested in the DGI, an undischarged bankrupt is not caught by s 38(1)(a). On that, we do not subscribe to the view expressed by the Singapore Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Standard Chartered Bank v </span><span class="font-italic">Loh Chong Yong Thomas</span> at paras [30] and [32] per VK Rajah JCA, delivering the judgment of the court, that an action for ‘property’ which does not vest in the assignees, still require the previous sanction coupled with assignment of the ‘property’ by the assignees.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 Contrary to the appellant’s arguments, s 38(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the Malaysian Insolvency Act is in fact applicable to claims which are vested in the DGI. However, s 38(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the Malaysian Insolvency Act does not apply to claims which are not vested in the DGI. On this point, we note that there is some divergence with the position in Singapore, which requires a bankrupt in Singapore to obtain the OA’s prior sanction even in respect of claims which do not vest in the OA, so long as the claims do not fall within the exceptions listed in s 131(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the Singapore Bankruptcy Act (<span class="font-italic">Thomas </span><span class="font-italic">Loh </span>at [30]). However, this divergence in this limited aspect was irrelevant for the purposes of this appeal. In the present case, it was not disputed that the appellant’s claims in Suit 965/2018, being claims in contract and tort, were vested in the DGI. Therefore, s 38(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the Malaysian Insolvency Act was applicable to the appellant’s claims in Suit 965/2018. His failure to comply with that provision meant that he had no legal standing<span class="font-italic"> </span>to commence Suit 965/2018 on 1 October 2018, the date the action was taken out.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 In our view, the appellant’s failure to obtain the DGI’s previous sanction affected his competence or capacity<span class="font-italic"> </span>to commence his action in Singapore. If he was “incompetent to maintain” the action, surely he could not be competent to commence the action too. This is entirely consistent with <span class="font-italic">Akira</span> <span class="font-italic">Sales</span> cited above. This incompetence or lack of capacity was not a mere procedural irregularity which could be rectified by amendment under O 20 r 5(1) of the Rules of Court because the action could not be commenced by the appellant at all on 1 October 2018. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 We were not persuaded by the appellant’s argument that he would be prejudiced if Suit 965/2018 was struck out because of a potential time-bar against his claims. We agree with the Judge that any potential time-bar was simply the consequence of the appellant’s own delay in commencing Suit 965/2018.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Thomas Loh</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 As we have explained above, the appellant’s lack of legal standing<span class="font-italic"> </span>turned on his failure to comply with s 38(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the Malaysian Insolvency Act. As a matter of Malaysian law, it was clear that the appellant had to comply with <br/>s 38(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the Malaysian Insolvency Act but did not do so. <span class="font-italic">Thomas </span><span class="font-italic">Loh</span>, which concerned s 131(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the Singapore Bankruptcy Act, was not directly relevant to the above analysis. Nevertheless, since the appellant submitted that his new argument was supported by <span class="font-italic">Thomas </span><span class="font-italic">Loh</span>, we shall discuss it briefly.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 The appellant focused specifically on the following paragraph in <span class="font-italic">Thomas </span><span class="font-italic">Loh </span>in support of his new argument (at [30]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">30 Section 131(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the BA expressly restricts the competence of a bankrupt, so long as he has not obtained his discharge, to maintain any action (other than an action for damages in respect of an injury to his person) without the previous sanction of the OA<span class="font-italic"> </span>(for ease of reference, we shall, in this part of the judgment, use the term ‘the s 131(1)(a) BA restriction’ to denote the stipulation that the bankrupt must obtain the OA’s previous sanction before commencing an action which is not an action for damages in respect of an injury to his person). This formulation of the rights and disabilities of a bankrupt implies that it is only in cases where the bankrupt would be competent – if not for the <br/>s 131(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) BA restriction – to maintain an action <span class="font-italic">despite his bankruptcy</span> that he requires the previous sanction of the OA. What then are the actions which, if not for the s 131(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) BA restriction, a bankrupt is competent to maintain notwithstanding his bankruptcy? As these actions will not, for practical reasons, be actions relating to property which vests in the OA upon bankruptcy (see [16] above), they must be actions relating to property that does not vest in the OA upon bankruptcy.<span class="font-weight-bold font-italic"> </span>In other words, the bankrupt may maintain any action with respect to property which remains vested in him despite his bankruptcy, but s 131(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the BA declares it incompetent for him to do so without the previous sanction of the OA. In our view, this is the proper construction of s 131(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the BA, having regard to the object of the legislation, which is to (<span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>) ‘disable’ some of a bankrupt’s civil rights. [emphasis in original] </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 In our judgment, the context of the above paragraph shows that the court was concerned with identifying the claims which a bankrupt would be able to sue in his own name once the OA’s prior sanction was obtained. It was noted that such claims “must be actions relating to property that does not vest in the OA upon bankruptcy”. This is because for “actions relating to property which vests in the OA upon bankruptcy”, the bankrupt may sue in his own name only if the OA assigns the property in question back to the bankrupt. However, the court pointed out that the OA would not assign property back to a bankrupt. This was explained in <span class="font-italic">Thomas </span><span class="font-italic">Loh </span>earlier in that judgment at [15] and [16]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">15 The second issue raises the question of whether property of a bankrupt which has vested in the OA upon bankruptcy must be assigned by the OA back to the bankrupt before the latter can sue <span class="font-italic">in his own name</span> on that property. The guiding principle here is that, where property of a bankrupt has vested in the OA upon bankruptcy, the bankrupt no longer has any standing to commence any proceedings <span class="font-italic">in his own name</span> in respect of such property. He may do so (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, sue in his own name <span class="font-italic">vis-à-vis</span> property vested in the OA) <span class="font-italic">only if</span> the OA assigns the property in question back to him (upon such assignment, the property re-vests in the bankrupt, which is why he can then bring an action in his own name <span class="font-italic">apropos</span> that property). In contrast, if the OA does not assign the property in question back to the bankrupt (and merely grants the sanction required by s 131(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)), the bankrupt cannot sue in his own name in respect of the property, but must instead sue <span class="font-italic">in the OA’s name</span>. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">16 The second issue is, to all intents and purposes, purely hypothetical in that it has never been the practice of the OA, for practical and other reasons (one of which is s 131 of the BA, which we shall examine later), to assign property back to a bankrupt so that the latter can pursue a claim which he has in respect of that property. Such a procedure would entail more administrative oversight on the part of the OA in terms of recovering from the bankrupt any damages or restitution that he may obtain from the defendant. If the bankrupt has a viable claim against the defendant, the OA would have a duty to pursue the claim for the benefit of the creditors. The OA would also have full control over the proceedings. It can be envisaged that, if an assignment of property back to a bankrupt for the purposes of enabling him to sue on it is made, such assignment would be subject to so many conditions in order to safeguard the interests of the creditors that it would simply be more convenient for the OA to sue on the property rather than to delegate this duty back to the bankrupt by an assignment of that property.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis in original]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 In <span class="font-italic">Thomas </span><span class="font-italic">Loh</span>, the plaintiff/respondent commenced an action in his own name against the defendant/appellant. There were three claims advanced by the respondent, namely, breach of duty in contact, breach of duty in tort and defamation. As the respondent was an undischarged bankrupt, his claims in contract and tort vested in the OA. His claim for defamation did not vest in the OA as it related to “pain felt by the respondent in respect of his body, mind, or character, and without immediate reference to his rights of property” (at [14]). It was undisputed that the respondent did not seek the OA’s prior sanction before commencing the action (at [7]). It was held that the OA’s sanction was required for all three claims, including the two claims that were vested in the OA, as all three claims were not for “damages in respect of any injury to the bankrupt’s person”. The conclusion in that case was as follows (at [44]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">44 In conclusion, we find for the appellant on all the essential issues.<span class="font-italic"> </span>None of the respondent’s claims in the DC Suit were claims for ‘damages in respect of an injury to [the] person’ (<span class="font-italic">per</span> s 131(1)(a) of the BA); thus, the respondent had to obtain the previous sanction of the OA before he could commence the DC Suit.<span class="font-italic"> </span>This was not done, and this failure to comply with s 131(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the BA could not be cured by the retrospective ‘sanction’ which the respondent received from the OA. Further, the respondent was the sole plaintiff throughout the DC Suit and currently still remains the sole plaintiff (see [7] above). However, as we pointed out earlier, the respondent cannot sue in his own name in so far as his claims for breach of duty in contract and in tort are concerned as these claims now vest in the OA because of s 76(1)(a)(i) of the BA. For these reasons, we allow the present appeal. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46  It is therefore clear to us that the appellant’s new argument arose from an incorrect reading of <span class="font-italic">Thomas </span><span class="font-italic">Loh</span>. The position in <span class="font-italic">Thomas </span><span class="font-italic">Loh </span>is consistent with the plain wording of s 131(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the Singapore Bankruptcy Act, under which a bankrupt in Singapore is required to obtain the sanction of the OA before he commences “any action”, unless the action is “an action for damages in respect of any injury to the bankrupt’s person” or “a matrimonial proceeding” (the latter exception was introduced after <span class="font-italic">Thomas </span><span class="font-italic">Loh </span>was decided, pursuant to the Bankruptcy (Amendment) Act 2015 (No 21 of 2015)). This would include claims which vest in the OA and claims that do not vest in the OA. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 For the above reasons, we dismissed the appeal.

<p><strong><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">Decision of the Court of Appeal (delivered by Tay Yong Kwang JA):</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: black; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">Outcome:<em> </em>Court of Appeal dismisses the appellant’s appeal and holds that he had no legal standing to commence Suit No 965 of 2018 on 1 October 2018 as he did not obtain the Director General of Insolvency’s prior sanction.</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">Introduction </span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">1<span style="white-space:pre;"> </span>The sole issue in this appeal concerned the following legal question: does a bankrupt in Malaysia have to obtain the sanction of the Director General of Insolvency (“the DGI”), who is the equivalent of Singapore’s Official Assignee (“the OA”), before he commences legal proceedings in Singapore which are based on claims that are vested in the DGI? </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">2<span style="white-space:pre;"> </span>Section 38(1)(<em>a</em>) of the Insolvency Act 1967 (Act 360 w.e.f 31 December 1988) (M’sia) (“the Malaysian Insolvency Act”) stipulates that a bankrupt in Malaysia shall be incompetent to maintain any action without the “previous sanction” of the DGI, other than an action for damages in respect of an injury to his person. It was not disputed that the plaintiff/appellant obtained the DGI’s sanction only after he commenced the present action, Suit No 965 of 2018 (“Suit 965/2018”). </span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">3<span style="white-space:pre;"> </span>The appellant, Dr Edward Ho Yu Tat, is a Malaysian citizen. The first respondent, Mr Joseph Chen Kok Siang, was the former solicitor of the appellant. The first respondent is the managing partner of the second respondent, Joseph Chen &amp; Co. He acted for the appellant who was the plaintiff in District Court Suit No 2230 of 2011 (“the Underlying Suit”).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">4<span style="white-space:pre;"> </span>On 5 December 2013, the appellant’s defamation claim in the Underlying Suit was dismissed by the District Judge (“the DJ”). On 26 September 2014, the appellant’s appeal against the DJ’s decision was dismissed by the High Court. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">5<span style="white-space:pre;"> </span>On 10 December 2014, the appellant was made a bankrupt in Malaysia by a bankruptcy order of the Penang High Court. The appellant remained an undischarged bankrupt at the time the appeal before the Court of Appeal (“the Court”) was heard.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">6<span style="white-space:pre;"> </span>On 1 October 2018, the appellant commenced Suit 965/2018 against the respondents. The appellant sued the respondents for breach of contract and/or negligence arising out of their legal representation of the appellant in the Underlying Suit. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">7<span style="white-space:pre;"> </span>On 15 October 2018, the appellant applied to the DGI for his sanction. The appellant obtained the DGI’s sanction on 14 December 2018. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">Decisions of the High Court</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">8<span style="white-space:pre;"> </span>The respondents took out a striking out application before the Assistant Registrar (“the AR”). The main issue was whether the DGI’s sanction which was granted after the commencement of Suit 965/2018 cured the appellant’s failure to comply with s 38(1)(<em>a</em>) of the Malaysian Insolvency Act. The AR held that the appellant’s failure to obtain the DGI’s prior sanction before commencement of the action could not be cured by the DGI’s sanction granted after commencement of the action. Accordingly, the AR struck out Suit 965/2018 on the ground that it was legally unsustainable as the appellant had no legal standing to commence Suit 965/2018 at the time of commencement. The appellant appealed to the High Court judge (“the Judge”). The Judge affirmed the AR’s decision in her oral judgment delivered on 29 July 2019.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">Summary of the parties’ arguments on appeal</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">9<span style="white-space:pre;"> </span>The appellant raised a new argument before the Court that was not advanced before the AR or the Judge. According to the appellant, the Court’s decision in <em>Standard Chartered Bank v Loh Chong Yong Thomas</em> [2010] 2 SLR 569 (“<em>Thomas Loh</em>”) stood for the proposition that the prior sanction of the OA/DGI is only necessary for claims that do not vest in the OA/DGI.  Since the appellant’s claims in contract and tort against the respondents vested in the DGI, the appellant did not have to seek the prior sanction of the DGI. The issue of whether sanction could be granted retrospectively was thus irrelevant.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">10<span style="white-space:pre;"> </span>The appellant claimed that because the striking out application and the appeal therefrom had proceeded on the wrong question (namely, whether the DGI’s sanction had retrospective effect), he was prejudiced in that he was denied the opportunity to cure the relevant defect in his pleadings, this defect being the commencing of Suit 965/2018 in his own name rather than in the DGI’s name. This defect could have been cured by allowing the appellant to amend his pleadings under O 20 r 5(1) of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2014 Rev Ed) (“Rules of Court”). </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">The Court’s decision</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">11<span style="white-space:pre;"> </span>Section 38(1)(<em>a</em>) of the Malaysian Insolvency Act governed the appellant’s capacity to sue as a bankrupt in Malaysia, rather than s 131(1)(<em>a</em>) of the Singapore Bankruptcy Act (Cap 20, 2009 Rev Ed) (“the Singapore Bankruptcy Act”) (at <strong>[33]</strong>). </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">12<span style="white-space:pre;"> </span>Section 152(1) of the Singapore Bankruptcy Act provides that the Singapore and Malaysian governments shall recognise the respective official assignees in each country. It would be inconsistent with the legislative framework for the Singapore courts to recognise the office of the DGI in Malaysia and yet permit a bankrupt in Malaysia to commence an action in Singapore without the DGI’s sanction, if the bankrupt is required to obtain the DGI’s sanction as a matter of Malaysian law (at <strong>[34]</strong>–<strong>[35]</strong>).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">13<span style="white-space:pre;"> </span>The appellant’s new argument was untenable as it clearly contradicted s 38(1)(<em>a</em>) of the Malaysian Insolvency Act. The appellant did not attempt to show how his new argument was supported by the text of this provision or by Malaysian case law. Section 38(1)(<em>a</em>) does not state that a bankrupt in Malaysia is not required to seek the DGI’s prior sanction if his claims are vested in the DGI. Instead, it states in clear terms that so long as the action is not one for “damages in respect of an injury to his person”, a bankrupt is required to obtain the “previous sanction” of the DGI before he commences “any action” (at <strong>[37]</strong>). </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">14<span style="white-space:pre;"> </span>The appellant’s new argument was also unsustainable in the light of the decision of the Federal Court of Malaysia in <em>Akira Sales &amp; Services (M) Sdn Bhd v Nadiah Zee bt Abdullah and another appeal</em> [2018] 2 MLJ 537 (“<em>Akira Sales</em>”) which held that s 38(1)(<em>a</em>) of the Malaysian Insolvency Act is applicable to claims which are vested in the DGI (at <strong>[38]</strong>–<strong>[39]</strong>). </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">15<span style="white-space:pre;"> </span>The appellant’s failure to obtain the DGI’s previous sanction affected his competence or capacity to commence his action in Singapore. If he was “incompetent to maintain” the action, he could not be competent to commence the action too and this is consistent with <em>Akira Sales</em>. This incompetence or lack of capacity was not a mere procedural irregularity which could be rectified by amendment under O 20 r 5(1) of the Rules of Court because the action could not be commenced by the appellant at all on 1 October 2018 (at <strong>[40]</strong>).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">16<span style="white-space:pre;"> </span><em>Thomas Loh</em>, which concerned s 131(1)(<em>a</em>) of the Singapore Bankruptcy Act, was not directly relevant to the question of whether the appellant had to comply with s 38(1)(<em>a</em>) of the Malaysian Insolvency Act. In any event, the appellant’s new argument resulted from an incorrect reading of <em>Thomas Loh</em>. The position in <em>Thomas Loh</em> is consistent with the plain wording of s 131(1)(<em>a</em>) of the Singapore Bankruptcy Act, under which a bankrupt in Singapore is required to obtain the sanction of the OA before he commences “any action”, unless the action is “an action for damages in respect of any injury to the bankrupt’s person” or “a matrimonial proceeding”. This would include claims which vest in the OA and claims that do not vest in the OA (at <strong>[42]</strong> and <strong>[46]</strong>). </span></p>
