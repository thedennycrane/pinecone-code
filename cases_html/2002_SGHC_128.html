<strong>Judgment</strong>
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font color="#800000" face="Times New Roman"><strong><u>GROUNDS OF

DECISION</u><em>

               

Cur Adv Vult</em></strong></font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">1.

        The plaintiff is an Indian company dealing in

vegetable oil. It claimed that it had entered into an oral agreement with the defendant

bank to purchase 9,000 m.t. of degummed rapeseed oil from it. The bank’s case is that

there was no binding contract between them, and if there was a contract, it was not

enforceable.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">2.

        The events leading to the dispute started in

1999 when Shweta International Pte Ltd ("Shweta"), a Singapore company,

purchased rapeseed oil from Germany. Shweta obtained financial assistance from the bank to

pay for the oil and pledged the oil to it as security. Shweta sold the oil on to Lanyard

Foods Ltd ("Lanyard") of India. When the oil arrived at Kandla in India, the

import document known as the bill of entry was issued in the name of Lanyard, and Lanyard

took delivery of the oil and deposited it into customs-bonded tanks.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">3.

        Difficulties arose when Lanyard did not pay

Shweta and in turn Shweta did not pay the bank. The bank decided to exercise its power of

sale as pledgee. In October 2000, Mahesh Mehta, Senior Manager of the Trade and Commodity

Finance department of the bank and his subordinate, Sunil Kumar s/o Ragnath ("Sunil

Kumar"), entered into negotiations with Chetan Kumar s/o M.A. Parikh ("Chetan

Parikh"), the plaintiff’s representative on the sale of the oil. This led to

Sunil Kumar sending a fax on 19 October.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">4.

        The fax reads in full:</font></p>

<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">5.

        The plaintiff’s case is that the

negotiations had culminated in an agreement which terms were set out in the fax.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">6.

        The bank took a contrary position. The defence

filed referred to various facts and issues which could have been pleaded more concisely

and clearly than they were, but in effect there were three lines of defence. The first is

that no agreement was concluded and the fax of 19 October was a draft agreement for sale

and purchase which was subject to conditions, and those conditions were not met. The

conditions were:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">(i) Shweta and Lanyard must agree to the

  sale;</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">(ii) a written sale agreement was to be

  executed by the plaintiff, defendant, Shweta and Lanyard;</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">(iii) the plaintiff was to pay the import

  duty on the oil; and</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">(iv) Wilmar Trading Pte Ltd

  ("WTPL"), a shareholder of the plaintiff company, was to take an interest-free

  loan of $1.4m from the bank and advance it to the plaintiff to pay the import duty<sup>1</sup>.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">7.

        The second line of defence is that if there was

a contract it was not enforceable when it became impossible of performance and was

frustrated because</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">(i) Lanyard did not agree to transfer the

  bill of entry to the plaintiff, and</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">(ii) on or about 1 November 2000 there was

  an order restraining the sale of the oil<sup>2</sup>.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">8.

        The last line of defence is that if a contract

was concluded it was vitiated because both parties had acted in the mistaken belief that

the bill of entry can be transferred to the plaintiff<sup>3</sup>.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">9.

        The bank also made a counterclaim against the

plaintiff. It was a curious claim for the loss it suffered loss when the contract was not

carried out. Nothing in the pleadings or evidence explained the basis of the claim for

loss on a contract which existence it denied, and which it had refused to perform. The

counterclaim was withdrawn in the course of the trial subject to the bank paying costs in

the counterclaim up to the time of withdrawal.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">10.

        Four persons were involved in the negotiations

for the sale of the oil. They are Rajesh S. Adani ("Rajesh Adani") the Managing

Director of the plaintiff, Chetan Parikh, Sunil Kumar and Mahesh Mehta.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">11.

        The first three persons gave evidence in these

proceedings. The plaintiff had summoned Mahesh Mehta as a witness but did not call him,

and offered him to the bank, but the bank did not take up the offer.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">12.

        Chetan Parikh’s evidence is that he came

to know of the oil from Mahesh Mehta when they met on 13 October 2000. This was followed

up by negotiations over the telephone between himself, Rajesh Adani and Mahesh Mehta.

Eventually they agreed on the price at 170 Rps/10 kgs on the basis that the bank will pay

the import duty.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">13.

        He went to the bank and met with Mahesh Mehta

and Sunil Kumar to tie down details on the delivery of the oil to the plaintiff and the

bank’s payment of the import duty. Sunil Kumar told him that the bank could not pay

the import duty itself because it was not the importer of the oil in India and that it

needed the plaintiff’s assistance as an importer to pay the duty on its behalf.

Chetan Parikh suggested that he should speak to Rajesh Adani who was familiar with customs

procedures. He also made it clear that the plaintiff did not want to be involved with

Shweta and Lanyard in the purchase.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">14.

        On 19 October, he received the fax from Sunil

Kumar. He was surprised that Shweta and Lanyard were included as parties in the contract.

He went to seek clarification from Mahesh Mehta and Sunil Kumar on that. Sunil Kumar

assured him that the plaintiff did not have to worry over that because Shweta and Lanyard

were included as an internal matter between the bank and Shweta.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">15.

        After 19 October he followed up with the bank

on the payment of the import duty, but little progress was being made. He sent faxes and

spoke with Mahesh Mehta and Sunil Kumar, but with no result until matters came to a head

on 13 November, when the bank took the position that there was no contract between them.

Further efforts made to proceed with the purchase also failed.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">16.

        Rajesh Adani’s evidence was consistent

with Chetan Parikh’s. He spoke with Mahesh Mehta over the telephone and informed him

that the plaintiff would only buy the oil if the bank paid the duty. When the transaction

stalled, he wrote to the bank on 30 October, 8 November and 10 November to press it to

perform the contract but the bank did not respond till 13 November when it denied that

there was a contract to perform.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">17.

        Sunil Kumar gave the bank’s account of the

events. He and Mahesh Mehta met with Chetan Parikh on 18 October. In the ensuing

discussion they told Chetan Parikh that the original seller of the oil was Shweta, and the

original buyer was Lanyard, and that the bank was selling the oil as pledgee. They also

told him that the oil was in bonded storage tanks and the bill of entry was issued in the

name of Lanyard, but Lanyard had not paid the customs duty, and had agreed to transfer the

bill of entry to the plaintiff for it to take delivery of the oil.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">18.

        Sunil Kumar went on to say that it was clear to

all the parties that Lanyard was to be a crucial party to the sale<sup>4</sup> and that

the plaintiff was to be responsible for the payment of the duty<sup>5</sup>. However the

plaintiff did not have the resources to pay and it was agreed that the bank would consider

making a loan to WTPL which was a customer of the bank, to be used for that purpose<sup>6</sup>.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">19.

        After that meeting, he prepared a draft

contract and faxed it to Chetan Parikh on 19 October. Chetan Parikh’s response after

receiving the fax was that it was broadly acceptable save for two items – first that

the 60 day delivery period was to run from the date of the transfer of the bill of entry,

and second that the sale was not a direct sale, and that a broker was to be involved.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">20.

        He then turned his attention to the loan to

WTPL, the transfer of the bill of entry from Lanyard’s name to the plaintiff’s

and the delivery orders to be issued to enable the plaintiff to take delivery.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">21.

        The loan to WTPL was put in the charge of his

colleague Lynn Ng. She submitted a credit memorandum with another officer, Angeline Tang

on 20 October to the bank’s credit committee. Although the credit committed approved

the proposed facility the offer of the facility was not carried through.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">22.

        On 27 October, he received telephone calls from

Shweta and Lanyard that there were rumours of a customs duty increase, and that they did

not wish to proceed with the transaction with the plaintiff. He informed Mahesh Mehta,

Jacqueline Chang and Lynn Ng of this<sup>7</sup>. (In this regard what he did not do is

more significant than what he did. The plaintiff was not informed of Shweta and

Lanyard’s decision. It would be expected that if the plaintiff and the bank had

agreed that the sale was subject to Shweta and Lanyard’s agreement, that Sunil Kumar

or the bank would notify the plaintiff of Shweta and Lanyard’s decisions.)</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">23.

        Legal proceedings were taken out in respect of

the oil in India. Punjab National Bank ("PNB") sued for monies owing to it by

Lanyard. On 1 November PNB obtained an interim injunction restraining the bank from

parting with any property of Lanyard that it held. The bank succeeded in having the order

set aside on 5 July 2001, but it was reinstated on appeal on 25 July.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">24.

        The plaintiff was not a party to the legal

proceedings in India. The bank did not invite their participation as it had already taken

the position on 13 November 2000 that there was no contract of sale between them.

Nevertheless two matters in the Indian proceedings are of relevance. First, there was a

consent order which released part of the oil to ten parties upon payment<sup>8</sup>.

Second, the bank by its representative, Mufazal Kantawala, deposed in an affidavit filed

in those proceedings that the bank had sold a substantial portion of the oil before the

injunction was issued.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">25.

        There was a body of contemporaneous documents

which shed light on the disputed matters.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">26.

        The first is an email dated 18 October from

Chetan Parikh to Rajesh Adani, Sunil Kumar and Mahesh Mehta. This email, which preceded

Sunil Kumar’s fax of 19 October reads in part </font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">

</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">27.

        The first sentence which referred affirmatively

to a concluded contract was not contradicted by Mahesh Mehta or Sunil Kumar. The latter

said that he did not read the email when it was received, printed out and filed<sup>9</sup>.

This email showed that Chetan Parikh regarded there to be a concluded contract, and

expected Mahesh Mehta and Sunil Kumar to be of like mind. He is unlikely to send this

message if he knew that there was no contract, because Mahesh Mehta and Sunil Kumar would

contradict and correct him when they read the message. He would not know that Sunil Kumar

would not read messages that were received and filed.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">28.

        Sunil Kumar’s fax of 19 October set out in

para 6 also referred to the oil being sold to the plaintiff. Nothing in the fax indicated

that the sale was subject to any other conditions than those mentioned.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">29.

        The next document of relevance is the credit

memorandum of 20 October. The salient parts of this memorandum read –</font></p>

<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Shweta International Pte Ltd had defaulted

<i><p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">9,000 mt of rapeseed oil sold to Adani

    Wilmar Limited</font></p>
</i>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">1) Rabobank had arranged to sell 9,000 mt

    of rapeseed oil to Adani Wilmar Limited at the <i>price of Rp170/10 kg </i>(<i>inclusive

    of the custom duty payable</i>). As it is likely that there would be an increase in the

    import duty in November, <i>it is in the interest of the Bank to make an immediate upfront

    payment of the import duty</i> prior to the announcement.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">2) However, <i>as the Bank is not in the

    position to pay the customs duty directly in India, we have to pay the customs duty via

    Adani-Wilmar</i>. Adani-Wilmar had in turn, requested Wilmar Trading to fund the customs

    payment. Wilmar Trading was only agreeable to this provided that the loan is extended on

    an interest-free basis, since it is the Bank that will benefit from the lower duty paid.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">3) The delivery of the oil would take over

    a period of 2 months, and <i>under the terms of our sales agreement</i>, the storage

    charges would be borne by Rabobank. As such, we are requesting that the tenor of this

    exceptional interest free Short Term Advance be set at 60 days.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">… …</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">3) Modus operandi</font></p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">a) The oil will be delivered against cash

      (Rp) payment from Adani Wilmar, with payment collected through our nominated bank, DBS

      Mumbai, and converted into USD for remittance to us.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">b) <i>The USD1.4 mln loan will be retired

<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Recommendation</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">1. We recommend that the interest free

    loan of upto USD1.4 mln, be extended to Wilmar Trading Pte Ltd. This exposure is necessary

    <i>to enable the Bank to make an immediate upfront payment on the customs duty</i>, to

    avoid the import duty hike anticipated in November 2000.</font></p>

<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">(Emphasis added)</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">32.

        Apparently Sunil Kumar had informed her that

there were issues pending <i>at the bank’s end</i>. It is also apparent that he did

not inform her that the sale had fallen through because Shweta and Lanyard did not agree

to it.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">33.

        The next set of relevant documents is an

exchange of email messages between Sunil Kumar and Jacqueline Chang (Assistant General

Manager and head of the Trade and Commodity Finance department) on 6 November. In the

first message, Sunil Kumar reported to her on the problems that had arisen</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Mr Chetan Parikh, broker for the above

  transaction, came to see me today after leaving a couple of messages for me.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">He indicates that Rabo had a verbal

  commitment to deliver the oil to Adani Wilmar and would expect us to perform on the

  contract although our understanding was that all 4 parties (Rabo, Lanyard, Shweta and

  Adani) should sign on the contract. He mentioned that Adani Wilmar had to deliver the

  refined reapeseed to its own buyers and would be in default if the oil was not delivered.

  Hence, any loss incurred could be claimed from Rabo.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">I subsequently spoke to Rajesh Adani, the

  promoter of Adani Group. He indicated that despite the injunction (which is known to

  them), we should consign the BLs to them and they would get the injunction lifted

  themselves, being the consignee under the BLs. However, when I inquired whether

  Rabo’s obligations would end if the injunction was not lifted, he was non-committed

  on this issue.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">34.

        Jacqueline Chang’s response was</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">This is a tricky situation. In a sense,

  it’s not a bad thing that we did not succeed with pulling the deal through with

  Wilmar as we would not have been able to allow delivery of oil (and risk getting ourselves

  sued!).</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">As discussed, Adani’s proposal that

  they could work around the order or better still to lift the order would mean going

  directly against Lanyard, which is a risk that I am not prepared to take. Lanyard could

  very well frustrate our sale efforts and the complications could be exponential. In any

  case, it is not possible (?) to consign B/Ls to Adani when it had already been used, and

  1/3 released to ITS and shipowner during discharge. Furthermore, some of the cargo may

  have import duty paid by Lanyard or its buyers further complicating the matter …</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Unless Adani is willing to pay us against

  release of oil – thereafter all risks assumed by them, I will not support

  Adani’s proposal.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">35.

        What did she mean when she wrote that the bank

"did not succeed with pulling the deal through with Wilmar"? On the face of it,

she appeared to accept that there was a deal which the bank could not perform, not that

there was no agreement at all.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">36.

        Even when matters went up to the head of the

department, the bank did not inform the plaintiff that there was really no contract to

perform. It only did that after receiving several series of letters from the plaintiff

demanding that it performed the contract. In its letter of 8 November signed by Rajesh

Adani, the plaintiff stated <i>inter alia</i></font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">We understand that you are having

  difficulty amounting to delay at your end for timely delivery of the cargo. Neither you

  (Rabobank) nor us (AWL) can deny the fact that we have concluded the deal between us on a

  willing buyer/seller basis. It was your expressed desire that we take the delivery of oil

  urgently so that Rabobank receives the payment quickly. We agreed only with an intention

  to help Rabobank in the matter.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">We negotiated with you for the entire

  quantity of 9000 MT (+/- 5%) at an agreed and established price of Rs 17,000 PMT. Both the

  parties were satisfied with the deal including the agreed price.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">In my discussion with Mr. Sunil Kumar

  &amp; Mr Mahesh Mehta, I had categorically stated that the deal is exclusively between

  Rabobank &amp; Adani Wilmar Ltd, India and we have nothing to do with either Lanyard or

  Shweta. I was given assurance that the matter with Lanyard &amp; Shweta and will be sorted

  out by Rabobank and I "need not worry about it". However, having concluded the

  deal we have been send a draft contract, whereby Shweta &amp; Lanyard had been brought

  into the picture.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">We would like to make it clear that our

  (AWL) dealing was with Rabobank only and at no time we had discussion or an interest to

  have an understanding or dialogue with either Shweta or Lanyard.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">We hope that Rabobank will not thrust onto

  us to resort to any unpleasant means to rightfully take delivery of the oil sold by you to

  us. Having concluded the deal over long discussions, we now cannot accept any turnaround

  on the deal, which has been concluded honorably. We stand to lose a huge sum of monies if

  we do not receive the oil, Rabobank and AWL are answerable to each other for timely

  performance.</font><i></i></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">37.

        Faced with notice of "unpleasant

means", the bank finally took a stand on the matter when it replied on 13 November

that</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">We do not agree to your allegation that

  there is a concluded agreement between us for the sale of 9000 Mt Degummed Rapeseed Oil as

  all negotiations are subject to contract. Furthermore, the Bill of Entry relating to the

  goods is in the name of Lanyard Foods Ltd. Without Lanyard Foods Ltd’s co-operation

  to transfer the Bill of Entry into buyers’ name, the sale cannot be proceeded. You

  are full aware of this fact. The draft contract faxed to you was sent on the premise that

  all four parties will agree to the terms therein.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">You have no doubt that there is an

  injunction preventing the sale or disposal of the goods by Lanyard Foods Ltd. Of course,

  any sale which we or anyone can enter into must be subject to the ability of the parties

  to perform. Until the injunction is vacated, we cannot continue to discuss the sale of the

  goods.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">On Friday 10 November 2000, there was a

  discussion between our Mr Mehta and your Mr Rajesh Adani when we told you that there is a

  possibility for Lanyard to agree to sell through us a quantity of about 6000 Mts. This

  however is subject to the injunction against the sale of the cargo being lifted.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">As you are aware there is an application

  by us to lift the injunction fixed for hearing tomorrow. If we succeed with this, then the

  possibility of a sale of about 6000 Mt on the cargo can be discussed further and subject

  to contract we will work towards this.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">38.

        However, this position taken by the bank was

contradicted by an affidavit filed by Mufazal Kantawala on behalf of the bank on 5

December in the Indian proceedings where he deposed</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">I say that the Applicants [the bank] are

  ready and will to sell and dispose off the said goods under the orders of this

  Hon’ble Tribunal and account for the sale proceeds to this Hon’ble tribunal

  pending determination of their Application to set aside/vacate the order dated 1/11/2000.

  I say that the Applicants are entitled to right of sale of the said cargo. In fact <i>a

  substantial portion of cargo was sold by the Applicants even before any orders were passed</i>

  by the Hon’ble DRAT. The Appellants [Punjab National Bank] were well aware of the

  sale/s but are deliberately feigning ignorance.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">(Emphasis added)</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">39.

        When Sunil Kumar was referred to the affidavit,

he was unable to explain that statement and he maintained that there was no sale of the

oil by the bank to the plaintiff or any other party<sup>10</sup>. If the bank had not sold

the oil to other parties the deponent was most probably referring to the transaction with

the plaintiff, and was calling it a concluded sale.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">40.

        Jacqueline Chang, Lynn Ng and Angeline Tang and

Mufazal Kantawala did not give any explanation to their statements which stated or implied

that there was a concluded agreement. The three bank officers had left the bank by the

time of the action, but there was no suggestion that they or Mufazal Kantawala were unable

or unwilling to give evidence. The reasonable inference to be drawn is that the bank did

not want to explain or qualify what was written.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">41.

        Looking at the evidence in its totality, the

plaintiff had been consistent throughout that there was a contract, the bank’s

position to the contrary was contradicted by its own documents. I find that the plaintiff

had proved on a balance of probabilities that there was a concluded agreement on the sale

of the oil. That disposed of the questions whether Shweta and Lanyard had to agree to the

sale and whether there was to be a written agreement.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">42.

        The next issue is whether the plaintiff or the

bank was to pay the custom or import duty. The fax of 19 October made it clear that the

plaintiff was to pay for the oil by <i>a</i> demand draft, without any obligation on it to

pay the import duty separately. If there was any doubt, that it is surely settled by the

statements in the credit memorandum of 20 October that "it is in the interest of the

Bank to make immediate upfront payment of the import duty", and as "the Bank is

not in the position to pay the customs duty directly in India, we have to pay the customs

duty via Adani-Wilmar."</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">43.

        On the related issue of the loan to WTPL to pay

the duty, that was not referred to as a condition to the sale in the faxes of 18 October

when the terms were set out by Chetan Parikh and of 19 October when the terms were set out

by Sunil Kumar, and not even in the bank’s letter of 13 November when it set out its

reasons for stating that there was no agreement. If it was such a condition all that time,

it should have been mentioned. But even if there was this condition, it was the bank which

held back the loan because of issues pending at the bank’s end, as stated in Lynn

Ng’s email of 31 October. The bank cannot rely on its own default as a defence.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">44.

        I will now examine the defence that the

agreement was discharged on the ground of frustration. A contract is said to be frustrated

when something renders it physically or commercially impossible to be fulfilled, or

transforms the obligation to perform into a radically different obligation. The bank

pleaded that if there was a contract, it was frustrated on two grounds.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">45.

        The first ground was that Lanyard did not agree

to transfer the bill of entry to the plaintiff. This alone does not discharge the contract

unless Lanyard’s refusal rendered the performance of the contract impossible. Sunil

Kumar’s evidence is that he had been informed by the customs authorities that a new

bill of entry could be obtained without the co-operation of Lanyard. He deposed in his

affidavit of evidence-in-chief</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">I was told by the customs authorities that

  … notwithstanding that the bill of entry is in the name of the Defendants’ [the

  bank’s] defaulting client is to obtain a court order from the Indian court. Since the

  Defendants are the pledgees to the goods, they can make an application to the Indian Court

  stating that their client has defaulted in the facility and the goods have not been paid

  by the importer, the Defendants are seeking to enforce the security against their client

  by obtaining possession over the goods for the purpose of selling the said goods to

  satisfy the outstanding amount<sup>11</sup>.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">The advice had come from the deputy

commissioner in charge of Kandla port<sup>12</sup>.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">46.

        However he did not act on the advice and

regarded it was incorrect. His decision was not influenced by any contradicting

information from the customs authorities, but because the opinion of the bank’s

expert witness, Mathew D’Silva, a retired assistant commissioner of customs and

customs consultant. It was curious that neither Sunil Kumar nor D’Silva went back to

the customs authorities to check if the original advice stood and reflected the prevailing

customs practice. This was a serious omission because if the advice was correct,

possession of and title in the oil can pass without Lanyard’s co-operation.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">47.

        It transpired that the expert D’Silva had

given his opinion in the mistaken belief that the customs duty on the oil was paid and

that the goods had been cleared from customs<sup>13</sup>. He relied on s 149 of the

Customs Act 1962 and came to his conclusion that "no Bill of Entry shall be

authorised to be amended after the goods have been cleared for Home Consumption or

deposited in a bonded warehouse (under section 149 of Customs Act 1962)."<sup>14</sup>

Section 149 reads</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Amendment of documents – Save as

  otherwise provided in sections 30 and 41, the proper officer may, in his discretion,

  authorise any document, after it has been presented in the custom house to be amended:</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">       

  Provided that no amendment of a bill of entry or a shipping bill or bill of export shall

  be so authorised to be amended after the imported goods have been cleared for home

  consumption or deposited in a warehouse, or the export goods have been exported, except on

  the basis of documentary evidence which was in existence at the time the goods were

  cleared, deposited or exported, as the case may be.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">48.

        The plaintiff’s expert witness Vikram S

Nankani, an advocate practising in custom laws disagreed with that opinion. He said that

D’Silva’s reliance on the proviso in s 149 was misplaced because s 149 did not

affect ss 30 and <u>41</u>, and s 30(3) empowers the customs authority to permit an import

manifest or import report which is incorrect or incomplete to be amended or supplemented

in the absence of any fraudulent intention. The provision reads</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">30(3) If the proper officer is satisfied

  that the import manifest or import report is in any way incorrect or incomplete, and that

  there was no fraudulent intention, he may permit it to be amended or supplemented.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">49.

        He went on to state that</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">2.5 There is, however, no provision under

  the said Act, which either prohibits or permits the cancellation of Bills of Entry

  (whether for home consumption or for warehousing) filed by any person claiming to be the

  importer and substitution thereof by a fresh Bill of Entry by another person also claiming

  to be the importer. The Courts in India have, however, accepted the right of foreign

  seller or the owner of the goods to sell the goods to a new buyer after import of goods

  into India. This view has been taken by the Calcutta High Court in Taiping International

  [1997 (89) ELT 457]. The Courts in India have also recognised the right of the foreign

  seller or owner to recall/re-ship the goods after the same have been imported into India.

  This view has been taken by the Supreme Court of India in Union of India – Vs –

  Sampatraj Dugar [1992 (58) ELT 163]. Although there is no provision in the said Act for

  acceptance or recognition of such rights, the Courts have followed the common law

  principles like the rights of an unpaid seller, in laying down this law. Similarly, in the

  absence of any provision either prohibiting or permitting substitution, of the bill of

  entry by the new buyer in lieu of the one already filed by an importer, such substitution

  would be governed by the general law of contract and sale of goods, subject to the

  conditions prescribed by sub-section (3) of Section 30 of the said Act, as set out above.

  Resort to the general law is necessary in respect of areas not covered by the said Act.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">2.6 Under the General Law of Contract and

  Sale of Goods, the bill of lading is a document of title. The holder or endorsee of the

  bill of lading has the custody of (constructive) and control over the goods. Upon

  surrender of the original and negotiable copies of the bills of lading, the holder thereof

  can obtain fresh bill of lading in the name of any other person. Upon receipt of fresh

  bills of lading drawn in the name of a new person (read as buyer also) the holder of the

  fresh set of bills of lading as owner of the goods, can endorse the bills of lading in

  favour of the new person (buyer) and instruct the carrier through its agents to give

  effect to the fresh bills of lading and carry out consequential amendment in the manifest.

  This means that the steamer agent in India shall make an application for amendment of the

  manifest, which subject to the provisions of sub-section (3) of Section 30, the proper

  officer may allow. In the event such an application is allowed, the basis of the bill of

  entry filed by the first person disappears and consequently, the new importer whose name

  is now substituted in the manifest, can file the Bill of Entry<sup>15</sup>.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">The bank’s expert did not offer any

comments on these statements.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">50.

        There was no authoritative evidence that a bill

of entry cannot be issued in the plaintiff’s name without Lanyard’s assistance.

Upon reviewing the two experts’ opinions and Sunil Kumar’s evidence, I find that

the bank had not proved that the bill of entry could not be changed without Lanyard’s

agreement, or that the contract was frustrated by Lanyard’s refusal to co-operate.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">51.

        The second ground of frustration the bank

relied on was the injunction issued in India against the sale of the oil. The existence

and terms of the injunction were established, but its effect on the transaction was not.

Such an injunction may be discharged, and in fact, this was done in respect of the sale of

some of the oil to ten other parties. The prospect of obtaining a discharge is enhanced if

security is offered, but the bank did not offer security when it applied to discharge the

injunction<sup>16</sup> and it did not enquire with the plaintiff if it was prepared to

assist in the application. The truth of the situation was that it had repudiated the

agreement with the plaintiff, and did not take any action to discharge the injunction for

the purpose of proceeding with the sale to it. The bank cannot say that it was prevented

by the injunction from performing the contract.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">52.

        The bank’s final defence is mistake –

that it and the plaintiff had entered into the contract under the mistaken belief that the

bill of entry could be transferred. The fax of 19 October stated that Lanyard was to

assist in the transfer of the bill of entry. Insofar as Lanyard would not offer its

assistance, it can be said that both parties were mistaken in the belief or expectation

that it would. But that is not the end of the matter. Contracts are robust creatures, they

do not fall to just any mistake. Only mistakes which lie at the root of the contract would

have that effect.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">53.

        Lanyard’s assistance to transfer the bill

of entry was not a critical part of the contract. The contract was for the bank to sell

the oil to the plaintiff. The transfer of possession of the oil to the plaintiff was an

essential part of the transaction, but the manner of the transfer was not. If Lanyard

would not co-operate and the contract remains in force, other ways would have to be found

to deliver possession of the oil to the plaintiff. The mistake here did not release the

bank from its obligations.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">54.

        In the course of the trial, Sunil Kumar

revealed that the bills of lading to the oil had been endorsed and handed over to Lanyard

sometime between September 1999 and April 2000. This was not disclosed to counsel for

either party earlier. Consequently the plaintiff applied for and was granted leave to

amend its statement of claim to add a further claim that the bank had breached the term

implied by s 12 of the Sales of Goods Act (Cap 393) that the bank had the right to sell

the oil<sup>17</sup>.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">55.

        The bank admitted that the bills of lading were

endorsed and handed over to Lanyard by its agent in India, Caleb Brett (Canada) Ltd. It

pleaded that this was done without its knowledge or authorisation, and that there was no

intention to pass any property to Lanyard, but only to enable it to take the oil from the

vessel to store it in bonded storage tanks. The bank also claimed that there was no

consideration for the endorsement and that Lanyard admitted in a letter of 16 August 2000

that it had not paid for the oil, and the title lies with Shweta<sup>18</sup>.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">56.

        Sunil Kumar’s evidence was that he and

Mahesh Mehta found out in April-June 2000<sup>19</sup> about the endorsement and delivery

to the bills of lading to Lanyard. The bank did not explain why it took no action to have

the bills of lading endorsed and delivered back to it, or any other action to rectify the

situation.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">57.

        The bank sought to tender in evidence the

letter from Lanyard dated 16 August. Counsel for the plaintiff objected on the ground that

the letter was not disclosed during discovery, and that it should be formally proved by

the writer. I accepted the force of the objections and ruled that the letter was not

admissible in evidence.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">58.

        Even if the bank was not aware of and had not

authorised the endorsement and delivery of the bills of lading, title to the oil had

passed to Lanyard by the endorsement and delivery of the bills of lading in the absence of

any clear and admissible evidence to the contrary. The bank would have no right to sell

the oil as pledgee. Consequently, the plaintiff have also established its case under s 12.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">59.

        I give judgment to the plaintiff with costs and

order that the damages payable to it be assessed by the Registrar.</font></p>
