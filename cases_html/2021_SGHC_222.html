It is a contract by which an issuing bank agrees upon the application of the buyer to pay the seller of goods upon presentation of specified documents evidencing that the goods have been shipped by the seller to the buyer (usually internationally). On the expiry of a specified period, usually after he receives the goods, the buyer pays the issuing bank. The issuing bank also charges the buyer a fee for this facility. This arrangement, which underpinned the development of modern cross-border commerce, typically has these three participants of buyer, seller and issuing bank, the last of whom may appoint another bank to negotiate the presentation of documents for payment in the country where the seller is located.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">11 In more recent times, a fourth participant is sometimes added, and plays a purely financing role. This fourth participant discounts or monetizes the documentary letter of credit by paying the seller an agreed percentage of the face value of the letter of credit before the presentation of documents by the buyer to the issuing bank. He is known as the discounter or monetizer. The monetizer would then receive payment from the issuing bank in place of the seller. This allows the seller to receive earlier in time a substantial part of the payment. The monetizer’s reward is the difference between his discounted payment to the seller and the face value subsequently paid by the buyer via the negotiating and issuing banks.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">12 Under the arrangement between AMG and F&amp;BCo, AMG was, at least on paper, the seller of 1,000 metric tons of aluminium sheets to F&amp;BCo and would receive its payment via the DLC issued by Kasikornbank.

I considered my intervention to be necessary to ensure a just and fair trial, but I remained mindful that any leeway given to the defendants should not mean that they could act without regard to the court’s rules and procedures. In this case, I found that, upon my providing the defendants with some explanation of the process, both acted responsibly and respectfully. I also sought to ensure – and was satisfied – that the plaintiff was not prejudiced in its conduct of the case by any indulgence given to the defendants as litigants-in-person.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The parties’ cases </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">20 AMG’s case is that Mr Ong breached his director’s duties in respect of the payments made out of the SCB Account in the period 25 August 2017 to 21 September 2017,

</div> although this was not pleaded. However, both are forms of accessory liability where the wrongdoer has either assisted in another’s breach of trust or received assets of a trust transferred by the trustee to him in breach of trust. In this case, both the defendants were directors of AMG. Consequently, both owed fiduciary duties to AMG. Thus, if they dishonestly assisted Mr Manu in a breach of his fiduciary duty, they would have primary liability for breach of their own fiduciary duty to AMG. Similarly, if they knowingly received assets of AMG under circumstances where it was unconscionable for them to retain the benefit of those assets, they would, as directors, be liable for unauthorised self-dealing with those assets. The one exception for which knowing receipt is relevant is Mr Koh’s receipt of US$37,458.77 prior to his becoming a director, which was the first transaction in knowing receipt pleaded against him.

On the occasions that I asked Mr Manu what certain documents or payments were for, he would say that they were legitimate business payments. As he was aware of my weak health, he would intimidate me by raising his voice at me and insisting that I counter-sign as he instructed. I am sure that the bank officers who attended to us will recall witnessing my poor mental state and Mr Manu’s pressure tactics.

The understandings and conditions with Mr. Manu were for AMG to pay back my loan whenever Mr. Manu managed to bring in funds despite I left AMG. I rejoined AMG upon request from Mr. Manu in [2017]. Mr. Manu told me that he monetized a Letter of Credit and Mr. Richard Ong was not co-operating with him such that he wanted me to be the local Director for AMG. However he wanted to be the 100% shareholder as well as the sole signatory of the AMG bank account and continued to be the CEO so that he could run AMG’s business better as the main decision maker. I raised my concern on my Director’s responsibility and Mr Manu told me that he would take full responsibility of all AMG’s matters as he is also the Director/CEO of AMG as well as the sole shareholder and bank account signatory. As the CEO of AMG, Mr Manu had full authority to run AMG’s business as well as the responsibility. Despite this, I did mention to Mr. Manu that all the company business needed to be run in proper order as I did not want to get into any trouble and Mr. Manu gave me his commitment. Maintaining AMG in proper order was also in line with the expectation to cater for more business to come in. Other than helping Mr. Manu with AMG’s business, I also wanted AMG to pay back to me on my loan. Mr. Manu told me that he could only afford to pay me two payments of 50,000 SGD each as partial repayment of my loan to AMG. I asked Mr. Manu for more payments as I knew that the total monetized sum was around 3 million dollars. However, Mr. Manu told me that he already had payment schedule with commitments to various parties before I re-joined AMG. But he promised that he would pay more and possibly settled the full remaining amount when the next fund comes in.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">6.  I did not hold any share of AMG when I rejoined in [2017] and only served as local Director as per Mr. Manu’s terms. Mr. Manu, as the CEO, was the sole signatory of the AMG bank accounts and he told me that he would be fully responsible for all AMG’s business and matters. Only Mr Manu knew all the AMG’s business contacts and he did all the business communication with those business contacts. Despite this, I met Mr. Manu very frequently to catch up on AMG’s business as well as contributed my input on those business that I have knowledge. I learnt that part of the monetized proceeds needed to be paid back to the issuer of the Letter of Credit. However as most of the decisions on the distribution of fund already made before I re-joined according to what Mr. Manu told me when I discussed with him, I was not able to cause changes in these already made decisions before I joined. I did all I could to try to talk to Mr. Manu to ensure the proper handling of the funds as I did not want AMG and the Directors to get into trouble. I also wanted to get back the rest of all my loan to AMG. As such there is no doubt on my great effort in trying to work with Mr. Manu to handle AMG’s business and funds in proper order, both from AMG as well as my own personal interest.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 I also informed parties that I intended to consider the question whether Companies Act (Cap 50, 2006 Rev Ed) (“Companies Act”) s 391 might apply to one or both defendants so as to excuse them from some or all of their liability and invited them to address me on this question.

In forming that belief, he needs to take reasonable steps to understand the transaction, and to have sight of supporting documentation. What those steps should be will depend on the circumstances, including the size of the transaction. A director is entitled to rely on information provided to him by others in the company, including a fellow director, so long as he does so both honestly and reasonably. He is also entitled to rely on such system of checks as has been instituted within the company. At the same time, he must keep an enquiring mind. If he turns a blind eye to suspicious circumstances, then he has not acted honestly and reasonably. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 This matter concerns a small company, where at the material times there were only two directors: first Mr Ong and Mr Manu, and then Mr Manu and Mr Koh. There was no system involving staff checking or documenting the purpose of payments. In these circumstances, the enquiry reduces into whether they honestly believed the payments were for proper corporate purposes and could reasonably rely on what Mr Manu said about them in forming any such belief. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Issue 2: The elements of knowing receipt </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 The elements of knowing receipt are well-established: see, for example, the Court of Appeal decision in <span class="font-italic">George Raymond </span><span class="font-italic">Zage III and another v Ho Chi Kwong and another </span>[2010] 2 SLR 589<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [23].

When exactly that collapse occurred is unclear, but his admission to IMH only occurred about three weeks after he had ceased to be a director. He did apparently attend Clementi Polyclinic in September 2017, but it is not clear whether this was before the last payment he signed off on, which was on 21 September 2017, or only after that.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 I consider it significant that Mr Ong was in a fit enough state of mind on or about 11 August 2017 to ask for and obtain from Mr Manu a handwritten confirmation that Mr Manu took full responsibility for the payments made from the SCB Account as well as the procurement and supply of the goods mentioned in the DLC.

</div> In my view, Mr Ong initially believed that Mr Manu was following up on his sudden success and reasonably relied on what Mr Manu told him. From his past dealings with Mr Manu he had no reason to believe him to be dishonest. I consider that Mr Ong himself is an honest man who tried to do the right thing in terms of AMG. However, at some point he began to suspect and eventually realised that Mr Manu was probably stripping AMG of funds. He quarrelled with Mr Manu repeatedly and tried to avoid going to the bank when summoned, but unfortunately took the path of least resistance and reluctantly countersigned on withdrawals or payments. He wanted to resign and it is obvious that he felt under considerable pressure and mental strain. The question for the court is at which point Mr Ong understood or ought to have understood that the payments were not for proper purposes of AMG, and yet nonetheless countersigned them. I will now consider each of the payments and withdrawals in turn.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Cash withdrawal of US$11,216.75 on 25 August 2017 </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 This withdrawal of cash was for Mr Manu’s personal expenses.

</div> It remains arguable that, in a proper case, where all the shareholders have had a meeting of minds concerning reasonable remuneration of directors, and the company is solvent, the absence of a shareholders’ resolution compliant with Companies Act s 169 would not make the remuneration unauthorised. This would be an application of the principle that shareholders may proceed on the basis of informal assent, if unanimous (see <span class="font-italic">Re Duomatic Ltd</span> [1969] 2 Ch 365; <span class="font-italic">Yong Kheng Leong and another v </span><span class="font-italic">Panweld Trading Pte Ltd and another</span> [2013] 1 SLR 173 at [25]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 This however is not such a proper case. No basis was offered for the calculation of the remuneration. Nor was any period stipulated.  I also add that it was the next day that AMG became insolvent, and I infer that Mr Manu certainly understood that AMG was approaching insolvency while Mr Ong ought reasonably to have done so. Accordingly, Mr Manu and Mr Ong were obliged to consider the interests of creditors when making this decision. I am unable to find that the reasonableness of the remuneration was properly considered by the directors. I also find that the real purpose of this payment was an attempt by Mr Manu to secure Mr Ong’s cooperation in his scheme, a scheme that was manifestly not in AMG’s interests. I find that Mr Ong ought reasonably to have understood this to be the case. Accordingly, I hold this payment was improper and not duly authorised. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Cash withdrawal of US$112,666.38 on 28 August 2017</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 This was a very large and wholly unexplained cash withdrawal, which Mr Ong admitted did not benefit AMG.

</div> Mr Ong was not very clear in his evidence, but it does seem that Mr Ong was quite desperate for Mr Koh to replace him as a director and so was ready to sign off on whatever amount Mr Manu negotiated with Mr Koh. However, I accept that repayment of a loan made previously to the company in order to have the lender re-join the company as a director is not in and of itself a breach of fiduciary duty. Mr Koh had resigned from AMG previously, but had been a director for a long time before his resignation. Mr Ong of course knew this, and also knew that Mr Koh had lent money to AMG, as evidenced by Mr Koh’s email to Mr Ong dated 28 July 2009, referred to at [40] above. I do not find that Mr Ong knew of any bargain struck between Mr Manu and Mr Koh which would have rendered his acquiescence dishonest or unreasonable.

</div> Nonetheless, I hold that he reasonably believed Mr Manu’s representations that such a facility was in the interests of AMG. Logically, having a credit line would be beneficial to AMG’s trading, and Mr Ong honestly thought that Mr Manu had secured a valuable deal for AMG and had renewed confidence that Mr Manu could secure new deals for AMG. Mr Ong would have envisaged the use of this facility in connection with such deals. It cannot be said that this was not a genuine transaction with a substantial bank. The administrative fee and interest rate were reasonable. The alleged misuse of the facility to pay a sum of US$744,000.00 to Smart Recycling Pte Ltd only occurred on or about 9 November 2017, more than a month after Mr Ong left AMG.

</div> I take this as a reference to Companies Act s 145(5), which stipulates that:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Notwithstanding anything in this Act or in the constitution of the company, or in any agreement with the company, a director of a company shall not resign or vacate his office unless there is remaining in the company at least one director who is ordinarily resident in Singapore; and any purported resignation or vacation of office in breach of this subsection shall be deemed to be invalid.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">73 I accept that the effect of this section was such that Mr Ong could not resign unilaterally, as that would have left AMG without any other director ordinarily resident in Singapore, the only other director at the time being Mr Manu. This, however, does not absolve Mr Ong of liability. While he remained in office, he was subject to the duties of a director. These he breached, even though he could have and should have refused to countersign the payments and withdrawals. His signature was required by SCB to mandate such payments and withdrawals. Indeed, it was when he finally made up his mind to refuse to sign that he was able to extricate himself from the situation, by forcing Mr Manu to seek a replacement director in Mr Koh.

</div> However, as a director he was under a fiduciary duty of loyalty to AMG that included the duty to safeguard its assets. He consciously decided not to act as a check on Mr Manu. He did not institute any other system of checks or safeguards. In fact, I find that he understood at the least that there was a real risk that Mr Manu would make use of AMG’s funds for his own and not AMG’s purposes. The basis for this finding arises from the circumstances of his own return to AMG: during cross-examination by AMG’s counsel, he said he was invited by Mr Manu to re-join because “Mr Ong didn’t cooperate properly”.

Mr Koh does not seem to have asked Mr Ong at the time why he had been reluctant to countersign some payments or withdrawals. This is surprising given that they had known each other for so long. Hearing what Mr Manu had to say was enough to put him on notice that something was amiss in Mr Manu’s conduct. Mr Koh’s not following up with Mr Ong about this was an instance of turning a blind eye – choosing not to speak to Mr Ong in case he was told something he did not want to hear about Mr Manu’s conduct. Instead of acting as a check on Mr Manu, he preferred to give Mr Manu a free rein, perhaps mistakenly believing that he was protected by the resolution he signed authorising Mr Manu to be the sole signatory. In making this Faustian pact with Mr Manu, he preferred his own interests (in having Mr Manu agree to repay his loan to AMG) to those of AMG (in having its assets used only for proper purposes of AMG). Consequently, Mr Koh is liable to AMG for those withdrawals or payments made by Mr Manu which were not for AMG’s purposes or in AMG’s interests, during the period that he was a director. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">80 In addition, once a company is approaching insolvency, a director must consider the interests of creditors (see <span class="font-italic">Chip </span><span class="font-italic">Thye Enterprises Pte Ltd (in liquidation) v Phay Gi Mo and others</span> [2004] 1 SLR(R) 434 at [13]–[16]).

In AMG’s case, it had no business income and so, once the amount in the SCB Account had reduced to less than the US$2,145,000 owed to F&amp;BCo, every subsequent withdrawal or payment was correspondingly reducing the amount that F&amp;BCo could receive.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">81 I now consider those withdrawals and payments. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Twelve cash withdrawals or cash cheques totalling US$148,064.97 </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">82 There appears to have been no documentation of the purpose of these withdrawals and cash cheques, and I find that they were not for AMG’s purposes or in AMG’s interests.

I do not allow the claim for the administrative fee as the facility was already in place prior to Mr Koh rejoining the board, and in any case, as discussed at [71] above, I do not consider that setting up the facility was itself a breach of fiduciary duty or that the administrative fee was unreasonable. However, the interest that accrued on the illegitimate drawdown on the facility is a loss that flows from Mr Koh’s giving Mr Manu free rein to instruct drawdowns on the facility, and he is liable for it just as much as he is liable for the amount drawn down to pay Smart Recycling Pte Ltd.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Conclusion on Mr Koh’s liability </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">97 I have allowed a total of US$1,017,070.93 of the claims made by AMG against Mr Ong. I also award interest on this sum at the usual rate of 5.33% from the date of writ to the date of judgment.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Issue 7: Companies Act s 391 </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">98 Companies Act s 391 provides:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">If in any proceedings for negligence, default, breach of duty or breach of trust against a person to whom this section applies it appears to the court before which the proceedings are taken that he is or may be liable in respect thereof but that he has acted honestly and reasonably and that, having regard to all the circumstances of the case including those connected with his appointment, he ought fairly to be excused for the negligence, default or breach the court may relieve him either wholly or partly from his liability on such terms as the court thinks fit. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">99 As I have noted at [25] above, I considered it important to consider this section notwithstanding that the defendants did not plead it. It seemed to me that the gist of their defence was that they had acted honestly and reasonably and should be fairly excused from any breach of duty committed by them. I raised it at the start of the trial so that AMG could lead evidence on it if felt necessary or desirable, as well as question the defendants should they choose to give evidence. My doing so does not derogate from my view expressed in <span class="font-italic">OOPA Pte Ltd v Bui Sy </span><span class="font-italic">Phong</span> [2021] SGHC 142 at [62] where I opined that “it is good practice for a defendant to plead in his defence his intention to seek relief under this section”. This is because the defendants are litigants-in-person and that is material to why I took the course that I did in this case. The court should not guide a litigant-in-person to the prejudice of the opposing party; nonetheless, where that person is grasping for a legal argument that is not quite articulated, the court may give voice to it and offer the other party an opportunity for rebuttal.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">100 However, having considered the evidence carefully I find that Mr Ong has failed to establish that he acted reasonably, and that Mr Koh has failed to establish that he acted either honestly or reasonably. Hence, I do not go on to consider whether either should be fairly excused of any breach of duty.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">101 In the case of Mr Ong, while I have considerable sympathy for his predicament, a reasonable person in his position would not have given in to Mr Manu’s pressure. Unfortunately, conduct that is understandable given the frailty of human nature may yet not be reasonable in law, considered objectively. In this case, Mr Ong could and should have refused to countersign once he understood that Mr Manu was not engaging in legitimate business on behalf of AMG, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, from 28 August 2017 onwards. To countersign under such circumstances was not reasonable.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">102 As for Mr Koh, not only did he behave unreasonably in resolving to give Mr Manu a free rein when he knew that Mr Ong had left precisely because of disagreements over the purpose of payments and withdrawals that Mr Manu wished to make, he also failed to act honestly. He allowed his desire to be repaid some of what he believed AMG to owe him to override his duty to protect AMG’s assets. While there is nothing wrong with someone refusing to join or re-join the board of a company unless he is repaid a loan that he made to the company, it is not permissible to agree in return for such repayment that upon being appointed a director one will not check on a fellow director’s conduct. This is especially so in circumstances where the company is obviously insolvent. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">103 I allow AMG’s claims against Mr Ong in the sum of US$1,297,883.63 and against Mr Koh in the sum of US$1,017,070.93.
