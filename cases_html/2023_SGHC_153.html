</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> Mr Wang and Mr Yang were also directors of Babel Asia for certain periods of time.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">7 Parastate and Babel Asia entered into a management agreement, following which Parastate invested US$5m into the Fund, in the form of the USDT cryptocurrency.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Procedural history</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Mareva injunction</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">8 By way of SUM 2564/2022, Parastate applied <span class="font-italic">ex parte</span> for a Mareva injunction against both Mr Wang and Mr Yang.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">9 That <span class="font-italic">ex parte</span> application was heard by me on 14 July 2022. I declined to grant an injunction on an <span class="font-italic">ex parte</span> basis; instead, I directed that the application be converted to an <span class="font-italic">inter partes</span> one, and gave directions for Parastate to address certain matters at the <span class="font-italic">inter partes</span> hearing.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">10 The <span class="font-italic">inter partes</span> hearing proceeded on 28 November 2022. By then, Parastate had decided that it would only seek an injunction against Mr Wang, and not also Mr Yang. I granted the Mareva injunction against Mr Wang, but for a quantum of US$2.5m instead of $5m as sought by Parastate. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Stay of proceedings</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">11 In HC/SUM 3639/2022 I granted a mandatory arbitration stay of Parastate’s claims against Babel Asia.

In CA/CA 15/2022 Parastate has appealed against the case management stay. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">12 There is a pending application (in HC/SUM 1179/2023) by Parastate to lift the case management stay in relation to Mr Wang and Mr Yang, as Babel Asia is presently subject to a moratorium against proceedings. That application is scheduled for hearing before me next month.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Parastate’s unsatisfactory evidence as to its ability to meet its undertaking as to damages</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Parastate’s breach of the Supreme Court Practice Directions 2021</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">13 In its application for the Mareva injunction, Parastate duly included the prescribed undertaking as to damages: “If the Court later finds that this order has caused loss to the defendant, and decides that the defendant should be compensated for that loss, the claimant will comply with any order the Court may make.”</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">14 However, Parastate’s supporting affidavit (a solicitor’s affidavit exhibiting a draft client affidavit) said nothing about Parastate’s ability to meet that undertaking.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">15 Parastate’s application was filed as a summons for injunction without notice, and para 73(1)(f) of the Supreme Court Practice Directions 2021 (“Practice Directions”) required Parastate, as the applicant, to include in the affidavit prepared and filed in support of the application the following information under clearly defined headings: “… (f) An undertaking to pay for losses that may be caused to the opponent or other persons by the granting of the orders sought, stating what assets are available to meet that undertaking and to whom the assets belong”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">16 All that was said about the undertaking in Parastate’s supporting affidavit was, in the draft client affidavit:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">F. UNDERTAKING TO PAY DAMAGES</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">64. The Claimant undertakes to abide by an order for damages that this Court should make should the Court be of the opinion that the 1st Defendant and the 2nd Defendant has sustained damage by virtue of this injunction. If necessary, the Claimant will fortify the undertaking herein.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">17 That simply said that Parastate was giving the prescribed undertaking, and would fortify it if necessary. Nothing was said about what assets were available to meet that undertaking and to whom the assets belonged; this was information that the Practice Directions required Parastate to provide.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">18 At the <span class="font-italic">ex parte</span> hearing on 14 July 2022, all that Parastate’s counsel could say about Parastate’s ability to meet its undertaking was that he was instructed that Parastate could meet an order for damages, and that he could take instructions on fortification – that obviously fell short of the information required by the Practice Directions.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Parastate’s breach of the court’s direction</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">19 At the <span class="font-italic">ex parte</span> hearing, I declined to grant the Mareva injunction. Instead, I directed that the application proceed on an <span class="font-italic">inter partes</span> basis, and required Parastate to address certain matters at the <span class="font-italic">inter partes</span> hearing, one of which was its ability to meet an order as to damages (on its undertaking).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">20 In response, Parastate filed the 2nd affidavit of Mr Chen Jiayi dated 11 August 2022 with a section from paras 31–33 on “Claimant’s ability to meet undertaking as to damages”. Mr Chen said, in para 31, that Parastate was a company incorporated in Delaware, a project for which the founders used their own money to invest in September 2020; a corporate restructuring had just been completed recently and hence Parastate did not have any financial statements prepared since it was started. He went on to say that he nevertheless believed that Parastate had the ability to meet an undertaking as to damages as it had raised US$11.8m in funding over the past 1.5 years: US$1.3m on 27 January 2021, US$5m on 9 April 2021, and US$5.5m on 14 July 2021. In para 32 he referred to news articles about that funding, copies of which were exhibited to his affidavit. He concluded by saying in para 33, “I confirm that the Claimant is financially sound.”</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">21 Paragraphs 31–33 of Mr Chen’s 2nd affidavit still fell short of what the Practice Directions required. He did not say what assets were available to meet Parastate’s undertaking and to whom the assets belonged. He mentioned in his 2nd affidavit that Parastate had raised US$11.8m, but the last funding date was on 14 July 2021, more than a year ago. Of the US$11.8m, presumably US$5m had gone into Parastate’s cryptocurrency investment in the Fund. Given the financial difficulties Babel Asia had mentioned, it appears that the sum which had gone to Babel Asia would not be available to meet Parastate’s undertaking if Parastate should fail in its claims against Mr Wang and be ordered to pay him damages on its undertaking.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">22 As for the balance US$6.8m raised, Mr Chen did not say how much of that Parastate still had, or in what form Parastate’s assets were. For instance, were Parastate’s assets in the form of cryptocurrency? If so, how much were those assets worth? And were there any issues with how those assets were held – like there were with the cryptocurrency Parastate had invested with Babel Asia? The fact that Parastate did not have any financial statements was a poor excuse for Mr Chen not disclosing the worth of Parastate’s assets. Parastate and Mr Chen must have known what Parastate’s assets were worth (and not just what Parastate had previously raised in funding) but they simply did not say.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">23 Unsurprisingly, Mr Wang attacked Parastate’s evidence, saying that Parastate would have had to produce information about its financial position to third parties to secure the US$11.8m in funding, and yet it provided no information to the court other than the dates and amounts of funding raised; Parastate provided no bank statements, or statements of accounts.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 I agreed with Mr Wang and Mr Yang that Parastate’s evidence about its ability to meet its undertaking was unsatisfactory. Parastate continued to be in breach of the Practice Directions as well as the court’s direction that it address its ability to meet its undertaking.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Material non-disclosure by Parastate</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 Mareva relief may be refused in cases where the plaintiff has not come to court with clean hands:<span class="font-italic"> </span><span class="font-italic">JTrust Asia Pte Ltd v Group Lease Holdings Pte Ltd and others</span> [2018] 2 SLR 159 (“<span class="font-italic">JTrust</span>”) at [84]–[92], and that includes cases where there has been a failure to make full and frank disclosure in seeking relief <span class="font-italic">ex parte</span>: <span class="font-italic">JTrust</span> at [84(b)], [89]– [92].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 Parastate’s unsatisfactory evidence as to its ability to meet its undertaking was one aspect of its material non-disclosure in seeking relief <span class="font-italic">ex parte</span>.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 Another aspect (which involved another breach of the Practice Directions) was Parastate’s deliberate omission of prescribed undertakings 9 and 10 in Form 25 of Appendix A of the Practice Directions: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">9. The claimant will not without the permission of the Court begin proceedings against the defendant in any other jurisdiction or use information obtained as a result of an order of the Court in this jurisdiction for the purpose of civil or criminal proceedings in any other jurisdiction. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">10. The claimant will not without the permission of the Court seek to enforce this order in any country outside Singapore (or seek an order of a similar nature including orders conferring a charge or other security against the defendant or the defendant’s assets).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 Paragraph 72 of the Practice Directions states that Forms 24, 25, and 26 of Appendix A (as the case may be) should be used except to the extent that the judge hearing a particular application considers there is a good reason for adopting a different form, and “Any departure from the terms of the prescribed forms should be justified by the applicant in his or her supporting affidavit(s).”</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 Parastate’s application for the Mareva injunction did not include prescribed undertakings 9 and 10, but Parastate’s supporting affidavit did not mention, let alone justify, such departure from the prescribed Form 25.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 At the <span class="font-italic">ex parte</span> hearing, I noted that prescribed undertakings 9 and 10 were missing from the application, and asked Parastate’s counsel whether there was an intention to commence proceedings in other jurisdictions. My notes of the <span class="font-italic">ex parte</span> hearing (which were not <span class="font-italic">verbatim</span> notes) do not record that query, but they record counsel’s response: that Parastate might make a mirror application in Hong Kong, and that is why those prescribed undertakings were not included in the application. In short, the omission of the prescribed undertakings was deliberate.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 Pursuant to the Practice Directions, Parastate should have been forthright and mentioned the omission of the prescribed undertakings in the supporting affidavit, rather than to only mention it in a response to a query from the court (in the event of the court noticing that the prescribed undertakings were missing).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 I also highlighted to counsel that the importance of those undertakings was explained by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Bouvier, Yves Charles Edgar and another v Accent Delight International Ltd and another and another appeal</span> [2015] 5 SLR 558. In that case, the court said at [131]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">We will close off this discussion on the abuse of court process with an observation. When a plaintiff seeks a worldwide Mareva injunction from a Singapore court, the plaintiff should ordinarily undertake to the court that it shall not, without the court’s leave, enforce the injunction or seek an order of a similar nature in any jurisdiction outside Singapore. This is a standard undertaking found in the prescribed form for a worldwide Mareva injunction: Form 7 of the Practice Directions at Sched 1, para 8. This undertaking plays a vital role because it protects a defendant from the risk of oppression which may arise from a multiplicity of suits: <span class="font-italic">Dadourian Group International Inc v Simms </span>[2006] 1 WLR 2499 at [2] and [24]. Courts have gone so far as to say that a worldwide Mareva injunction should not be granted unless the plaintiff gives such an undertaking: <span class="font-italic">Re Bank of Credit and Commerce International SA </span>[1994] 3 All ER 764 at 794. This undertaking was not given by the respondents, and it appears that they have taken steps to enforce the Mareva injunction against Mr Bouvier overseas without obtaining any leave from the court to do so.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 I directed Parastate to address at the <span class="font-italic">inter partes</span> hearing, why prescribed undertakings 9 and 10 should not be required in light of the Court of Appeal’s observations in <span class="font-italic">Bouvier</span>.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 In response, Mr Chen said at para 34 of his 2nd affidavit:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">D. THE UNDERTAKINGS TO BE GIVEN TO THE COURT NOT TO ENFORCE OR APPLY FOR A SIMILAR ORDER IN ANY COURT OUTSIDE SINGAPORE WITHOUT THE PERMISSION OF THIS COURT</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">34. I am advised and has [<span class="font-italic">sic</span>] been advised that the undertakings are usual undertakings that have to be given, and I have therefore instructed my solicitors to include them in the Summons.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 At the <span class="font-italic">inter partes</span> hearing, Parastate’s counsel accepted that the prescribed undertakings should be included, and the Mareva injunction I granted thus incorporated those undertakings. Nevertheless, Parastate’s earlier conduct remained a relevant consideration.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 In relation to Parastate’s deliberate omission of prescribed undertakings 9 and 10, not only did Parastate not disclose that to the court, but it did not cite the Court of Appeal decision of <span class="font-italic">Bouvier</span> which discussed the importance of those undertakings, nor did it cite the subsequent Court of Appeal decision of <span class="font-italic">JTrust</span> which cited <span class="font-italic">Bouvier</span> (see <span class="font-italic">JTrust</span> at [109]–[118]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 Had I granted the Mareva injunction at the <span class="font-italic">ex parte</span> stage, it would have been susceptible to being set aside for material non-disclosure, although the court would have had a discretion nevertheless to continue the injunction or to re-grant it on new terms: <span class="font-italic">JTrust</span> at [90], particularly [90(e)]. On a parity of reasoning, if the material non-disclosure were detected by the court at the <span class="font-italic">ex parte</span> stage, and consequently no injunction were granted at that stage, it would remain open to the court to take into account the non-disclosure and refuse to grant the injunction at the <span class="font-italic">inter partes</span> stage: <span class="font-italic">JTrust</span> at [92] where the court mentioned “discharge <span class="font-italic">or denial</span> of Mareva relief”, and “the discharge <span class="font-italic">or the refusal</span> of the injunctions” [emphasis added].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 I thus considered Parastate’s material non-disclosures (both in relation to its ability to meet its undertaking as to damages, and in deliberately omitting prescribed undertakings 9 and 10) in deciding Parastate’s Mareva application.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The appropriate quantum of the injunction</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 In granting the injunction, I required that Parastate fortify its undertaking by paying S$50,000 into court. That was at the top end of the S$30,000– S$50,000 range suggest by Parastate’s counsel. Even so, S$50,000 was less than 1% of the US$5m Parastate had asked to injunct, and less than 2% of the US$2.5m that I did injunct. If the court should later decide that the injunction was wrongly asked for, and directed an inquiry as to damages, Mr Wang might well find himself with no recourse beyond the S$50,000 provided by Parastate as fortification, and injuncting US$2.5m (let alone US$5m) might have caused him loss well beyond S$50,000.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 In <span class="font-italic">Maldives Airport Co Ltd </span><span class="font-italic">and another v GMR Male International Airport Pte Ltd</span> [2013] 2 SLR 449 (“<span class="font-italic">Maldives Airport</span>”), the Court of Appeal set aside an injunction, mentioning as the final factor in that case, the respondent’s ability to make good on its cross-undertaking (at [79]–[80]). The court noted that one of the solicitors acting for the respondent claimed that the respondent “would plainly be able to satisfy any award that may be made in [the Appellants’] favour”, but there was no evidence to substantiate that claim. The court also noted that the judge who granted the injunction appeared to have been influenced by a contention that the respondent was a company of good financial standing, given its paid-up capital of US$40.2m. But the court held: “a company’s paid-up capital is not proof of its creditworthiness, and, if it had come down to it, the absence of evidence on this score would also have weighed against the granting of the Injunction” (at [80]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 Similarly, Parastate’s mention of funds it had raised a year ago was not proof of its creditworthiness at the time it sought the Mareva injunction.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 Parastate’s unsatisfactory evidence in this regard weighed against the granting of the Mareva injunction. However, the ultimate question is still whether “it appears to the court to be just or convenient that such order should be made”: s 4(10), Civil Law Act 1909 (2020 Rev Ed).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 Parastate sought an injunction for US$5m, as that was the amount of its investment in the Fund. I agreed that it had established a good arguable case against Mr Wang, and a real risk of dissipation. However, having regard to Parastate’s conduct as detailed above, I considered that the just and convenient thing to do would be to grant an injunction for half the sum claimed, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, US$2.5m instead of US$5m. I further ordered that the parties be at liberty to apply to vary the amount either way, but there has been no such variation application to date.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 From Parastate’s perspective, if it were to succeed in its claim against Mr Wang, only half of its claimed sum would have been injuncted. From Mr Wang’s perspective, though, if Parastate were to fail in its claim against Mr Wang and Parastate were ordered to pay him damages on its undertaking, the lower quantum of the injunction would tend to have caused Mr Wang less damage to be compensated.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 In my view, the lower quantum of the injunction struck the right balance between the interests of both parties, considering the likely effects of an injunction on the defendant (<span class="font-italic">JTrust</span> at [97]) and the unsatisfactory evidence from Parastate as to whether it was good for its undertaking.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 A good arguable case, and real risk of dissipation, are necessary but not sufficient requirements for the grant of a Mareva injunction – <span class="font-italic">JTrust</span> at [95]:  “where the two requirements have been established, there remains scope for the refusal of relief.” Ultimately, whether to grant a Mareva injunction, and if so, on what terms, depends on what appears to the court to be just or convenient. Having regard to Parastate’s unsatisfactory evidence as to its ability to meet its undertaking as to damages, the Mareva injunction I granted was for a lower quantum than what Parastate had applied for.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">Andre Maniam</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">Judge of the High Court</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"></div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Foo Maw Shen, Chu Hua Yi and Mark Tan (FC Legal Asia LLC) for the claimant;</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Choo Zheng Xi and Carol Yuen (Remy Choo Chambers LLC) for the first defendant;</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Darius Chan and Michael Chan (Breakpoint LLC) for the second defendant;</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Ang Ann Liang and Yeoh Tze Ning (Allen &amp; Gledhill LLP) for the third and fourth defendants.</div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
