<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       This was an appeal against the decision of the
                    district judge (“the DJ”) dismissing the claim by the appellant,
                    Xu Ren Li (“the Appellant”), for damages in respect of injuries
                    which he suffered while at work (see <em>Xu Ren Li v Nakano
                        Singapore (Pte) Ltd</em> [2011] SGDC 159 (“the
                    GD”)). At the conclusion of the hearing of the appeal, I allowed the
                    appeal in part. In my view, the Appellant and the respondent, Nakano Singapore
                    (Pte) Ltd (“the Respondent”), were equally at fault, and I
                    accordingly apportioned liability in the ratio 50:50. I now give my reasons for
                    so deciding.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Factual background</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       At the material time, the Appellant, a
                    43-year-old PRC national, was employed as a construction worker by the
                    Respondent in the construction of a condominium known as
                    “Saint Thomas Suites Condominium” located at St Thomas
                    Walk, Singapore.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       The Appellant claimed that on 30 March
                    2009, at about 7.00pm to 7.20pm, while he was using a staircase (“the
                    Staircase”) in an uncompleted building at the construction site
                    (“the Building”) to make his way down from the 19th floor to
                    the 10th floor to catch the passenger lift located on that floor, he lost
                    his balance on one of the steps and fell against an on-facing wall situated at
                    the staircase landing on the 12th floor, hitting his right shoulder and
                    landing on his buttocks. At the time of his fall, the Appellant was the last
                    person in the group of workers going down for their dinner. As he was trailing
                    his co-workers, no one saw him fall. He picked himself up and rejoined his
                    colleagues at the passenger lift.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       The Appellant claimed that as a result of his
                    fall, he felt intense pain in his right shoulder, right arm and back. He
                    returned to his dormitory after dinner to rest because his right shoulder was
                    painful and he could not lift up his right arm. The Appellant reported the
                    accident to his supervisor the next day and was sent to Singapore General
                    Hospital for medical treatment. The doctor noted that he had sustained minor
                    shoulder and back injuries. The Appellant was given medical leave for ten days
                    and was told to return for a CT scan of his injured shoulder.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       On 9 April 2009, the Respondent arranged
                    for the Appellant to receive follow-up treatment at National University Hospital
                    (“NUH”). From 11 April 2009 till 16 October 2009, the
                    Appellant visited NUH six times and was given six medical certificates to cover
                    his absence from work.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       On 16 April 2009, the Appellant lodged a
                    report with the Ministry of Manpower (“MOM”). On 18 April
                    2009, the Respondent lodged a report with MOM and disputed the manner in which
                    the Appellant had (so he claimed) sustained his injuries. The Respondent alleged
                    that the Appellant had been involved in an affray on the afternoon of
                    30 March 2009 with another PRC construction worker, in the course of which
                    he was pushed. His injuries were caused by the resultant fall. As such, the
                    Respondent claimed that the Appellant’s account of his fall at the
                    Staircase was fabricated. Alternatively, the Respondent alleged that the
                    Appellant was wholly responsible for the accident, either through his own
                    negligence or by deliberately injuring himself.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       On 12 October 2009, the Appellant filed a
                    writ of summons against the Respondent claiming damages for personal injuries
                    arising from his fall. The basis of the Appellant’s claim was that the
                    Respondent had breached both its statutory duty under reg 23(2) of the
                    Workplace Safety and Health (General Provisions) Regulations (Cap 354A,
                    Rg 1, 2007 Rev Ed) (“Reg 23(2)”) and its common law
                    duty of care in failing to provide a safe place of work, in that:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_7-p2_a"></a>(a)     there was no handrail or other
                        support along the wall of the Staircase for the Appellant to hold on to
                        while descending;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_7-p2_b"></a>(b)     the step on the Staircase where the Appellant fell was broken;
                        and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_7-p2_c"></a>(c)     there was no
                        proper lighting in the stairwell where the Staircase was
                    located.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       The Appellant also pleaded other particulars of
                    breach of statutory duty and common law duty, but they will not be considered in
                    these grounds of decision as they were not material to the disposition of the
                    Appellant’s claim in the court below.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       The Respondent denied liability on the ground
                    that its failure to install any handrail along the wall of the Staircase was not
                    a breach of either its statutory duty or its common law duty to provide a safe
                    place of work. It also pleaded that the Appellant’s injuries were not
                    caused by his fall, but were instead caused as a result of his affray with a
                    co-worker. Alternatively, if the Respondent was indeed negligent, the Appellant
                    was himself also negligent in going down the Staircase hurriedly to catch the
                    passenger lift.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The decision below</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     The DJ dismissed the Appellant’s action
                    for the following reasons:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_10-p2_a"></a>(a)     the Respondent was not in breach of
                        Reg 23(2); and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_10-p2_b"></a>(b)     although the Respondent owed a duty of care to the Appellant to
                        ensure that there was adequate lighting at and proper steps on the
                        Staircase, the Appellant had failed to prove that the Respondent was in
                        breach of this duty as:</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_10-p2_b-p3_i"></a>(i)       the lighting at the
                            Staircase was adequate; and</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_10-p2_b-p3_ii"></a>(ii)       the Appellant’s evidence that he had
                            fallen by stepping on a broken step was not reliable as he had produced
                            a photograph of a broken step which might have been located on a floor
                            other than the floor where he fell.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     The DJ also found that the effective cause of
                    the Appellant’s fall was “the [Appellant]’s own negligence in
                    rushing down the steps” (see the GD at [23]). It appeared from the GD (at
                    [22]–[23]) that the DJ considered the Appellant’s conduct to be the
                    sole effective cause of his fall.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The issues on appeal</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     On appeal to this court, the Appellant raised
                    the same issues as those raised in the court below and reiterated the arguments
                    that were rejected by the DJ. Similarly, the Respondent reiterated the arguments
                    which found favour with the DJ.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     In essence, there were three issues which I
                    had to decide, <em>viz</em>:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_13-p2_a"></a>(a)     whether the Respondent, in failing
                        to install any handrail along the Staircase, was in breach of its statutory
                        duty under Reg 23(2) (“Issue 1”);</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_13-p2_b"></a>(b)     whether the Respondent was in breach
                        of its common law duty of care to provide a safe place of work for its
                        workers (“Issue 2”); and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_13-p2_c"></a>(c)     whether the Appellant was negligent in falling
                        while making his way down the Staircase
                        (“Issue 3”).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Issue 1: Was the Respondent in breach of its statutory duty
                under Reg 23(2) in failing to install any handrail along the
                Staircase?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     Issue 1 centred on Reg 23(2), which
                    provides as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-Heading1">
<b>Measures to be taken to
                            prevent falls</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>23</b>.    …</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(2)    For every staircase
                            in a factory building or which affords a means of exit from the factory
                            building, a substantial handrail shall be provided and maintained,
                            which —</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(<em>a</em>)    if the staircase
                                has an open side, shall be on that side; and</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(<em>b</em>)    if the staircase
                                has 2 open sides, shall be on both sides.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     The DJ found that the Respondent was not in
                    breach of Reg 23(2) for the following reasons (see [7] of the GD):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Having read the provision, <em>I think the statutory
                            obligation is only to provide handrails for staircases with open
                            sides</em>. This rule aims to prevent workers falling from height
                        at the exposed side. The [S]taircase here, however, has no open sides. It is
                        flanked by walls (a walled staircase). Hence, [Reg] 23(2) … does
                        not apply. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     In my view, the DJ’s interpretation of
                    Reg 23(2) was wrong. Reg 23(2), read purposively and sensibly, entails
                    that a handrail must be provided for every staircase in a factory building
                    (which, as defined in s 5(3)(<em>q</em>) of the
                    Workplace Safety and Health Act (Cap 354A, 2009 Rev Ed), includes
                    premises where building operations or any engineering construction works are
                    carried on) or which affords a means of exit from a factory building. The word
                    “which” in the third line of Reg 23(2) (as reproduced at
                        <a href="#p1_14">[14]</a> above) does not qualify the earlier
                    reference to a factory building, but merely specifies that if a staircase is
                    open on one side, a handrail must be provided on that side, and if a staircase
                    has two open sides, handrails must be provided on both sides. Reg 23(2)
                    applies to all staircases, whether or not they have any open side or sides.
                    Where a staircase has no open side, such as the Staircase in the present action
                    (which was a walled staircase), a substantial handrail must still be provided on
                    at least one side as the minimum requirement under Reg 23(2). Counsel for
                    the Respondent argued that Reg 23(2) was ambiguous and, because it was a
                    penal provision, such ambiguity should be construed in favour of the Respondent.
                    I rejected this argument as, in my view, the principle of construction is the
                    converse. In the area of social legislation where the prevention of injury to
                    workers is paramount, any ambiguity in such legislation should be construed to
                    achieve its purpose, <em>viz</em>, to protect the safety
                    and welfare of the worker.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     I should add, further, that counsel for the
                    Respondent accepted that the staircases from the 9th floor to the
                    19th floor of the Building had no handrails. It was argued that it was not
                    practical for the Respondent to install handrails as they might be damaged
                    before the Building was ready for occupation. I rejected this argument. The
                    obligation created by Reg 23(2) is not qualified by considerations of
                    practicality. If the Respondent was indeed concerned about handrails (had they
                    been installed) being damaged, it could have installed temporary handrails along
                    the staircases in the Building. Accordingly, I found the Respondent in breach of
                    Reg 23(2) in failing to provide any handrail along the Staircase where the
                    Appellant fell.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Issue 2: Was the Respondent in breach of its common law duty to
                provide a safe place of work?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     Turning now to Issue 2, in my view, the
                    Respondent was in breach of its common law duty to provide a safe place of work
                    for its workers. The staircases from the 9th floor to the 19th floor
                    of the Building (which were not in a finished state at the material time as the
                    Building was still under construction) were unsafe for use by workers
                    because:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_18-p2_a"></a>(a)     no handrail had been installed on at
                        least one side of each staircase;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_18-p2_b"></a>(b)     the steps on the staircases were uneven as each step had
                        a recess on the edge which had yet to be laid over with a non-slip tile
                        (that was to be done only at the completion stage of the Building);
                        and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_18-p2_c"></a>(c)     the
                        staircases did not have any lighting and the staircase landings were only
                        dimly lit.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">In this connection, it is pertinent to note
                    that a photograph of a completed staircase in the Building showed a handrail
                    running along one side of the staircase as well as non-slip finishing at the
                    edge of the steps.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     I should add that in the present case, the
                    staircases in the Building were constructed for use by residents –
                    <em>ie</em>, they were not intended to be used by the
                    Respondent’s workers. However, the Respondent’s workers had to use
                    the staircases, notwithstanding their incomplete state of construction at the
                    material time, because the passenger lift in the Building could not reach higher
                    than the 10th floor. The staircases became an unsafe place of work because,
                    despite their incomplete state, the Respondent’s workers had to use them
                    to gain access from the 10th floor to higher floors of the
                Building.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Issue 3: Was the Appellant negligent in falling while making his
                way down the Staircase?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     Moving on to Issue 3, in my view, the
                    Appellant was contributorily negligent at the material time. He had used the
                    staircases in the Building (which, as just mentioned, were still in an
                    incomplete state of construction) many times in the course of his work and ought
                    to have been aware of their physical condition. His co-workers had also used the
                    same staircases for the same purposes every working day. Yet, none of them had
                    fallen or slipped on the staircases. The Appellant was aware that there was no
                    lighting at the staircases and that the staircase landings were only dimly lit.
                    He was also aware that the steps on the staircases were unfinished and uneven.
                    As such, the Appellant should have exercised care when using the staircases. He
                    should not have descended them at a fast pace. In his testimony, the Appellant
                    agreed that he had been moving quickly down the Staircase when he fell. His act
                    of rushing down the Staircase significantly increased the risk of his accident
                    happening and also contributed to the degree of his injuries. For these reasons,
                    I was of the view that the DJ’s finding that the accident had resulted
                    from the Appellant’s conduct in rushing down the Staircase should not be
                    disturbed, although I differed from the DJ in so far as I regarded the
                    Respondent’s breach of statutory duty and common law duty as a causative
                    factor as well.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     In the result, I found that both the Appellant
                    and the Respondent were negligent. Based on the evidence before me, it was
                    difficult to determine which party was more at fault. I thus decided that
                    liability should be apportioned equally between the parties, with the costs of
                    the appeal awarded to the Appellant. I also ordered the quantum of damages and
                    the costs of the proceedings in the District Court to be assessed by a deputy
                    registrar of the District Court.</p>
