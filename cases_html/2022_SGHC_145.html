</div> There is a small difference between what Mdm Thum withdrew and the time deposits that remained in the account, and they do not add up to the preceding balance of $1,532,140.94 (but instead, the lower figure of $1,522,615.07). That difference is likely due to Mdm Thum withdrawing interest and/or the incurring of bank charges reducing the remaining balance. For instance, the BOC statement dated 31 December 2014 shows that in 2014, $27,002.32 was paid in interest.

Again, the difference is likely due to interest and/or bank charges.

</div>
</div> This is consistent with Mr Ng’s inaction when confronted with his wife’s and children’s unhappiness regarding the manner in which the property was held. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The parties’ interests in the Sennett Lane Property</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 Both parties used the analytical framework in <span class="font-italic">Chan Yuen Lan v See Fong Mun</span> [2014] 3 SLR 1048 (“<span class="font-italic">Chan Yuen Lan</span>”), which I apply in the present case. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 The first step in the <span class="font-italic">Chan Yuen </span><span class="font-italic">Lan</span> framework is to ask if there is sufficient evidence of the parties’ respective financial contributions to the purchase price of the property (<span class="font-italic">Chan Yuen Lan</span> at [160(a)]). The answer to that is “no”. As I stated above at [29], I consider that both Mr Ng and Mdm Thum made financial contributions to the purchase price of the property. However, I cannot discern the exact proportions of their respective financial contributions based on the available evidence. Accordingly, there is no presumption of resulting trust (that they hold the beneficial interest in the property in proportion to their respective contributions to the purchase price). It will thus be presumed instead that the parties hold the beneficial interest in the Sennett Lane Property in the same manner in which the legal interest is held. Here, the legal interest was held on a joint tenancy, and it is therefore presumed that Mr Ng and Mdm Thum held the Sennett Lane Property on a beneficial joint tenancy (see <span class="font-italic">Damodaran s/o Subbarayan v Rogini w/o Subbarayan</span> [2020] 5 SLR 1409 (“<span class="font-italic">Damodaran</span>”) at [33]–[34]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 Moving to the second step, regardless of whether there is sufficient evidence of the parties’ respective financial contributions to the purchase price of the property, is there sufficient evidence of an express or an inferred common intention that the parties should hold the beneficial interest in the property in a proportion which is different from that set out in the first step (<span class="font-italic">Chan Yuen Lan </span>at [160(b)])? The answer to that is “no”. I find in the present case that the parties intended to hold the Sennett Lane Property as beneficial joint tenants, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, it was jointly owned in their lifetime not in any particular proportion (unless that joint ownership were severed), with the property going to the survivor in the event of the death of one of them (see [39] above). As the answers to both the first and second steps are “no”, it follows that the parties hold the beneficial interest in the Sennett Lane Property in the same manner as that in which they hold the legal interest, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, as beneficial joint tenants (<span class="font-italic">Chan Yuen Lan</span> at [160(c)]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 If, as Mr Ng contended, the loans Mdm Thum procured from her family members were only extended after the Sennett Lane Property had been fully paid for, that would nevertheless be relevant in considering the parties’ intentions regarding the Sennett Lane Property at the time it was sold in or around 2011. Whatever the situation at the time the property was acquired, the parties could have a subsequent express or inferred common intention as to how they hold the beneficial interest in the property (<span class="font-italic">Chan Yuen Lan</span> at [160(f)]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 In the present case, the Sennett Lane Property was held as a beneficial joint tenancy from the time of acquisition, and events after the purchase do not point to a change in the parties’ intention. On the contrary, Mdm Thum continued to contribute to Seacon (including by procuring loans from her family members for Seacon), and I accept that she did so in the belief (which Mr Ng shared) that Seacon was <span class="font-italic">their</span> business; and that the Sennett Lane Property which was purchased with money from Seacon was <span class="font-italic">their</span> property. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The UOB account</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 The Sennett Lane Property was sold in or around 2011, and the net sale proceeds of $3,738,796.99 were deposited into the UOB joint account of Mr Ng and Mdm Thum.

That amount of savings is also unlikely even if I were to include her earnings from trading on her own account. Moreover, Mdm Thum’s own evidence that she had occasionally used her savings and profits from her own trades for Seacon’s working capital makes it all the more unlikely that she could have accumulated a further $500,000 in savings (on top of what she contributed to Seacon).

Here, each of the two joint tenants took around half of the balance of the sale proceeds of the Sennett Lane Property in March 2020, with the same end-result: nothing remained in their joint names, and the joint tenancy came to an end. Such conduct – where one or more joint tenants operate on their own interests in the property – is a recognised mode of severing a joint tenancy in equity: <span class="font-italic">Chan Lung Kien</span> <span class="font-italic">v Chan Shwe Ching</span> [2018] 2 SLR 84 at [18]–[19].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">96 Absent any other intention of the parties, severance of a joint tenancy results in a tenancy in common in equal parts between Mr Ng and Mdm Thum (see <span class="font-italic">Lee Hwee Khim Rosalind v Lee Sai Khim and others</span> [2011] SGHC 64 at [25] and <span class="font-italic">Damodaran </span>at [92]–[94]). Accordingly, Mdm Thum was entitled to take a half-share of the money in the BOC account, as she did. If the balance in the UOB account were included as well, Mdm Thum took slightly less than half of the balance sale proceeds as at March 2020: she took $762,000 whilst Mr Ng took $766,466.62 ($761,048.42 from the BOC account, and $5,418.20 from the UOB account).

It would have been unprincipled to attempt some retrospective division of the sale proceeds equally between Mr Ng and Mdm Thum – that would have gone against their common intention that the balance sale proceeds from time to time were jointly owned (as I have found at [42], [51] and [66] above).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">99 In any case, the evidence before me did not allow for retrospective division of the sale proceeds of the Sennett Lane Property equally between Mr Ng and Mdm Thum.

</div> If I were to divide the sale proceeds of some $3.7m equally between the parties, I would first have to subtract the amounts which Mdm Thum had used to pay off the loans and to reimburse herself for her financial contributions – it would not be fair for Mdm Thum to have to use her share of the sale proceeds to repay the loans or reimburse herself. However, there was no evidence of exactly how much of the $1m Mdm Thum received was used for those purposes. Furthermore, as I noted above at [67]–[80], it is likely that some money from the BOC account was used by Mdm Thum towards the purchase of the Pine Close Flat, but on the evidence I cannot say precisely how much. Moreover, although the Pine Close Flat was in Mdm Thum’s sole name, both she and Mr Ng stayed there, and the evidence does not support a finding that what was used towards purchasing the Pine Close Flat was meant to be counted towards Mdm Thum’s share of the sale proceeds of the Sennett Lane Property. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">100 For the above reasons, I dismiss Mr Ng’s claim.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">101 In principle, Mdm Thum is entitled to costs from Mr Ng.

Mr Ng had a wife and children when his relationship with Mdm Thum began, and he never married Mdm Thum. Mr Ng and Mdm Thum operated a business together (“Seacon”). Mdm Thum had worked for Seacon without remuneration; she also channelled profits from trades on her own account to Seacon, and contributed to Seacon from her own savings. The parties purchased a property at Sennett Lane (the “Property”) as joint tenants for $160,000 using money from Seacon’s bank account. Mdm Thum also procured loans from several members of her family for Seacon’s business, although it is unclear if those loans were procured before or after the Property had been fully paid up.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">2 In or around 2011, Mr Ng and Mdm Thum sold the Property. The sale proceeds of $3,738,796.99 were deposited on 9 January 2012 into an account with United Overseas Bank (“UOB”) that was in the parties’ joint names. Prior to the sale proceeds being deposited, there was a balance of $5,325.15 in the UOB account. Various payments were made out of the UOB account, including $1m to Mdm Thum, $300,000 to three of Mr Ng’s four children, and $38,000 to repay Mdm Thum’s nephew for a loan he had extended. </div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">3 On 11 January 2012, two $1m cheques were drawn on the UOB account and placed as two $1m time deposits with the Bank of China (“BOC”). The BOC account was opened in the joint names of the parties. Subsequently, Mdm Thum bought another property in 2014 and Mr Ng lived there with her for a few years, before eventually moving to live in a nursing home. By March 2022, the balance in the BOC account had been reduced to $1,532,140.94. Mdm Thum withdrew $762,000 from the account, which was about half of the balance, and left the remainder half for Mr Ng. Thereafter, Mr Ng withdrew the balance in both the BOC account and the UOB account and closed them. </div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">4 Mr Ng commenced an action against Mdm Thum for the $762,000 which she withdrew, arguing that (1) Mdm Thum had undertaken that she was a joint account holder of the BOC account in name only, that the money in the account belonged solely to Mr Ng, and that she was not to draw out any money from the account; and (2) the sum was held by Mdm Thum on a resulting trust, constructive trust or bare trust for him. In response, Mdm Thum argued that she was beneficially entitled to the $762,000 that she withdrew, as she had contributed financially to the purchase of the Property. Moreover, she argued that the Property, the money in the UOB account, and the money in the BOC account were all held on a beneficial joint tenancy. </div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The court’s decision</span></div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The parties’ interest in the Property </span></div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">5 It was found that Mdm Thum had contributed financially to the purchase of the Property, as the Property was purchased using funds from Seacon’s business to which Mdm Thum had contributed. In particular, Mdm Thum had worked for Seacon without remuneration and had also used profits from her own trades and her own savings for Seacon’s business: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[20]</span>–<span class="font-weight-bold">[</span><span class="font-weight-bold">22]</span>. </div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">6 Applying the framework set out in <span class="font-italic">Chan Yuen Lan v See Fong Mun</span> [2014] 3 SLR 1048, the parties were presumed to hold the Property as legal and beneficial joint tenants, as (1) there was insufficient evidence of each party’s respective financial contributions to the purchase price of the Property; and (2) there was also insufficient evidence of an express or inferred common intention that the parties should hold the beneficial interest in the Property in a proportion different from their legal interest: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[41]</span>--–<span class="font-weight-bold">[42]</span>. </div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center"></div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The parties’ interest in the balance in the UOB account and BOC account </span></div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">7 Absent evidence to the contrary, the sale proceeds of a property held on a joint tenancy would continue to be held by the co-owners as joint tenants. Where such sale proceeds are deposited into a joint bank account, the co-owners hold the chose in action for the balance sale proceeds in the account as joint tenants. In this case, the sale proceeds of the Property were deposited into the UOB account (that was in the joint names of Mr Ng and Mdm Thum). The court held that the balance in the UOB account was also held by Mr Ng and Mdm Thum as beneficial joint tenants as their conduct was consistent with this. In particular, Mr Ng had not taken any steps to remove Mdm Thum as a joint account holder of the UOB account, despite stating that he was fearful of having assets in joint names with Mdm Thum as problems would arise if the relationship soured: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[46]</span> and <span class="font-weight-bold">[51]</span>. </div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">8 It was also found that the money in the BOC account, which was drawn from the UOB account, was held by Mr Ng and Mdm Thum as joint tenants. The court rejected Mr Ng’s allegation that Mdm Thum was only added as a joint account holder of the BOC account after giving some undertaking to the effect that he was beneficially entitled to the entire balance in the BOC account: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[63]</span>, <span class="font-weight-bold">[64]</span> and <span class="font-weight-bold">[66]</span>. </div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">9 The balance of $5,325.15 in the UOB account prior to the sale proceeds being received on 9 January 2012 was found to have been withdrawn and expended before March 2020. Hence, by March 2020, what remained in the UOB and BOC accounts was the balance of the sale proceeds of the Property (including interest thereon): at <span class="font-weight-bold">[87]</span>-–<span class="font-weight-bold">[</span><span class="font-weight-bold">88]</span>.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center"></div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Severance of the joint tenancy over the sale proceeds of the Property </span></div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">10 In a Canadian case with similar facts, the British Columbia Supreme Court and Court of Appeal held that where the entire balance of a joint account is drawn down to zero, any joint tenancy over sale proceeds formerly in the joint account is necessarily severed – the four unities of interest, title, time and possession, which are pre-requisites for a joint tenancy to exist, would no longer be present: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[92]</span>. </div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">11 When Mdm Thum withdrew $762,000 from the BOC account (which was about half of the balance then in the account), and Mr Ng withdrew the remaining balance in the BOC and UOB accounts and closed them, there ceased to be any chose of action that was held jointly by both parties, and the four unities no longer existed. Accordingly, the joint tenancy over the sale proceeds of the Property (which had been deposited into the joint bank accounts) was severed: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[93]</span>.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">12 Moreover, when Mdm Thum and Mr Ng each withdrew the amounts that they did, they both did so with the intention that the money withdrawn was not to be shared with the other. Mr Ng’s and Mdm Thum’s withdrawal of the entire balance of the sale proceeds of the Property amounted to operating on their own respective interests in the sale proceeds, which is a recognised mode of severing a joint tenancy in equity: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[94]</span>–<span class="font-weight-bold">[</span><span class="font-weight-bold">95]</span>. </div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">13 Absent any other intention of the parties, severance of a joint tenancy resulted in a tenancy in common in equal parts between Mr Ng and Mdm Thum. Accordingly, Mdm Thum was entitled to a half-share of the balance sale proceeds, and what she withdrew from the BOC account on 9 March 2000 was slightly less than a half-share of the balance sale proceeds. Mr Ng’s claim was therefore dismissed: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[96]</span>–<span class="font-weight-bold">[</span><span class="font-weight-bold">97]</span>. </div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center"></div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center"><span class="font-italic">This summary is provided to assist in the understanding of the Court’s grounds of decision.
