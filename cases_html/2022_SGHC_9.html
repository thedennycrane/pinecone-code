Mr Hook says he had not agreed to this transfer, and that his shares were worth far more.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">7 The plaintiffs say that Mr Hook’s shares were validly transferred away from him.

Incomlend also seeks damages from Mr Hook, in respect of certain information technology (“IT”) issues.

There are, however, significant differences between the management and directorship provisions in SD1, and those in SD2, which I will discuss at [64]–[80] below.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">16 The “entire agreement” clause in SD2 (Clause 23.2) is identical to that in SD1 (quoted at [13] above). Thus, SD1 said that <span class="font-italic">it</span> was the entire agreement between the parties, but thereafter SD2 said that <span class="font-italic">it</span> was the entire agreement between the parties.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The effect of the “entire agreement” clause in SD2</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">17 All of the 17 shareholders who were parties to SD1 were also parties to SD2; they were joined as parties to SD2 by 27 new shareholders.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">18 SD2 made no reference to SD1, and as such the phrase “[t]his Deed, and the documents referred to in it” in the “entire agreement” clause of SD2 (see the text at [13] above) would not include SD1.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">19 Indeed, the 27 new shareholders who are only parties to SD2 might not even know of the existence of SD1, and no evidence was led to show that any of them knew. As far as those 27 new shareholders were concerned, the “entire agreement” between them and the 17 earlier shareholders would comprise only SD2 and the documents referred to in it (which did not include SD1).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">20 The plaintiffs, however, suggested that for those who were parties to both SD1 and SD2, the “entire agreement” between them was SD1 <span class="font-italic">and</span> SD2 (and any documents referred to in both deeds). I do not accept this.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">21 In particular (and crucial in the present case), Clause 3.2 of SD2 provides that: “Each Shareholder undertakes with the other Shareholders and the Company that it shall procure and ensure that no issue or transfer of Shares shall be effected unless such issue or transfer is effected as permitted by and in accordance with the provisions of this Deed.”</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">22 If a transfer of shares were permitted by some agreement other than SD2, but not by SD2, then effecting that transfer would be a breach of SD2. Specifically, if the plaintiffs’ transfer of Mr Hook’s shares were permitted by SD1, but not by SD2, then effecting that transfer would be a breach of SD2. Likewise, if the plaintiffs’ transfer of Mr Hook’s shares were permitted by the Founders Agreement, but not by SD2, then effecting that transfer would be a breach of SD2.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">23 Even if the 17 earlier shareholders who were parties to both SD1 and SD2 agreed amongst themselves that transfers permitted by SD1 could still be effected, though in breach of SD2, that could not bind those who were parties only to SD2.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 I do not accept that the 17 earlier shareholders, or the Founders alone, intended to have inconsistent (or potentially inconsistent) share transfer regimes: one under SD2, one under SD1, and another under the Founders Agreement. Rather, the 17 earlier shareholders who were parties to SD1 agreed – by entering into SD2 – that, henceforth, only transfers permitted by SD2 (the latest agreement) would be allowed.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 I find that all 44 shareholders of Incomlend intended that SD2 (and the documents referred to in it) would be the “entire agreement” going forward:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The 27 new shareholders who were parties only to SD2 could have had no other intention.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The 17 earlier shareholders who were parties to both SD1 and SD2 could not have intended their relationship <span class="font-italic">inter se</span> to be governed by both SD1 and SD2, but their relationship with the 27 new shareholders to be governed only by SD2. This would be a messy state of affairs, and (as illustrated above in relation to share transfers) inconsistencies between the agreements would create problems.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Incomlend would have intended just one Shareholders Deed to regulate its relationship with all of its shareholders, that being SD2.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 Clause 27.1(d) of SD1 provides: “This Deed shall remain in full force and effect as between all the parties until the earlier to occur of … (d) agreement of all the parties that it be terminated.” I find that, by entering into SD2, Incomlend and all the 17 shareholders who were parties to SD1 agreed to terminate SD1 and replace it with SD2. That is what it means for SD2 to state – without reference to SD1 – that SD2 is the “entire agreement” that regulates the affairs of the company and the relationship between the shareholders of the company.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 In the specific context of share transfers, any inconsistent regime in SD1 or the Founders Agreement would not survive SD2 coming into force. It follows that whether the plaintiffs can justify the transfer of Mr Hook’s shares rests on SD2. For completeness, I will nevertheless also consider the position under SD1 and the Founders Agreement.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Was the transfer of Mr Hook’s shares justified?</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Was the transfer justified under SD2?</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Plaintiffs’ contentions</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 The plaintiffs sought to justify the transfer of Mr Hook’s shares as follows:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Mr Hook had breached SD2;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) on 12 January 2018, Mr Terigi had given Mr Hook notice to remedy his breaches (the “Cure Notice”)

To that, I would add that breach of Clause 5.1 of SD2 also does not form part of the plaintiffs’ pleaded case, and the plaintiffs made no submissions that Clause 5.1 of SD2 had been breached. The focus was thus on Clause 16.1 of SD2 instead. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 In the plaintiffs’ Statement of Claim, they pleaded that “the 1st Defendant persistently refused to assume full-time employment with the 3rd Plaintiff, and to relocate to Singapore for that purpose.

Instead, the plaintiffs acknowledged that Mr Terigi and Mr Kouchnirenko agreed that instead of Mr Hook himself becoming a director, he could nominate his father, Mr Ray Hook to be a director; and Mr Ray Hook was appointed a director accordingly.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 Moreover, the Cure Notice did not call upon Mr Hook to become a director to remedy his breaches. Instead, he was asked to remedy his breaches by “immediately tendering [his] notice of resignation at HSBC and confirming that [he] will take on full time employment with Incomlend in Singapore by 29th January 2018”. The focus was on employment, not directorship.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 As for Clause 16.1 of SD2, it was asserted in the Cure Notice that Mr Hook “continue[d] to work at HSBC Hong Kong, a bank which engages in similar business activity to Incomlend”, and he was asked to resign from HSBC HK immediately.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 I accept that, for the purposes of Clause 16.1 of SD2, HSBC HK’s business was a “Competing Business”, defined in Clause 1 of SD2 as “the provision of trade financing brokerage &amp; financial services or such business that is the same or substantially similar to the Business”. Clause 1 also defines “Business” to mean “principal activity of the Company [Incomlend] and its related corporations, being trade financing brokerage &amp; financial services through the Incomlend online platform and any ancillary activities related thereto, or any other business as the Shareholders may from time to time resolve in general meeting.”</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 However, I accept Mr Hook’s defence that his employment with HSBC HK falls within the proviso at the end of Clause 16.1 of SD2, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, “activities existing as at the date of this Deed … and disclosed in writing to the Directors of the Company.”</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 Mr Terigi and Mr Kouchnirenko were the initial directors of Incomlend, and it was disclosed to them in writing, prior to SD1 and SD2 (indeed, prior to the incorporation of Incomlend) that Mr Hook was employed with HSBC HK. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 Mr Hook provided his written <span class="font-italic">curriculum vitae</span> (“CV”)

In effect, it is the plaintiffs’ case that Mr Hook was in breach of Clause 16.1 of SD1 from inception, and thereafter also in breach of the identical Clause 16.1 of SD2 from inception, all because he did not resend his CV to Mr Terigi and Mr Kouchnirenko (both of whom already had it).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 I rejected these attempts to get around the fact that Mr Terigi and Mr Kouchnirenko were informed in writing of Mr Hook’s employment with HSBC HK. That disclosure, by way of Mr Hook’s CV, suffices for Clause 16.1 of SD2 (and SD1). Nothing in Clause 16.1 of SD2 (or SD1) indicates that disclosure made pre-incorporation of Incomlend would not count, or that disclosure to the directors before they became directors would not count.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 The proviso to Clause 16.1 of SD2 allowed the directors of Incomlend to decide whether they were agreeable to the person in question continuing with the disclosed activities, whilst also being a shareholder of Incomlend. If the directors were not agreeable, they could simply decide not to accept the person as a shareholder of Incomlend. Disclosure pre-incorporation of Incomlend, to Mr Terigi and Mr Kouchnirenko before they were appointed directors, is entirely consonant with that.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 I also note that in the Cure Notice, Mr Hook was not asked to re-send his CV (which on the plaintiffs’ case would have cured the breach of Clause 16.1); he was simply asked to resign from HSBC HK. The crux of the plaintiffs’ unhappiness with Mr Hook was not that he was involved in a Competing Business (which they had known about all along); it was that Mr Hook declined to resign from HSBC HK and take up full-time employment with Incomlend in Singapore, when first Mr Terigi and then Mr Kouchnirenko had done so.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 This is clear from the Cure Notice where Mr Terigi said:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">When we started Incomlend, us 3 founders clearly envisioned that we would eventually move to Singapore to take up full-time roles as the business was identified as being a Singapore business to start. Dimitri and I have both fulfilled our side of the bargain, we have been for quite some time full time with employment contracts and EP in Singapore for Incomlend Pte Ltd. But you still have not …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Dimitri and I have reached out to you on numerous occasions urging you to do right by what was agreed amongst us founders and come down with us here in Singapore. In return, you have given all types of excuses to avoid doing so. We have now reached a stage in Incomlend’s development where we need your complete and unreserved commitment and cooperation to the business.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">As such, pursuant to Clause 17.1(a) of both Shareholders Deeds, I am giving you a final opportunity to make good your breaches under the Shareholders Deeds and Founders Agreement, by immediately tendering your notice of resignation at HSBC and confirming that you will take on full time employment with Incomlend in Singapore by 29th January 2018 …</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 When Mr Terigi said the “founders clearly envisioned that we would eventually move to Singapore to take up full-time roles”, and called upon Mr Hook “to do right by what was agreed amongst us founders”, what was Mr Terigi referring to?</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 Nothing in SD2 obliged Mr Hook to take up full-time employment with Incomlend in Singapore. In particular, that was not required by either Clause 5.1 or Clause 16.1 of SD2, the only two clauses of SD2 that the Cure Notice said Mr Hook had breached.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 If Mr Terigi were referring to some agreement outside SD2, whether SD1, the Founders Agreement, or some other agreement altogether, that would run counter to the “entire agreement” Clause in SD2 (Clause 23.2). Moreover, on the terms of Clause 17.1, a Cure Notice under SD2 could only relate to a breach of SD2.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 If, for instance, Mr Hook had resigned from HSBC HK, and become a director of Incomlend, but nevertheless declined to take up full-time employment with Incomlend in Singapore, he would have cured any breach of SD2’s Clause 5.1 (by becoming a director) and Clause 16.1 (by leaving HSBC HK).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 That would, however, still not satisfy Mr Terigi and Mr Kouchnirenko, who were insistent that Mr Hook take up full-time employment with Incomlend in Singapore. But Mr Hook would nevertheless not be in breach (let alone material breach) of SD2, if he did not take up full-time employment with Incomlend.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Restrictions on transfer</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 Absent a breach of SD2 by Mr Hook, if the plaintiffs were to transfer Mr Hook’s shares away from him, they would breach Clause 3.2 of SD2, where each shareholder undertook with the other shareholders and Incomlend that “it shall procure and ensure that no issue or transfer of Shares shall be effected unless such issue or transfer is effected as permitted by and in accordance with the provisions of this Deed.”</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 Clause 9.1 of SD2 stipulates: “Subject to Clauses 9.8 and 17.2, no Shareholder shall sell or transfer any of his Shares for a period of two (2) years commencing from the date of this Deed.” The transfer of Mr Hook’s shares took place on 13 February 2018, within that two-year period commencing from 30 June 2017 (the date of SD2).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 Clause 9.8 of SD2 did not apply, and the plaintiffs do not contend it did. The plaintiffs sought to justify the transfer pursuant to Clause 17.2 which prescribes the consequences of an event of default by a shareholder. However, that does not work unless Mr Hook had breached SD2.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 I find that Mr Hook had not breached Clause 5.1 or Clause 16.1 of SD2 (the only clauses of SD2 which the Cure Notice asked him to remedy). It follows that he was not in material breach of SD2 for not remedying breaches, following the Cure Notice. Consequently, there was no Event of Default under Clause 17.1, and the plaintiffs could not invoke Clause 17.2 to justify the transfer of Mr Hook’s shares.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 I thus find that the plaintiffs breached SD2 by transferring Mr Hook’s shares as they did.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 The above analysis is premised on SD2 (and the documents referred to in it) being the “entire agreement” between the parties, with SD2 having superseded SD1 (either wholly, or at least in relation to share transfers). I will nevertheless go on to consider the position under SD1 and the Founders Agreement.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The position under SD1</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Notices</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 In these proceedings, the plaintiffs sought to justify the transfer of Mr Hook’s shares on the basis that he had breached not only SD2, but also SD1 and the Founders Agreement. However, the notices which they issued contemporaneously to deem an offer having been made by Mr Hook to transfer his shares, and to accept that offer, were only issued pursuant to SD2, not SD1 or the Founders Agreement.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 Preceding those notices, the Cure Notice

In connection with the foregoing, each of the Founder [<span class="font-italic">sic</span>] hereby grants the Company a power of attorney for the transfer of his Shares to the other Shareholders, which shall not be revocable except with the unanimous consent of the Shareholders.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">4.5. Dmitri Kouchnirenko shall enter in the Employment Agreement by 1 August 2016. Morgan Terigi shall enter in the Employment Agreement by 1 July 2016. Laurence Hook shall enter in the Employment Agreement by 1 August 2016.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 In line with Clauses 4.4–4.5 of SD1, Clause 4.6 states:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The Founders <span class="font-italic">will be</span> employees of the Company and shall be entitled to market rate salary. [emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 The equivalent of Clause 4.6 of SD1 is Clause 4.2 of SD2 which states:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The Founders <span class="font-italic">who are</span> employees of the Company and shall be entitled to market rate salary. [emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 There is a significant difference in wording between Clause 4.6 of SD1 (“The Founders <span class="font-italic">will be</span> employees …”) and Clause 4.2 of SD2 (“The Founders <span class="font-italic">who are</span> employees …”) [emphasis added]. Clauses 4.4, 4.5 and 4.6 of SD1 stipulated that the Founders “will be” employees, but there is no such stipulation in SD2. Instead, Clause 4.6 of SD2 provides in neutral fashion that the Founders “who are” employees shall be entitled to market rate salary. That contemplates that there might be Founders who are not employees, in which case those Founders would have no entitlement to market rate salary under Clause 4.2 of SD2.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 On a related note, Clause 5.1 of SD1 provides as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The Board of Directors shall initially comprise the Founders provided that a Founder shall only be appointed as a Director after he has signed an Employment Agreement with the Company …</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 Clause 5.1 of SD2, however, simply provides:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The Board of Directors shall initially comprise the Founders …</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">71 Unlike Clause 5.1 of SD1, Clause 5.1 of SD2 did not make it a pre-condition of directorship, that a Founder be an employee of Incomlend. This difference is in line with the differences between Clause 4 of SD1 and Clause 4 of SD2, noted at [68] above. In any event, instead of Mr Hook himself being a director, Mr Hook was allowed to nominate his father, Mr Ray Hook, who was appointed as a director: see [34] above.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">72 I note also that SD1 was dated 29 August 2016. The Founders were supposed to have signed their respective employment agreements before that date (as stipulated in Clauses 4.4–4.5 of SD1: see [65] above). In particular, Mr Kouchnirenko and Mr Hook were supposed to have signed their employment agreements by 1 August 2016, but neither had done so. On the face of SD1, they were both in breach of Clauses 4.4–4.5, and for that breach Clause 4.4 stipulated that they as defaulting Founders “shall transfer all [their] Shares to the other Shareholders at no cost”. This stipulation in Clause 4.4 of SD1 was never invoked – it would have led to Mr Kouchnirenko and Mr Hook losing all their shares, which would be transferred to Mr Terigi and the other shareholders. Taking this to the extreme, it might be said that even if Mr Kouchnirenko and Mr Hook belatedly signed their employment agreements, they had not done so by 1 August 2016 and so they were still liable to lose their shares.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">73 The plaintiffs instead sought to invoke SD2 (which was entered into on 30 June 2017, some ten months after SD1) such that Mr Hook’s shares would go to just Mr Kouchnirenko and Mr Terigi (with Mr Kouchnirenko by then having entered into an employment agreement with Incomlend), rather than to all the shareholders in SD1 other than Mr Hook himself. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">74 Unlike SD1, however, SD2 had no stipulation requiring the Founders to be employees of Incomlend. It was thus not a breach of SD2 for Mr Hook to have continued in employment with HSBC HK, instead of leaving for full-time employment with Incomlend. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">75 Under SD2, the fact that Mr Hook had not signed an employment agreement with Incomlend could not be used to justify acquiring his shares: that was not a breach under SD2. This brings the sting of the Cure Notice into sharp focus: the plaintiffs were fixated on Clauses 4.4, 4.5, 5.1 and 16.1 of SD1 (and in particular, the requirement that Mr Hook be an employee of Incomlend), rather than Clauses 5.1 and 16.1 of SD2.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">76 Even if Mr Hook were in breach of SD1 in the period between SD1 and SD2, once SD2 came into force and superseded SD1, the fact that he was not a full-time employee of Incomlend could not be regarded as a breach of contract as between him and the parties to SD2, which included all those who were parties to SD1. The plaintiffs could no longer treat this as a breach, for by entering into SD2 they agreed that SD2 (and the documents referred to in it) would be the “entire agreement” between Incomlend and its shareholders, that regulated the affairs of Incomlend and the relationship between its shareholders.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">77 Clause 27.3 of SD1 on consequences of termination stipulates that “[t]ermination of this Deed shall be without prejudice to any accrued rights or obligations of the parties up to the date of termination”, and various provisions were said to remain in full force and effect notwithstanding termination. Those provisions did not, however, include Clauses 3, 9 and 17 on the transfer of shares.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">78 Even if Clause 27.3 of SD1 preserved liability for breaches of SD1 in the period between SD1 and SD2 (such that Mr Hook remained in breach of SD1 for not signing his employment agreement, and the other parties to SD1 could seek relief for that breach), the plaintiffs did not seek to claim any damages from Mr Hook for breach of SD1, they only sought to justify their transfer of his shares.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">79 However, SD2 did not permit Mr Hook’s shares to be transferred for breach of SD1, and the regime for the transfer of shares under SD2 superseded that under SD1. Moreover, when the parties to SD1 entered into SD2, they agreed that the Founders would not need to be employees of Incomlend. That too superseded the position under SD1.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">80 For these reasons, I find that SD1 did not justify the transfer of Mr Hook’s shares.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The position under the Founders Agreement</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Notices</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">81 As I noted above (at [59]–[63]), the Cure Notice did not purport to be issued pursuant to the Founders Agreement. Likewise, the notices deeming an offer to have been made for the transfer of Mr Hook’s shares, and purporting to accept that offer, did not purport to be issued pursuant to the Founders Agreement. The Cure Notice did however allege that Mr Hook had breached Clauses 1.2(b) and 4 of the Founders Agreement, and I consider this below.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Alleged breaches of the Founders Agreement</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">82 Clause 1.2 of the Founders Agreement was a list of Trigger Events. Clause 1.1 provides that if any of the Trigger Events in Clause 1.2 are committed by or occur in respect of a Founder, that Founder shall offer his Relevant Shares in Incomlend to the other parties in accordance with Clause 2. “Relevant Shares” are defined in Clause 1.3 as various percentages of the Founder’s shares, depending on when the Trigger Event occurs.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">83 The Trigger Event in Clause 1.2(b) of the Founders Agreement is: “when a Party has committed a material breach of under [<span class="font-italic">sic</span>] this Agreement not having been remedied within ten (10) business days from the receipt of a notice of said violation addressed in writing by any of the Company or any of the Parties to the relevant Party in breach”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">84 The reference to Clause 1.2(b) of the Founders Agreement begs the question: what material breach of the Founders Agreement had Mr Hook committed, that he was expected to remedy?</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">85 The other clause of the Founders Agreement cited in the Cure Notice was Clause 4, but that did not impose any obligation on Mr Hook that he could breach. It provided that, without prejudice to Clauses 1 and 2, additional shares would be transferred by Mr Terigi and Mr Kouchnirenko to Mr Hook “if (i) Laurence Hook is free from all other work commitments and dedicates himself fulltime to the Company on or prior to June 1st 2017 with full time presence in Incomlend including presence in Singapore office when setting up may be needed and permanently present in Singapore from mid November 2017 onwards and (ii) none of the Trigger Events is committed by or occurs in respect of Laurence Hook on or prior to June 1 2017”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">86 Under cross-examination, Mr Terigi conceded that Clause 4 of the Founders Agreement did not impose an obligation on Mr Hook that he could breach; in particular, it did not impose an obligation on Mr Hook to take up full-time employment with Incomlend.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">87 The Founders Agreement did not reinforce the draconian consequences of a breach of Clauses 4.4–4.5 of SD1, pursuant to which Mr Hook was at risk of<span class="font-italic"> losing his shares</span> from the inception of SD1 on 29 August 2016 because he had not signed his employment agreement by 1 August 2016. Instead, Clause 4 of the Founders Agreement allowed Mr Hook to <span class="font-italic">receive </span><span class="font-italic">more shares</span> (by way of transfer from Mr Terigi and Mr Kouchnirenko) <span class="font-italic">if</span> he took up full-time employment with Incomlend on or prior to 1 June 2017, and was permanently present in Singapore from mid-November 2017. That did not happen, but that does not mean Mr Hook “breached” Clause 4 of the Founders Agreement: he simply gave up getting more shares from Mr Terigi and Kouchnirenko. Indeed, the word “if” in Clause 4 of the Founders Agreement recognised, in a neutral fashion, that Mr Hook might or might not take up full-time employment with Incomlend by 1 June 2017: it provided an incentive for him to do so, but it was not a breach if he did not.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">88  The plaintiffs submitted that Clause 4 did impose an obligation on Mr Hook to take up full-time employment with Incomlend on or before 1 June 2017 and relocate to Singapore by November 2017. I do not agree. That is not what Clause 4 says, and it also goes against the concessions of Mr Terigi and Mr Kouchnirenko as noted at [86] above. Using Clause 4 of the Founders Agreement to impose such an obligation would be superfluous, for Clauses 4.4–4.5 of SD1 already imposed an obligation on Mr Hook to have signed his employment agreement by 1 August 2016, and he had not done so; moreover, under SD1 Mr Hook stood to lose <span class="font-italic">all</span> his shares, whereas under the Founders Agreement, he only stood to lose 50% of them (at the relevant time).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">89 At trial, the plaintiffs sought to rely on Clause 1.2(d) rather than Clause 1.2(b) of the Founders Agreement. Clause 1.2(d) is also a Trigger Event, but it was not mentioned in the Cure Notice. Clause 1.2(d) applies: “When a Party is no longer willing to perform its duties within the Company”. The evidence does not support a finding that Mr Hook was no longer willing to perform his duties within Incomlend, and the point was not pursued in closing submissions.

The evidence indicates that the plaintiffs wished to take over control of Incomlend’s system from Mr Hook, to whom the Cure Notice had already been sent.

</div> That was however a “further or alternative” claim and there was a general prayer for “[d]amages to the 3rd Plaintiff, to be assessed”. The damages prayer nevertheless appeared to relate more to the allegations that Mr Hook had breached his duties to Incomlend in relation to the IT passwords. Indeed, the only “damages” sought from Mr Hook in the plaintiffs’ closing submissions, are damages of S$12,024.13 for appointing a new IT service provider.
