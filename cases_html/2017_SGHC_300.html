Consequently, it applied in Summons No 1847 of 2017 (which was granted on 9 May 2017), to be added as a party to and for a stay of Midas’ suit until after the determination of the garnishee summons and this Suit.            </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">20 Dissatisfied with the AR’s Order, both the judgment creditor and the judgment debtor appealed to a judge in chambers in RA Nos 102 and 103 of 2017 respectively (“collectively the Appeals”). The Appeals came up for hearing and both were dismissed by this court.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">21 This court subsequently acceded to the judgment creditor’s request to hear further arguments.

Hashimoto had then reportedly stated that if IFKAP received an invoice “based on some kind of document, then we will transfer the payouts that we have suspended”.

However, the House of Lords decision in <span class="font-italic">Employers’ Liability Assurance Corporation, Limited v Sedgwick, Collins &amp; Co </span>[1927] AC 95 made it clear that garnishees had no such direct interest in a suit such as to entitle them to apply to set aside a judgment in default.

He added that the judgment creditor did not dispute that Midas has a right of set-off of its claim against the monies it held on behalf of the judgment debtor. He found it highly suspicious that the sum claimed in Midas’ suit was so similar to the sum the judgment creditor sought to garnish. The burden was on Midas to show how much monies it held and the amount that was owed to it by the judgment debtor. The judgment creditor was entitled to any surplus between the two amounts.

First, he referred to those exhibited in Hyun’s first “show cause” affidavit.  He contended that the Midas Service Contracts were suspect. As Midas provided essentially the same service under all four contracts, why was there a need for so many contracts?  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 Further, the Midas Service Contracts were neither properly dated nor executed. To elaborate, Mr Sithawalla pointed to the contract dated 20 February 2014 (at pp 19-20 of exhibit SH-1) between Midas and the judgment debtor exhibited in Hyun’s first affidavit.  It stated that the “Holdback/Security Deposit” of 3% can only be withheld for 180 days. That contract was not even signed by Midas and was also conditional upon the bank accepting the merchant. The other three contracts at pp 24-28 of the same exhibit were signed by Midas but not by the merchant and/or undated.

Under subclause (2), if there are breaches by the judgment debtor, Midas must first make a demand before it can levy penalty charges arising from the breaches. Under subclause (6), after termination of the contractual relationship, Midas can retain the Security Deposit for a further 9 months in order to secure any claims for recovery resulting from chargebacks. T hereafter, any credit balance shall be transferred to the account of the judgment debtor designated by Midas. If (as Midas contended) the judgment debtor had been in breach of its payment obligations to Midas since 23 January 2016 (see [5]), then the 180 days started from that date and ended on 22 April 2016.

In such circumstances, we consider that the legal burden remains on the judgment creditor to prove the existence of such a debt if this is disputed by the garnishee and the matter proceeds for determination either summarily or at trial. In <span class="font-italic">Zoom Communications Ltd v Broadcast Solutions Pte Ltd</span> [2014] 4 SLR 500 (“<span class="font-italic">Zoom Communications</span>”) (at [75]), we held that a plaintiff retains the burden of showing that Singapore is the proper forum at the <span class="font-italic">inter </span><span class="font-italic">partes</span> stage if the foreign defendant who has been served, after the plaintiff succeeded at the <span class="font-italic">ex parte</span> stage to obtain leave to serve the originating process on a foreign defendant out of jurisdiction, challenges the jurisdiction of the Singapore court. We so held because we considered that in the final analysis, the party applying for the order at the <span class="font-italic">ex parte </span>stage of the proceedings had the same burden and the fact that it obtained the order at that stage does not mean it had discharged that burden.

It was well-nigh impossible to determine from the affidavit(s) whose version should be accepted as to what transpired at the meetings between the parties held on 23 February 2016 and 28 March 2016. The dispute revolved around what was said by Hyun and Hashimoto and whether the former knew and approved of the latter’s signing of the Remittance and Deposit Agreement in [9] regarding the debt owed to the judgment creditor by the judgment debtor and in turn by Midas to the judgment debtor. Moreover, the court cannot without more ignore Hashimoto’s apology dated 21 December 2016.  He should be afforded an opportunity to explain that along with his alleged oral commitment at the meetings to pay the judgment creditor’s claim.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 The court noted that the English version of the Japanese transcripts of the audio-recordings taken by Takeuchi at those two meetings was done in Japan and not by certified translators recognised by Singapore courts. I was not prepared to accept the accuracy of either those Japanese transcripts or the English translations of the transcripts. As it was impossible for this court (and the AR) to determine which side’s version of what transpired at the meetings should be accepted, I agreed with the AR’s decision that the dispute should go to trial.  In this regard, I adopt the reasoning for the AR’s grounds of decision dated 29 March 2017.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 The dispute between the parties extended to the rate that Midas could charge to the judgment debtor for its services, with the judgment creditor contending it was limited to 3% while Midas asserted it was a higher rate as penalty provisions had kicked in after the judgment debtor’s alleged breach of the Midas Service Contracts.  This dispute could not be resolved by affidavit evidence alone. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 This court was further prompted to dismiss the Appeals because it was mindful of what the appellate court in <span class="font-italic">Westacre</span><span class="font-italic"> Investment</span> said at [86]: </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">We accept that after a provisional garnishee order has been obtained the legal burden to <span class="font-italic">show cause</span> as to why the court should exercise its discretion not to make the order absolute lies with the garnishee or the judgment debtor. <span class="font-weight-bold">As a garnishee order is a form</span><span class="font-weight-bold"> of equitable remedy, the court may refuse to make the order absolute if it finds that the attachment of the debt would be inequitable (such as, if it would affect the interests of other persons, prejudice the rights of other creditors, or cause the judgment debtor to be liable for the debt twice)</span>. However, this must be contrasted with a situation, such as the present, where the garnishee or the judgment debtor is disputing the liability of the garnishee as opposed to arguing that an attachment would be inequitable or unfair. In our judgment, where the primary liability that governs the intended garnishee proceedings is being disputed, the burden of proof remains on the judgment creditor to prove that a debt as against the garnishee exists. [emphasis added in bold]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 It bears remembering that the judgment creditor took steps via Summons No 1847 of 2017 (see [19]) to stop Midas’s suit from proceeding further after it was filed. This was not done with altruistic intentions or in compliance with the AR’s directions as the judgment creditor claimed, but to steal a march on Midas, because the judgment creditor had already obtained the Judgment whereas the Midas suit had just commenced.  There was no reason at law for the court to prefer the judgment creditor’s claim over that of Midas as both were trade creditors of the judgment debtor. Midas should not be at a disadvantage just because it did not have a judgment for its claim. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 I accept the judgment creditor’s complaint that Midas was less than prompt in pursuing its claim for breach of contract against the judgment debtor which to date it should but has yet to quantify. I do appreciate the difficulties Midas may face in maintaining an accurate running account with the judgment debtor relating to voluminous credit card transactions over a considerable period of time and computing the penalty interest rate chargeable. However, now that the AR and this court has made the order for the issue to be tried as to whether it owes a pre-existing debt to the judgment debtor, Midas cannot and can no longer afford to be tardy.  </div><div class="Judg-Sign text-left">Lai Siu Chiu <br>Senior Judge</br></div><div class="Judg-Sign text-left"></div><div class="Judg-Sign text-left"></div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Moiz Haider Sithawalla and Lau Yu Don (Tan Rajah &amp; Cheah) for the plaintiff;<br/>Wong Hin Phin Wendell, Denise Teo and Alexis Loo (Drew &amp; Napier LLC) for the garnishee.</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
