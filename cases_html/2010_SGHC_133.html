<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       This is an appeal by Alphomega Research Group
                    (“Alphomega”) against the decision of the learned assistant
                    registrar (“AR”) who declined to set aside a default judgment
                    dated 7 July 2009 (“the Default Judgment”), which was granted in
                    favour of Nanyang Law LLC (“Nanyang”), as well as two orders of
                    court with respect to execution (“the Orders”) and a writ of
                    seizure and sale (“the WSS”). After much consideration, I decided
                    to allow Alphomega’s appeal. I now give my reasons for doing
                so.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Background</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The facts in the present matter are clearly set
                    out at [3] to [8] of the AR’s judgment in <em>Alphomega
                        Research Group Ltd v Nanyang Law LLC</em> [2010] SGHC 45 (“the
                    Judgment”). Essentially, Nanyang, a firm of advocates and solicitors, had
                    represented Alphomega in two suits involving Alphomega’s
                    directors/shareholders and Alphomega, <em>viz</em>, Suit No
                    49 of 2008 (“Suit 49”) and Suit No 856 of 2008. Both suits were
                    consolidated, together with a third suit, <em>viz</em>,
                    Suit No 855 of 2008 and heard before Tan Lee Meng J (“Tan
                        J”).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> Midway through the trial before
                    Tan J on 9 February 2009, Alphomega terminated the services of Nanyang and
                    replaced Nanyang with Sterling Law Corporation (“Sterling”) as its
                    counsel. Subsequent to its discharge, Nanyang sought to recover from Alphomega
                    payment for work done up to the termination. Several invoices were rendered to
                    Alphomega. However, payment was not made. Nanyang then proceeded to tax the
                    solicitor-client costs with the result that registrar’s certificates were
                    issued for sums totalling $332,229.40 payable by Alphomega to Nanyang. Nanyang
                    then sought payment of this sum from Alphomega. Once again, this was to no
                    avail. Nanyang hence commenced the present action against Alphomega to recover
                    the total outstanding amount in respect of the registrar’s
                    certificates.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       The writ of summons for the present suit
                    (“the Writ”) was filed on 23 June 2009. It was purportedly
                    served by a court clerk of Nanyang (“the Court Clerk”) on
                    Alphomega on 24 June 2009 at 6 Sungei Kadut Way, Singapore 728786, the address
                    of Alphomega’s principal place of business. As Alphomega did not enter
                    appearance in respect of the Writ, Nanyang obtained judgment in default against
                    Alphomega (<em>ie</em>, the Default Judgment) for the sum
                    of $332,229.40 on 3 July 2009. Thereafter, Nanyang proceeded with execution
                    proceedings against Alphomega. It obtained the Orders and the WSS and lodged a
                    caveat in the Registry of Land Titles in connection with the WSS.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       On 26 November 2009, Alphomega filed an
                    application to set aside the Default Judgment (“the Application”).
                    Two other summonses, <em>viz</em>, Summons No 6297 of
                    2009 and Summons No 6440 of 2009, were filed to amend the Application. One of
                    the amendments to the Application was to include an additional ground for
                    setting aside the Default Judgment, namely, the merits of its defence against
                    Nanyang’s claim. After hearing the arguments of both parties, the AR
                    dismissed the Application and upheld the Default Judgment. Alphomega’s
                    appeal against the AR’s decision then came before me.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       After careful consideration of the respective
                    submissions of the parties, I allowed Alphomega’s appeal on the basis that
                    even though the Default Judgment was regularly obtained, as the learned AR had
                    rightly found, Alphomega had a <em>prima facie</em> defence
                    and ought therefore to be allowed to defend itself against Nanyang’s
                    claim.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The law on the setting aside of default judgments</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       Under O 13 r 8 of the Rules of Court (Cap 322,
                    R5, 2006 Rev Ed) (“Rules of Court”), the court may, on such
                    terms as it thinks just, set aside a judgment entered in default of appearance.
                    The law on the setting aside of default judgments may be found in the seminal
                    case of <em>Mercurine Pte Ltd v Canberra Development Pte
                        Ltd</em> [2008] 4 SLR(R) 907 (“<em>Mercurine</em>”), where the Court of Appeal restated the
                    principles governing this area of the law. The Court of Appeal drew the usual
                    distinction between default judgments which have been obtained regularly and
                    those obtained irregularly.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       Where the default judgment sought to be set
                    aside is regular, the Court of Appeal said at [60] (and again at [95]) that
                    “the question for the court is whether the defendant can establish a
                        <em>prima facie</em> defence in the sense of showing
                    that there are triable or arguable issues”. However, the Court of Appeal
                    stressed at [65] that “the merits of the defence do not constitute the
                    sole consideration that a court takes into account in deciding whether to set
                    aside a regular default judgment”, indicating that it will also take
                    other considerations into account. At the end of the day, whether there is
                    a defence on the merits is to be balanced against other considerations, such as
                    the applicant’s explanation for the default and any delay, as well as
                    against prejudice to the other party.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       Where the default judgment sought to be set
                    aside is irregular, the Court of Appeal’s guidance at [96] is
                    instructive:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Where the default judgment sought to be set aside is an
                            <em>irregular</em> one, setting aside as of right
                            (<em>viz</em>, the <em>ex debito
                            justitiae</em> rule) remains the starting point, especially in
                        cases where the irregularity consists of the premature entry of a default
                        judgment or a failure to give proper notice of the proceedings to the
                        defendant –
                        <em>ie</em>, in cases where there has been egregious
                        procedural injustice to the defendant. This starting point may, however, be
                        departed from where there are proper grounds for doing so. The court has an
                        unfettered discretion whether the <em>ex debito
                            justitiae</em> rule should be followed, and, in exercising this
                        discretion, it may take into account, among other factors (see also [76]
                        above):</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(a)    the blameworthiness of the respective parties
                                    (<em>eg</em>, whether there has been undue
                                delay on the defendant’s part in making its setting-aside
                                application);</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(b)    whether the defendant has admitted liability
                                under the default judgment; and</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(c)    whether the defendant would be unduly
                                prejudiced if the irregular default judgment is allowed to
                                stand.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In those instances where the court is of the view that there has been no
                        procedural injustice of such an egregious nature as to warrant setting aside
                        the irregular default judgment as of right, the court has to go on to
                        consider whether to nonetheless set aside the irregular default judgment on
                        some other basis apart from the <em>ex debito
                            justitiae</em> rule. To this end, it is crucial for the court to
                        take into account the merits of the defence. Should the court find that the
                        defendant is ‘bound to lose’ (<em>per</em>
                        Sir Staughton in <em>Faircharm</em> ([77] <em>supra</em>)) if the default judgment is set aside and the
                        matter re-litigated, the court should ordinarily uphold the default
                        judgment, subject to any variation which the court deems fit to make and/or
                        any terms which it deems fit to impose.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">In other words, the plaintiff has first to persuade the court that the
                        <em>ex debito justitiae</em> rule should not be
                    applied. Having done so, it then has to counter the defendant’s setting
                    aside application by showing that the defendant is “bound to
                    lose”.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Whether the Default Judgment was regularly obtained</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       Based on the guidance provided in <em>Mercurine</em> (<a href="#p1_6">[6]</a> <em>supra</em>), I had first to decide whether the Default
                    Judgment was regularly or irregularly obtained. In this regard, I agreed with
                    the AR that the Default Judgment was regularly obtained. First, I was of the
                    view that service of the Writ had indeed been effected. The Court Clerk had
                    described in detail how service was effected on 24 June 2009 in a statutory
                    declaration. Alphomega’s argument (that Nanyang’s assertion that
                    service of the Writ had been acknowledged by one “Chris” ought not
                    to be believed because none of its employees bore the name of
                    “Chris”) was weak. I was also not convinced by Alphomega’s
                    argument that Nanyang’s chairman, Mr Ng Kim Tean (“Mr Ng”)
                    who was also Alphomega’s company secretary, had possession of
                    Alphomega’s stamp and could have belatedly and improperly affixed the same
                    to the Writ. This was because I noted that Mr Ng had ceased to be
                    Alphomega’s company secretary in February 2009.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     Second, not only had service of Writ been
                    effected, I was also of the view that there was proper service of the same. To
                    my mind, service of the Writ at Alphomega’s principal place of business
                    was good service. In this regard, I disagreed with the learned authors of
                        <em>Walter Woon on Company Law</em> (Sweet &amp;
                    Maxwell, 3rd Ed, 2005) at para 10.2 and <em>Halsbury’s Laws
                        of Singapore</em> vol 6 (LexisNexis, 2006 Reissue) at para 70.298, who
                    take the view that s 387 of the Companies Act (Cap 50, 2006 Rev Ed)
                    (“Companies Act”), which provides for service at a company’s
                    registered office, is prescriptive and not only permissive. I based my
                    decision, in part, on the AR’s comprehensive discussion of service on
                    companies at [19] to [39] of his Judgment. In addition to his analysis of the
                    law in Singapore, the United Kingdom and Australia, I have two points to add.
                    First, s 387 of the Companies Act which provides that “a document
                        <em>may</em> be served on a company by leaving it at or
                    sending it by registered post to the registered office of the company” is
                    in substance very similar to s 1139(1) of the UK Companies Act 2006 which also
                    provides that “a document <em>may</em> be served on
                    a company registered under [the Companies Act 2006] by leaving it at, or sending
                    it by post to, the company’s registered office”. I noted, in
                    particular, that the word “may” is used in both ss 387 and
                    1139(1).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     Apart from the other authorities considered by
                    the learned AR, the Court of Appeal in England in <em>Singh v
                        Atombrook</em> [1989] 1 WLR 810 suggests (at 818–819) that there
                    is no reason why “may” as used in s 725(1) of the Companies Act
                    1985 (UK) (c 6) (the predecessor of s 1139(1) of the Companies Act 2006)
                    (UK) (c 46)) should be read as “must”. The earlier decision
                    of <em>Vignes v Stephen Smith &amp; Co</em> (1909) 53 SJ
                    716 (“<em>Vignes</em>”), which stated that
                    “the only way in which a writ can be served on a company is by leaving it
                    at or sending it by post to the registered office”, as well as the
                    decisions of <em>Wood v Anderson Foundry Co</em> (1888) 36
                    WR 918 (“<em>Wood</em>”) and <em>Pearks, Gunston &amp; Tee Limited v Richardson</em> [1902] 1
                    KB 91 (“<em>Pearks, Gunston &amp; Tee</em>”),
                    which Eve J relied upon in <em>Vignes</em>, all did not
                    explain why “may” in s 62 of the Companies Act 1862 (c 89) (UK)
                    (which is equivalent to s 387 of our Companies Act) ought to be read as
                    “must”. <em>Wood</em> and <em>Pearks, Gunston &amp; Tee</em> merely stated that service had to be
                    effected in the manner provided by s 62 of the UK Companies Act 1862 and then
                    concluded that because service was not effected at the respective registered
                    offices, s 62 was not complied with. However, no cogent reason was offered as to
                    why service under s 62 had to be limited to service at the registered office
                    despite the word “may” in s 62. My view that s 387 of the
                    Companies Act is merely permissive also finds support in the Australian case of
                        <em>Peters v Oscar Mayer Pty Ltd</em> [1963] VR 390. In
                    that case, the Supreme Court of Victoria opined (at 395) that s 252 of the
                    Victorian Companies Act 1958, which states that “a document
                        <em>may</em> be served on a company by leaving it at or
                    sending it by post to the registered office”, does not purport to
                    “provide an exclusive mode of effecting service on a company. It [merely]
                    provides what will be sufficient leaving other methods open of proving effective
                    service”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     The second point I would like to make concerns
                    s 48A of the Interpretation Act (Cap 1, 2002 Rev Ed) (“Interpretation

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Since s 387 merely provides that service “may” be
                    effected at the company’s registered office, I was of the view that
                    service on the company may be effected in accordance with any of the methods
                    stipulated in s 48A(<em>c</em>) of the Interpretation Act.
                    In my view, the clause “Where a written law authorises or requires a
                    document to be served on a person”, which appears at the beginning of s
                    48A(1) of the Interpretation Act, refers principally to written law which
                    authorises or requires service of a document but which is silent on the manner
                    of service of the same. Section 48A therefore supplements such written law by
                    providing the methods whereby service may be effected.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     Admittedly, on a plain reading of the
                    prefatory words in s 48A, s 387 of the Companies Act could also qualify as a
                    written law which “authorises … a document to be served”.
                    But does s 387 “require” service in the manner provided in s
                    387? On the view that I have already expressed, it does not. On a plain reading,
                    s 387 of the Companies Act is clearly permissive and not prescriptive.
                    Therefore, it cannot be said that any “contrary intention appears”
                    in s 387. Such a construction permits s 48A(1)(<em>c</em>)
                    of the Interpretation Act to have effect. In contrast, a reading that s 387 of
                    the Companies Act is prescriptive (so that a contrary intention appears) would
                    render s 48A(1)(<em>c</em>) otiose in so far as service on
                    a company is concerned. It would then be capable of applying only to bodies
                    corporate other than companies, <em>ie</em>, to foreign
                    corporations. I cannot imagine any principled argument in favour of such
                    construction. That this could not have been the legislature’s intent is
                    demonstrated by the provision in s 48A(1)(<em>c</em>) for
                    service on “the secretary ... of the body corporate”. Typically, a
                    foreign company would not have a secretary in Singapore. Moreover, if truly the
                    legislative intent was that s 48A(1)(<em>c</em>) was to
                    apply only to foreign corporations, it could easily have been drafted to make
                    this clear.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Whether the defendant has a <em>prima facie</em>
                defence</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     Second, having established that the Default
                    Judgment was regularly obtained, I then considered whether Alphomega had
                    established a <em>prima facie</em> defence and ought to be
                    allowed to defend Nanyang’s claim.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     Of the various defences Alphomega pleaded, I
                    was of the view that, <em>prima facie</em>, Alphomega had a
                    defence of set-off based on money had and received by Nanyang. On that basis, I
                    allowed the appeal.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     Order 18 r 17 of the Rules of Court provides
                    for the defence of set-off. Since a set-off is a defence, the claims must, as a
                    general rule, be between the same parties and made in the same capacity. In
                    addition, not all claims can be the subject of a set-off. The law only
                    recognises three forms of set-off, <em>viz</em>, legal
                    set-off, abatement and equitable set-off (<em>Hua Khian Ceramics
                        Tiles Supplies Pte Ltd v Torie Construction Pte Ltd</em> [1991] 2 SLR
                    901 (“<em>Hua Khian Ceramics Tiles
                    Supplies</em>”) at 887.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     In the present matter, Alphomega argued that
                    in a separate suit (see <em>Tan Choon Yong v Goh Jon
                        Keat</em> [2009] 3 SLR(R) 840, moneys had been found, as a matter of
                    fact, to have been inappropriately paid out of its funds to Nanyang for services
                    Nanyang rendered to Alphomega’s directors in their personal capacities. As
                    a result, it was submitted that it was entitled to repayment of that sum of
                    money by way of set-off against moneys owing to Nanyang. I was of the view that,
                        <em>prima facie</em>, Alphomega did have an arguable
                    claim for money had and received against Nanyang and ought to be given an
                    opportunity to establish its claim. I stressed, however, that it was not for me
                    to adjudicate on the merits of that claim. It sufficed to say that if
                    Alphomega’s claim was made out, Nanyang would owe Alphomega a liquidated
                    debt and that this debt would satisfy the requirements of a
                set-off.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     A claim for money had and received seeks to
                    return both parties to their respective positions which they would have been in
                    had the disputed moneys not been paid out. In this respect, the sum which
                    Alphomega sought on a claim for money had and received would be fixed at the
                    amount Nanyang received. It was hence a liquidated sum. It would appear that
                    Alphomega’s claim against Nanyang was unrelated to Nanyang’s claim
                    in the present suit. However, that is no barrier to a defence of legal set-off,
                    since it is irrelevant that a defendant’s claim against the plaintiff is
                    unrelated to the plaintiff’s claim against the defendant, so long as the
                    defendant’s claim is for a liquidated sum (<em>Axel Johnson
                        Petroleum AB v MG Mineral Group AG</em> [1992] 1 WLR 270 at 272, 274
                    and 276; <em>Aectra Refining and Manufacturing Inc v Exmar NV
                        (The New Vanguard and The Pacifica)</em> [1994] 1 WLR 1634
                        (“<em>Aectra Refining</em>”) at 1643 and
                    1647; <em>Hua Khian Ceramics Tiles Supplies</em> (<a href="#p1_16">[16]</a> <em>supra</em>) at 887; and <em>OCWS

                    SLR(R) 888 (“<em>OCWS Logistics</em>”) at [6]
                    and [8]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     In the alternative, Alphomega could arguably
                    have a defence of equitable set-off. In my view, there was <em>prima facie</em> a triable issue as to whether Alphomega’s
                    claim (based once again on money had and received) is so closely connected with
                    Nanyang’s claim that it would be manifestly unjust to allow Nanyang to
                    enforce payment without taking into account Alphomega’s claim (<em>Hua Khian Ceramics Tiles Supplies</em> at 889; <em>OCWS Logistics</em> at [9]; <em>Pacific Rim
                        Investments Pte Ltd v Lam Seng Tiong</em> [1995] 2 SLR(R) 643 at [35];
                        <em>Abdul Salam Asanaru Pillai v Nomanbhoy &amp; Sons Pte
                        Ltd</em> [2007] 2 SLR(R) 856 at [28]. Once again, it was not for me to
                    adjudicate on the merits of such defence. I noted, however, that there were
                    arguable or triable issues in that respect.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     Other than Alphomega’s defence of
                    set-off based on a claim for moneys inappropriately paid out of
                    Alphomega’s funds to Nanyang for services Nanyang rendered to
                    Alphomega’s directors in their personal capacities, I was not convinced
                    that Alphomega had a <em>prima facie</em> defence based on
                    its other submissions. Alphomega alleged that it had a defence against
                    Nanyang’s claim as Nanyang did not have the authority or mandate to act on
                    behalf of Alphomega. It also alleged that Nanyang was not entitled to claim
                    for work done as it had not acted in Alphomega’s best interest. In
                    essence, both defences concerned non-entitlement to payment for work done. I
                    rejected both arguments for two reasons. First, Nanyang’s claim against
                    Alphomega was for money payable by Alphomega to Nanyang as a result of the
                    taxation of various invoices Nanyang had issued to Alphomega for work done. It
                    was akin to an enforcement action whereby the rights of one party against the
                    other (such rights arising from the former’s liability to the other at
                    law) was given effect to, rather than an action determining whether one party
                    was liable to another to begin with. By agreeing to taxation of solicitor and
                    client costs (the learned AR found at [4] and [41] of the Judgment that
                    Alphomega had in fact agreed to such taxation), Alphomega had acknowledged
                    Nanyang to be its solicitors in Suits 49, 855 and 856. If it disputed
                    Nanyang’s authority or mandate to act on its behalf, Alphomega ought to
                    have raised such objection at the taxation hearing. However, this was not done.
                    Hence, it was not open to Alphomega to argue before me that Nanyang was not
                    entitled to claim for work done in the first place. Arguments to this effect
                    appeared to be an afterthought on Alphomega’s part.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     Second, pursuant to O 59 r 33 of the Rules of
                    Court, the registrar’s certificates, unless set aside on review, ought to
                    be taken as conclusive both as to Alphomega’s liability towards Nanyang as
                    well as to the quantum of that liability (<em>Shook Lin &amp; Bok
                        v Yeo Kian Teck</em> [1991] 2 SLR(R) 944, quoted in <em>Commercial Bank of Kuwait SAK v Nair (Chase Manhattan Bank NA,
                        garnishee)</em> [1993] 3 SLR(R) 281 at [26]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     As for Alphomega’s claims that it has a
                    right to claim against Nanyang for damages it allegedly suffered as a result of
                    first, Nanyang’s wrongful actions; and second, Nanyang’s negligence,
                    both claims are in effect counterclaims against Alphomega for damages rather
                    than defences against Nanyang’s claim. However, a counterclaim is not
                    synonymous with a defence. Since the Default Judgment may only be set aside if
                    Alphomega had a <em>prima facie</em> defence against
                    Nanyang, rather than a counterclaim, Alphomega’s arguments in this respect
                    are untenable.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Effect of defence of set-off</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     The effect of Alphomega having, <em>prima facie</em>, a right of set-off is that it is entitled
                    to have the Default Judgment set aside. This is based on the law’s
                    approach to set-offs and counterclaims raised in opposition to summary judgment
                    applications. It has been said in <em>Mercurine</em>
                        (<a href="#p1_6">[6]</a> <em>supra</em>) at [60] that “it is … rather
                    illogical to hold that the test for setting aside a regular default judgment
                    should be any stricter than that for obtaining leave to defend in an O 14
                    application. In both instances, there has been no hearing on the
                    merits”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     The court’s approach to set-offs and
                    counterclaims raised in opposition to summary judgment applications can be found
                    in <em>United Overseas Limited v Peter Robinson
                        Limited</em> (Civil Division, 26 March 1991, unreported) where Bingham
                    LJ identified four classes of cases which the court would encounter when
                    deciding whether summary judgment ought to be granted:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The first class of case is that in which the defendant can show an
                        arguable set-off, whether equitable or otherwise. To the extent of such
                        set-off the defendant is entitled to unconditional leave to defend. It is
                        for the judge to decide whether such an arguable set-off is shown or not. If
                        he decides that it is, he has no further discretion as to the order he
                        makes. …</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The second class of case is where the defendant sets up a bona fide
                        counterclaim arising out of the same subject-matter as the action and
                        connected with the grounds of defence. In this class of case … the
                        order should not be for judgment on the claim, subject to a stay of
                        execution pending the trial of the counterclaim, but should be for
                        unconditional leave to defend even if the defendant admits the whole or part
                        of the claim. …</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The third class of case … is where the defendant has no defence to
                        the plaintiff's claim so that the plaintiff should not be put to the trouble
                        and expense of proving it, but the defendant sets up a plausible
                        counterclaim for an amount not less than the plaintiff's claim. In such a
                        case the order should not be for leave to defend, but should be for judgment
                        for the plaintiff on the claim and costs until the trial of the
                        counterclaim. That passage in the White Book is based on, and is indeed an
                        almost literal quotation from, the judgment of Lord Esher in <em>Sheppards &amp; Co v Wilkinson and Jarvis</em> (1889) 6
                        TLR 13, where judgment was entered for the plaintiff on the claim, but with
                        a stay of execution pending trial of the counterclaim.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The fourth class of case is where the counterclaim arises out of quite a
                        separate and distinct transaction or is wholly foreign to the claim or there
                        is no connection between the claim and the counterclaim. The proper order
                        should then be for judgment for the plaintiff with costs without a stay
                        pending the trial of the counterclaim. ...</p>
<p class="Judg-1">These were adopted by Lai Siu Chiu J in <em>Hawley
                        &amp; Hazel Chemical Co (S) Pte Ltd v Szu Ming Trading Pte Ltd</em>
                    [2008] SGHC 13 at [33].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     Based on Bingham LJ’s classification,
                    since I found that Alphomega has an arguable defence of set-off, its claim
                    against Nanyang falls within the first class of Bingham LJ’s
                    classification (which represents the classic set-off situation), entitling it to
                    have the Default Judgment set aside. Alternatively, it could be said that
                    Alphomega has a <em>bona fide</em> counterclaim which acts
                    as a set-off against Nanyang’s claim and which can be placed in the second
                    class (also resulting in the Default Judgment being set aside).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     In the result, I allowed Alphomega’s
                    appeal and ordered, albeit with some reluctance, that the Default Judgment be
                    set aside. This was because Alphomega should have realised from the hearing
                    before the AR that several of its assertions were not borne out by the facts. It
                    suffices to mention three such instances. First, Alphomega claimed that it had
                    no notice of the proceedings in this action until 17 November 2009 when it was
                    served the Orders and WSS by the court bailiff. However, Alphomega’s
                    filing of a Notice of Appointment of Solicitor on 13 November 2009, giving
                    notice that Sterling had been appointed as solicitors for Alphomega, suggested
                    that Alphomega would have had notice of the proceedings in this suit by that
                    day.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     Second, Alphomega would have been aware of
                    demands made by Nanyang for payment in letters sent in June 2009 by Nanyang to
                    Sterling demanding payment and seeking confirmation that Sterling had
                    instructions to accept service. In response to those letters, Sterling wrote to
                    Nanyang (with copy to Alphomega) to state that it had “no instructions to
                    act”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     Finally, Alphomega asserted that
                    Nanyang’s chairman, Mr Ng, was its company secretary until 21 September
                    2009 but never notified Alphomega of any action being commenced by Nanyang. In
                    addition, it was contended that as Alphomega’s company secretary, he could
                    have easily affixed Alphomega’s stamp to the Writ, thereby misrepresenting
                    that service had been properly effected. However, the assertion relating to Mr
                    Ng’s position as Alphomega’s company secretary until 21 September
                    2009 was not true, since Alphomega had sent a letter to Mr Ng earlier in
                    February 2009, informing him that he had been removed from the company secretary
                    position, and Mr Ng had in return sent Alphomega a letter of resignation from
                    the position.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     Accordingly, while the justice of the case
                    required that Alphomega be allowed an opportunity to be heard on its defence and
                    it was in that spirit which I allowed its appeal (though I would also mention at
                    this point that that on which Alphomega succeeded was covered in but four short
                    paragraphs, out of 114 paragraphs, of Alphomega’s written submissions), I
                    was disinclined to allow Alphomega its costs in the appeal. Under O 59 r 7 of
                    the Rules of Court, the court may refuse to allow a party to recover its costs
                    if it appears to it “that any thing has been done, or that any omission
                    has been made, unreasonably or improperly by or on behalf of any party”
                    in the action. Accordingly, I ordered that the costs order below was to remain
                    and made no order as to costs in the appeal.</p>
