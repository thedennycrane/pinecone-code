The absence of any quantum being mentioned as director’s fees reinforces the perception that even if Wallace had discussed with the Plaintiff about such fees, the discussion was tentative only. So even on the Plaintiff’s own evidence, there was no such definite promise that he would be paid such fees.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">17 </span>Secondly, the Plaintiff’s evidence was that every year during the annual performance review, Wallace would promise him director’s fees.

I will now elaborate on the circumstances leading to the allegation of misconduct regarding that letter. To do so, I will set out a chronology of material emails and events. There was initially some confusion about the chronology as the dates and times of some emails were based on Singapore dates and times, and others were based on time zones outside of Singapore. However, the parties managed to agree on the dates and times of most of the emails, using Singapore as the common reference point. Hence, the references to dates and time of various emails below are references to Singapore dates and times.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(1) Chronology of material emails and events</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">31 </span>By an email dated 23 May 2012 at 10.39am, Goldbach informed his superior, Pascal Ronde that, as discussed, he had terminated the employment of ST Lee that day. ST Lee’s last day of employment would be 31 July 2012. The Plaintiff was tasked to prepare the paper work in consultation with German and Savoy. This email was copied to various persons, including the Plaintiff.

The commencement date was important because the calculation of the main component of payment due to ST Lee was based on his commencement date.

This was the first time he had sent the Disputed Letter to any of the Defendant’s other officers. The Defendant’s case was that the letter was forged and then sent to German because the Plaintiff’s calculations for ST Lee’s severance package, based on a commencement date of 11 March 2000, were being queried and the Disputed Letter had to be produced to substantiate the calculations.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">78 </span>The change in the Plaintiff’s position was very damaging to his credibility. He must have known whether both the laptops he was using were password protected. I find that he had lied when he asserted, through Advocatus, that the Plaintiff’s office laptop was not password protected. Furthermore, the evidential burden of proof was on him to establish that even though it was password protected, other staff knew the password too. This allegation was based on his bare assertion. Bearing in mind his lack of credibility, I find that he has not established this allegation.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">79 </span>I address one other argument raised by the Plaintiff in his closing submissions at paras 28–34. He submitted that he did not gain any monetary benefit from the Disputed Letter. Furthermore, the Defendant did not allege that there was collusion between the Plaintiff and ST Lee. He submitted that it was incorrect for the Defendant to suggest for the first time in Savoy’s AEIC (at para 53) that the Plaintiff had created the Disputed Letter to cover up the allegedly unauthorised payment of $30,000 and/or the Plaintiff’s miscalculation of ST Lee’s severance package. According to Savoy’s AEIC, the $30,000 reflected approximately the excess amount which would have been paid to ST Lee had the Defendant computed ST Lee’s severance package based on the Disputed Letter.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">80 </span>The Plaintiff further submitted that even if the advance payment of $30,000 was not authorised, the creation of the Disputed Letter would have done little to justify the unauthorised payment. The advance payment of $30,000 was paid to ST Lee after the Plaintiff had computed ST Lee’s severance package and circulated it by email on 23 May 2012 at 11.18am (see [32] above). The email spoke of the payment structure and not the intention to only advance $30,000 to ST Lee. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">81 </span>In my view, this last point was neither here nor there. It did not support the argument that the severance package had nothing to do with the advance payment of $30,000.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">82 </span>I come now to the Plaintiff’s further submission that if he had made a miscalculation on ST Lee’s severance package, he could have easily admitted to the genuine miscalculation with little or no consequence. I find this submission ironic because it is not disputed that the commencement date of ST Lee in the Disputed Letter was erroneous and that the Plaintiff did not admit the error initially even though he was questioned several times about the accuracy of ST Lee’s commencement date. This is the next topic which I will elaborate on, but suffice it for me to say for now that, far from admitting any error, the Plaintiff in fact did the opposite. He did attempt to use the Disputed Letter with intent to deceive the Defendant.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">83 </span>The following factors therefore supported the Defendant’s case that the Plaintiff created or was involved in the creation of the Disputed Letter:</div><div class="mb-3"><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(a) the Disputed Letter was created on the Plaintiff’s office laptop;       </div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(b) his office laptop was password protected;</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(c) he denied it was password protected only to admit this fact later;</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(d) he did not establish his belated allegation that other staff knew the password; and</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(e) he did attempt to use the Disputed Letter with intent to deceive the Defendant. </div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">84 </span>It is not necessary for the Defendant to establish the Plaintiff’s motive in creating or being involved in the creation of the Disputed Letter although that would have aided the Defendant’s case. In the circumstances, I find that the Defendant has established that the Plaintiff created the Disputed Letter or was involved in its creation.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(3) Whether the Plaintiff had attempted to use the Disputed Letter with intent to deceive the Defendant</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">85 </span>Even if the Plaintiff did not create and was not involved in the creation of the Disputed Letter, the next important question was whether he had attempted to use it with intent to deceive the Defendant.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">86 </span>On the face of the Disputed Letter, there were two points which should have alerted the Plaintiff that it was not authentic if he had paid attention to it. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">87 </span>The first was that the top right hand of the Disputed Letter had the words “LTX Asia International, Inc” as part of a letterhead of sorts. However, as mentioned earlier, the first sentence of the substance of the letter referred to “LTX-Credence Singapore Pte Ltd”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">88 </span>It was submitted by the Plaintiff that this difference was not drawn to his attention at any time before 7 June 2012 when he was told to go on administrative leave. I reiterate that by 6 June 2012, he had sent an email to Savoy to say that he had found the payroll for calendar year 2000 and learned that ST Lee had not been paid in that year (see [58] above).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">89 </span>However, given the fact that queries had already been made about the accuracy of the information he was providing and the authenticity of the Disputed Letter after he first sent his calculations for ST Lee’s severance package on 23 May 2012 (see [32] above), it seems strange that he needed someone to point out that discrepancy to him when he himself should have been checking the Disputed Letter carefully in the light of the queries.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">90 </span>Be that as it may, I would say that even if I were to give him the benefit of the doubt and assume that he did not notice the first point, this brings us to the second point which is that the name “LTX-Credence Singapore Pte Ltd”, which was stated in the substance of the Disputed Letter, was inconsistent with the purported date of 18 February 2000 in the Disputed Letter. As at that date, there was no such entity then, as mentioned by Savoy (see [44] above). Even if the Plaintiff had not noticed this point before, Savoy had drawn it to his attention specifically in Savoy’s email of 25 May 2012 sent at 3.51am.

</div> The one for Kevin Chong was dated 16 April 1986. It was under the letterhead of LTX Corporation, Singapore. The first line of the substance of the letter itself referred to “LTX Corporation’s offer”. The second letter for the Plaintiff himself was dated 13 October 1989. It was on the letterhead of LTX Asia International, Inc. and the substance of the letter referred to “LTX Asia International” as the employer. In other words, the new name of “LTX-Credence Singapore Pte Ltd” did not appear in either of these letters unlike the Disputed Letter for ST Lee. When the Plaintiff received copies of these two letters, he ought to have realised that each was using one of the old names and certainly not the new name. Indeed when he forwarded copies of these two letters to Savoy on the next day, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, 31 May 2012, at 8.50am, his cover email stated, “It is in the old format”.

</div> The Plaintiff replied that he was not sure and there would have been some arrangement between one Amy Yeo and Cornelius on this. Savoy asked if the Plaintiff thought Cornelius had actually signed the letter and the Plaintiff said that he had no reason to doubt. This part of the telephone conversation was not denied by the Plaintiff but he could not explain why he gave such responses when he knew (and must have remembered by then) that there had been no revised offer letter for ST Lee and hence, the Disputed Letter with the new name of the employer stated therein must have been a forgery.

The allegation about Goldbach’s prior approval was important to the issue whether the Plaintiff had unilaterally approved payment of the $30,000 to ST Lee. If Goldbach did give his approval on 23 May 2012 before the $30,000 was paid to ST Lee, the Plaintiff would have said so at the earliest opportunity. He did not.

</div>
</div> and that under this provision, the Defendant was to make “due inquiry” before dismissing an employee. The terms of cl 5(1) GST are set out above at [9].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">127 </span>The question was whether the Defendant did conduct “due inquiry” before dismissing the Plaintiff on 14 June 2012. The Plaintiff alleged that he was entitled to claim damages based on a reasonable length of time that it would have taken the Defendant to conduct “due inquiry” before dismissing him.     </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">128 </span>Before I continue, I note that in the Defendant’s closing submissions, the Defendant relied on its Business Conduct and Ethics Policy which was applicable in principle to the Plaintiff’s employment. Specifically, the Defendant raised clause 20 of the Business Conduct and Ethics Policy (“cl 20 BCEP”) which provides that if the Defendant receives information regarding an alleged violation of the policy, the Defendant shall “(c) determine whether it is necessary to conduct an informal inquiry or a formal investigation” and thereafter report the results of any such inquiry or investigation upwards.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">129 </span>The Defendant submitted that the procedure under cl 20 BCEP had been followed because the Plaintiff’s misconduct in the creation of the Disputed Letter had been reported and Savoy had been tasked to conduct an investigation into the matter and the results and recommendation were also reported upwards. The Defendant also submitted that it was not the Plaintiff’s case that the procedure under cl 20 BCEP was not followed. Also, its witnesses were not cross-examined on cl 20 BCEP. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">130 </span>I am of the view that it was for the Plaintiff to decide whether he was relying on cl 20 BCEP. He was not. The truth of the matter is that it was the Defendant which was attempting to rely on cl 20 BCEP late in the day as it did not raise this provision in its defence or during the trial. Yet the Defendant attempted to bring in cl 20 BCEP through the back door by submitting that it was not the Plaintiff’s case that the procedure under cl 20 BCEP was not fulfilled or that the Defendant’s witnesses were not cross-examined on cl 20 BCEP.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">131 </span>The Defendant itself did not cross-examine the Plaintiff on cl 20 BCEP. It was not surprising that the Plaintiff did not cross-examine the Defendant’s witnesses on it. There was no reason to do so in the circumstances. I rule that the Defendant is not entitled to rely on cl 20 BCEP. Accordingly, it is not necessary for me to decide whether cl 20 BCEP was in any event superseded by or subject to cl 5(1) GST. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Whether the Defendant had conducted due inquiry</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">132 </span>Coming back to cl 5(1) GST, the question is what constitutes “due inquiry”? There is no elaboration in either the Defendant’s GST or the Business Conduct and Ethics Policy. The terms in cl 5(1) GST (which are set out at [9] above) are similar to those in s 14(1) of the Employment Act (Cap 91, 2009 Rev Ed) (“s 14(1) EA”) which states:  </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Dismissal</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">14</span>.—(1)  An employer may after due inquiry dismiss without notice an employee employed by him on the grounds of misconduct inconsistent with the fulfilment of the express or implied conditions of his service except that instead of dismissing an employee an employer may — …</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">133 </span>The Plaintiff did not assert that he was an employee for the purpose of the Employment Act. Hence it was not his case that that provision applies to him. Nevertheless, he was entitled to rely on cl 5(1) GST. In view of the similarity between cl 5(1) GST and s 14(1) EA, he was relying on s 14(1) EA to ascertain what “due inquiry” in cl 5(1) GST means. I turn now to consider relevant case law on this point. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">134 </span>In <span class="font-italic">Velayutham</span><span class="font-italic"> M v Port of Singapore Authority </span>[1974–1976] SLR(R) 307 (“<span class="font-italic">Velayutham</span>”), the High Court considered the meaning of “due inquiry” in the predecessor to the present version of s 14(1) EA, both of which are materially similar. In that case, the plaintiff was an employee of the Port of Singapore Authority (“PSA”). On 17 April 1968, he was charged in the District Court with the theft of various cartons of brandy from a godown. On the same day, he was interdicted from service and put on half pay. On 20 June 1969, he was acquitted and discharged by the court. He reported for work the next day but was told to wait. His solicitors then wrote to PSA on 30 June 1969 to request that he be reinstated. He was not.     </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">135 </span>On 3 July 1969, the PSA held a meeting presided by its chairman/general manager. Various senior officers of PSA were present but not the Plaintiff. The meeting was held to discuss the plaintiff’s request to be reinstated. Two reports of the PSA police, one before the plaintiff’s acquittal and one after his acquittal as well as various statements of witnesses were considered at the meeting. PSA also subsequently sought and obtained legal advice that it was entitled to dismiss the plaintiff (and two other employees who were involved in the alleged misconduct) without payment of pension and gratuity. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">136 </span>On 10 September 1969, PSA wrote to the plaintiff to inform him that he was dismissed forthwith for misconduct. The plaintiff then commenced action for wrongful dismissal and arrears of salary.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">137 </span>The main point raised by the plaintiff in <span class="font-italic">Velayutham</span> which is relevant for present purposes was that “due inquiry” as required by s 14(1) EA had not been carried out. He had not been asked to appear before the meeting and was not afforded the opportunity to present his own defence there.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">138 </span>The High Court concluded that the PSA had conducted full investigations and the results of such investigations and relevant documents had been placed before the meeting. There was sufficient material for those present at the meeting to make a decision to dismiss the plaintiff for misconduct. It was not necessary to call the plaintiff to appear before the meeting and be heard in his own defence. He was at all times well aware of the accusations against him. Accordingly there had been “due inquiry” within the meaning of s 14(1) EA. Another point raised by the plaintiff also failed. Accordingly his claim was dismissed (see <span class="font-italic">Velayutham</span> at [33]–[37]).      </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">139 </span>In the Malaysian case of <span class="font-italic">Said </span><span class="font-italic">Dharmalingam Bin Abdullah (formerly known as Dharmalingam A/l Ranganathan) v Malayan Breweries (Malaya) Sdn Bhd</span> [1997] 1 MLJ 352 (“<span class="font-italic">Said</span>”), the employee was suspended from duties pending an investigation into an allegation that he had attempted to steal various bottles of cordials and a bottle of stout from the brewery. After a two week suspension, a formal domestic inquiry was conducted over three days. However, in that case, the employee was required to and did attend the inquiry and was assisted by a union representative to address four charges against him. The panel of inquiry eventually found him guilty of all the charges. The panel recommended to the brewery manager that he be dismissed with immediate effect and the manager then dismissed the employee.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">140 </span>The employee then commenced action. He was unsuccessful at first instance. On his appeal, his only contention was that although he had been given the opportunity to defend himself on liability, he was also entitled to be given the opportunity to make a submission in mitigation on the question of the punishment to be imposed under the “due inquiry” provision in s 14(1) of the Employment Act 1955 (No 265 of 1981) (M’sia). However, as he was not given that opportunity, there was no “due inquiry”. Section 14(1) of that Act is worded similarly to s 14(1) EA (see [132] above).      </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">141 </span>The appellate court decided that “due inquiry” includes the right to make representations in respect of the punishment to be imposed. Nevertheless, it also decided that in the circumstances of the case where the misconduct was very grave indeed, it would have been a useless formality to have accorded the employee that right as the penalty (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, dismissal)<span class="font-italic"> </span>would have been the same even if the right had been exercised. Hence his appeal was dismissed.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">142 </span>I now come to some guidelines in the website of Singapore’s Ministry of Manpower (“MOM”) (<span class="font-underline" style="color: rgba(0,0,255,1)">http://www.mom.gov.sg/employment-practices/termination-of-employment</span> (accessed 17 April 2017)). Under the subject of “Termination due to employee misconduct” and “Holding an inquiry”, the website states that the employee being investigated for misconduct should have the opportunity to present his case even though there is no prescribed procedure for conducting an inquiry.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">143 </span>The Defendant did not dispute that the Plaintiff should have been given an opportunity to present his case. Its position was that he <span class="font-italic">did</span> have several opportunities to do so even though there had been no formal inquiry and hence “due inquiry” under cl 5(1) GST had been carried out.

</div>
</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">144 </span>It was not in dispute that the Plaintiff knew that as of 23 May 2012, the Defendant had begun to look into the question of the commencement date of ST Lee’s employment. I have set out the various emails between him and officers of the Defendant or its parent company. However, it was only on 7 June 2012 that Savoy was in Singapore and accessed the Plaintiff’s email account and then the Plaintiff’s office laptop. I have discussed this above. I now turn to the affidavit of evidence-in-chief (“AEIC”) of Savoy who was the main witness for the Defendant.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">145 </span>At paras 56–60 of Savoy’s AEIC, he said that he had made various discoveries, some by means of accessing the Plaintiff’s email account on 7 June 2012. Thereafter, he and Goldbach had a meeting with the Plaintiff at about 4pm at the office of the Defendant to give the Plaintiff an additional chance to explain the discrepancies in the Disputed Letter and the Plaintiff’s involvement. He said that he showed the Plaintiff print-outs of the authentic letter of employment for ST Lee, the Disputed Letter and the February 2002 Version. He also showed the Plaintiff various other documents which he set out at para 52 of his AEIC. Savoy informed the Plaintiff that it was clear that he had created the Disputed Letter. He took the Plaintiff through the course of events as evidenced by the documents the Defendant was relying on. He offered the Plaintiff a severance package if he confessed and assisted in the Defendant’s investigations. If the Plaintiff denied involvement in the forgery, he would be placed on administrative leave while investigations were continuing and his employment was likely to be terminated unless there was other evidence which would exonerate him.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">146 </span>According to paras 58–60 of Savoy’s AEIC, the Plaintiff said to him that Linda Phang had nothing to do with the forgery. He denied any involvement too and offered no explanation. He refused the offer of a severance package. In the circumstances, the Plaintiff was placed on administrative leave.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">147 </span>Goldbach’s AEIC on the meeting of 7 June 2012 with the Plaintiff was more brief. Basically he left it to Savoy to elaborate. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">148 </span>The Plaintiff executed two AEICs. The first was executed on 22 August 2016 and the second on 9 September 2016 to address certain AEICs of the Defendant’s witnesses. It seems that he had no legal representation at the times when he executed the two AEICs as they do not appear to have been prepared and filed by solicitors. His AEICs were not helpful as to what transpired on 7 June 2012 although he did mention generally that Savoy did not offer him any severance package.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">149 </span>The Plaintiff was the first to give oral evidence at trial. He said that on 7 June 2012, Savoy and Goldbach had been walking in and out of his room. Savoy spoke to him a number of times face to face, once in the morning and once in the afternoon. In the afternoon, at about 3.45pm, he was told that he was suspected of being involved in the forgery of the Disputed Letter and asked to admit to it or say who was involved. He was also told that Barres had a copy of the authentic offer letter to ST Lee, but was not shown a copy of that letter or any other document. The Plaintiff did not ask why he was being suspected. He did not ask for elaboration about the forgery but he did say he did not do anything and he did not know anything about a forged letter or who did it. He told Savoy he goes to church, he is a Christian and he would see him later. He was then told to go on administrative leave and he left the office.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">161 </span>It seems to me that the phrase “due inquiry” means something more than just the making of inquiries and the conduct of an investigation. Otherwise the word “inquiry” alone would suffice. The phrase suggests some sort of process in which the employee concerned is informed about the allegation(s) and the evidence against him so that he has an opportunity to defend himself by presenting his position, with or without other evidence. While the website of the MOM does not have the force of law, its guide that the employee concerned should have the opportunity to present his case is a useful one. That accords with notions of justice and fairness especially since serious consequences may follow. Furthermore, as already mentioned, the Defendant did not dispute that the Plaintiff should have an opportunity to present his case.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">162 </span>However, in order for an employee to be given an opportunity to present his case effectively, he must first be informed clearly what the case against him is. As mentioned above, this includes the allegation(s) and the evidence against him. While “due inquiry” does not mandate any formal procedure to be undertaken, the more the informality the greater the danger that “due inquiry” was not undertaken. Accordingly, where no formal process was undertaken, the court should be more careful to ensure that the employee’s right is protected.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">163 </span>In the present case, it is clear that no formal process was undertaken. Initially, Barres’ email dated 23 May 2012 (see [33] above) raised a question about the correct commencement date for ST Lee’s employment. This inquiry developed into a suspicion that something was wrong especially when the discrepancy in the name of the employer in the Disputed Letter was noted and the Plaintiff was not able to answer questions about the discrepancy satisfactorily. Indeed, his purported explanation about revised offer letters appeared to have fuelled the suspicion since there were offer letters still in the old format. By the time Barres located a copy of the authentic letter on 29 May 2012, the Defendant would have likely inferred that the Disputed Letter was a forgery. However, at that point in time, it was still uncertain who was involved and more information was required to determine who was behind the forgery.

Even though he eventually said he had printed out certain documents and showed them to the Plaintiff, it was not clear to me what he had actually said to the Plaintiff. Did he say that the Plaintiff was suspected of misconduct or did he actually accuse the Plaintiff of misconduct? If the latter, did he state clearly that the Plaintiff was being accused of being the forger, or of being involved in the forgery even if he was not the forger?

</div> For the reasons I have given, that is not good enough.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">168 </span>Furthermore, as the Plaintiff submitted, even the timing of the three occasions on 7 June 2012 when Savoy spoke to the Plaintiff was not entirely consistent. The further and better particulars of the initial defence and counterclaim filed on 17 October 2014 stated that the times of the three occasions were 9.30am, 1pm and 4pm.

<div class="FootnoteRef text-justify">  Further and Better Particulars of Defence &amp; Counterclaim dated 17 October 2014, para 7.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> Yet, as mentioned above, when Savoy gave his oral evidence, he said it was around 12pm, 2pm and 4pm.                     </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">169 </span>Again, I do not say that Savoy was being deliberately untruthful. However, this inconsistency and the uncertainty of other parts of his evidence to which I have alluded suggest that he was only inquiring and investigating but no more. Perhaps that was why no contemporaneous written record by Savoy as to what transpired between the Plaintiff and him that day was produced. While, as I have said, it is not necessary to undertake any formal procedure, the absence of such a contemporaneous written record from the Chief Legal Counsel of the parent company of the Defendant suggests that he was not contemplating a process beyond an inquiry and investigation.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">170 </span>It seems that even after 7 June 2012, the Defendant was not entirely certain about its reasons for dismissing the Plaintiff. Hence, even though the letter of termination set out four specific reasons, they were referred to as a “partial list” of the specific reasons. I note also that the letter of termination referred to “part (5)” of the GST. Presumably, this referred to cl 5 GST and, as set out at [9] above, cl 5(1) GST contains the requirement of “due inquiry”. The letter of termination did not even mention that “due inquiry” had been undertaken. This was likely because the Defendant had equated “due inquiry” with “inquiry” and thought that there was no need to mention the latter because clearly inquiries had been made.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">171 </span>I add that after parties had tendered their closing submissions, I gave them an opportunity to address the court also on the Malaysian case of <span class="font-italic">Said </span>([139] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>)<span class="font-italic"> </span>and certain sections of the website of the MOM pertaining to “due inquiry” which had come to my attention.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">172 </span>It was then that the Plaintiff further submitted that he should also have been given the opportunity to present arguments in mitigation relying on the Malaysian case. However, in <span class="font-italic">Said</span>, the court concluded that the denial of that opportunity would have made no difference to the employer’s decision as the misconduct was so grave that no punishment other than dismissal was possible. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">173 </span>Indeed, the Plaintiff did not suggest that if he had been given the opportunity to present arguments in mitigation, the outcome would have been different. His point was that this was another illustration that he had been denied “due inquiry”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">174 </span>As there was inadequate evidence to establish what the Defendant had in fact said to the Plaintiff on 7 June 2012 about his alleged misconduct, I conclude that the Defendant did not conduct “due inquiry” in respect of the Disputed Letter. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">175 </span>In respect of other allegations of misconduct such as the Plaintiff’s unauthorised approval of four payments, it seems clear that the Plaintiff was not specifically informed about all of such other allegations until he was presented with the letter of termination. Therefore, likewise, there was no “due inquiry” about any of these payments.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Consequences of the failure to conduct due inquiry</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">176 </span>Relying on <span class="font-italic">Gunt</span><span class="font-italic">on v Richmond-Upon-Thames London Borough Council</span> [1980] 3 WLR 714, the Plaintiff submitted that he is entitled to his salary for the reasonable time it would take the Defendant to conduct “due inquiry”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">177 </span>Bearing in mind that the Defendant was investigating into the Plaintiff’s misconduct about approving various payments without authority, the Plaintiff submitted that it would have taken the Defendant two months to conduct “due inquiry” into all the allegations against the Plaintiff.

<div class="FootnoteRef text-justify">  Statement of Claim (Amendment No 2) dated 23 January 2017, para 26A.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">178 </span>The argument that it would have taken the Defendant two months to conduct due inquiry into all the allegations was really based on a figure plucked out of the air. Indeed the claim for failure to conduct “due inquiry” was not part of the initial claim of the Plaintiff. At trial, he made a half-hearted reference to some other dispute between the Defendant and another employee to support his argument of two months. On the other hand, the Defendant hardly gave evidence as to how long it would have taken it to conduct “due inquiry”, if it had failed to conduct such an inquiry. Furthermore, the Defendant’s submission was only that there was “due inquiry” or that the allegation of two months to conduct such an inquiry was too long. It did not suggest an alternative to the two-month period.    </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">179 </span>Be that as it may, the burden of proof is on the Plaintiff to establish that the Defendant would have taken at least two months to conduct “due inquiry”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">180 </span>I noted that the Defendant had, in its own mind, completed all or most of its inquiries at least in respect of the Disputed Letter. It had made some inquiries into the four unauthorised payments but it was likely that it would have had to make more inquiries to ascertain the facts in respect of all of such payments. On the other hand, it was not necessary for it to insist or rely on all the four unauthorised payments to dismiss the Plaintiff. It could have relied on his conduct in respect of the Disputed Letter and the unauthorised payment of $30,000 as it seemed to have completed its inquiries on both these matters by the date of the letter of termination, from its point of view.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">181 </span>In the circumstances, the Defendant would not have needed much more time to conduct due inquiry. The additional time it would have needed would be to clearly specify to the Plaintiff each and every allegation in respect of both these matters as well as its evidence to support each allegation and give him the opportunity to respond. In my view, it was unlikely to require more than seven days to do so and it was unlikely that the Plaintiff would have required more time to respond. It seemed to me that he would have simply denied the allegations just as what he had done before the Defendant was more specific. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">182 </span>I have some reservation as to whether the Defendant would also be obliged to give the Plaintiff an opportunity to address it on the consequences of his misconduct if it concluded that the misconduct was established. There was no evidence as to what human resource departments do or on the advantages and disadvantages of embarking on such a course of conduct. There was also no evidence or submission as to whether both liability and consequences could be addressed together in the same opportunity given to the Plaintiff or should be done separately. After all, “due inquiry” need not be formal. Accordingly, I will not say that the Defendant would have required more than the seven days mentioned above. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">183 </span>In the circumstances, the Plaintiff is entitled to payment of his salary for those additional seven days it would have taken the Defendant to conduct due inquiry. The slight problem was to determine the quantum of his salary for the purpose of computing this claim. As mentioned at [2] above, the Plaintiff had used different figures to represent his monthly salary for his various claims. As the Defendant did not appear to challenge the figure of $17,064 for the monthly salary, I will use this figure as the basis for computing the seven days’ salary.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">184 </span>Another slight problem was whether this seven days’ salary ought to be calculated based on 30 days per month or working days. One would have thought that since the Plaintiff was not a daily-rated employee, working days would not be the appropriate measure. However, the Plaintiff had used working days as the basis to calculate his claim for salary in lieu of unconsumed leave of 24.92 days (see [2(c)] above) and the Defendant appeared to accept this basis (see [5(a)] above). Accordingly, in relation to the Plaintiff’s claim for salary for the time period it would have taken the Defendant to conduct “due inquiry”, I will similarly calculate the seven days’ salary based on working days and use the approach in [2(c)] above. This works out to be $5,512.98 (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, $17,064 x 12/260 x 7).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">185 </span>I would mention that the Plaintiff’s claim for damages if the Defendant had failed to conduct due inquiry appeared to be made on the premise that so long as due inquiry was not made, he was entitled to damages, whether or not misconduct was established.

</div>
</div> In other words, the Plaintiff appeared to be asserting that even if misconduct was not established and he would have been entitled to the reliefs mentioned in [2(a)] and [2(b)] above, he would also have been entitled to damages for the Defendant’s omission to conduct due inquiry in addition to such reliefs.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">186 </span>I doubt if that proposition is correct. If misconduct was not established, the general principle in law is that an employer would be entitled to adopt the avenue most advantageous to it to terminate the employment. In the present case, the Defendant would have been entitled to terminate the Plaintiff’s employment by giving him the one month’s salary in lieu of notice and the severance package. There would have been no need to carry out due inquiry first and then give him such benefits since in that scenario, the Defendant would no longer be relying on misconduct. However, as misconduct was established, I need not reach a conclusion on the Plaintiff’s approach.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The claim for damages for inability to procure similar employment</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">187 </span>As for the Plaintiff’s claim for loss for not being able to procure a similar job as that held with the Defendant, this was based on the premise that his dismissal was wrongful in the sense that there was no valid reason to dismiss him. As I have found that the Defendant did have valid reasons to dismiss the Plaintiff, his claim for loss for not being able to procure a similar job must fail. Even if he had established that there was no valid reason for the Defendant to dismiss him, it is uncertain whether he would have succeeded in establishing his entitlement to the loss both as a matter of legal principle and evidence, especially since his evidence in respect of this claim was not satisfactory in various aspects. However, I need not say any more on such a claim. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">188 </span>In the circumstances, I grant judgment to the Plaintiff for $5,512.98 being seven days’ salary based on his salary of $17,064 per month for the Defendant’s failure to conduct due inquiry. I need not consider whether he should also be entitled to pro-rata bonus or any other relief for that claim since his claim was for the loss of salary only.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">189 </span>In addition, the Defendant is to pay the Plaintiff $12,928.26, being the aggregate amount of $12,505.05 and $423.21 (see [61] and [62] above), which it was intending to pay him for his salary and other benefits but for the fact that the Plaintiff did not present these two cheques for payment. I have included the aggregate amount formally as part of a judgment against the Defendant to avoid any dispute although it has all along not disputed its obligation to pay the aggregate amount subject to any counterclaim it may have.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">190 </span>I dismiss the rest of the Plaintiff’s claim. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">191 </span>As for the Defendant’s counterclaim for $30,000 (being the payment which the Plaintiff authorised to ST Lee, without authority), there was a question in my mind as to whether this sum had been recovered from ST Lee. According to the Defendant, it has not.
