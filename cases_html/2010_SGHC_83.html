<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       This was an appeal by the plaintiff
                    (“CHHK”) against the decision of the assistant registrar
                    (“the AR”) on 1 October 2009 in Summons No 4717 of 2009
                    (“Sum 4717”) in which she ordered that part of CHHK’s claim
                    against Yeow Chern Lean (“Yeow”) be struck out. The AR also
                    ordered the conversion of the originating summons into a writ action, but no
                    appeal was made against this order.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       Essentially, this case concerned a question of
                    law, <em>viz</em>, the applicability of the Limitation Act
                    (Cap 163, 1996 Rev Ed) (“the Act”) to a claim for moneys had
                    and received in respect of two United Overseas Bank cheques, No 378730 for
                    $80,000 (“the First Cheque”) and No 634684 for $100,000
                    (“the Second Cheque”) (collectively “the Two
                    Cheques”), issued by Neo Kok Eng (“Neo”), the majority
                    shareholder and managing director of CHHK. I dismissed the appeal on 17 November
                    2009 and now give my reasons for so doing.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Background</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       Neo had originally issued three cheques, the Two
                    Cheques as well as another cheque for $260,000, to one Lim Leong Huat
                    (“Lim”), the general manager of CHHK at the material time. Lim
                    handed those cheques to Yeow, who in turn encashed the First Cheque on
                    22 November 2000 and the Second Cheque on 4 April 2002. He applied the
                    proceeds from the Two Cheques towards, respectively, the purchase and
                    construction of a house at No 189 Eng Kong Garden, Singapore 599287
                    (“the Property”). In a previous action, Suit No 136 of 2007
                    (“Suit 136”), Neo sued Yeow for damages from conversion, moneys
                    had and received and a declaration that the Property was held by Yeow on trust
                    for Neo. Yeow pleaded that there was a private arrangement between Neo and Lim
                    which allowed Yeow the use of the proceeds from the three cheques, and further
                    that Neo’s claim was in any case time barred. However, Yeow admitted that
                    as he had no personal knowledge of such an arrangement he had accepted that the
                    arrangement existed on the basis of whatever Lim had told him.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       Suit 136 was heard by Lai Siu Chiu J
                    (“Lai J”) together with a related action, Suit No 137 of
                    2007, in which CHHK sued Yeow for the breach of his fiduciary duties. Lai J
                    found, in her judgment issued on 15 September 2008 in <em>Neo Kok
                        Eng v Yeow Chern Lean</em> [2008] SGHC 151 (unreported)
                        (“<em>Neo Kok Eng (HC)</em>”), that Yeow
                    was liable to Neo for $440,000, or the sum of the three cheques, and ordered an
                    inquiry into the percentage contribution of the $440,000 towards the profits and
                    rental income of the Property. Significantly, Lai J, citing the decision of
                    Judith Prakash J in <em>MCST No 473 v De Beers
                        Jewellery Pte Ltd</em> [2001] 2 SLR(R) 669
                        (“<em>De Beers</em>”), held that
                    Neo’s alternative claim for money had and received was <em>not</em> a claim in tort or contract, and that therefore
                        s 6(1)(<em>a</em>) of the Act had no application
                    (at [130] of <em>Neo Kok Eng (HC)</em>).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       Yeow appealed successfully against Lai J’s
                    decision. The Court of Appeal held, in <em>Yeow Chern Lean v Neo
                        Kok Eng</em> [2009] 3 SLR(R) 1131 (“<em>Neo Kok Eng (CA)</em>”), that Neo had no <em>locus standi</em> to bring the claim in Suit 136 because he
                    had already relinquished title to the three cheques in favour of CHHK; it was
                    thus for CHHK and not Neo to bring a claim against Yeow (at [39] of <em>Neo Kok Eng (CA)</em>). Pertinently, the Court of Appeal
                    observed at [52], <em>ibid</em>, that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">52    Neo’s
                            alternative claim for moneys had and received is contingent on him
                            proving his claim in conversion. It fails along with his inability to
                            prove the existence of the tort. This is so because Neo’s
                            alternative claim in restitution is premised on a ‘waiver of the
                            tort.’ The House of Lords has made it clear in United Australia v
                            Barclays Bank Ltd [1941] 1 AC 1 that the ‘waiver’
                            was really an election to take a gain-based rather than loss-based award
                            for the tort. In the absence of the tort, this claim in restitution
                            fails. As Viscount Simon LC explained (ibid at 18):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">When the claimant ‘waived the tort’ and brought assumpsit,
                            he did not thereby elect to be treated from that time forward on the
                            basis that no tort had been committed; indeed, if it were to be
                            understood that no tort had been committed, how could an action in
                            assumpsit lie? It lies only because the acquisition of the defendant is
                            wrongful and there is thus an obligation to make restitution. [emphasis
                            added]</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Since Neo’s claim for conversion is unsustainable, it follows that
                        his claim for restitution of the tort also fails. Simply put, he cannot
                        ‘waive the tort’ when there is no tort to waive in the first
                        place. In any event, as the cheques were issued as loans to the Company, if
                        any loss was suffered, it was on the part of the Company.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       Following this decision, CHHK, in its own name,
                    brought the current action against Yeow for moneys had and received under the
                    three cheques as well as for a declaration that the Property was held by Yeow on
                    trust for CHHK in the proportion that CHHK had contributed towards the purchase
                    and construction of the Property. The AR held that, since an action for
                    conversion of the Two Cheques was time-barred under s 6(1)(<em>a</em>) of the Act, CHHK’s claim for moneys had and
                    received in respect of the Two Cheques was doomed to fail and should therefore
                    be struck out.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The parties’ arguments</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       According to CHHK, the Act did not apply to its
                    claim at all because it was neither founded in tort nor in contract. CHHK argued
                    that its claim was not in conversion and therefore should not be subject to the
                    time bar of six years applicable to torts, relying on the case of <em>Chesworth v Farrar</em> [1967] 1 QB 407
                        (“<em>Chesworth</em>”). It also pointed
                    out that Lai J had considered and dismissed Yeow’s arguments on time
                    bar in Suit 136 (at [129]–[133] of <em>Neo Kok Eng
                        (HC)</em>), and that this point had not been overturned by the Court
                    of Appeal on appeal. Further, CHHK argued that because there was no contract
                    between the parties, the contractual time limit could not apply, as was the case
                    in <em>De Beers</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       Conversely, Yeow argued that CHHK’s claim
                    was doomed to fail because its alleged title to the Two Cheques was extinguished
                    upon the expiry of six years from the date of the first alleged conversion
                    pursuant to 7(2) of the Act. Moreover, Yeow argued that CHHK’s claim was
                    time barred under s 6(1)(<em>a</em>) of the Act
                    because the source or nature of the claim arose out of the tort of conversion
                    despite the characterisation of the claim as restitutionary. I should add that
                    no argument on laches was raised.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The law</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       This case requires an examination of the nature
                    of a claim for money had and received based on a conversion of cheques and how
                    it fits into the statutory limitation scheme. For that reason a brief summary of
                    the legal history is necessary before looking at the Act itself. Broadly
                    speaking, there are commonly understood to be two types of restitutionary
                    claims: restitution for autonomous unjust enrichment and restitution for wrongs
                    (see generally Andrew Burrows, <em>The Law of
                        Restitution</em> (Butterworths, 2nd Ed, 2002)
                    (“Burrows”) at p 25; Goff and Jones, <em>The
                        Law of Restitution</em> (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 7th Ed, 2007)
                    (“Goff and Jones”) at paras 1–092 to 1–095). The
                    former, autonomous unjust enrichment, occurs when the defendant has gained at
                    the expense of, or “in subtraction” from, the claimant. This
                    category of restitution is commonly concerned with payments made under a mistake
                    or an ineffective transaction. On the other hand, what the present case is
                    concerned with is the latter category, which is to provide the claimant
                    restitution of the benefits received by a wrongdoer from his wrongful acts, in
                    this case Yeow’s conversion of the Two Cheques. As Burrows puts it (at
                    p 26):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… the divide is between, on the one hand, where unjust enrichment
                        is the cause of action or event to which restitution responds and, on the
                        other hand, where a wrong is the cause of action or event to which
                        restitution responds.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">According to this definition, the claimant brings an action based on
                    the tort, but chooses a restitutionary remedy instead of the usual compensatory
                    remedy. The authors of Goff and Jones, however, note that judges often say that
                    “restitution for wrongs is concerned with reversing the defendant’s
                    unjust enrichment” (at para 1–011), suggesting that the cause
                    of action lies in the unjust enrichment of the wrongdoer and not in the wrong
                    suffered.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     Historically, in lieu of suing on a tort, a
                    claimant could “waive the tort” and choose instead bring a claim
                    for money had and received (see generally <em>United Australia,
                        Limited v Barclays Bank, Limited</em> [1941] AC 1
                        (“<em>United Australia</em>”) for a
                    comprehensive history). The doctrine arose from necessity. In England, there was
                    a time when an aggrieved person had to fit his claim within a specific form of
                    action, either in <em>indebitatus assumpsit</em> (the
                    precursor to a claim for money had and received) or an action for damages in
                    tort. A claim in <em>assumpsit</em> had to be premised on a
                    contract or debt between the parties. Therefore, to allow the aggrieved person
                    whose goods had been converted to sue in <em>assumpsit</em>, the courts created the legal fiction that a defendant who
                    improperly sold converted goods promised to repay the claimant the proceeds of
                    such a sale, thereby allowing the claimant to claim against the defendant in
                        <em>assumpsit</em>. (In form, this claim of <em>assumpsit</em>, and later the claim for money had and
                    received, became recognised as “quasi-contract”.) However, the
                    same claimant could not be allowed to go on to recover compensation for the tort
                    on top of the profits disgorged, and so it was said that a claimant who sued in
                        <em>assumpsit</em> had chosen to “waive the
                    tort” because under those circumstances the claimant could no longer
                    bring an action for damages for tort.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     In <em>United
                        Australia</em>, a company converted a cheque payable to the plaintiff
                    by encashing it with a bank. The plaintiff originally claimed against the
                    company for money had and received but discontinued the action without obtaining
                    final judgment. The issue before the House of Lords was whether the plaintiff
                    could later choose to proceed against the bank for conversion of the cheque
                    given that it had previously “waived the tort”. The House of Lords
                    held that the doctrine of waiver of tort meant nothing more than a choice
                    between possible remedies for the commission of what was at the heart of it a
                    tort. It did not mean that the plaintiff had chosen to ignore the existence of
                    the tortious act. Therefore the initiation of a claim for money had and received
                    which had not been pursued to judgment did not preclude an action in tort. As
                    noted above at <a href="#p1_5">[5]</a>, this interpretation was
                    adopted by the Court of Appeal (at [52] of <em>Neo Kok Eng
                        (CA)</em>).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     I turn now to the relevant provisions of the
                    Act, which state:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>Limitation of actions of contract and tort and certain
                            other actions</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">6. —(1) Subject to this Act, the following actions
                        shall not be brought after the expiration of 6 years from the date on which
                        the cause of action accrued:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(a) actions founded on a contract or on tort;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>Limitation in case of successive conversions and
                            extinction of title of owner of converted goods</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">7. —(1) Where any cause of action in respect of the conversion
                        or wrongful detention of a chattel has accrued to any person and before
                        he recovers possession of the chattel, a further conversion or wrongful
                        detention takes place, no action shall be brought in respect of the
                        further conversion or detention after the expiration of 6 years from
                        the accrual of the cause of action in respect of the original
                        conversion or detention.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(2) Where any such cause of action has accrued to any person and the
                        period prescribed for bringing that action and for bringing any action
                        in respect of such a further conversion or wrongful detention under
                        subsection (1) has expired and he has not during that period recovered
                        possession of the chattel, the title of that person to the chattel
                        shall be extinguished.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Quite clearly, there is no explicit reference to restitutionary claims
                    within s 6(1)(<em>a</em>). This has led to discussion
                    of the applicable limitation period, if any, for restitutionary claims such as
                    in the present action, <em>ie</em>, restitution for wrongs.
                    At first blush, a plain reading of s 6(1)(<em>a</em>)
                    suggests that a claim for money had and received arising from the commission of
                    a tort, in this case the alleged conversion of the Two Cheques, would fall
                    squarely within the definition of an action that is “founded” on a
                    tort. This was the view of the UK Law Commission Consultation Paper on <em>Limitation of Actions</em> (LCCP151), 1998, p 86 at
                    p 91, and of Burrows at 552. Denning J also expressed the view, albeit
                    as dicta, in <em>Beaman v A.R.T.S. Ltd</em> [1948]
                    2 All ER 89 at 92–93, that a claimant should not be able to
                    evade the statutory limitation period on conversion by choosing another
                    remedy.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     However, that was not the position taken in
                        <em>Chesworth</em>, where the court considered whether
                    a plaintiff’s claim for money had and received was a cause of action in
                    tort such that it was statutorily barred six months after the tortfeasor’s
                    demise (the old <em>actio personalis</em> rule). In that
                    case, the plaintiff had two claims: first, that her landlord had breached his
                    duty as bailee to take proper care of the plaintiff’s goods in the
                    landlord’s possession and; secondly, for money had and received by the
                    landlord for failing to account for the proceeds of other antiques belonging to
                    the plaintiff. The defendant argued that the latter claim was in substance a
                    cause of action in tort and was therefore statute-barred. Edmund Davies J
                    observed that while an action “found on tort” was not necessarily
                    “a cause of action in tort”, both expressions were to be
                    interpreted by looking at the substance of the matter. The learned judge further
                    accepted the decision of Bramwell LJ in <em>Bryant v
                        Herbert</em> (1878) 3 CPD 389 as establishing that the
                    “foundation of an action consists solely in those facts which are
                    necessary to be alleged and proved in order to maintain it” (<em>Chesworth</em> at 413–414). He further cited the cases
                    of <em>Jarvis v Moy, Davies, Smith, Vandervell &amp;
                        Co</em> [1936] 1 KB 399 and <em>Jackson v
                        Mayfair Window Cleaning Co Ltd</em> [1952] 1 All ER 215,
                    which established that an action was founded in tort, as opposed to contract,
                    when there was a breach of duty independent of the defendant’s contractual
                    obligations.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     Yet, though it was accepted that the plaintiff
                    had first to establish that a tort had been committed, Edmund Davies J
                    found that her claim for money had and received to recover proceeds from the
                    sale of the converted goods was in substance “analogous to one brought in
                    contract”, and therefore did not fall within the <em>actio
                        personalis</em> rule (<em>Chesworth</em> at
                    p 112). Instead, the learned judge observed, on the authority of <em>In re Diplock</em> [1948] Ch 465 at 514, that the contractual
                    limitation period ought to apply since the claim was one of quasi-contract.
                    Parenthetically, although the court analysed it assuming that the claim was
                    based on a conversion, that case could arguably be considered to have arisen
                    from a contract since the (wrongful) retention of the proceeds by the landlord
                    was ostensibly for rent arrears under the tenancy agreement; applying the
                    contractual time limit could possibly be justified on that ground.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     Subsequently, Hobhouse J in <em>Kleinwort Benson Ltd v Sandwell Borough Council</em>
                    [1994] All ER 890 (“<em>Sandwell</em>”) considered the question whether there was a
                    limitation period for a bank’s claim for money had and received to recover
                    payments made under an interest rate swap agreement which was later found to be
                    void. The learned judge held that the limitation period of six years for an
                    action “founded on simple contract” was “sufficiently
                    broad” to encompass a claim for money had and received because such a
                    claim was quasi-contractual (at 942–943). Hobhouse J considered the
                    Hansard report for the Limitation Act (UK) 1939 (upon which statute our own Act
                    was based, see <em>Hong Guet Eng v Wu Wai Hong</em> [2006]
                    2 SLR(R) 458 at [16]) in which it was made clear that the legislature
                    intended that the limitation period for “all actions founded in tort or
                    simple contract (including quasi-contract)” should be six years (at 955).
                    The decision was ultimately prompted, understandably, by the fear that there
                    would otherwise be no applicable limitation period.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     In Singapore, as far as I am aware, there is
                    no case that deals with the question of the limitation period applicable to
                    restitution for wrongs, although the issue has arisen with respect to unjust
                    enrichment by subtraction. In <em>Ching Mun Fong v Liu Cho
                        Chit</em> [2000] 3 SLR(R) 304 (“<em>Ching Mun Fong</em>”), moneys were paid out under an oral
                    contract for the purchase of a property. However, the seller was later found
                        <em>not</em> to have an interest in the property at
                    all, and the buyers sued for moneys had and received arising and total failure
                    of consideration. Woo Bih Li JC (<em>Ching Mun Fong</em> at
                    [73]) held that the claim for moneys had and received was time-barred because
                    the words “founded on a contract” in s 6(1)(<em>a</em>) of the Act were “wide enough to cover claims
                    for the recovery of moneys paid pursuant to a contract where the underlying
                    subject matter of the agreement did not exist or did not materialise”.
                    This decision was upheld by the Court of Appeal in <em>Ching Mun
                        Fong v Liu Cho Chit</em> [2001] 1 SLR(R) 856 at
                [27].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     
          <em>Ching Mun Fong</em>
                    was, however, distinguished in the more recent case of <em>De
                        Beers</em> (<a href="#p1_4">[4]</a> <em>supra</em>). In that case, the subsidiary proprietors
                    of a strata title property claimed that the management corporation had
                    unlawfully demanded and been unjustly enriched by two payments made as a
                    condition for its approval of certain conversion works by the subsidiary
                    proprietors. Prakash J held that unlike the situation in <em>Ching Mun Fong</em>, the subsidiary proprietor’s claim was for
                    restitution of payments made under a mistake of law, and no contract arose or
                    was capable of arising in the circumstances. The learned judge further
                    considered the House of Lords’ decision of <em>Kleinwort
                        Benson v Glasgow City Council</em> [1997] 3 WLR 923
                    (involving the same series of interest rate swap agreements as in <em>Sandwell</em> (<a href="#p1_15">[15]</a> <em>supra</em>) in which the question was whether a claim
                    in restitution was a “matter relating to a contract” for the
                    purpose of determining if the English or Scottish courts possessed jurisdiction
                    over the action. It was held that a claim for restitution of moneys paid under a
                    void contract was <em>not</em> a matter relating to
                    contract and therefore the English courts had no jurisdiction to entertain the
                    claim. On that basis, Prakash J found that the subsidiary
                    proprietors’ claim was not founded on a contract and was not time-barred
                    by virtue of s 6(1)(<em>a</em>) of the Act. However,
                    the decision of Hobhouse J in <em>Sandwell</em> was
                    not brought to the court’s attention. The learned judge therefore did not
                    have the opportunity to address the argument in <em>Sandwell</em> that the legislature intended for claims in money had
                    and received to be subjected to a six year limitation period. Instead,
                    Prakash J opined that until legislative intervention, there appeared to be
                    no applicable limitation period for restitutionary claims which had no grounding
                    in contract (<em>De Beers</em> at [77] and [79]). The
                    appeal against the decision was dismissed. The Court of Appeal (in <em>MCST Plan No 473 v De Beers Jewellery Pte Ltd</em>
                    [2002] 1 SLR(R) 418 at [32]) stated that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">A perusal of the Limitation Act showed that a claim for unjust enrichment
                        which was <em>neither grounded in contract nor
                            tort</em>, and in which equitable relief was not sought, did not
                        fall within the scope of the Act. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">It may therefore be inferred that there are claims for unjust
                    enrichment (<em>ie</em>, for money had and received) that
                        <em>are</em> grounded in tort, although the Court of
                    Appeal did not go further into explaining what exactly was meant by
                    “grounded” in contract or tort. (I am inclined to believe that the
                    Court of Appeal used the word “grounded” synonymously with the
                    word “founded” in this context.)</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     The views of learned academic commentators on
                    this issue are varied. Corbin, in his seminal article on the topic, <em>Waiver of Tort and Suit in Assumpsit</em>, (1909–1910)
                    19 Yale LJ, p 233, wrote (at pp 235–236):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In all cases where a tort is waived, there is in fact no contract. The
                        cause of action is a tort, and the tort exists as the cause of action and
                        must be proved as the cause of action from first to last. No trick or
                        legerdemain on the part of the plaintiff can change the tort into a
                        contract. Neither can the law do this. The law may allow new forms of
                        action, and may call things by new names, but it cannot turn a theft or
                        other conversion of goods into an innocent agreement to sell and to buy. The
                            <em>assumpsit</em> alleged in these cases is a mere
                        fiction and is not the cause of action … The fact that it has been
                        used to dodge the rule that a personal action dies with the person, or to
                        expand the right of set-off which the common law technically and
                        inconveniently limited, is no ground for using it to nullify a legislative
                        act based on sound public policy.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">This view was supported by Professor Burrows. According to Burrows
                        (<a href="#p1_9">[9]</a> <em>supra</em>), the court in <em>Chesworth</em> (<a href="#p1_7">[7]</a> <em>supra</em>) disregarded the statutory bar in respect of
                    restitution for a tort so as to evade the <em>actio
                        personalis</em> rule (see Burrows at 553). Prof Burrows went on to
                    opine that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">As a matter of policy, however, there is no good reason for the courts to
                        reject, in respect of restitution for a tort or breach of contract, the
                        modern six year time limit laid down for causes of action in tort or
                        contract. In particular, there is no other obvious time limit to which they
                        can turn. Nor is there any suggestion of this in the cases. Indeed, as we
                        have seen, the courts are only too anxious to force claims in unjust
                        enrichment by subtraction into the six year statutory bar. No such
                        distortion is needed here [in relation to restitution for torts]. It would
                        seem therefore that, whether taking the most natural or a purposive
                        construction, a six year time limit applies to restitution for a tort or
                        breach of contract.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     On the other hand, the authors of Goff and
                    Jones (<a href="#p1_9">[9]</a> <em>supra</em>) accept that claims for the restitution of
                    wrongs, being quasi-contractual, fall under the limitation period applicable to
                    contracts (at paras 36–013 and 43–017), although the authors take
                    the view that whether the same limitation period should apply to actions in tort
                    and in restitution may depend on the particular tort. According to them, while
                    the rationale of a limitation period for conversion lies in ensuring that
                    “title to a chattel be unencumbered from a previous theft” for the
                    sake of commerce and the protection of purchasers of goods, the unjust
                    enrichment of a defendant is a continuous wrong which does not end upon the
                    transfer of title. Further, the authors contend that accrual of the cause of
                    action lie in the receipt of proceeds by the defendant instead of, as in
                    conversion, the wrongful act (consistent with the authors’ stand that the
                    cause of action lies in unjust enrichment and not the wrongful act). Thus, the
                    authors conclude that in restitution the limitation period only begins to run
                    upon the tortfeasor’s receipt of the proceeds from the conversion (at
                    para 36–013).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     Similarly, in HM McLean’s article
                        <em>Limitation of Actions in Restitution</em>
                    (1989) CLJ 472, it was argued that where the restitution was merely a
                    “supplemental tortious remedy”, then the limitation period should
                    be that applicable to an action in tort; however, where the restitutionary claim
                    arose out of the tort of <em>conversion</em>, then it was
                    independent of the tort because “it [arose] on the defendant’s
                    receipt of a benefit (the proceeds of the sale) in circumstances (conversion)
                    which [made] it unjust that he should retain that benefit” (at
                    p 487).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">My decision</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     It is perhaps convenient to deal with
                    Yeow’s argument on s 7(2) of the Act first. The
                    “chattels” that were allegedly converted were the Two Cheques, and
                    not the proceeds thereof. While it may be accurate to state that CHHK could no
                    longer establish title to the Two Cheques after a period of six years, this was
                    beside the point since the relevant subject matter for the purposes of
                    CHHK’s claim was the monetary proceeds received by Yeow. In other words,
                    CHHK’s claim did not seek to recover title to the Two Cheques but rested
                    instead on establishing that Yeow had wrongfully converted the Two Cheques and
                    received the proceeds thereof. Whether this claim could be proceeded upon
                    depended not on s 7(2) but on s 6(1)(<em>a</em>)
                    of the Act.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     Next, with respect to s 6(1)(<em>a</em>) of the Act, CHHK’s claim would be time-barred
                    if it could be shown, as was the case in <em>Ching Mun
                        Fong</em> (<a href="#p1_16">[16]</a> <em>supra</em>), that there was a contract between the
                    parties or if the claim was one founded on tort. Since there was no suggestion
                    that there was any contract between the parties, only the interpretation of the
                    phrase “founded on tort” was in issue. What was the nature of
                    CHHK’s claim? The foundation of an action, as stated by
                    Bramwell LJ (above at <a href="#p1_13">[13]</a>), lay
                    in the facts necessary to be alleged and proved in order to maintain it. Here,
                    CHHK essentially had to prove that Yeow had converted the Two Cheques (see the
                    Court of Appeal’s observation in <em>Neo Kok Eng
                        (CA)</em> (<a href="#p1_5">[5]</a> <em>supra</em>) at [52]. From that perspective, the
                    foundation of CHHK’s restitutionary claim therefore lay in the conversion
                    of the Two Cheques. It would therefore be time-barred by virtue of
                        s 6(1)(<em>a</em>) of the Act. This approach was a
                    natural interpretation following the plain statutory language.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     CHHK’s reliance on <em>Chesworth</em> (<a href="#p1_7">[7]</a> <em>supra</em>) was misguided because it did not stand for
                    the proposition contended for by CHHK – that a claim for money had and
                    received was immune from any limitation period. Instead, the position in
                        <em>Chesworth</em> was either (a) the general
                    proposition that claims for money had and received fell within the limitation
                    period applicable to contract; or (b) the narrower one that, on the facts of the
                    case, the claim for money had and received was governed by the limitation period
                    applicable to contract. Neither position accords with that under Singapore law,
                    as decided in the <em>De Beers</em> case and the Court of
                    Appeal’s approval thereof. (However, even if I were to apply <em>Chesworth</em>, adopting the general position that the
                    correct limitation period is that applicable to a claim in contract,
                    CHHK’s claim would also be time-barred because the Two Cheques were
                    encashed more than six years before the claim was brought.)</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     As would have been obvious from the above, I
                    was not persuaded that <em>Chesworth</em> necessarily
                    precluded an interpretation that CHHK’s claim was one founded on tort for
                    the purposes of s 6(1)(<em>a</em>). As acknowledged by
                    Edmund Davies J, the phrase “cause of action in tort” did not
                    necessarily mean the same thing as the phrase “founded on tort”
                        (<em>Chesworth</em> at 41). It would appear to me that,
                    on a plain reading, the latter phrase had a wider scope than the former.
                    Moreover, it was suggested by Burrows that the result in <em>Chesworth</em> could have been prompted by the court’s desire
                    to circumvent the much-criticised <em>actio personalis</em>
                    rule then extant. The policy considerations behind circumventing this rule were
                    clearly not applicable in the context of a general limitation period, and the
                    decision did not suggest otherwise. It is undesirable, as a general principle,
                    that restitutionary claims should remain at large. Defendants should not have to
                    face the prospect of litigation indefinitely, and claimants should be encouraged
                    to settle their disputes timeously.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     Separately, in the light of the Court of
                    Appeal’s adoption of the position in <em>United
                        Australia</em> (<a href="#p1_10">[10]</a> <em>supra</em>) that what was meant by a waiver of tort was
                    essentially only a choice in <em>remedy</em>, it was clear
                    that restitution was regarded as a <em>response</em> to the
                    wrong (thus making it unnecessary to consider the alternative view taken in Goff
                    and Jones (<a href="#p1_9">[9]</a> <em>supra</em>) that the cause of action rested upon the
                    unjust enrichment of the defendant instead). Since the difference between
                    CHHK’s claim for money had and received, and an action in conversion lay
                    only in the remedy sought, it followed that CHHK’s claim should fall
                    within the same limitation period of six years under s 6(1)(<em>a</em>) of the Act as well. The claim for money had and
                    received arose out of the alleged conversion of the Two Cheques. Since CHHK was
                    barred from pursuing its claim under the tort of conversion, it was likewise
                    barred from its claim for money had and received founded on the tort since it
                    was in substance only a choice in remedy.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     Accordingly, I found that
                        s 6(1)(<em>a</em>) of the Act was sufficiently
                    broad to encompass CHHK’s claim for moneys had and received in respect of
                    the Two Cheques and that the AR was correct in striking out the claim on the
                    basis that it was doomed to fail.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     In the result, the appeal was dismissed. I
                    ordered that costs in the appeal were to be fixed at $7,000 to be paid by CHHK
                    to Yeow, and further that the costs order below was to stand.</p>
