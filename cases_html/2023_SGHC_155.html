The accused was the Victim’s stepfather. I acquitted the accused of the Murder Charge and substituted it with a conviction for voluntarily causing grievous hurt under s 325 of the Penal Code. After hearing the Prosecution’s and Defence’s sentencing submissions, I sentenced the accused to nine years’ imprisonment and 12 strokes of the cane, with two other charges respectively under s 324 of the Penal Code and s 5(1) of the Children and Young Persons Act (Cap 38, 2001 Rev Ed) (“the CYPA”) taken into consideration.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 The Prosecution has appealed against my decision to acquit the accused as well as my decision on sentence, and the Defence has also appealed against my decision on sentence.

The accused was the Victim’s stepfather. The Victim’s mother (“M”) married the accused in 2016. At that time, the Victim was two years old. The accused and M also had two biological children, namely two twin boys who were born in November 2016 (“the Twins”). At the material time of the offence, the Victim lived in a rental flat (“the Flat”) together with the accused, M and the Twins.

M only returned home that evening at about 8.00pm. The Prosecution’s case was that the events giving rise to the Murder Charge took place during this period while the Victim and the Twins were left in the care of the accused.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">6 At about 10.00am that day, the accused noticed a puddle of urine outside the toilet of the Flat. The accused became angry because he thought that the Victim, who had already been toilet-trained, was misbehaving. The accused called the Victim over to the toilet and placed her on the toilet bowl. It was not in dispute that the accused, after having placed the Victim on the toilet bowl, applied some force on the Victim’s abdomen with his knuckles. What was in dispute was whether the force applied by the accused on the Victim’s abdomen consisted of punches, as alleged by the Prosecution, or mere nudges to stop the Victim from getting off the toilet bowl, as alleged by the Defence. After this incident at 10.00am, the accused exited the toilet and left the Victim there alone.

</div> Nothing untoward happened after that incident.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">7 Later that same day, at about 3.00pm, the Victim indicated to the accused that she wanted to go to the toilet. The accused asked the Victim to go to the toilet to urinate on her own. The Victim went into the toilet and came out a while later. After the Victim came out of the toilet, the accused went into the toilet and saw that the Victim had again urinated on the floor in front of the toilet bowl. The accused became angry and called the Victim over. He questioned the Victim about the urine on the floor. The accused then pushed the Victim on the left shoulder, causing her to fall sideways on the ground. Then, while the Victim was lying on her side on the ground, the accused kicked the Victim’s abdomen twice with his right leg while barefoot. This part of the 3.00pm incident was undisputed as the accused admitted to pushing the Victim and kicking her abdomen twice during that incident.

Again, it was not in dispute that, after the accused placed the Victim on the toilet bowl, he applied force on the Victim’s abdomen with his knuckles a few times. However, just as in the case of the 10.00am incident, there was a dispute as to whether the force applied consisted of punches or nudges.

The accused testified that, as he was applying ointment on the Victim’s abdomen, he noticed that the Victim’s face twitched when he pressed on her right abdominal area. The accused then pressed lightly on the other parts of the Victim’s abdominal area and asked her if it was painful.

The accused noticed that the Victim had difficulty vomiting so he used his index finger to ease her vomit. The Victim then vomited and became unconscious. The accused carried the Victim out of the toilet and informed M that she was no longer breathing and asked M to call for an ambulance.

It argued that the intra-abdominal injuries as found on the Victim were intentionally inflicted by the accused, as was evident from the manner in which he landed fist blows on the Victim’s stomach (during both the 10.00am and 3.00pm incidents) and also kicked the Victim’s stomach twice (during the 3.00pm incident). It argued that the evidence before the court showed that the intra-abdominal injuries were sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The Defence’s case</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">22 As I have mentioned earlier, the Defence’s position was that the contact between the accused’s knuckles and the Victim’s abdomen during both the 10.00am and 3.00pm incidents were not forceful and had been mere nudges. Thus, the Defence’s case was that those actions were not a cause of the intra-abdominal injuries found on the Victim.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">23 It was also the Defence’s case that there had been other contributory causes to the intra-abdominal injuries that were not attributable to the accused. These included: (a) an incident where the Twins bounced on the Victim’s abdomen a few times, which took place at around 7.00pm on 1 September 2018; (b) the intra-abdominal pressure caused by the Victim’s vomiting in the night of 1 September 2018 and in the early hours of 2 September 2018; and (c) the accused’s application of CPR erroneously on the Victim’s abdomen. The Defence’s case was that each of these were sources of blunt force trauma on the Victim’s abdomen, and they were contributory causes to the intra-abdominal injuries.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 The Defence argued that the “bodily injury” identified for the purposes of an offence under s 300(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the Penal Code and to which the test in <span class="font-italic">Virsa Singh v State of Punjab </span>AIR 1958 SC 465 (“<span class="font-italic">Virsa Singh</span>”) is to be applied must be the injury that had actually been inflicted by the accused, and not any injury that is found on the victim at the time of his or her death; in other words, the “bodily injury” referred to in the <span class="font-italic">Virsa Singh </span>test must be an injury attributable to the actions of the accused. The <span class="font-italic">Virsa Singh </span>test sets out the elements that must be proven for an offence under s 300(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the Penal Code and has been consistently endorsed by the Court of Appeal as part of Singapore law. Thus, the Defence argued, because the Prosecution had not led evidence on the precise extent of contribution by each of these sources of blunt force trauma to the intra-abdominal injuries on the Victim, it was not possible to ascertain <span class="font-italic">the extent to which</span> the intra-abdominal injuries were caused by the accused’s kicks during the 3.00pm incident. This gave rise to a reasonable doubt that the accused caused the entirety of the intra-abdominal injuries found on the Victim and as described in the Autopsy Report.

</div> The Defence submitted, relying on the decision of the High Court in <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v AFR </span>[2011] 3 SLR 653 (“<span class="font-italic">AFR</span>”), that an accused person can only be found to have intended a bodily injury on the victim if it is to some extent foreseeable that such an injury would have resulted from his actions. The ease with which this requirement of foreseeability would be satisfied depends on the actions by which the injury was caused. In this case, given that the intra-abdominal injuries were inflicted by two kicks in succession, injuries of a severity like the intra-abdominal injuries would not have been a foreseeable result at all, and so it could not be said that the accused had intended to cause the intra-abdominal injuries found on the Victim.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Second, there was a reasonable doubt as to whether the intra-abdominal injuries were sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death.

</div> In this regard, the Defence relied on medical literature that it had adduced as evidence in the course of trial and also evidence of the Prosecution’s witnesses which stated that death did not inevitably follow from what it referred to as a “Class II haemorrhage injury”, that is, one involving the loss by a person of 15% to 30% of his circulating blood volume. Given that the intra-abdominal injuries caused the Victim to lose 300ml of blood, which was about 30% of her circulating blood volume, this was a Class II haemorrhage injury, from which death did not inevitably result.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The issues</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 From the foregoing outline of the parties’ cases, four broad issues arose for determination: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Whether the force applied by the accused during the 10.00am incident and the 3.00pm incident consisted of fist blows or nudges.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) In the case of an offence under s 300(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the Penal Code where there are multiple contributory causes to the injury that resulted in the victim’s death, how is the “bodily injury” for the purposes of the <span class="font-italic">Virsa Singh </span>test to be identified?

He interpreted this as her being fearful of falling into the toilet bowl, as her body was small compared to the size of the toilet bowl. He did not observe any expression of pain from her. In relation to the 3.00pm incident, the accused testified that, after he had kicked the Victim twice, he carried her to sit on the toilet bowl.

In any event, even if I were to accept ASP Mahathir’s evidence that the accused had indeed used the word “punch” in the 3 September 2018 statement, I did not think this displaces the overall weight of the evidence in favour of the accused’s account that he had nudged rather than punched the Victim.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 In my judgment, the accused would not have punched or “forcefully hit” the Victim’s abdomen. I accepted the accused’s evidence that he exerted just enough force to prevent the Victim from getting up from the toilet bowl.

</div> Given the size and strength disparity between the accused and the Victim, it would not have taken very significant force for the accused to prevent the Victim from getting off the toilet bowl. Importantly, the Victim, who was small enough to be at risk of falling into the opening of the toilet bowl, was precariously gripping on to the sides of the toilet bowl while she was sitting on it.

</div>
</div> This concern is unfounded. It conflates the cause of the <span class="font-italic">bodily injury</span> to which the <span class="font-italic">Virsa Singh </span>test is to be applied with the cause of <span class="font-italic">death</span>. A bodily injury forming the subject matter of a s 300(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) offence need not be the sole cause of death for it to pass the <span class="font-italic">Virsa Singh </span>test. It only needs to be intentionally inflicted by the accused (third element) and sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death (fourth element). Whether the act of the accused (in inflicting the bodily injury) is the cause of death is a matter to be resolved by reference to the usual rules concerning causation in criminal law.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 The point that causation of death is not a matter dealt with by the <span class="font-italic">Virsa Singh </span>test was also noted in <span class="font-italic">Toh Sia Guan</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>([37] above), where the court observed at [48]<span class="font-italic"> </span>that neither the <span class="font-italic">actus reus </span>requirement nor the causation requirement were mentioned in the <span class="font-italic">Virsa Singh </span>test. To understand this observation, it is useful to refer to the structure of the relevant statutory provisions, which I reproduce below (with the words which are not relevant to the present analysis omitted): </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">299. Whoever <span class="font-italic">causes death by doing an act</span> … with the intention of causing such bodily injury as is likely to cause death … commits the offence of culpable homicide.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">300. … culpable homicide is murder —</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) if the <span class="font-italic">act by which death is caused</span> is done …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) if it <span class="font-italic">is done with</span> <span class="font-italic">the intention of causing bodily injury</span> to any person, and the <span class="font-italic">bodily injury intended to be inflicted</span> is sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death; … </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 The structure here is that s 299 of the Penal Code defines culpable homicide (and defines it in terms of “caus[ing] death by doing an act”) while s 300 provides that culpable homicide <span class="font-italic">is</span> murder “if the act by which death is caused” is done with certain types of intention (or knowledge in the case of limb (<span class="font-italic">d</span>) of s 300). In this structure, s 300 is concerned only with the <span class="font-italic">mens rea</span> of murder while the <span class="font-italic">actus reus </span>of murder is defined in s 299. The <span class="font-italic">actus reus </span>of culpable homicide and murder are the same – causing death by doing an act. It is the difference in <span class="font-italic">mens rea </span>which turns culpable homicide into murder. In this structure, the causation requirement is also provided in s 299 by the phrase “causes death by doing an act” – <span class="font-italic">ie,</span> the death must have been caused by an act done by the accused.  Within this structure, the <span class="font-italic">Virsa Singh </span>test explains how the words of s 300(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) are to be applied. Since s 300 (and in turn, the words of s 300(<span class="font-italic">c</span>)) are concerned only with the <span class="font-italic">mens rea </span>of murder, the <span class="font-italic">Virsa Singh </span>test is a test for determining <span class="font-italic">mens rea</span>. In fact, the decision in <span class="font-italic">Virsa Singh</span> was entirely about the nature of the intention required by s 300(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the Penal Code. For these reasons, I agree with the observation in <span class="font-italic">Toh Sia Guan </span>that neither the <span class="font-italic">actus reus </span>requirement nor the causation requirement were mentioned in the <span class="font-italic">Virsa Singh </span>test.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The </span>Virsa Singh<span class="font-italic"> </span><span class="font-italic">test requires identification of the injury actually inflicted by the accused</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 I begin this part of my analysis by reciting the elements of the <span class="font-italic">Virsa Singh </span>test.

The second element requires ascertainment of the nature of the said bodily injury. The third element asks whether the bodily injury identified pursuant to the first two elements was intentionally inflicted. The fourth element asks whether the bodily injury identified pursuant to the first three elements is sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 It goes without saying that, when the third element asks whether the “bodily injury in question” is intentionally inflicted, that phrase can only refer to an injury <span class="font-italic">inflicted by the accused</span> and not an injury inflicted by someone else (assuming, for simplicity, that cases involving s 34 of the Penal Code are excluded from the scope of the present discussion). It would make no logical sense to ask whether a particular bodily injury was intentionally inflicted <span class="font-italic">by the accused</span> if that bodily injury was not inflicted by the accused in the first place. What this means is that, for the <span class="font-italic">Virsa Singh </span>test to be properly applied in accordance with how the test was actually formulated in the <span class="font-italic">Virsa Singh </span>case, the court would, in a case involving multiple injuries or multiple causes to an injury, need to identify and isolate the injury actually inflicted by the accused.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 In this regard, the decision of the High Court in <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v Phuah Siew Yen </span>(1991) 3 CLAS News 30 (“<span class="font-italic">Phuah Siew Yen</span>”)<span class="font-italic"> </span>is instructive. In that case, the accused person strangled the victim with a sash while sitting on her chest. The strangulation resulted in congestion and petechiae haemorrhage <span class="font-italic">above</span> the ligature mark around the victim’s neck. The forensic pathologist certified the cause of death as asphyxia by strangulation, and he was of the view that, from the nature of the injury, force would have been applied at the victim’s neck for at least two minutes. Congestion and petechiae haemorrhage were also observed <span class="font-italic">below </span>the ligature mark around the victim’s neck. The forensic pathologist agreed that this could have been caused by the weight of the accused’s body when the accused sat on the victim’s chest, and so there was also an element of traumatic asphyxia as a result of the accused’s body weight on the victim’s chest in addition to the strangulation. Although the forensic pathologist denied that the traumatic asphyxia contributed to the death, he conceded that it could have “augmented the strangulation”, meaning that the time taken for death to occur could be lesser than two minutes due to such augmentation. The defence’s forensic pathologist, on the other hand, gave the cause of death as “asphyxia by strangulation associated with some degree of traumatic asphyxia”. The defence’s forensic pathologist also testified that the absence of a ligature mark in an area below the victim’s left ear as recorded in the post-mortem report showed that the pressure applied by the accused had not been tight enough to completely stop venous return, to which the prosecution’s forensic pathologist disagreed.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 The court held: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… The bodily injury that [the accused] intended to inflict was the strangulation at the neck. It is clear that when [the accused] sat on the chest of the deceased, it was not [his] intention to inflict any injury on her by so sitting. <span class="font-italic">The medical evidence, however, is that the strangulation of the neck was augmented by the pressure on the chest as a result of [the accused] sitting on the chest. It must, therefore, remain in doubt whether the bodily injury </span><span class="font-italic">[the accused] intended to inflict (i.e. the strangulation at the neck) would in this case be sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death</span>. We have in mind the evidence of both pathologists on this issue. We also accept the evidence of [the Defence’s forensic pathologist] that the absence of any internal injuries in the neck and the absence of the blanche mark below the left ear indicates that the pressure applied was not sufficiently severe.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Accordingly, we find that the Prosecution has not established a case under limb (<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of Section 300.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added] </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 In <span class="font-italic">Phuah Siew Yen</span>, the fatal injury was a combination of: (a) asphyxia arising from the manual strangulation; and (b) traumatic asphyxia arising from the accused’s body weight exerted on the victim’s chest. The court held that the injury which the accused intended to inflict was the manual strangulation of the victim’s neck (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the first of the two causes), implying that this injury to the neck, rather than the totality of the fatal injury found on the victim, was the relevant “bodily injury” referred to in s 300(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the Penal Code. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The specific scenario posed by the Defence cannot be side-stepped by looking to the “substantial cause test” instead of the </span>Virsa Singh <span class="font-italic">test</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 A requirement that the court identifies the injury actually inflicted by the accused poses no difficulties in most cases. For example, in <span class="font-italic">Phuah Siew Yen</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>([46] above), the court had no difficulty isolating the injury caused to the neck from the injury caused to the chest in its analysis, because the two injuries were inflicted on different parts of the deceased’s body. However, one could imagine a scenario where, after the accused had inflicted an injury on a part of the deceased’s body, further injuries were inflicted on <span class="font-italic">exactly </span><span class="font-italic">the same part of the body</span> by other persons or other causes, such that it was not possible during autopsy to identify and isolate the injury inflicted by the accused from the injuries caused to the same part of the body by other causes. This is the scenario which the Defence posited when making the submission alluded to at [37] above. While I accept that, in such a scenario, there would be practical difficulties with applying the <span class="font-italic">Virsa Singh </span>test in accordance with how the test was actually formulated in the <span class="font-italic">Virsa Singh </span>case, I do not agree with the Prosecution that the application of the “substantial cause test” in such a scenario would be free from similar difficulties.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 This may be illustrated by considering the authorities concerning the “substantial cause test” cited by the Prosecution. In <span class="font-italic">R v Smith </span>[1959] 2 QB 35, the deceased received a stab wound in the chest which pierced his lung, and was then given incorrect treatment in the hospital which impeded his chances of recovery. In <span class="font-italic">Shaiful Edham</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>([38] above), after stabbing the deceased in the neck, the accused threw the deceased into a canal thinking that she was already dead. The certified cause of death was “multiple incised wounds on neck and drowning”. In <span class="font-italic">Murugan a/al Arumugam v Public Prosecutor </span>[2013] 3 MLJ 345, the deceased suffered spinal injury as a result of being violently assaulted by the accused and then died in the hospital after developing septicaemia. The certified cause of death was “spinal injury due to blunt force trauma with septicaemia due to right leg ulcer”. In <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v Chan Lie San </span>[2017] SGHC 205, the deceased died in the hospital from pneumonia after receiving severe head injuries from the accused. The certified cause of death was “bronchopneumonia following multiple fractures of the skull”. In each of these cases, the court had no difficulty applying the “substantial cause test” by asking whether the injury inflicted by the accused remained an operating and substantial cause <span class="font-italic">because the court had no difficulty identifying the injury actually inflicted by the accused</span>. Conversely, in the scenario painted by the Defence, where it is not possible to say what injury was actually inflicted by the accused, it is difficult to see how the court could meaningfully embark on an inquiry into whether the injury inflicted by the accused, which remained unidentified and unidentifiable, was an operating and substantial cause of death.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 The Prosecution also cited <span class="font-italic">Guay Seng Tiong Nickson v Public Prosecutor </span>[2016] 3 SLR 1079 (“<span class="font-italic">Nickson Guay</span>”), a case concerning causing death by negligent act, where the deceased was a child who died from head injuries sustained in a traffic accident between the car driven by the accused and the car driven by the deceased’s father. The issue in that case was whether the failure of the deceased’s parents to properly secure the deceased in an approved child restraint may be considered as a mitigating factor in sentencing. The issue of causation did not arise for decision in that case as the accused did not dispute causation. More importantly, that case involved only one set of injuries – <span class="font-italic">ie,</span> the injuries sustained in the traffic accident. It was not a case concerning multiple injuries being caused to the same part of the body at different times.<span class="font-italic"> </span>As such, the citation of <span class="font-italic">Nickson Guay </span>does not add to the analysis at [49]–[50] above.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Conclusion on the problem of a fatal injury arising from multiple causes </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 In the light of the foregoing, I do not agree with the Prosecution that the Defence’s submission should be dismissed simply as an attempt to argue that the bodily injury inflicted by an accused has to be the sole cause of death.

The two tests govern different matters, even though their application may be affected in a similar way in certain factual scenarios.

</div> Given the finding of fact I made (at [61] below) that the contributory effect of the three incidents referred to at [23] above would have been negligible, this is not a question which arose for decision in the present case. Perhaps the answer to this submission could lie in evaluating the facts against other limbs of s 300 of the Penal Code instead of s 300(<span class="font-italic">c</span>), or perhaps it could lie in revisiting the <span class="font-italic">Virsa Singh</span> test as had been suggested in some academic commentary (see <span class="font-italic">eg</span>, Jordan Tan Zhengxian, “Murder Misunderstood: Fundamental Errors in Singapore, Malaysia and India’s Locus Classicus on Section 300(c) Murder [2012] 1 SJLS 112).

As set out at [43] above, to make out a charge under s 300(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the Penal Code, the Prosecution must prove beyond reasonable doubt the following elements of the <span class="font-italic">Virsa Singh </span>test : </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) a bodily injury must be present and objectively proved;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) the nature of the injury must be objectively proved;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) it must be established that the bodily injury in question had been intentionally inflicted; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) the bodily injury in question must be sufficient to cause death in the ordinary course of nature.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">First and second elements: Presence and nature of bodily injury</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 In a typical case, the first element of the <span class="font-italic">Virsa Singh </span>test involves merely ascertaining that a bodily injury was caused and present on the victim, and the second element involves an inquiry into the type and extent of the injury.

Following what I have set out earlier (see [52] above), it is necessary in such a case to inquire whether there were indeed other contributory causes of the intra-abdominal injuries and, if so, identify the “bodily injury” to which the elements of the <span class="font-italic">Virsa Singh </span>test is to be applied.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 It was not in dispute that the mechanism by which the intra-abdominal injuries were caused by blunt force trauma to the Victim’s abdomen (see [16] above).

Dr Lau therefore surmised that very considerable force must have been applied to the Victim’s abdomen to have caused such extensive disruption of the greater omentum.

</div> The Defence did not put any questions concerning this issue to Dr Lau. However, given the nature of the experts’ answers on the significance of the Twins bouncing on the Victim’s abdomen and the alleged misapplication of CPR by the accused, I do not see how any contributory effect by the Victim’s vomiting to the intra-abdominal injuries would have been anything but negligible.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 More importantly, unlike the other two incidents, the Victim’s vomiting was a natural symptom and consequence of the injuries inflicted by the accused’s kicks, which therefore could not be regarded as independent causes to the Victim’s intra-abdominal injuries.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Conclusion on the first and second elements</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 For the reasons above, in my judgment, the other sources of blunt force trauma on the Victim’s abdomen as alleged by the Defence had negligible contributory effect to the intra-abdominal injuries and I excluded them as causes of the intra-abdominal injuries. In other words, the entirety of the intra-abdominal injuries as identified and described in the Autopsy Report were attributable to the accused, and that is the “bodily injury” to which the third and fourth elements of the <span class="font-italic">Virsa Singh </span>test were to be applied.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Third element: Intention to inflict the bodily injury caused</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 For the third element of the <span class="font-italic">Virsa Singh </span>test, what needs to be proved is the subjective intention of the accused to cause the bodily injury that is present on the victim. The third element will not be satisfied if the injury was accidental or unintended, or if the accused had intended some other kind of injury (see <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v Lim Poh Lye and another </span>[2005] 4 SLR(R) 582 (“<span class="font-italic">Lim Poh Lye</span>”) at [22]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">71 The inquiry into the accused’s intention proceeds on broad lines. It extends to asking whether there was intention to strike the part of the body where the injury was found, and whether there was intention to strike with sufficient force to cause the kind of injury found to be present (see <span class="font-italic">Virsa Singh </span>at [21]). However, it does not extend to asking whether the accused intended an injury of a particular degree of seriousness. Thus, so long as the accused intended the injury which he inflicted on the victim, it is irrelevant whether the accused knew of the seriousness of the injury he inflicted, or if he did not intend the injury to be as serious as it turned out to be (see <span class="font-italic">Lim Poh Lye </span>at [23] and [37]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">72 The accused’s subjective intention is also to be ascertained or inferred from the objective facts and evidence. Thus, in practice, where it is proved that an injury was inflicted and that the accused inflicted it, the natural inference would be that the accused intended to inflict the injury, unless the evidence or the circumstances warrant an opposite conclusion (see <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v Boh Soon Ho </span>[2020] SGHC 58<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [45(e)]).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Whether the accused intended to cause the intra-abdominal injuries when he kicked the Victim’s abdomen twice during the 3.00pm incident</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">73 The accused’s evidence was that he had been very angry during the 3.00pm incident on 1 September 2018 as he saw the Victim urinate on the floor again despite his earlier instruction to the Victim during the 10.00am incident to not urinate on the floor.

</div> I accepted the accused’s evidence on this and found that he had inflicted the two kicks in quick succession, spontaneously as he was “carried away” by his anger towards the Victim, meaning that he did not kick the Victim with the intention to strike the part of the Victim’s body where the intra-abdominal injuries were later found, and he also did not have the intention to strike with sufficient force to cause the sort of injuries that eventually came to be found on the Victim when he inflicted the kicks. This is so for two reasons.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">75 First, the 3.00pm incident had been entirely unpremeditated and it had been triggered by the Victim’s act of urinating on the floor which resulted in the accused losing his temper. The accused’s first response was to push the Victim, but there was no evidence showing that the accused had done so in order that he could target a specific part of the Victim’s body when he later inflicted the kicks. The accused’s kicks eventually landed on the Victim’s abdomen because that was the part of the Victim’s body that happened to be directly in front of the accused’s right foot after the Victim fell down. I therefore found that the accused did not have the intention, at the time when he inflicted the kicks, to strike at the Victim’s abdomen. Second, the entire sequence of events (starting from when the accused first summoned the Victim to the toilet until the Victim was pushed on the floor and then kicked) happened so quickly that I found that the accused could not have formed the intention there and then to strike at any part of the Victim’s body with sufficient force as to cause the intra-abdominal injuries that she came to sustain, especially since the incident was a result of the accused’s spontaneous response after he got angry with the Victim’s act of urinating on the floor and then not giving any answers when questioned by the accused.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">76 I also found it significant that, in the evening of 1 September 2018 when the accused applied some ointment on the Victim’s stomach after she started vomiting, the accused said he “noticed” the Victim’s face twitched when he rubbed her right abdominal area, and he then proceeded to press several other spots on the Victim’s right, left and upper abdominal area and asked the Victim if it was painful (see [9] above).

</div> Presumably, this would have also applied to the second occasion when he applied ointment for the Victim and asked her where in her abdominal area she felt pain.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">77 The accused would obviously have remembered after the event that he kicked the Victim in the general area of her abdomen, and indeed he was candid with this fact across all his statements and in his testimony in court. It was therefore unsurprising and logical that the accused knew that the Victim would have felt pain in her abdomen as a result of his kicks. What was significant, however, was that the accused asked the Victim where exactly on her abdomen she felt pain when he applied ointment for her on the second occasion. This showed that the accused did not know where exactly his kicks had landed, and that both kicks were a spontaneous reaction by the accused to his anger.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Conclusion on the third element </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">78 Therefore, in my judgment, although both of the accused’s kicks on the Victim’s abdomen had been intentional (in the sense that they were voluntary), he did not intend to cause the intra-abdominal injuries found on the Victim because those kicks were a spontaneous response as a result of his anger and they were inflicted not with any intention to strike at any part of the Victim’s body nor with the intention to strike with sufficient force to cause the intra-abdominal injuries that the Victim came to sustain.

First, I note that that the accused in his 3 September 2018 statement recorded by ASP Mahathir stated that his kicks had been “targeted” at the Victim’s stomach.

</div> ASP Mahathir’s testimony on this point was not challenged in cross-examination.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">81 In the circumstances, I accepted ASP Mahathir’s evidence and found that the accused had said the word “targeted” when giving his statement on 3 September 2018. However, I did not find the accused’s use of the word “targeted” in the 3 September 2018 statement significant, as the term never appeared again in any of the subsequent statements given by the accused to ASP Violet Toh (see [33] above). The fact remains that the accused only <span class="font-italic">happened</span> to kick the Victim’s abdomen because, after the Victim fell onto the ground, her abdomen came to be the part of her body that was closest to the accused’s right foot after the fall. In other words, the accused ended up kicking the Victim’s abdomen because she fell in the way she did. Those circumstances militate against the accused having deliberately targeted the Victim’s abdomen by his kicks. Having observed and considered the demeanour of the accused, I was satisfied that he was a credible witness and I preferred his oral evidence that he had not targeted any part of the Victim’s body when he kicked the Victim and only kicked the Victim’s abdomen because that was the part of her body closest to his right foot. This was also consistent with the account he gave about the kicks in his police statement recorded on 13 September 2018 which was not long after the 3 September 2018 statement was recorded.

</div> In this regard, the Prosecution submitted that a person should be regarded as intending the ordinary and natural consequences of his act. On its face, this submission accorded with the following principle articulated in <span class="font-italic">Virsa Singh </span>at [16]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The question is not whether the prisoner intended to inflict a serious injury or a trivial one but whether he intended to inflict the injury that is proved to be present. If he can show that he did not, or if the totality of the circumstances justify such an inference, then, of course, the intent that the section requires is not proved. But if there is nothing beyond the injury and the fact that the appellant inflicted it, the only possible inference is that he intended to inflict it.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">Therefore, the inquiry is whether the totality of the circumstances justify an inference that the accused lacked the requisite intention. In my judgment, although the accused had kicked the Victim with considerable force, the evidence showed that he had kicked the Victim spontaneously and without targeting the Victim’s abdomen. Also, since the kicks were a spontaneous response by the accused as a result of his anger, the fact that considerable force had been used was simply an unfortunate consequence of his anger at that time, rather than a result of him intending to strike the Victim’s abdomen with sufficient force to cause the sort of injuries found on the Victim. I therefore found the present case to be one where the totality of the circumstances justified the inference that the accused lacked the requisite intention.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Fourth element: Whether the bodily injury was sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">83 On the basis of my conclusion on the third element, I acquitted the accused of the Murder Charge. For completeness, however, I set out my views on whether the fourth element of the <span class="font-italic">Virsa Singh </span>test had been satisfied in this case.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">84 The question of whether the bodily injury is sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death is an objective inquiry into the character of the injury. An injury which is “sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death” is one which carries a high probability of death in the ordinary course of nature (see <span class="font-italic">Wang Wenfeng</span><span class="font-italic"> v</span> <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor </span>[2012] 4 SLR 590 at [33]). It does not import a requirement that the said injury must inevitably and in all circumstances cause death (see In re <span class="font-italic">Singaram Padayachi and others </span>(1944) AIR Mad 223 (“<span class="font-italic">Singaram</span>”) at 225). Also, the probability of death is to be determined without reference to the availability of timely medical intervention or the possibility that the victim may have survived if medical treatment had been rendered (see <span class="font-italic">Singaram </span>at 225).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">85 In this case, the intra-abdominal injuries caused death as a result of the internal bleeding within the abdomen (or haemoperitoneum). The amount of blood measured in the Victim’s abdomen during the autopsy by Dr Lau was 300ml. Dr Lau testified that, on the basis that there is approximately 80ml of circulating blood for every kilogram of body weight in the human body, the Victim (who weighed 12kg at the time of her death) would have had approximately 960ml or 1 litre of circulating blood volume. The loss of even 10% of one’s circulating blood volume is already life-threatening

First, the medical literature which the Defence relied on was an extract from a textbook on emergency medicine titled <span class="font-italic">Advanced Trauma Life Support</span>. It described Class II haemorrhage as “uncomplicated hemorrhage for which crystalloid fluid <span class="font-italic">resuscitation is required</span>” [emphasis added]. Both Dr Dios and Dr Loh testified that the Classification System was meant to guide doctors in an emergency setting on allocation of resources.

</div> Seen in this light, it was clear that, when Dr Koh and Dr Dios said that death does not inevitably follow from Class II haemorrhage, what they meant was that death would not follow if there were timely medical intervention. Since the law requires probability of death to be determined without reference to the availability of timely medical intervention, the Classification System did not assist the Defence at all.

</div> These were:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) a charge of voluntarily causing hurt to the Victim by means of a heated substance under s 324 of the Penal Code arising from an incident sometime between July and October 2017 when the accused intentionally scalded the Victim with hot water while bathing her (“the VCH Charge”).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) a charge of child abuse under s 5(1) of the CYPA arising from an incident sometime between January and April 2018 when the accused ill-treated the Victim by slamming her head against the floor (“the CYPA Charge”).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">94 As the Court of Appeal explained in <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v BDB </span>[2018] 1 SLR 127 (“<span class="font-italic">BDB</span>”) at [55], the primary sentencing objective in offences under s 325 of the Penal Code is deterrence, and retribution may also be relevant as a sentencing consideration where heinous violence has been inflicted. The Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">BDB </span>at [55]-[56] also set out the sentencing approach for s 325 offences, which involves a two-step process. First, the court identifies the indicative starting point for sentencing by reference to the seriousness of the injury caused. In a case where the grievous hurt takes the form of death (as is also the case here), the indicative starting point should be a term of imprisonment of around eight years. Second, after the indicative starting point has been identified, the court then considers the necessary adjustments upwards or downwards based on an assessment of the offender’s culpability and the presence of relevant aggravating and/or mitigating factors, a non-exhaustive list of which was identified by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">BDB </span>at [62] and [71] as follows.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The aggravating factors include: (i) the extent of deliberation or premeditation; (ii) the manner and duration of the attack; (iii) the victim’s vulnerability; (iv) the use of any weapon; (v) whether the attack was undertaken by a group; (vi) any relevant antecedents on the offender’s part; and (vii) any prior intervention by the authorities.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The mitigating factors include: (i) the offender’s mental condition; (ii) the offender’s genuine remorse; and (iii) the offender’s personal or social problems.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">95 In <span class="font-italic">BDB </span>at [60], the Court of Appeal held that death is generally the most serious consequence of any offence and may warrant the imposition of the maximum sentence in appropriate cases. The court emphasised that, where death results from the infliction of severe physical violence on a young victim, this would warrant a sentence close to the statutory maximum. However, the court also reiterated at [61] that each case must be assessed based on its own particular factors and the sentencing framework was not meant to be rigidly applied.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">96 An offender under s 325 of the Penal Code may also be liable to caning in addition to a sentence of imprisonment. The Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">BDB</span> held at [76] that, where violence has been inflicted on a victim, retribution is likely to be the principal sentencing consideration that warrants the imposition of caning. The court also held at [76] that, where death is caused, a sentence of 12 or more strokes of the cane may be warranted.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The parties’ sentencing submissions</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">97 Both the Prosecution and the Defence agreed that the applicable sentencing framework in this case was that set out by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">BDB</span>. They were also in agreement that, following <span class="font-italic">BDB</span>, the indicative starting sentence in this case (an offence of voluntarily causing grievous hurt resulting in death) was eight years’ imprisonment and 12 strokes of the cane.

</div>
</div> For the purposes of step two of the sentencing framework, parties agreed on the appropriate number of strokes to be imposed but they differed in their positions on the appropriate imprisonment term.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">98 The case of <span class="font-italic">BDB </span>was one where the offender inflicted severe physical violence on her biological son who was four years old that resulted in his death. The offender was charged with two offences under s 325 of the Penal Code as well as four other charges under the CYPA. In respect of the s 325 charge involving the victim’s death, the Court of Appeal held that the appropriate starting point was nine years’ imprisonment (see <span class="font-italic">BDB </span>at [124]). As the offender was exempted from caning, the court enhanced her sentence by 6 months pursuant to s 325(2) of the CPC in lieu of 14 strokes of the cane that the court would otherwise have imposed (see <span class="font-italic">BDB </span>at [128]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">99 The Prosecution sought a sentence of ten years’ imprisonment and 12 strokes of the cane. The Prosecution accepted that the events giving rise to the accused’s conviction under s 325 in this case were less aggravated than those in <span class="font-italic">BDB</span>, but it submitted that there were two factors warranting a higher imprisonment term in this case. The first factor was the charges taken into consideration (“the TIC Charges”) which were similar in nature to the s 325 offence for which the accused was convicted and so the court should accordingly enhance the sentence for the s 325 offence. The Prosecution pointed out that in <span class="font-italic">BDB</span>, there were other proceeded charges and so the court had the option of imposing consecutive sentences to ensure that the overall aggregate sentence was commensurate to the offending in that case. Therefore, the nine-year imprisonment term in <span class="font-italic">BDB </span>had not been subject to any enhancement on account of similar offences taken into consideration.

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> The second factor was the fact that the accused in this case had delayed seeking medical help for the Victim even after it became clear to him that the Victim was in significant distress after the kicks to her abdomen. The delay had been for more than 12 hours and it demonstrated that the accused blatantly disregarded the Victim’s health and welfare. The delay was also aggravating because the reason for the delay was the accused’s self-preservation. The Prosecution also highlighted that such delay in seeking medical attention had been a feature of offending in the TIC Charges.

</div>
</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">100 The Prosecution also submitted that there were no significant mitigating factors in this case. In particular, the Prosecution argued that there was no evidence of genuine remorse as the accused never accepted responsibility for causing the Victim’s death, as was evident from his defence in which he sought to avoid responsibility by relying on other events as having caused the intra-abdominal injuries.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">101 The Defence submitted that the appropriate sentence was seven years’ and six months’ imprisonment and 12 strokes of the cane. The Defence argued that the present case was less serious than <span class="font-italic">BDB </span>because it involved no sustained period of abuse, the manner in which the Victim was assaulted by the accused was also less egregious than in <span class="font-italic">BDB</span><span class="font-italic">.</span> Further, unlike in <span class="font-italic">BDB</span>, this was not a case where the offence occurred in spite of prior intervention of authorities like the Child Protection Services.

First, the Defence argued that the sentence of nine years’ imprisonment in <span class="font-italic">BDB </span>had, in fact, been subject to some enhancement, as the Court of Appeal had taken into account the other proceeded charges in that case, as well as the past instances of violence inflicted by the offender on the victim that were not the subject of any of the proceeded charges or charges taken into consideration, in arriving at the overall criminality of the offender for the purposes of the subject offence.

</div></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">My decision </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">103 In this case, since death was caused to the Victim, the appropriate starting point was an imprisonment term of eight years and 12 strokes of the cane.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">104 In my view, the following aggravating factors, taken from the list identified by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">BDB</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>(see [86] above), were relevant in this case: (a) the manner of the attack; (b) the victim’s vulnerability; and (c) any relevant antecedents.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">105 As for the first factor, the focus is on the viciousness of the offender’s actions and his culpability, and the inquiry is one into whether there was cruelty in the manner of the attack and whether the victim’s agony had been exacerbated by the manner in which injuries were inflicted, which is to be inferred from the circumstances of the attack, like the frequency and recurrence of the attacks, and the length of time over which the attacks are carried out (see <span class="font-italic">BDB </span>at [64]). In terms of this factor, the accused’s actions in this case (which were two kicks in quick succession to the Victim’s abdomen) were not as severe and brutal as those of the offender in <span class="font-italic">BDB</span> (which involved the offender pushing the victim causing him to fall and hit his head on the ground, and then later choking the victim on his neck on two occasions, the second of which left the victim weak and unresponsive). The Prosecution and the Defence were in agreement on this.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">106 As for the second factor, this will often be engaged in the case of young victims, and it will be given additional weight where the victim’s vulnerability is also rooted in the relationship of trust and dependence that exists between the victim and the offender (see <span class="font-italic">BDB </span>at [65]). I agreed with the Prosecution that this factor was engaged in this case, and further that there had been an abuse of trust and authority by the accused given the relationship of trust and dependence between himself and the Victim. This is because the accused was one of the primary caregivers responsible for the Victim’s care and welfare and the Victim also regarded the accused as his father. I noted, however, that this factor was also engaged on the facts of <span class="font-italic">BDB </span>in similar terms (see <span class="font-italic">BDB </span>at [124]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">107 As for the third factor, I agreed with the Prosecution that the TIC Charges should be given due weight in determining the accused’s overall criminality and in arriving at the appropriate sentence. I agreed with the Prosecution that in so far as this factor was concerned, this case could be distinguished from <span class="font-italic">BDB </span>as the Court of Appeal in that case had the option of consecutive sentencing because the offender was convicted of four distinct charges.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">108 I should also add that I agreed with the Defence’s submission that this case was also distinguishable from <span class="font-italic">BDB </span>because there was no evidence of prior intervention by child protection authorities. As the Court of Appeal explained in <span class="font-italic">BDB</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [70], this is an aggravating factor rooted in the enhanced need for specific deterrence when an offender <span class="font-italic">continues </span>to abuse a young victim despite prior intervention by the authorities.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">109 I come to the Prosecution’s submission that a further aggravating factor in this case was that there had been delay on the accused’s part in seeking medical attention for the Victim. I rejected this submission for two reasons. First, as a general principle, delay on the part of an accused person in helping the victim of an offence of violence seek medical attention should not be a relevant aggravating factor. The aggravating factors considered at stage two of the sentencing framework in <span class="font-italic">BDB </span>are meant to adjust for the offender’s culpability (see <span class="font-italic">BDB </span>at [62]). Thus, in order for a factor to constitute an aggravating factor in this context, it must relate to the manner in which the offence had been committed (see <span class="font-italic">Logachev Vladislav v Public Prosecutor </span>[2018] 4 SLR 609 at [35]). The accused’s act of delaying medical attention relates to what occurred <span class="font-italic">after </span>the commission of the offence, and not the manner in which the offence had been committed. Furthermore, to the extent that a delay in seeking medical attention contributed to the victim’s demise or the more severe injury that he or she eventually suffered from, this already constituted a consequence of the offence, which would have been factored in identifying the indicative starting sentence under the first step of the sentencing framework in <span class="font-italic">BDB </span>(see <span class="font-italic">BDB </span>at [56]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">110 Second, even if this were an aggravating factor, I was of the view that it was not engaged on the facts of this case. I agreed with the Defence that there was insufficient evidence to support the finding that there had been deliberate delay on the part of the accused in seeking medical attention for the Victim. This was because there were no visible external injuries as a result of the kicks and the Victim’s abdominal discomfort and subsequent vomiting may not have sufficiently alerted the accused to the possibility that the Victim had, in fact, sustained severe injuries. I also noted that the accused had, in fact, been concerned whether the Victim was suffering from pain or discomfort as a result of his kicks, as he had pressed on various parts of the Victim’s abdomen in the evening of 1 September 2018 when applying ointment on her, asking her where she felt pain (see [68] above). This demonstrated concern on the part of the accused. I found it likely that, had the Victim told the accused that she was in great pain or discomfort (which unfortunately she was unable to), the accused would have sought medical attention earlier. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">111 Finally, I agreed with the Defence’s submission that the accused had demonstrated genuine remorse and this was a mitigating factor operating in his favour. The accused had come clean in his police statements, which were taken shortly after the incident on 1 September 2018, that he had kicked the Victim’s abdomen forcefully. I noted that the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">BDB</span> stated at [74] that an offender’s cooperation with the investigating authorities should not be regarded as a strong mitigating factor if there is overwhelming evidence against him. However, this case was qualitatively different as I was satisfied from the accused’s police statements and his court testimony as a whole that he had accepted responsibility for his actions and the accused’s admissions and cooperation with the authorities was demonstrative of genuine remorse.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">112 As for the punishment of caning, the parties agreed that 12 strokes of the cane was appropriate. I saw no reason to disagree.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">113 Taking all the relevant factors into account, I was of the view that the appropriate sentence in this case was nine years’ imprisonment and 12 strokes of the cane.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">114 For the above reasons, I acquitted the accused of the Murder Charge and substituted it with a conviction under s 325 of the Penal Code for voluntarily causing grievous hurt to the Victim. The appropriate sentence for the s 325 offence, with the VCH Charge and the CYPA Charge taken into consideration, was nine years’ imprisonment and 12 strokes of the cane. The accused’s sentence was also backdated to 3 September 2018, the date of his arrest.</div><table class="table table-sm table-borderless"><tbody><tr><td><div class="txt-body text-left">Pang Khang Chau <br/>Judge of the High Court </div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-left"></div></td></tr></tbody></table><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Senthilkumaran Sabapathy and Lim Yu Hui (Attorney-General’s Chambers) for the Prosecution;</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Eugene Singarajah Thuraisingam and Suang Wijaya (Eugene Thuraisingam LLP) for the accused. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
